		<shortDescription>Gosh! And 10 days was all it took to be filmed!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Farrell is a self-professed star publicist with an attitude to boot. Watch 81 minutes of gut-wrenching nerve-wracking dialog reduce a pretentious "kiss my ass" punk into an enervated and regretful reprobate. Farrell is simply awesome in portraying the gravity of the situation. "The Caller"'s voice is absolutely worth a mention. Calm, creepy and authoritative! Something different and the movie would have fallen flat on its 'flab less' anterior. Sutherland plays 'The Caller', manning a high profile sniper rifle, while he thrusts honesty upon Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell). Frankly, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for a second. Ebert himself was marvelled by the creativity of "Phone Booth". Why! It wasn't without good reason! A gaudy character stuck inside a phone booth in a busy locale, some good camera work, bunch of apartment windows, a psycho sniper and 10 days of excellent filming supported by a 'worth a mention' cast easily will manage to get into a good bundle of "top ten" lists. Fabulous entertainment and a good display of creativity. Graham Bell is still aiding marvels, I guess!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One ringy dingy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who doubts that people are as easily programmable as Pavlov's pets need look no further Graham Bell's little box. While most of us generally don't start salivating at the sound of a ringing phone, few people (unless they work for a software help desk) can resist the urge to answer one. Pray that the darkest force that dials your number is a telemarketer.For Stu Shephard, sincerity is little more than a fuzzy concept. A shady publicist, his life consists of spinning interconnecting webs of lies to further the careers of clients and raise his stature. In his spare time he enjoys abusing his assistant, and ignoring his wife. Stu is, is also determined to give an impressionable young actress a test run on the casting couch. When he enters the one functioning pay phone in a ten-block radius in the hopes of setting up a liaison, the phone rings. It turns out to be Stu's conscience on the line. With a sniper rifle aimed at Stu's head.When you take into account that `Phone Booth' was filmed in just ten days, on a limited budget with a dearth of special effects, one principle actor and a single venue you could be forgiven for questioning the potential success of this film. The original November 2001 release date might give one pause - films that sit on the shelf usually do so for a reason - read `straight to video'. In this instance the studio wanted to wait until Farrell was more familiar to moviegoers. He achieved this with a little film called `Minority Report' (the name of his co-star escapes me at the moment...). `Phone Booth's' new release date had to be pushed back once again after the sniping episodes in Washington. Some things are worth the wait.While he stole the spotlight as the maniacal hit man in `Daredevil', Farrell is faced with a different animal in `Phone Booth', an 80-minute soliloquy which lives or dies on his performance (several A-list stars walked away from the project for this very reason). Reminiscent of his much-lauded turn in `Tigerland', Farrell confirms that he isn't a one trick pony, proffering a wide-ranging display of emotions, from cocky to cathartic without straying into soap opera or comic territory. He delivers his lines with a solid fluidity rare among his peers, no simple feat when one takes into account that he's suppressing a harsh brogue. Farrell also demonstrates a presence, beyond mere charisma - his good looks can only inspire interest for so long - that draw the viewer into the story.While the supporting cast - Katie Holmes as the naive ingenue and Forrest Whitaker as the good cop - fulfill their purpose, it is Keifer Sutherland who takes up what little slack there is. While the audience doesn't get to see Sutherland, he is amply menacing as the cold, otherworldly voice on the other end of the phone. The audience is never privy to who he is (`Just call me Bob') or what his motives are, but it is inconsequential - he sees all, knows all, and is clearly in charge. Unlike S&amp;M, there are no safe words. And for a control freak like Stu nothing could be more terrifying.Although tied to a static location, deft camera work provides action, perspective and mood with such techniques as quick pans, compressed zooming, and picture in picture sequences, while careful not to cross the gimmickry line . Enhanced sound editing bolsters the visuals: ringing phones are jarring, Bob's quietly booming voice is unsettling, and the sound of a round being chambered is deafening.`Phone Booth' could easily have been a quirky novelty flick that played well amongst the art house set. Thanks to Farrell's performance it makes for good mainstream cinema (normally an oxymoron) and may actually make a few top ten lists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the premiere of "Phone Booth" at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, and I LOVED IT! It's unusual for a feature like this to even show at the TIFF, which should say something about it. I know it sounds like a hard sell. The whole thing takes place outside a phone booth in Manhattan, and it was shot in 10 days for less than 2 million dollars. But this movie is electric. It BLEW ME AWAY! Stuart `Stu' Shepard (Colin Farrell), a sleazy publicist, uses this phone booth to call his girlfriend, because his wife checks his cell phone bills. The phone rings, and when he picks it up, all hell breaks loose. The voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland is just terrifying) warns him that if he leaves the booth he will be killed. At first Stu doesn't believe him, but we find out pretty quick that his life is in real danger, and the stranger on the other end of the line knows EVERYTHING about Stu and his life. Then the police show up, (Forest Whitaker is wonderful as always as the cop in charge) and order Stu out of the booth. I spent the next hour on the edge of my seat. I don't want to give anything more away, but it is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a very long time! You should go see this movie! I don't think it's going to get a very big release, even though it's directed by Joel Schumacher (St. Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, Batman and Robin, 8mm, Tigerland). Schumacher was at the screening, and he talked about how a number of different actors (including Mel Gibson) and directors had been attached to the script, and it had taken years to get it to the screen. He was able to do it with Colin Farrell after 20th Century Fox exec's saw him in `Tigerland' and decided to take a chance. But he's still not considered a `big' star. And Kiefer only came to the project at the end (though Schumacher said he was the only guy for the role, and I agree), and you don't see him much. So the movie may not get much of a push when it comes out. Don't let that dissuade you. If you like a good ride, you should go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and full of suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that is rare these days. It didn't cost an arm and a leg to make, it stars some good actors and the story line was plausible.The Hitchcock influence is obvious and the pacing of the film was just right. This is the best work of director Schumacher. The lead could have been played by any yuppie looking actor but Colin Farrell does a good job anyway in a role that puts you in his character's place.It's hard to make a movie work when it takes place in a confined space with few characters, but when those movies succeed, it shows. And that's how it is with "Phone Booth."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Way To Get Your Message Across!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only looked at this because a friend loaned it to me so, at zero cost, what could I lose? Well, it was a lot better than I anticipated. Oddly, even though it's only 80 minutes long, I think this could have been better with about 10 minutes chopped off. It starts to repeat itself too much near the end. You have to remember, almost the whole film takes place within a phone booth!Colin Farrell does a super job playing a sleazy guy held captive in the phone booth by a threatening sniper-caller. The story, although simple, holds your attention because there is great suspense, innovative camera-work, an involving story that hooks you in pretty fast and some great sound. I hope you have a surround sound system because the caller's (Keifer Sutherland) voice on the other end of the line is something to hear!There is a big moral message in this film, too, about doing the right thing and paying for your sins, which Farrell sure did. It was really refreshing to hear that message, effectively told. Maybe some of us need a sniper to get the message across, but I hope not! Are there holes in this story? Sure, but it's still good and has a cool ending. The only warning I would give readers here is the language: this is a very profane film with Farrell going overboard on the f-word. If that offends you, then stay out of this phone booth; otherwise, it's pretty entertaining</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Synopsis of this flick without spoiling the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a movie that you would actually pay money to watch more than once? What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members? While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion: Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell). Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate. He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification. He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes). Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time. To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day. Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu. He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up. To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call. This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder. Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up. In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue. During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives. His lies no longer matter. As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts. In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring. The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth. Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here. While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters. Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed. However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't. However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for? Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher. While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes. However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once. If nothing else, it will make you stop and think: the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farrell is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) uses a pay phone to call his mistress (Katie Holmes) and after he hung up the phone rings. He picks it up, of course, and learns that there is a sniper on the other side of the line. When he hangs up the sniper will shoot him, so he is told. Before he entered the booth we saw Stu talking on his cell phone as a PR-man, constantly lying to people. The sniper has observed Stu and thinks he deserves to die.When the sniper demonstrates he is real by shooting a pimp near the booth the police arrives and thinks Stu is the shooter. Capt. Ramey (Forest Whitaker) slowly understands things are not as they seem.Colin Farrell who is in almost every scene is great. First he looks so confident and slowly he becomes more and more desperate. The voice of the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) is also perfect for the movie. It sounds calm but creepy, like a dangerous man who knows what he is doing.The movie is not very long and here that is a very good thing. Scenes are not dragged to make the movie as long as most movies and therefor it doesn't get boring. It kept me on the edge of my seat. A very good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small scale and slightly flawed but gripping and very enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepherd is in public relations and uses lies and deceit everyday in his job to get things moving. When calling a client from a phone booth in the hope of getting her to a hotel. When he hangs up the phone rings and he answers to what he assumes is a prank call. However the caller reveals more and more about Stu exposing his lies. When Stu tries to leave the caller reveals that he has Stu pinned down with a sniper rifle and the death of a man by the booth proves it. The police arrive and surround Stu while the caller continues his game.Everyone knows that it had a small budget, a shooting window of just over a week and that it was made years ago and shelved as Farrell's star power increased and real life terrorist attacks and snipers came and went in the media and the mind of the American public. So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film! The pitch was enough to get me interested ? `man is held in phone box by sniper' ? sounds great! I really wanted to see this film but was put off by the trailer, but not of the films I saw wrong in the trailer were to the detriment of the film as over 80-odd minutes it really runs like a race horse.Starting with humour and a free-flowing pace it turns sinister early on but keeps the pace. In terms of plot it has many good twists and turns that will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat. The only issue for me was accepting why the sniper was doing it and how he was able to get access to the equipment he would have needed as well as the information ? not to mention the WILL to do it! Also little things bugged me, but the film carries itself over these obstacles well enough and reservations are soon forgotten. It sounds simple but the simple ideas work best and, although low on action (sorry, teen boys!) it is driven by dialogue and simply not knowing what will come next.The direction helps the film by constantly moving and using split screens etc to give the impression that a lot is going on at once ? again making the film feel like it has a fast pace. It feels a little gimmicky (especially now that we've had 2 series of 24 doing the same thing) but it works regardless. I wrote in an old review (8mm I think) that I would never pay to see a Joel Schumacher film ever again, and I DIDN'T pay to see Phone Booth! However I was surprised because he didn't ruin it! He did a good job ? yes, you heard me! His usual excesses seem to have been controlled by a good producer and editing team and the film works ? much to my surprise and relief!Farrell may not be a bona-fide Hollywood star yet but he takes the task of being onscreen for almost the whole film and runs with it. He makes a comically cruel character someone that reveals himself to be a loser but never loses the audience ? and that takes talent. Sutherland's voice on the trailer didn't work for me (too normal and slow) but in the film he is excellent, like the director said, no-one else could have done the role, he is right for it. Whitaker makes up the third lead and he holds his corner well.It may not be without the odd flaw but this film manages to be simple, gripping and very effective. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a phone rings...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Joel Schumacher preserves his reputation with a script by Larry Cohen about personal morals and hopefully the truth providing some kind of redemption. This is a white knuckle nerve wrecker about a self-serving publicist(Colin Farrell)making the mistake of his life by answering a public telephone. On the other end of the phone is a self empowered mad man(Kiefer Sutherland) inflicting demands on the fast talking, fast thinking publicity dealer who just happened to be walking by the phone booth he passes every day. The mystery voice on the phone demands the publicist to stay in the phone booth until he tells his wife(Radha Mitchell)and the TV watching public of his cheating, lying and making use of others. Of course behind the demanding voice is a sharpshooter that is not afraid to pull the trigger. The senior officer on the scene(Forest Whitaker)tries to make sense of the situation while fighting back thoughts of his own past personal problems. At least 90% of this thriller is made up of witty, threatening and revealing banter between Farrell and Sutherland. And talk about a clever twist to end this flick. Also of note in the cast are: Katie Holmes, Richard T. Jones and Paula Jai Parker. Think twice about answering that ringing phone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my most favourite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought the film was going to be just a normal thriller but it turned out to be a thousand times better than I expected. The film is truly original and was so dark &amp; sinister that gives the tensive mood also it is emotionally &amp; psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and seems like it's really happening. It's amazing that how they managed to make an 80 minute movie with just a guy in a phone booth but the full credit goes to Colin Farrell and Larry Cohen the writer not Joel Schumacher because he is a crappy director. Joel Schumacher's films are rubbish especially The Number 23, Phone Booth was shot in 10 days with a budget of $10 million so it wasn't a hard job to make it, that's why Joel doesn't get any credit but the cast &amp; crew did a fantastic job. I also really liked the raspberry coloured shirt Colin was wearing and it was an excellent choice of clothing because the viewers are going to watch him throughout the whole film. When I first saw the movie I fell in love with it and I bought it on DVD the next day and I've seen it about 20 times and I'm still not fed up with it. Phone Booth is and always will be Colin Farrell's best film! Overall it is simply one of my favourite films and I even argued over my friend because he didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not read if you have not seen this movie! Interesting failure let down by plot failures: For me the voice of the sniper was so obviously added in a sound studio after the movie was finished it spoilt the whole suspension of disbelief, he was supposed to be at the end of that phone line after all.The Farrell character's redemption at the end did nothing for me, he was such a sleaze-bag you did not really feel any empathy or sympathy for him.The sniper was far too God like through the first 90% of the movie, a common failing in Hollywood. He knew everything about Farrell's life, he was an expert marksman, he was an electronics bugging expert, he was a phone system expert so his calls are untraceable, he was an expert at predicting police tactics etc etc etc... and then lets himself be found just at the right time in the plot by previously phoning a traceable call from the apartment which is to be the scene of his crimes.The ending was a cop out, I saw the pizza guy denouement a mile off without seeing any reviews or hints, who kills themselves by hacking through their own throats when police are running up the stairs outside the door and you have a gun available? A great idea for a movie but really needed a Hitchcock to iron out the plot holes and improve the suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard for me to believe that for some reason I missed viewing this film, which took me by great surprise. The photography around NYC and Times Square was great and that special phone booth drove me crazy. The film started out with a con artist who never stop lying and had everybody completely fooled until one fatal day when he made a phone call as his daily routine at the end of his baloney days work. It drove me crazy when he had to confess his sins to an audience, including his mistress and wife. The con artist turned his complete life around and even helped a NYC detective wish he had told the complete truth to his own wife. There is plenty of deep suspense that keeps you glued to the screen and your seat. Refreshing film and worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock &amp; Kafka Meet In Times Square Via Larry Cohen's Pen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler A tense, taut, darkly funny 81-minute package of Hitchcockian suspense set in New York City (although the scenes specifically involving the phone booth were filmed in Los Angeles, the art direction and veteran thriller genius Larry Cohen's biting script gave those scenes a very convincing Times Square ambience. It really reminded me of the seedy Times Square of my youth! :-), PHONE BOOTH is a film that everyone in front of and behind the camera should be proud of. In particular, it's a tour de force for Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Farrell, doing a good Bronx accent that also sounds slightly Latino-tinged to my native New Yorker ears, shows why he was long touted as The Next Big Thing even before he finally got some hit movies under his belt. As slippery publicist Stu Shepard, the intense, kinetic Farrell runs the gamut of emotions; he's like Nicolas Cage in dramatic mode without the scenery-chewing! :-) Sutherland has never been more sinister in a mostly voiceover role as Farrell's nemesis/self-appointed conscience. Ron Eldard reportedly did the voice of The Caller first, but maybe after seeing the rushes, PB director Joel Schumacher decided the part needed more star power and/or menace, so he recruited his old bud' and colleague Sutherland. It was a good move, and I'm not just saying that because Sutherland is one of my longtime faves. When Sutherland plays bad guys, he gets this great silky menace to his voice (kinda like James Mason without the British accent :-), and it's very effective in PB. Sutherland is seen very briefly in the film, too, so I must assume they filmed that footage later, but it certainly blends in seamlessly with the rest of the movie. SPOILER ALERT... I actually found it darkly funny, even Kafkaesque, that The Caller's reasons for terrorizing arrogant married PR flack Stu included his aspiring to lure actress/client Pam (the ever-appealing Katie Holmes) into an affair. Think about it: The Caller was so twistedly self-righteous and judgmental that he was punishing his victims (or Stu, anyway) for thought-crimes! How Big Brother can you get?! :-) ...END SPOILER ALERT. While PB was well worth seeking out in actual theaters, especially since it has lots of cool split-screen shots and inset effects that are especially effective on a big screen, its claustrophobic nature also makes it well-suited to the small TV screen. Check out Schumacher's enjoyable DVD commentary, too.</fullReview>

The film stars Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Katie Holmes, and Radha Mitchell, and is about a man who is held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper. Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is definitely a comeback for Joel Schumacher, after making Batman &amp; Robin. It is a well-directed, well-acted, fast paced, solid flick which I wasn't bored with for a second. I thought that Colin Farrell was great as the lead actor in the movie, and I'm sure that whoever is interested in solid thrillers will most likely like this flick.

		<fullReview>a very very impressive and gripping kind of psychological thriller i have ever seen in my life. Colin Farrel was great in his role while on the other hand kiefer Sutherland did the most best tremendous job as the unknown hidden caller who never showed up until the end comes. The real movie starts at the time when Colin Farrel is held hostage at the phone booth by the unknown hidden kiefer Sutherland but before he also puts the curtain away from the secret life of Farrel on the other line by calling his girl friend and Farrel was listening but wasn't able to do any thing then he demonstrate to Farrel that he has got an eye on him , a telescopic view through a 50 caliber rifle and if he tries to walk away he ll be shot at point blank range. and now the chase begins when Stu Shepard is forced to tell the truths about his life which he hided form his wife , girlfriend, his secretary and colleagues. Forrest Whitaker plays here the police detective who arrives at the scene when a crime is committed and Farrel is considered as prime suspect but he is amazed by the ongoing situation , he really wants to know who s on the line with Farrel , what conversation they are having how can he make Farrel out of the booth and surrender. In this scenario of the movie the shooter in fact is a person who hates lier's , deceptive and hypocrites , his main purpose is to punish them by his own and expose their mysterious double standard lives with fraud attitude. When you see this film you ll watch lots o twists in the story. A very nicely executed movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not hang up, it's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing what he'd done with the Batman franchise and Nicolas Cage in "8MM", you wouldn't believe that Joel Schumacher could make a good movie, would you? "Phone Booth", starring Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland, is a surprisingly astounding film and a near-perfect example of psychological thriller. And I insist on both words because none of them is separable from the other.Farrell is Stu, a NY press agent who oversees everybody and has a wife (Radha Mitchell), as well as a mistress (Katie Holmes). He seems to appreciate his lifestyle but everything is about to change into an unforgettable way.After Stu called up his mistress in a phone booth, the phone rings. Stu answers, only to find himself ear-to-ear with a sniper (voiced by Sutherland).It's now that the twisted mind game begins. The sniper is a typical one, ie. that he knows everything about everybody, including Stu. He claims to be some kind of angel-like figure who wants to force sinners to expiate their faults to the society. And this time, he aims Stu.Rarely have I seen a thriller so exciting, so mind-torturing. These sensations are mainly due to Farrell and Sutherland.Farrell offers an extraordinary performance as Stu. We can feel his fear, his anger, his desperation during the short 80 minutes of the movie. His transformation is real and sincere. We really can feel it.Sutherland's role is as great, but for different reasons. His task is gigantic: to sound menacing, bright, skillful and sarcastic only with his voice. And he fits perfectly. The result is that the Sutherland-voiced sniper becomes as terrifying and frightening as other mind players, such as Hannibal Lecter.Merit should also be given to screenwriter Larry Cohen. The "Phone Booth" script is easily his best after "Carrie", which he wrote almost 25 years earlier. The story is simple, but very intelligent, very developed.The conclusion is stupendous. At first, I believed that I was watching another one of these thriller conclusions that are half-cooked because they can't render justice to the main part. But then the plot twists and we just can't believe that we've been fooled like that.I also liked the cinematography. Mainly the screen divided in multiple parts, so the viewer can follow many scenes at once. It's nicely depicted by director Schumacher.I deserve great regards for "Phone Booth", especially for Farrell and Sutherland. It's one of the greatest thrillers of the still young 21st century and it acts as some kind of redemption for critic scapegoat Joel Schumacher.By the way, would you dare to go into a phone booth after you see this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" kept me captive as much as it did Colin Farrell ("Stu Shephard"). No matter what other big stars held this movie up, Farrell was the right guy - I sincerely hope it makes a bundle, no matter how it is released. I saw a trailer SOMEPLACE, and knew that I'd enjoy......lucky me, a friend had it.I guess some folk don't like Joel Schumacher's directing: I'm not overly acquainted with his style, but this film put him high on my enjoyment-list. A lot of today's generation may never have seen this type of phone-booth - wonder what happened to all of them when they went out of use ? What a revel they were ! Those tacky phones hanging on the wall are hardly worth the $.75 required to use them. Try to get someone to call you back, and you'll discover there are VERY FEW incoming calls.Writer Larry Cohen has a very good imagination, and knows how to get it onto paper. How frustrating it must have been for him to see it sit on "the shelf", after the short time it took to get it onto film. But, no doubt he had already pocketed his money. Hope his residuals are huge.Keifer Sutherland ("The Caller") certainly holds your attention, even when he goes-off into his sick childhood. His voice was riveting; I wish I had surround-sound now so I could listen to the effect. I've watched this film 3 times in a week.Forest Whitaker ("Capt. Ramey") was perfect for his role - some users thought it took him a while to get-onto why "Stu" was trapped in the booth. Me, I think he caught-on right away, or else he'd had ordered his cops to shoot and that would have been the end of "Stu". The simple reason of this particular phone-booth was right in the middle of New York City is another anachronism......but, gave the hookers (and other creeps) the right place to make their money. This is kind of incident that old-timers in NYC just ignore and hope it doesn't involve them. N ONE mentioned the first object to be shot - the toys.....Radha Mitchell ("Kelly Shepard") and Kate Holmes ("Pam") were excellent in their roles. That "Kelly" kept track of "Stu's" cell-phone calls is another example of how public everything is today, and reminds me of all the gimmickry in "Enemy of the State".Farrell was superb in his role. Other users have commented he used every gimmick in his closet, and they are right. If he isn't a huge star, by now, there's something wrong. I can't think of any big star who could have portrayed the role better; a somewhat unknown actor for this kind of role is often refreshing and just what the producers needed. The location/sets were perfect for this genre; quick camera-works kept the plot screeching to the very end. You won't leave the TV for this film - it deserves a much bigger release. BUT, it's not always a mistake to release "direct to video". I give it a 20 -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We hear a telephone rings. This call can be for anyone but then we can't stop ourselves picking up.This is the story of a phonebooth. What is important about this is that this is the only phonebooth in that locality. This is the phonebooth where Chtioui goes to make a call and gets stuck there after receiving a call from a psycho. The movie is a thriller and suspense.The hero is a New York publicist. He goes to a phonebooth to make a call. After making the call, when he is coming out he heard a ring and picks it up. He is told that he will be killed if he tries to hang it. Now he is stuck. Initially he doesn't buy the story. But then he has to believe after a murder. Now he has been charged with that murder and policemen surrounds him from all side.Phonebooth is a nicely made movie. It is full of drama, action, suspense, thrills.This is a movie that is very different from all other movies made. A psychological thriller. The movie was a hit in Hollywood.In short, the movie is interesting. End looked incomplete as if the director has left something for the viewer to imagine or maybe to make another sequel to the movie as being made all these days. A must watch movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing god (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about movie villains and god-complexes? They're not merely content to cause havoc and pain; they want to educate as well.The sniper in Phone Booth is yet another example of this. He doesn't want to just kill Stu. He wants to break him down and make him re-examine his life. He's kind of like Dr Phil with a gun. Only he's infinitely more personable than the aforementioned bald-headed ignoramus.One of the biggest clues that the sniper is supposed to be a god-like character is the way that Kiefer Sutherland's voice-over is mixed. It doesn't sound like it's coming through a phone. Instead it just sounds like a disembodied omnipotent voice. This gives the character a more immediate, more threatening quality and it makes it easier to believe that this is a person who sees everything and hears everything.Of course, another clue is all the moralising. Stu's a liar (he's a publicist) and he treats people rather badly, so he needs to be taught a lesson. And naturally, in this day and age of arrogant city folk, the only way to bring about change is with a gun. People just wont listen to reason any more. Fear is the only thing that will turn us into a nice, polite honest society. Yep, the sniper certainly thinks he's god.However, all throughout the film the sniper gives various false reasons for his behaviour ? his unhappy childhood, Nam, etc. It's a nice little dig at the shallow explanations that are usually provided in such films to justify certain behaviour, but even though he says in the film that he's not religious, he'd make an excellent Christian fundamentalist. He even turns the phone booth into a confessional.And the confessional scene ? the one where Stu explains everything to his wife and those around him ? is a nice little comment on modern society. Before people used to unburden themselves to a priest. Now people do it over phones, in crowded streets or even in the glare of the media. Private life has dwindled and dwindled. Everything is for public consumption. Yet at the same time no one really cares. People walk around talking on their phones completely oblivious to those that surround them. Maybe a gun is the only thing that will wake them up from their self-absorbed stupor.But I doubt Phone Booth is meant to be taken this seriously. Yeah it's fun reading between the lines but it's really just a snappy little thriller. The real enjoyment is in just seeing what happens. And thankfully, pretty much everything that happens (in movie terms at least) makes sense. After all, in these types of films, you're often asking yourself 'why did he do that?' or 'why didn't he do this?' I mean, you could make a ten minute film where he doesn't pick the phone up. But the fact that he does pick the phone up isn't too hard to believe (I've done it myself). And although one of the questions could be 'why didn't he just hang up the phone?' the writing is smart enough to keep Stu on there for plausible reasons ? the sniper has lots of personal information.And once the film is on its way ? the beginning is rather dodgy, what with some idiot doing an over the top Eminem impersonation and with the snappy but uninteresting publicity stuff ? it doesn't really put too many feet wrong. The tension is always there and there's a good central conflict between Stu and the sniper.However, I do have one major reservation: the final image. At the end Kiefer Sutherland is walking through the crime scene with a case that might as well be labelled: 'sniper rifle inside'. Are the police blind? Surely even if they were certain they had their man they might get a little suspicious when a man with a rifle shaped case is inspecting the phone booth. But then again, maybe Kiefer Sutherland really is god. Now that's a scary thought?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie with a good message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was skeptical going into this movie. I thought that there would be no way that the entire film could take place in a phone booth without it dragging on. I was proved wrong. I liked this movie a lot. It was not at all boring how I first assumed it would be.This is actually a very good movie. The story kept me interested throughout the whole film. It was very suspenseful. It seemed the further the movie progressed that yet another dilemma would arise forcing the main character to make a difficult decision that his life depended on.The story was good but a story alone cannot carry a movie if the acting is bad. I feel that the cast could not have been more perfect for this movie. Colin Farrell did an excellent job as the main character. He flawlessly portrayed the wide range of emotions that his role demanded. Forest Whitaker was great as the police captain that had to maintain control of an escalating situation while trying to discover the real reason behind it. Kiefer Sutherland was perfect for the voice on the phone. He sounded determined and in control and came off as truly chilling at times. Radha Mitchell did a good job as Farrell's wife. She truly seemed very concerned and loving throughout. Katie Holmes had a minor part but was great as a sweet and innocent girl that was oblivious to Farrell's intentions. There were many notable performances in the major roles but the minor roles were also well done, supporting the overall performance of the movie.Phone Booth is a truly good movie with a good message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsStu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a selfish,small-time New York publicist who lies to his wife and strings along those he feels he can manipulate.Until one day,however,his judgment day arrives when a mystery caller (Kiefer Sutherland) traps him in a soon to be demolished phone booth,aims a snipers rifle at his head and makes him confess and atone for all his sins.It is from here that he goes on a personal and psychological journey of redemption from which there will be no return...I have something of a confession to make.I had already seen and reviewed this film a year ago.But an element of jealousy was hindering my ability to review it in a professional manner.Namely,that I was going through a phase where I had a huge crush on Britney Spears (today,that's long evaporated though......eeeeew) and to see her snogging Mr Farrell in OK! Magazine broke my heart somewhat.I've been man enough to admit to my mistake and I'm now well over it.In the back of my mind,I always knew I was kidding myself with regards to my ** rating which I dished out to it.But tonight,I've re-watched and re-reviewed it in a more honest and professional manner.Although touted as a revolutionary new concept for a thriller on it's release,there was a DTV film I saw that year (2002) called Liberty Stands Still starring Wesley Snipes that had a very similar storyline.Which film ripped which film off,I don't know,but in hindsight,I guess it doesn't really matter.Die Hard was a classic that got ripped off many times by other films,but that doesn't mean that I didn't thoroughly enjoy those films!As for the film itself,it's one of those ones where we are thrust straight into the throes of the action.This might mean it lacks things like character development and a focused storyline but on the other hand,it makes things move in 'real-time' and so it feels like we are right there in the midst of the action while everything's going on.It's a gambit that pays off well if you take the movie for what it is and helps it to roll by in no time at all.On the performances front,Sutherland is possibly the eeriest performance ever portrayed by an actor who only uses his voice for the duration of the movie as he quite literally phones his performance in.Farrell (bast*rd!-only joking!) manages the lead role very well,his emotional timing spot on and with a brilliant Brooklyn accent that only occasionally wavers back into Irish brogue.Together,they provide wonderful dialogue between each other as they verbally duke it out in the booth.Forest Whitaker adds good support as the police sergeant trying to talk Farrell out of the booth.Overall,this is a film that magnetizes our attention right through to the end.I promise I'll try not to do what I did with my original review too often,but at least you have my honest thoughts and feelings on the movie now.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense and Enjoyable Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a thrilling and exciting film to watch that will make you scared. Stu Shepard, a low-rent media consultant who is trapped after being told by a caller - a serial killer with a sniper rifle - that he'll be shot dead if he hangs up. They believe that Stu, not the unseen caller of whom they remain unaware, is the dangerous man with a gun. The senior officer on the scene, Captain Ramey, tries to talk Stu out of the booth. But uncanonized to Ramey, his team, the media circus that has flocked to the site - and Stu's wife, Kelly, and his client /prospective girlfriend, Pamela - the caller has them all in his high-powered rifle sights. Stu must dig deep into his soul, find his strength and attempt to outwit the caller, taking the game to an even more dangerous level. The plot is similar to Liberty Stands Still and Panic Room but the execution it done pretty well. The majority of the film takes place in and around a phone booth. While that may not sound exciting, it actually is a pretty good film. There are plenty of intense scenes and the acting is also pretty good. Colin Farrell is a pretty good actor and he does a good job in this film. Forest Whitaker plays Captain Ramey and he also does a good job. Kiefer Sutherland is actually not seen until the end but he has a good creepy phone voice. Joel Schumacher does a pretty good job of directing and makes up for making the horrible Bad Company. The running time is just 80 minutes long so its not boring to watch. As soon as he picks up the phone it's a fun ride until the end. The films plot is unrealistic though as no one would actually be able to do this and get away. Also you don't really feel for the character so it may be hard to actually care about the film. The movie is also kind of predictable but the director and the cast make it exciting to sit through. In the end, this a nice, short thriller to watch. Rating 7.7/10, defiantly worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I went into this hoping for the usual quality fare we have all come to expect from Joel Schumacher. Bad decision. Mr. Schumacher has done plenty better and none worse, and the really sad thing is that this movie had plenty of potential to be great. Somewhere around 20 minutes into the movie I stopped caring whether any of them made it out alive or not. Thank god it was only 80 minutes long. I might have shot myself if it had gone on any longer. For another movie scripted along the same lines, but carried off with more panache and fewer big names, try watching Liberty Stands Still (Linda Fiorentino, Wesley Snipes) This shooter actually has motive and there is a clever script, an intelligent plot line, and characters that appeal to the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without giving too much away, this film has parallels with the SAW series of movies, in that it deals with people owning up and taking responsibility for their actions. Where it differs is that it doesn't rely on gratuitous gore to get the message across and hold the audience's interest. Instead, it is a taut, tense psychological thriller that draws you in and holds you. The confines of the phone booth which constitute almost the entire setting would at first seem to make for a dull movie, but in fact it adds to the atmosphere to the extent that it almost becomes another character in the story. When it comes to movies, I am pretty easy to please. I am content to check my brain at the door for a couple of hours and be entertained. But I am very hard to impress.

		<shortDescription>Such a Good, Underrated Film with Great Performance from Farrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I've ripped on Joel Schumacher in the past for his ridiculous treatments of the Batman franchise but PHONE BOOTH is proof that the man isn't all that bad. The entire film is set within the confines of a single location with minimal characters and he has created a tense thriller that keeps you honed in until the final moments. The film focuses on publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), a fast-talker with a nasty habit of using others for his own personal gain. In the end, it's his complete disregard for others and his attempted infidelity with aspiring actress Pamela (Katie Holmes) that brings him to the attention of a sniper with a love of teaching lessons. On his daily visit to the only remaining phone booth in New York to call Pamela, he receives a call from the sniper who's got Stu in his sights. The course of the mere 80 minute film has Stu pinned inside the phone booth while cops gather to arrest him for an apparent murder while the sniper drives him to confront his over-bearing flaws and promises to end it with a bullet if Stu hangs up.I was drawn to this film for the novel concept of the entire story occurring within a phone booth. With such a handicap, I know some filmmakers wouldn't have been able to accomplish a gripping story but Schumacher does just fine. This was made possible with some great casting choices. Colin Farrell had a lot riding on his shoulders since we was the primary focal point in the film and spends a great portion of the time speaking into a phone rather than interacting with others face-to-face. This was my first real exposure to Farrell (I hadn't yet seen TIGERLAND at the time) and he blew me away in this movie. On the other end of the line is Kiefer Sutherland as the sniper/caller. The man has the best possible voice, creepy and powerfully demanding. It's the perfect voice for a psychopath who has less than two minutes of screen time. Forest Whitaker is Captain Ramey, the officer who takes it upon himself to get behind the situation and find out what's really going on in that phone booth. Whitaker's great, but it's not all that deep a role so it doesn't give him much to work with.This is a great film and it's flaws are few and far between. It definitely requires some suspension of belief, as some of the decisions made by the police and some of the sniper's actions are hard to believe would have gone as they did. Still, this story's focus is the interaction between Farrell and Sutherland and the character transition of Stu Shepard as he's forced to confront what a piece of garbage he's been. In that sense, the film succeeds and it's a great display of talent from both Schumacher and Farrell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first read about the movie I was not sure what to think... Watching 95% of a movie stuck in a phone booth?! Well, I did watch anyway, and I loved it :) The good side: As I have said, most of the movie is based inside a phone booth but that didn't get in the way of anything or sounded boring for the least bit...Can't say that it was busting with action, but it had it's thrilling moments. The thoughts expressed in the movie were quite well from all actors (except maybe some of Kelly's remarks). I just love that 'caller guy'. I'm a bit sad about the fact that not much is revealed about him - but oh well... And he survived!! Forest Whitaker did a great job - as in all of his previous acting :) Kiefer Sutherland also acted well enough (in the very short bit he's seen), but I'm not quite sure that did quite match his profile - according to me...The bad side: Certain concepts of the movie were somewhat unrealistic... The police were quite slow and unresponsive... The fact that he's locked up in there for the whole movie - I'm not sure about that either. Furthermore, what do Stu Shepard's crimes have to do with the other crimes of the previous mentioned victims... The porn guy and the executive's motives were very much different than his... I'm not sure one would target Stu for such little crimes - but I must say that I loved the part where he admitted to his 'crimes'. Ohh, and one more thing... I DID NOT like the beginning and the ending of the movie... It should have started without that strange-and-unrelated song, and it shouldn't ended with all the calls being made... What if it ended with 'caller' guy moving away and Stu crying 'help'...A great movie! I really recommend watching :) A well-planned and executed movie... Good concept and scripts as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking the concept of claustrophobia even further</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Publicist Stu Shepherd (Farrell) becomes the target of an anonymous caller (Sutherland) when he enters a Phone Booth in a busy New York street.The claustrophobic thriller genre has taken a wild swing in formation over the past few decades. Whether it is David Fincher's portrayal of a Panic Room or Wolfgang Peterson's representation of a crowded Russian invaded plane in Air Force One there maintains a level of high adrenaline soaked entertainment. So with a film revolving around a man threatened at gun point in a telephone box for eighty minutes could Batman and Robin director Joel Schumacher live up to the claustrophobia of the other great thrill rides? What Phone Booth does is take that ideology of guilt and betrayal and put a blackmailing soaked feel of revenge and acceptance on its head and create a bewildering dramatic adventure. When reading descriptions I personally sounded sceptical that this film would not maintain a level of thrilling for over an hour, but somehow it has not only maintained it, but taken the concept of isolation even further.Schumacher's real life shots and exterior portrayals of the location with fast moving hand held cameras help create a feeling of adrenaline and action, with an ounce of drama thrown in to make gripping entertainment.Farrell's character Stu is the subject of a mysterious caller. This apparent assassin blackmails him to stay situated in the booth whilst he manipulates his mind by revealing his own secrets and his powerful knowledge of Stu's own life. Taking on the challenge of acceptance in the wrong and owning up to faults shows how stubborn and proud middle aged men can be and Farrell is in an exceptional position to cease this concept and justify it for the viewers. Sutherland's manipulator is a bizarre creation. Sounding calm and collective we can still feel his anger and be manipulated ourselves, even if his motive is questionable.But the point of Phone Booth is to shock and entertain and though there are some exaggerated drama soap styled concepts thrown in to give the appeal more sustenance, it maintains a gritty realistic portrayal of a sniper situation and significantly, represents that horrible sickly feeling of claustrophobia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a very creative and entertaining piece of work. It sets the standards and goes on right to the end. The suspense is the element that keeps you on the edge of your seat for those 81 minutes, of thrill, mystery and excitement. A man kept hostage in a phone booth in the middle of thousands of people, where he is controlled and voiced by some stranger over the phone. It's a very short movie in duration wise, only calibrating for 81 minutes, but you feel if it went on any longer the movie would of felt dragged and less-exciting, because there's only so much you can take especially if 90% of the movie is in a phone booth. It's got a terrific, unpredictable ending that will make you think. The acting is great, the screen-play and cinematography is great, Phone Booth is a edge of a seat thriller that all should be viewed, at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know whether its just me or are the films in which situations are presented from the beginning of the films to the end spark more interest. Speed, Saw, and Phone Booth all present situations where you cant help but become intrigued to how it'll pan out or be solved.Phone Booth as you may have guessed is set within a phone booth. Coline Farrel enters the booth a cocky,confident man, and leaves it with a very different attitude. So how can a film which is primarly set in a phone booth keep you hooked for 80 minutes. Well early in the film a man is shot, in public and witnesses and evidence suggest its farrel thats the culprit. Farrel cant do anything about it, because he'l be shot by a sniper viewing the booth if he hangs up or leaves. So now you've got the police on hand as a second outfit and another dilemma for farrel to face. They are trying to bring him out of the booth, but if he does come out hes to be shot. You can see how the writers expanded a simple situation ad blown it waaaay out of proportion. Its great. The films offers sharp dialogue and fine acting (only from farrel, but hes all that matters really). Farrel displays all emotions humanly possible throughout the film. Mostly fear. By Hollywood standards this film is relatively short running time, but this works for it, as perhaps 2hours would have been to long to keep the dialogue from becoming tedious. To some up, this is a top film. Watch it. It wont take long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Phone Booth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two names who aren't exactly my favourite names in the movie world: Colin Farrell and Joel Schumacher. The first because I often find him annoying, pretentious, arrogant, and so on. The second because I can never forgive him for "Batman &amp; Robin". So its fair to say I had my trepidations for this film in which Farrell is the lead and Schumacher is the director. Thankfully, I was wrong to have doubts. "Phone Booth" is a magnificent return to form for Schumacher - a suspenseful, surprising mini-labyrinth of a film, with perhaps even slight elements of Hitchcockian film making. The film is set mainly in the title phone booth and the street it is on, and once Farrell's character of Stu Shepherd gets to the aforementioned telephone we never really leave it again. For this to work properly there have to be two factors that help us to ignore the claustrophobic settings: dialogue and acting. The plot is well written, simple yet effective. All in all its mainly a two-hander between Farrell and his anonymous captive. The latter is played with menacing vigour by Keifer Sutherland, who is never really seen throughout the majority of the film, and so has to pull of a a very convincing voice over gig. It is also a tour de force for Farrell, who takes his character from arrogant, pretentious, self-centred (hmmm...) to sympathetic, redemptive, decent. It's just a shame that there is not much of a role for the always excellent Forest Whitaker, though I'm kind of grateful that Katie Holmes has even less time.Another complaint I would have is the length of the film. Okay, so its short, snappy and to the point, but you do feel a little short-changed towards the end. It's as if the plot ran out of money before you could finish the call. Still, for tense, enjoyable entertainment, you could do much worse than this.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but maybe Schumacher was a little too proud of himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Schumacher was so proud that he'd shot this movie in 10 days that he didn't concentrate enough on post and finishing touchesWatching the DVD 'making of' says it all really. Everyone is gushing about how incredibly well they did by shooting the movie in 10 days (don't independent film makers do this regularly?), and we get to see just how incredible Farrell's performance is before they spoiled it in the edit, and made certain lines seem extremely hammy.The take they show of Farrell confessing all for example is much more powerful without all the cheesy close ups. That scene seems so amazing when you see it raw in the 'making of', that I wonder why they didn't keep it that way. Farrell deservedly gets an ovation after his lengthy deliveryThis movie reminds me a little of 'Dog Day Afternoon', only the way that movie was shot and put together seemed a lot more authentic. Overall I think Schumacher relied a little too much on the idea and didn't deliver fully on execution Still a great movie though, and one I've watched several times now mostly for Farrell's performance. A guy who I consider to be one of the most versatile actors around today</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth manages to put pretty much everything you want into a thriller in a short space of time. It is a thoroughly original idea - a publicist, who has been lying his way to success, is held inside the phone booth he has been using to cheat on his wife by an unseen sniper on the other end of the line, who wants him to confess to his wife. It is very well acted, with Colin Farrell portraying the desperation of his character really well, while Kiefer Sutherland, while only seen for a few seconds, plays "The Caller" very well. His character is a very good and original one, as while he does kill innocent people without remorse, his real victims are chosen well. He uses threat to try and force them to come clean, and stop cheating in life. It is one of the few films where you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. His voice on the phone is also chillingly brilliant. Without that voice, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective in achieving the suspense generated. Forrest Whitaker also puts in a nice performance as the detective trying to resolve the situation.The camera-work is also fantastic. The shots rotating 360 degrees, looking up at the tall buildings give you a feeling of claustrophobia, like you are also stuck in the phone booth with Stu. Interesting dialogue, a thrilling situation, a couple of nice twists and a completely fresh idea make this a top film, and is one of Joel Schumacher's best achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple title for a simple film, but boy it works well. At just 77min long, Phone Booth could not have been any longer anyway, but it's full of suspense from start to finish, and Colin Farrell can sure act!You don't feel anything for Farrell's Stu at the start of the movie, but as soon as he answers that phone and is forced to play a 'game' with a thoroughly convincing Kiefer Sutherland, you see his vulnerable and softer side, and actually want him to do whatever he can to survive!The tension simply builds and builds to an explosive ending, but has the culprit been nailed? A terrific nail-biting film that will keep you hooked, Phone Booth is the ultimate in suspense and intrigue, and Farrell is superb, showcasing his talents as a serious actor rather than just being a 'bad boy'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very tense movie about manipulation and death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might think that a guy (Colin Farrel) trapped in a phone booth by a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) would be boring, but that's just not the case. This movie, despite it's lack of pure action, makes up in some truly heart-pounding situations always hinging on life and death. It's frightening in that the sniper locked himself away from being traced by cops and can see Stu's (Farrel) every move within the booth. The story become fast-paced and will grab your attention and won't let go until the end. It's funny that until the very end you only hear the sniper's voice, but when Stu is waiting in an ambulance Sutherland walks up and talks to him. Then the last scene is Sutherland walking down the street with a large case. As he passes the phone booth he give it a glance. This movie is so tense and will keep you guessing of who's waling out of it alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb filmmaking and my favorite thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is an outstanding movie, though many of my friends disagree with me on that issue. I thought it was great filmmaking, and it was a superb thriller. The arguments I've heard for why this movie isn't good is: 1)It's predictable 2)There's not enough character development 3)There's too much swearingFor #1, I agree that it is somewhat predictable, but I didn't think the predictable part was really the significant twist or crux of the movie or the ending.For #2, this movie is not about Stu's wife or love interest, so their characters don't need developing. This is all about Stu and the life he's been leading, so it needed only introduce his lifestyle, give it history and a dramatic change, and it did just that, quite well in my opinion.For #3, It's a movie set in REAL New York, not a Hollywood-style New York that families can sit down and experience it together. There's cussing (lots), there's hookers, and there's unwholesomeness. It helped make the movie seem much more real and gave it an edgy style.For me, this movie is #4 on my all-time list, and I easily give it an A+ grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely terrific thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepard is a press agent. By definition that means he is a liar. One day Stu tells one lie too many, and, as he stands in a phone booth, he finds himself at the mercy of a vicious but sardonic sniper who demands the truth from him."Phone Booth" is an absolutely terrific thriller. I was intrigued by the concept when I first heard about it: a film set almost entirely within the confines of a phone booth! Frankly, having little respect for director Joel Schumacher after his bloated Batman sequels and mindless Grisham adaptations, I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised. With every plot twist, I was on the edge of my seat wondering how the film makers were going to resolve the escalating situation without violating the internal perspective of the film. Schumacher and company always did so with great panache, but this film is more than a esoteric experiment in film making technique. It is a fast-paced, suspenseful thriller.While much of the success of the film rests firmly on the shoulders of Colin Farrell, who plays wonderfully against the disembodied voice of Kiefer Sutherland, the real star of the movie is screenwriter Larry Cohen. Cohen, a crafty old veteran from the B-movie world, deserved an Oscar nomination for this inventive script which was so old that it was actually offered to Alfred Hitchcock. (I wish he would have tackled it!) Bravo, Mr. Cohen. Maybe it's time for me to start checking out your "Maniac Cop" films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a movie buff for a number of years and can usually predict with apparent ease the next thing to happen in most movies. This is not due to some amazing ability, more like learning from repetition due to a lack of original thought in Hollywood. So many movies have been made it is difficult to spin something original. Phone Booth, however, has kept to the old standby of KISS. Keep It Simple Stupid. This movie is a one stage deal. Apart from a couple side shots of nondescript locales, the entire movie takes place in a phone booth and the immediate surroundings. Now this may sound boring to those of us so used to the latest greated special effects but this is fantastic movie. It is gripping and highly entertaining. I was shocked that a movie with such little eye candy could capture my attention like it did. The acting is good, the story is good and the idea is superb. You have watched so many movies in your life that were not worth the time. Thankfully this one is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's mercilessly overheated "suspense" drama has cocky publicist Colin Farrell trapped in a phone booth by a sniper who knows all his dirty secrets. Seems cell-phone addict Farrell uses the public phone to ring his girlfriend, thus his wife of one year won't get suspicious when she sees the bill. Beginning with the caveat this slick, smarmy player is actually married (to a clean-cut good girl!), none of the details in "Phone Booth" manage to convince, least of all the psychopath (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) who turns out to be smarter than his victims and the entire New York City police department combined. There's a surprising amount of talent behind this film, but it's a one-trick pony, resting on a mighty thin script which doesn't allow for any spontaneity. Farrell does a good job under the cramped circumstances, but Forest Whitaker's police Captain seems to take an awfully long time to assess this situation correctly. So, the hookers across the street saw a gun in Farrell's pocket? Well, they must be right! Aren't prostitutes the most reliable witnesses in the Big Apple? *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

The film tries to keep the pace going with a very will-he-or-won't he theme which it just cannot pull off due to Colins awful acting and obviously being restrained to a phone booth.

Kiefer is no Jack Bauer here and really shines as a terrifying villain. The film knows when to quit, at only 81 minutes, and it leaves its strong effect in your viewing experience. Colin Farrell stars with Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes.Colin Farrell stars as an arrogant publicist in New York City named Stu Shepard. He's a very busy man and starts off the movie with an assistant named Adam making calls to tons of places that link together with at least 5 different cell phones ringing at the same time. He then leaves his assistant to do his work and now he goes off to his daily cheating. You see he's married to a women named Kelly (Mitchell) but he calls another girl named Pam (Holmes) "just in case things don't work out" with his wife. Everyday after work, he goes off to the same phone booth to call his "extra". After today's call, the phone rings and he picks it up. The movie has now official begun.Kiefer Sutherland plays as The Caller who forces Stu to do the most embarrassing antics to save him from getting killed. Forrest Whitaker eventually comes in as a NYPD chief to find out what's right and what's wrong. Note that about 80% or more takes place in the phone booth.I liked this movie. It had a decent ending, depending on how you wanted the movie to end. I found that it ran short and I found it had to much language. Of course, the language is applied only to make the movie even more realistic, having said they're in New York City. A great thriller and a good, entertaining performance by Colin Farrell. Joel Schumacher does a good job as director. One of the best thrillers of 2002.My Rating: 8/10 Objectively ? 8/10 Subjectively ? 8/10 Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having missed this tight thriller in its commercial run, I recently caught up with it on DVD form. Joel Schumacher is a director that has given us films that are clever and witty and hold the viewer's interest at all times.In this film, Mr. Schumacher presents us with a New York PR man, who is one of the lowest forms of vermin that populate and manipulate the media. He is ruthless. This is a man with no scruples at all; he is in for a rude awakening!This guy is in for the surprise of his life when he is caught in a phone booth, probably the last one standing in the streets of Manhattan! Of course, this is an allegory, perhaps his descent into hell. This man must think he is the king of the New York newspaper gossip column where he rules over the lives of other people. He is played brilliantly by Colin Farrell. All comes to a head when this character is threatened by an unknown voice on the phone that knows his very move. Is God taking revenge on this scum bag? Could that voice on the other side of the wire be his conscience calling him to a reckoning? Basically, the whole film is Colin Farrell coming to terms with his arrogance and being put down in his place by an unknown force, much too clever for him, or the police. The film has such an ironic twist that just when we thought we had solved the puzzle, we realize how wrong we were!Mr. Schumacher has directed with a sure hand and keeps the film to a frantic pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a good reason many people never use public phones anymore. Is it 'cause a crazed sniper might be aiming a high power rifle at your heart? No, of course not. People don't like to use public phones because who knows what vile contagious filth is there to smear off onto you. And that's how I felt after sitting through this absurd turd, like I had been infected with something foul. I needed a long hot shower to get the horrible stink off me; the stink of shame for having allowed myself to be duped by its promise of something original, something real.A slick, vain, arrogant prick that's cheating on his lovely, angelic wife? That's not so original. Oh right, he hasn't cheated yet, but he was JUST about to. HA!! And his lovely, angelic wife might happen to check his cell phone 'cause apparently he can't be trusted. Wait a minute. If she's so pure and wonderful why would she be creeping on him? Not really explained. And the idea of him not having a secret throw away cell phone for his illicit activity is beyond idiocy. There's just no way around that enormous gaping hole in the story. But it didn't stop the imbecilic writers from trudging on with their tedious odyssey.There's a primal pleasure that this crappy film wants to cater to - the desire to see innocent unsuspecting people exterminated for no good reason - but it retreats from this challenging idea so meekly. Senseless unconditional mayhem is a more honest premise for a movie than the con job this one pulls in needing us to believe that the sleaze ball PR agent might actually deserve to be shot dead. It's so cowardly of the people responsible for this ridiculous film to hide behind this idea. That they must justify their gratuitous mayhem with a moral cause is just pandering to the hypocrites, and that's the definition of depraved. When I annihilate pedestrians when I'm playing Grand Theft Auto I get such a rush. I don't first concoct back stories for each victim of how they have disgraced themselves hopelessly and my mortal violence is an act of divine justice (although that actually sounds like a good premise for a movie). I just love to blow 'em away! That's what a guilty pleasure is all about. But no, in the moral universe of this sad film only the nasty, evil pimp Leon is executed. We all know he was going to hell anyway, right? Stupid premise, stupid script, stooopid ethics. And stupid me for sitting through this slop till the end. Oh Christ, just talking about it makes me feel slimy. I gotta take another long hot shower...</fullReview>

Then again, with only a 10 day film shoot, you can't have much time to think through whether this is a film that should actually come into existence. even the cast doesn't boast any superb acting ability (Forest Whitaker can be perfectly amazing and at times perfectly horrible). for anyone to think that you could make a good movie out of a lousy plot such as a man being made to stay in a phone booth and such a quick film shoot can't believe in good film-making of any kind. all in all it wasn't surprising how flat Collin Farrell's acting was and certainly wasn't surprising that a plot with a man stuck in a phone booth turned out to be 80 minutes of nothing but a man stuck in a phone booth. now if you like watching guys in phone booths then this is your movie, if not, don't bother. the betrayal this commits against thrillers is a crying shame, the sad truth when a movie is brought into existence in such a hurried fashion is that it cannot be of any true noteworthy value. film making takes time and effort, something very lacking in this attempt at film.</fullReview>

Its doesn't transport you into a matrix, nor will it have flashbacks that take vast chunks of time.

Thanks to the great job of the actors: Colin Farrell, whose performance is so intense that it makes you feel like you share the space of the phone booth with him (one should be so lucky!); Forest Whitaker, who brilliantly gives life to a troubled character who saves the day; Radha Mitchell, the poor unaware main character's wife; last but not least, the screen-filling voice of the sniper: the actor's ability to keep it warm and ice-cold at the same time makes it impossible to turn your eyes away from the screen. Very interesting is the fact the the plot develops in real time and the extensive use of the split screen to show us what happens not only in the phone booth, but all around it. The combination of all these elements makes of "Phone booth" a breathtaking movie: just put yourself in a comfortable seat, watch it and savour it!</fullReview>

What develops is a stand-off situation with Farrell caught between the sniper and the police and although the action is confined almost entirely to the phone booth and the street around it, director Joel Schumacher makes brilliant use of that once much over-used and now hardly ever seen technique of splitting the screen to show the action from various viewpoints.The premise isn't particularly new but Larry Cohen's script is a model of its kind and once upon a time would have made one hell of a B-movie, (it clocks in at around eighty minutes). In this case, less is indeed more. Farrell is virtually never off the screen and is fast becoming one of the best young actors of his generation while Forest Whitaker is equally good as the sympathetic policeman trying to make sense of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" is a one of a kind thriller even though the movie is under 90 minutes long, a rarity now a days for a feature film, not a minute or even second is wasted in the movie."Phone Booth" could have easily been padded with extra and useless footage to make it seem impressive as a feature length film. It's film-makers wisely left it at 80 minutes which gave the movie the unrelenting and heart stopping action and suspense that made it the success that it is. Stu Shepard, Colin Farrell is a publicist who lives like the publicity that he gets for his clients which is for the most part an illusion. Stu grew up in the mostly low to middle class borough of the Bronx but he likes to dress and act like he's from the rich and luxurious Upper East Side and Sutton Place in Manhattan. This is Stu's way of trying to come across as super impressive to those who he works for, and those who work for him, as well as people that he meets socially. Sharp and fast talking Stu spins tales of him knowing and associating with top Hollywood and Madison avenue honchos as effortlessly as if he were ordering breakfast at the local neighborhood diner. This may be OK for Stu, it's part of his job, to BS people in order to get their attention and business. What really irked off Stu's secret and hidden antagonist is his infidelity that he has for his wife Kelly, Radah Mitchell. For some time he's been watching and planing to get Stu into a trap that he set for him on the corner of 53rd and 8th avenue. In a phone booth that Stu has been calling his girlfriend Pamala McFadden, Katie Holmes, so he wouldn't have to use his cell phone. Which Stu's wife Kelly could easily find who Stu has been calling from checking the monthly phone bill. Tense and powerful drama in midtown Manhattan with an excellent cast of characters. As the city is shut down by an unseen sniper who has a personal grudge thats reached public proportions. With the entire media focused on the private life of his helpless victim, trapped inside a phone booth, and forced to spill his guts out not only to those who know him but to the whole world on live TV. The movie is so packed with action that you can't believe that it's under 90 minutes long, it seems more like 190 minutes as your riveted to the screen throughout it's entire showing. "Phone Booth"is another feather in the cap for Larry Cohen who gave us such low-budget but high quality classics over the years like "It Alive" in 1974 "God Told me To" in 1976 "Q" in 1982 "Maniac Cop" in 1988 and "Ambulance" in 1990. With "Phone Booth" possibly being the best of them all. What works so well in the movie "Phone Booth" is how the dialog and the action is synchronized in the movie. Where it practically telegraphs everything thats going to happen and yet still jolts you when it does, even as you see it coming! Strong and hefty performances in this small and modest movie by Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Radah Mitchell, Kaite Holmes, Keith Nobbs, Richard T. Jones and many many more that would take up too much space to mention; and lets not forget Kiefer Sutherland. "Phone Booth" is an action suspense movie that stands head and shoulders above all the big budgeted films with multi-million dollar stars that Hollywood has made through the years. "Phone Booth" is a powerhouse of a movie that never lets up for a moment of the 80 minutes it's on the screen and with an ending that will literally knock you out cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little different twist on the psychopath-who-toys-with-the-protagonist plot line by keeping him posted at a phone booth. The psychopath manipulates Colin Farrel into confessing some of his 'sins' to his wife and public. Eventually, the police get involved and news people show up as would be expected. The police are under the impression that Colin Farrel is the bad guy at first but figure out there's someone else involved. It was interesting that we don't see the psychopath until the very end of the movie. I was disappointed by the use of the warn out cliche of two police detectives with different ranks clashing. On the positive side, there were some good twists and turns that set it apart from similar movies, but not enough tension and originality to give it more than 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was wickedly sharp and quite tense. It places you right there on a street to view a man ultimately stuck in the claustraphobic confines of a phone booth and must change as a person or die. He's at the mercy of a taskmaster who you can only hear. You see if Farrell doesn't pick up a ringing phone in an isolated phone booth,his lecherous life remains intact.The beauty of this film is we witness the evolution of a man who appears to have no spine. The situations that occur are well organized to not only build suspense but to make you think..believe me that's a rarity. This film is cunning in how it dictates the story. It's a satire on those people who think the world is their oyster. This film throws a cog in this person's wheel. The fact is he lives a supposed dream and this film strips away that merage. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so convenient to watch. Just an hour and 11 minutes minus the credits - total duration being 80 minutes (80 minutes - already incuding the credits). Colin was terrific in this movie. Radha Mitchell was great; a very beautiful and sexy actress I might add. The ending; though it might be too rushed or flawed due to the fact that Cohen was anxious to get his screenplay off his desk definitely has the "lasting terror" edge of films like Silence of the Lambs. That's all I'm saying without spoiling too much.As improbable as the plot might seem, it is handled with care with the very sharp direction of Joel Schumacher - someone who, before I saw this movie I thought I'd never see a film from again; after he ruined the Batman franchise.It is also shot very well by Matty Libatique. And I loved the opening done to "Operator". Very slick.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--- SPOILER WARNING! ---Few movies have ever gotten such an emotional response out of me as Joel Schumacher's 2002 release, "Phone Booth". For all the hype about movies pushing your emotional buttons in recent months, nothing for me has come close to the nerve-wrenching stuff dished up here with startling regularity throughout the film. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a good story and some well-considered characters, but I lost count of the number of times I bobbed around on a roller coaster of emotions that ranged from intrigue to excitement to anger to terror and back again. But the real brilliance of the film is in its simplicity; "Phone Booth" doesn't have a lot of crazy computer-animated special effects, or cool explosions, or gravel-voiced, gun-toting heroes who come in to save the day; it has none of that. It plays on the expectations, emotions and feelings of the audiences, with an often terrifying fluidity.Alas, there are some surprising events during the plot that, if I spoiled them for you, would seriously ruin the whole experience. I made sure that I avoided on-line reviews and chat rooms and message boards that concerned this film, so I could watch the DVD without any pre-conceived notions and, you know what? This movie blew me away!Keifer Sutherland, with his menacing, sinister voice, was the perfect choice for the sniper. Colin Farrel had never been my favourite actor, mainly because I didn't really like any of the films he was in --- but this movie has changed my views about the talented individual. He plays Stewart so convincingly that no one will have any trouble placing themselves in his shoes and watching the terror from inside that phone booth. The film's capability to suck you into the events, the plots, and the characters, is something we haven't seen since the original "Star Wars" back in 1977...!Repeating myself, I must say that practically no other movie has captivated and enthralled me like "Phone Booth" (with but a few notable exceptions, of course.) I found myself twitching and shaking with nervosity throughout the picture and I smiled at every darn scene because they were so perfect; so capted in reality that they were terrifying, and I even found myself in tears during one scene. IN TEARS! That's never happened to me before, dude!In closing, I'd like to state that I recommend "Phone Booth" to anyone who's looking for a nerve-wracking, pulse pounding psychological thriller. How a man like Joel Schumacher can completely and utterly destroy a franchise with god-awful films (Batman Forever and 1997's abominable "Batman and Robin"), then turn around and direct one of history's greatest thrillers is quite beyond me. All that's important is that if you even have the slightest inkling of what all the fuss is about with "Phone Booth", you're no doubt exceptionally excited to view this film. Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard many people comment about this movie saying: "Oh, its awful, he's in the booth the whole time!" Well, if you think like that, then you missed the entire point of the movie. Phone Booth is an internal conflict between Stu and hsi own sef-image. Stu is both the antagonist and the protagonist. While, the sniper being confounded with the "bad guy" is really the catalyst trying to help the main character "change". This movie is incredibly well done and is a true insight on the modern persona and corruptive personalities. It is truly an insightful and captivating experience. A definite 10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" is finally a psychological thriller that gets it right, something not seen out of Hollywwod in a long time. I was completely engrossed in this movie from the opening sequences onward. I could not turn away even for a second, and that is saying something about the story and the performances, which are stellar. Colin Farrell is great as the phony publicist who is confrtonted in the booth by the sins he's made in his life. Kiefer Sutherland, despite being on screen for only a minute or two near the end, is absolutely wonderful as the psychotic voice on the phone, toying with Stu; kind of like a prosecutor from hell, outlining the wrongs that Stu has done and threatening retribution.Some might say the end is a cheat, but I think not. I have issues with people who seem to think that every movie has to be a downer, that major characters have to die, in short, everything has to be a tragedy to be good. Not so. I thought this ending was good, and I liked the way that Forrest Whitaker's character was able to sense something strange going on and not just assume Stu was an insane jerk.This is a movie woth watching, multiple times. One of the best films of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone booth was one of those movies where I really felt that all is not totally lost when it comes to new movie making. Now I realize that this is no original idea, Hitchcock wanted to make a movie like this in the past but funny enough, was unable to come up with a reason to have the main character have to stay in a phone booth. Well, even though the reason used in this movie isn't one to gasp at, I still found myself enjoying the suspense, drama and thrill. A jerky agent has finally met his match when a man with a I-have-to-punish-people attitude, not unlike Mr. Nameless from Se7en, targets him while making his daily call to a promising mistress in a phone booth.I liked Phone Booth a lot. It was super suspenseful, and if your one for 2nd chances then you will surely find yourself rooting for Stu (Colin Farrell). Forest Whitaker played an awesome Captain that tried his best to understand the situation and not just jump to conclusions even with adversity.Colin Farrell has been someone I've been keeping a look out for ever since Tigerland, and he's done nothing but please the mind and eye (even in my guilty little pleasure DareDevil). The only thing that I will ask?no, not ask, beg of Hollywood?PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE A SEQUAL. The end is fine, we do not need to see what will happen to our characters. Just leave it as it is. With that said, I bid you all adu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. When I saw the trailer of 'Phone Booth' for the first time, I knew I had to see it. 1) it has Colin Farrell. 2) it's a thriller/horror movie. 3) it seemed very good. And when I went to the cinema yesterday, I wasn't disappointed.'Phone Booth' was, in my opinion, good from the beginning (despite the annoying song played in the start). The facts about using telephones in NYC was interesting. And when Stu Shepard appeared, my first reaction was a big sigh and a thought filled my head "I'll be able to look at that guy for the next 1? hours".And the movie just got better. I was actually horrified about the killer, and when Stu told all his secrets to all the people, cops and TV, I (though I'm pretty embarrassed to admit) started to cry.The movie ended well and the plot didn't have any flaws. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes exciting thrillers (or Colin Farrell :)).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an excellent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher directed Phone Booth, but don't let that scare you away. It is true he has made some truly awful films. Batman and Robin, Dying Young, 8mm,and Bad Company are just a few that spring to mind. But occasionally he forgets his track record of pure drivel and makes excellent movies. This is the director after all who gave us such fun fare as, Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down, and the compelling Tigerland. In between his attempts at excellence, and his successful forays into brain-dead filmmaking sits much that is mediocre.Phone Booth, is one Schumacher can happily add to his not crap efforts. I think this is very nearly a perfect thriller. I say nearly because the antagonist is, maybe, just a bit too perfect. That is a minor complaint though. Moreover Kiefer Sutherland's performance makes the complaint one all too easy to ignore.Phone Booth tells the unhappy story of Stuart `Stu' Shepherd, an unlikable, cynical, small time publicist with big time ambition. His chief skill as a publicist is his ability to lie. It also seems to be his chief skill in most other areas of his life. As the film opens we see him working his gift to everybody, his assistant, his clients and to various magazine personnel. The sad thing is that he is really good at his job. And we in the audience think it is pretty cool the way he wheels and deals to achieve his ends. Every day at lunch he goes to a specific phone booth, on a specific corner, in New York City. He has a cell phone, but he needs this booth. From this booth he calls a woman with whom he is quite taken. That is why he calls from the booth, to avoid any dangerous questions his wife might have about certain recurring phone numbers on his cell. As he is leaving the booth, the phone begins to ring. He does what many of us would do and picks it up. What happens after that I will not say. I worry I have revealed too much as it is.Phone Booth is a slick movie with a lot of substance. Its script is all wit and anger. This is an angry movie. It is critical and observant and I hope some of the laughter it generates is uneasy. That rifle is pointing at the viewer as much as it is pointing at Colin Farrell's lying cynic. But the movie succeeds in doing what I thought would be impossible. It keeps the tension up. Maybe that is not so impressive. There are a lot of tense, thrilling movies out there. But how many of those movies take place in a phone booth?If the script is good, then a movie like this hinges on the talent of its actors. Colin Farrell is up to the challenge. He plays Stu Shepherd perfectly. This is a complex character, not exactly good and not exactly bad (pay close attention to his rationale for even being in the phone booth). Fear is the big thing we need to see in a performance like this. Big old believable fear. And Farrell delivers. The other big performance has to come from `the caller'. `The Caller' is just a voice on a phone. Kiefer Sutherland has the perfect voice, the perfect delivery. We never see him but because of his skill we don't need to. We know what he looks like. We can hear everything in his voice.The supporting cast pushes this film over the top. While their parts are certainly much smaller, Forest Whitaker, Richard T. Jones, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes give performances that help ground the experience in reality. My verdict, this one's a 10. Go forth and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about those pathetic superficial flicks like "Monsters Ball" which got all the buzz in Hollywood, is perhaps one of the best flicks that came in late 2002.It was released in theaters in 2003, and not earlier because of the fact that the Washington Snipers shootings were happening at the same time the movie was scheduled to come out.Obviously the filmmakers (Joel Schulmaker) fearing possible lawsuits and copycats of the sniper shooting in film and Washington did the right thing.The film itself, wow, is probably the best thriller in the last decade superior to other thriller movies like "Dont Say A Word" , and "Insomonia. This movie will literally have you guessing till the end.Stu Shepard (Farrell) is basically a coldblooded, mean businessman, who ultimately gets exactly what he deserves when a psychotic sniper targets him for money and revenge.Excellent flick.A 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a perfect score. I am convinced that, at times when successful movies seem to be closely correlated to special effects, Phone Booth breathes some fresh air as a very simple - yet effective - movie. I have a hard time looking back and finding memories of movies built around such a simple concept as a life threatening situation going on during a public phone conversation, relying on nothing else than an acute sense of characterization. Farrell is magnificent as a wannabe-scam-artist ... and the voice on the other end of the line is at times terrifying and at times frighteningly real. Farrell's "Stu" goes through many changes throughout the story ... from arrogance to guilt to fear, all masterfully portrayed. As a final comment, I'll say that the underlying logic of the plot is the fear - that we all have felt at some point - that we're being watched and followed. That alone is a very strong argument for creating a chef d'oeuvre as this. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure my grammar isn't the greatest, but this movie sure was. I have to say that I have, like I always do, read up on some of the comments on Rottentomatoes and I was really surprised that the fresh rating wasn't higher. I tried my very best to avoid all the trailers and radio spots just cause I knew this movie was short and I didn't want to get too much just from that. And, when I finally got the chance to actually see this movie (yesterday) was was blown away. I thought it was amazing. I thought Colin Farrell was phenomenal (I really give propers for folks who have thick accents that take on different ones for their roles: Rene Zellweger in Bridget Jones, Nicole Kidman in a handful of movies, and Colin over and over).So there isn't much to add to the trailer though. A guy picks up the phone in a booth in Manhattan and it turns out to be a twisted killer who is picking people who are jerks and tries to make them better. Nothing like using a little bit of scare tactics to get your point across. I tell you I would love to see how the whole thing changes Stew. Can he change? Who knows. I know that I'm never gonna pick up a ringing phone.In its simplicity, Phone Booth really has a lot going on. Its got one setting, a handful of characters, and lots of action and drama for an 81 minute long movie. I say, Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did I give this movie a ten star rating? It's not Rear Window, and it's not this year's Memento either. So why? Well, to be honest with you, I couldn't find anything in the movie that I didn't like. I expected to see a movie about a guy in a phone booth who is told by a caller that he can't leave or he'll be shot. It must mean that I consider these types of premises good, or I would not have spent $8.00 on a ticket and $3.00 on Raisinettes. When I left the theatre, I was completely amazed.The movie never lets you down, not even for a second. The movie can be qualified as an action movie even though there's really not that much action. Instead, the director chose to use the "24" style edit. This means that instead of breaking the movie down in post-prod scene by scene, the director and the editor chose to show all things that happen simultaneously together at the same time. The result is a "real time" movie, where we never leave the phone booth. Everything else comes up in side boxes as it happens. Brilliant!At first I thought this wouldn't work, but as the movie progressed I realized it was necessary. There is a scene where there is nothing happening but pure gooey emotion. The director realized that this was one of the most vital parts to the script, but it seemed out of place given the pace of the film. Things were done so when this firstly-conceived emotional scene takes place, you're still biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. At the end of the movie I was actually disappointed. I wanted to go back in the phone booth. I didn't want it to end.All in all, I was very shocked with the newest from Hollywood's "let's make an independent film which can't be called independent because it was made in Hollywood" genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although some have ridiculed this film for being too long, or too rushed, or the fact the characters arent given much time to develop, I must disagree whole heartedly. This film is about a straightforward situation: a man enters a phone booth, and is held hostage by the scope of a sniper. Thats all you need to know, for that is the essence of the film. Character development is a great plus, and I could feel for Farrel because he MADE the character of Stu. Sutherland is great as the omnipotent, psychotic caller on the other end of the line, and Whitaker gives a great preformance as the cool-headed policeman in charge. As for the pace of the film, Schumacher actually manages to make a good film in this case, it is neither too fast nor too slow. You can feel the tension throughout the whole 81 minutes, and the story works perfectly. I also loved the twist at the end of the story (warning - SPOILER! Do not read ahead if you dont want the end to be spoiled for you) in the fact that Sutherland escapes to continue on his self-richeous snipering spree, he planned ahead for everything. I was afraid of him in the same manner I feared Hannibal Lecter at the end of Silence of the Lambs.Of course there were some plot holes or points in the movie that could have been done better, but thats to be expected in any film. All in all, this is an extremely well put together film, and I highly recommend for all prospective viewers to go out and see the film for themselves, on its on merits, rather than the views of a few on this board who dislike the film.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I saw Phone Booth yesterday, and I must say that I was blown away. I was a little curious as to how 81 minutes in a phone booth could be exciting, but this movie definitely help my attention.Colin Farrell as the lying publicist Stu Shepherd is absolutely AMAZING! If anyone had any doubts as to whether or not he could act, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! He does a brilliant job of transforming from the cocky, self-absorbed publicist to a desperate guy breaking down. Everything, especially the part where he is confessing and breaking down, seems completely real and not scripted. Prior to seeing this movie, I wasn't sure if Colin Farrell was just another pretty face, but now I can see that he is most definitely an extremely talented actor. Kiefer Sutherland, as the Caller, was also amazing. His voice is perfect for the part and almost makes you shiver when you first hear it. Forest Whitaker, likewise, was very good for his role. However, it was Farrell who stole the show - which is good, since he's the one alone on the screen for the majority of the movie. SPOILER ALERT The movie was not ALL suspense and sitting on the edge of your seat. There were a fewhumorous moments, especially with the hookers, which were good to ease a little bit of the suspense. *SPOILER ALERT* I thought that the "pretend shooting" at the end was a very good thing to add - it took some predictability out of the ending. *END OF SPOILERS* While the ending was slightly disappointing, it was also a pretty good way to end the movie. It seemed to leave it open for a sequel, but I have no clue how on earth this amazing movie could be followed up.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE IN SEARCH OF A GOOD THRILLER! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Apt for a Single Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth" is clearly his best work short of "Tigerland", and one of the few films I've seen in recent memory that actually had any merit as a film. For the director who almost destroyed Batman, he has fully redeemed himself with this virtual masterpiece. Colin Farrell landed one of the most interesting film character roles in a long time with that of Stu Shepherd, an agent with a young wife and a younger mistress. Stu has taken life for granted, and has refused to accept that he is morally corrupt, but is soon shown the error of his ways when he picks up a ringing phone, and the caller on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland, in an excellent role) tells him he will kill him if he hangs up. For approximately 76 minutes afterwards, Schumacher takes us on a real time, gripping journey of the life of a man and a modern morality tale with a strong message, albeit using violence as the guidelight. Colin Farrell plays Stu with a desperation that perfectly captures Stu's fear and anxiety. He makes you care about the character and his fate, a challenge that not many actors can pull off. Forest Whitaker, excellent in "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai", plays Captain Ed Ramey with such sensitivity that you can't help but feel for this poor man, who has lost his marriage and his life with his devotion to his job. *SPOILER* In a scene when the caller forces Stu to ask Captain Ramey if he masturbates at night, the sadness that overcomes Ramey's face speaks volumes more than any line could do. *END OF SPOILERS* Moments of great tension fill this movie, and they immerse the audience. Throughtout the movie, you feel for Stu Shepherd and fear for his life. Schumacher in this film demonstrates why he is considered a directorial talent, The cinematography in the film is also commendable. Tight, claustrophobic camera angles that surround Farrell in the phone booth add to the tension, and make this film one of the greats. Hopefully enough people will agree with me as to vote this film into the Top 250 because unlike other films with similar concepts, "Phone Booth" hits a homer out of the park and doesn't break stride while running the bases. 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing as troublesome as conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once, here's an edge-of-your-seat action film that's viscerally lean, symbolically rich (perhaps even stunning), and uncluttered by visual noise (a cheap substitute for content), or absurd, `deus ex machina' twists and turns of fate and fortune. This film goes straight to the heart of the problem of conscience, right from the opening song, an old gospel tune that whimsically asks the operator to `give me Jesus on the line.' Every one of who watches this film will identify with the man in the phone booth, because every one of us is guilty of some kind of shortcoming or another. The really fascinating, and groundbreaking, thing about this film is this: it's not clear whether the accusatory voice of conscience is good, or evil, or both; furthermore, it's not clear whether conscience is innate (natural), or conventional (a matter of upbringing, a social construct), or both. The viewer has to make up his or her own mind! When Stu picks up the phone, he does so by duty, by compunction, by social convention. `A ringing phone has to be answered, Doesn't it?' the caller taunts. He's gained control of Stu by manipulating Stu's innate sense of moral obligation. And like the voice of conscience, the phone booth is `the last vestige of privacy,' in New York, reminiscent of the `my own mind is my church' idea of American individualism, also on the `innate' side of the coin. Then again, on the `conventional' side, the man at the other end spends all his time watching Stu ? an envious, spiteful person who is, like Stu, a `walking clich.' His ethical stance is about as nuanced (and deadly) as PTL's Jim Bakker, and just about as compelling. Coward that he is, he attacks Stu at a time of weakness, playing God with unearned entitlement and capriciousness. `If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than conscience,' Huck Finn mused, `I'd pison it.' </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap and weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been a good movie is turned into a cheap exercise in extracting a few bucks out of a few million viewers. This movie is one routine beaten-to-death formula from start to finish. But we all would have been lucky if that was it. But no. It's also completely devoid of any tension and suspense. The caller's voice seems to be coming from behind the screen, not out of the receiver. His role is unconvincing and very badly written. Even Kiefer Sutherland's voice doesn't save it. In fact, that only makes it even more annoyingly banal. Colin Farrell has a single expression on his face throughout the movie and barely does anything more than sweat, although I'm not convinced that was real either. Several plot lines are left undeveloped or unfinished, but even if they were developed and finished it wouldn't have saved the movie anyway. The realism of this movie is especially nonexistent. I never noticed a "modern morality play" here, only a VERY BAD, SLOPPILY MADE film. It sucks, plain and simple, and it sucks all around. AVOID IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life alteration in a phone booth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Larry Cohen. It stars Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Rahda Mitchell, Katie Holmes and Kiefer Sutherland. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.New York City publicist Stu Shepard (Farrell) is a liar, a cheat and an all round weasel, but that is about to change when he enters a phone booth and finds himself at the mercy of a long range sniper who has him in his sights.In real time and set in practically one location, Phone Booth is not your standard thriller. Held back from its original release date due to the sad Beltway Sniper Murders in Washington D.C., Phone Booth proved to be worth the wait. A simple premise for sure, but for the brief running time of just over 80 minutes, tension rises with each quarter as the stakes get upped by outside forces until the deconstruction of one man is complete. Schumacher and Cohen deftly stitch satire into the narrative, while the director also indulges in some nice visual tricks with his camera. He also garners a great sweaty performance out of Farrell, firstly cocksure and in love with himself, latterly layered with mounting panic and sympathetic yearning. Outside the booth the picture is well served by Whitaker, Mitchell and Holmes. The former a wise cop who tries to grasp the situation and avert Stu's death, the latter two as love interests in opposite wings.It's not all perfect, the first turn of nasty events involving hookers veers too close to comedy, there's a couple of daft implausibilities and as much as I personally liked the epilogue, I understand those that hate it and see why it proved to be an audience divider. Still, I found it riveting on thriller terms and funny as a satire, nifty, neat and not normal entertainment. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captivating director Joel Schumacher imprisons cocky publicist Colin Farrell (as Stu Shepard) in a Manhattan "Phone Booth" for almost the entire length of this eighty minute movie - and, the result approaches amazing. Mr. Schumacher's cinematic sense, and willingness to experiment, is worth of comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Most obviously, this film is "Rear Window" in reverse. Note how successfully both directors keep you, and their protagonists, is their opposite settings. Of course, Mr. Hitchcock (for a small sample of his "phone booth" usage, see "The Birds") would have done several things differently in a feature-length "Phone Booth". For example, the "menacing" toy near the beginning of the film would certainly have been owned by an annoying kid. And, the film's moral compass ends up strangely askew. Still, Schumacher, cast, and crew keep you on the line.******** Phone Booth (9/10/02) Joel Schumacher ~ Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone booth equals death trap, mobile phone equals key out, hmmmmm. So, this is the latest propaganda against public pay phones? Now they can mean the death of you. I'm sure Cinguverizosprint were behind this some how.O.K., any movie that can utilize the same setting for the bulk of the movie and still hold its appeal is a good movie. Joel Schumacher did an excellent job with this project as did Colin Farrell. Colin Farrell played Stu Shepard, a wannabe hot shot publicist that is caught up in his own image and has desires to cheat on his wife. He eventually gets caught in an elaborate and well thought out trap laid by the unidentified phone booth caller played by Kiefer Sutherland.It is another megalomaniacal movie in which the antagonist takes a holier-than-thou position and forcibly tries to get people to see the error of their ways. In this case, the bad guy tries and succeeds at getting Stu to at least admit his sins and openly repent. Even though you typically abhor and loathe the evil vainglorious characters, they always end up serving some good. Almost like the existence of evil being there so people can recognize what is good.The dialog and flow of this movie was superb. Other characters were introduced into the scene at good intervals to make sure the movie never got stale. The movie continued to hold my interest all the way up to the very end just because I wanted to see the end result. That is the mark of a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young guy who gets trapped in a public phone booth where he is menaced by a maniac sniper on the line who is watching him. And it's OK. My disappointment is that, for various reasons, I thought it was going to be much better.I loved the basic premise, and I thought the casting was interesting. I'd also heard positive things about it. But in reality, far from gripping me as I thought it would, I found my mind wandering a bit by half-way through - and it's the kind of film where that shouldn't really happen.Colin Farrell is good, as is the disembodied voice of Keifer Sutherland. The director tries a number of innovative techniques like split screens etc. which give it a curiosity value. Personally, I found the constant music soundtrack intrusive after a while but I commend them for trying it as something different.So see it by all means. Just don't expect too much. All that's wrong with PhoneBooth is that the tension is just that bit more slack than it needs to be in films like this, and that's what makes it a decent film rather than an excellent one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good, but way too short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented a few movies this weekend. I noticed "Phone Booth" and everyone said that it was a good movie. I decided to give it a shot. After all, I do love Keifer. I got home from work a little late, and I noticed that the film cover said it was 81 minutes long. So, I watched it before I went to bed. The movie is great. The acting is above average. And the story keeps you on the edge. I kept wondering what would happen next, and how it would end. When it did finally end, I looked at my clock and I couldn't believe how short this film was. Although it was ended perfectly, I wished they had added more. But I would recommend this. It was a very good film.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stu, a looser promoter is held captive by an unseen gunman in a phone booth in New York. The police respond, listen to screaming women pointing at Stu in the booth, claiming he shot their pimp. That's the ONLY realistic part of this movie. After that everything falls apart. Farrell makes up for his lack of acting talent with four-letter words. Forrest Whitaker, the police captain, an otherwise good actor, stinks up the screen with unbelievable actions. The viewer of this movie is a captive in his own home if you sit through this stinker. I lost nearly two hours of my life on this project. I suggest you don't waste your time on this one.

		<shortDescription>"Phone Booth" should be flushed down a Public Toilet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth should be flushed down a Public Toilet (neither have existed in New York since about 1969)so this would be an appropriate way to dispose of this film.You just don't have to be able to suspend disbelief to attempt to enjoy this film, you have to suspend all reason and reality.The Phone Booth (which of course wouldn't exist in the first place) is obviously not in the Times Square area. The NYPD obviously has no chain of command, it recruits and promotes people without a clue, and makes sure that the innocent or always placed in the line of fire. The NYPD doesn't secure a crime scene and always let's anyone walk up to a victim of a hostage situation when receiving medical treatment.The one hook the film has is why would this brilliant sniper be so interested in the lives of strangers and why does he do the horrible things he does. The totally implausible conclusion abandons the viewer without any answer.The writing by Cohen was flawed from the premise, it has no believable plot, and there is no attempt to explain the main theme: the sniper who rights wrongs by criminal means. I don't blame the actors for stereotypical performances: the writer and director are to blame.Don't bother to search for Phone Booth, they don't exist and neither should this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deserve the praise. AT ALL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, a lot of folks seem to like this one. I don't understand why. It's a technically well-made movie, I guess, but the plot has nowhere to go. It could have been an interesting 15 minute short, I guess.There are implausible sequences through the whole thing. Absolutely nothing in this movie is believable. The holes in the plot are large enough to drive a house through. Minor spoilers ahead:For starters: Given the guy's personality, as it is established right in the beginning, there is no way he would have stayed on the line for more than 15 seconds, and he certainly would not have answered again when it rang a second time. That all happens LONG before the warning shot is fired. It makes no sense at all. -And he doesn't tell the pimp that he can't leave because there's a shooter? At that point in time, the shooter hadn't yet warned the guy NOT to say anything. Oh well, no matter.... Biggest problem of all:The police would have learned immediately that the pimp was facing the phone booth when shot, yet he was shot in the back, and this didn't tip them off? Are you kidding me? (not to mention the hookers who were staring right at the two men and just MIGHT have noticed that the guy in the phone never raised his arms or pointed anything when the pimp was hit. -But this doesn't seem to bother the director. Also, I do believe that NYC cops would be able to recognize a wound made by a rifle fired from 200 feet away. Such a wound looks, er, slightly different than a wound made by a handgun at six inches. duh...-and there are many other impossibilities. for instance, the supposed shooter-suicide guy would have already been somewhat cold by the time they burst into the room. NYC swat teams aren't quite that stupid. -And how exactly did the bad guy manage to end up driving the ambulance? Why would he have had the proper uniform on? There is no way he could have known how the whole thing would end up. The shooter expected either the good guy to walk away humiliated, or dead. Either way, the bad guy would not need to be driving any ambulance. This movie is so stupid, it boggles my mind that anyone was entertained by it. I'm so insulted by this directer that I'm actually angry about it. The whole movie insulted my intelligence. At least completely implausible B-movies usually don't take themselves seriously.I watched this because there was absolutely nothing else on, and I had work to do and just wanted noise in the backround. It was still a complete waste of time. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple, But Very Suspenseful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a publicist, who lies to his clients pretending to be more important than he is. He is married with Kelly Shepard (Radha Mitchell), but he has a sexual interest in his client Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), a beautiful aspirant to actress. Stu is trapped in a phone booth in Times Square by a sniper and by the New York police, under the command of Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), accused of killing a pimp who was shot by the sniper in front of the cabin a few minutes ago. The sick sniper wants Stu to confess and humiliate himself in front of the cameras, threatening Kelly and Pamela with his rifle. The police is not aware of the existence of the sniper and believes Stu has a gun. This movie is an excellent thriller, having an excellent director and cast. The running time of 81 minutes is perfect for the plot. On the behind of scenes on the DVD, Joel Schumacher tells that this film was shot in ten days, ten pages of the screenplay per day, in the sequence of the story and without the cast knowing the screenplay. Therefore, the actors and actresses were also anxious to know the end of the story. A simple, but very suspenseful film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil):'Por Um Fio' (`To Hang By a Thread')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting, highly entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a movie that will keep you glued to your seat from start to finish. The premise of this film is a slick media consultant in New York City finds himself trapped in a phone booth by an extortionist's sniper rifle; seems fairly straightforward. However, it is the enthralling story, superb acting and exceptional camera work that give the viewer an intense, worthwhile experience. This is seriously entertainment at its best.Farrell gives a fantastically convincing performance as a sleazy, New York publicist who bears some semblance to a young Ari Gold. I have always found that this man is painfully underrated and this film really shows off his versatility in a complete starring role. Everything from the thick New York accent to the devolution of his character seemed very natural and perfectly delivered. Kiefer Sutherland, providing the voice of the sniper, delivers a daunting performance. With merely his voice, he displays an intelligent, darkly comical and foreboding presence that makes the movie work. Forest Whitaker also gives a standout performance in his supporting role as captain of the task force.Joel Schumacher uses smart camera techniques, whether it being the use of split screens or fast cuts, to cultivate an atmosphere of sheer intensity and anticipation. It can be difficult to string along a story which takes place in mostly one setting, but the pace seems to never let up from start to finish. The director, editors and anyone else involved in the visual cutting of this film deserve a lot of praise. Phone Booth is creative, entertaining and ultra suspenseful. Pick up this call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell's Phone Call.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth (2002): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, Kiefer Sutherland: Thriller about isolation and confrontation. It stars Colin Farrell as a business man who lies to clients to excel until one day he picks up the receiver of a pay phone and informed that if he hangs up, the gun aimed in his direction will fire. He sees it as a bad joke until details are given regarding his affair to another client unknown to his wife. To complicate matters the caller contacts this client to inform her that Farrell is in fact, married. After a fatal incident, the police arrive on the scene. Interesting setup descends into a series of episodes between Farrell and the police, and Farrell and the caller. Conclusion is clever and director Joel Schumacher makes great use of a limited location. Farrell gives an exhausting sense of energy as an individual whose closet full of skeletons is about to be revealed but not without some redemption. Forest Whitaker does well as police chief in what could have been a mere standard role but he plays it out realistically. Radha Mitchell plays Ferrell's wife who receives a confession. Katie Holmes plays the client who will learn who Farrell is and her bad position. The voice on the phone belongs to Kiefer Sutherland but perhaps a little screen time would have played out more effectively. Strong theme regarding attitudes that eventually entrap us.

		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie makes you think that it's gonna be one of corny movies about NYC and it's lifestyle but it turns out as a decent thriller with a totally unpredictable ending.The main character is Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell) - an arrogant New York publicist and a cheater husband who answers a random call in one of the last phone booths of Manhattan and soon gets involved in a long, horrible talk. The man on the other end of the line turns out to be a sniper with a rifle who knows a great deal about Stu's life and threatens to kill him and other people around him unless he stays on the line and does exactly what he is saying.The Situation becomes more tense when the sniper actually kills a man outside of the booth which ends up intervening NYPD, after what everything messes up by all it means. Firstly, Stu is considered as a prime suspect but after a major detective notices the sniper's red dot sight aimed to Stu's wife he realizes that Stu is a victim himself and rest of the action he is trying to get him out of the booth safely.The whole set is almost entirely around the phone booth but is interesting enough to keep you glued to your seat during 80 min due to its fine acting (especially by Farell) and very well-developed story-line. The movie is full of suspense, you can predict some things but most of them not.Many details doesn't seems purely logical, for example hooker's redundant rage to a man occupying a booth or Stu's too much loyalty towards the caller or the unresponsiveness of Police but I hope this is not what the director claims for.Schumacher is the director of several successful pictures, including two of the Batman movies, but in this case he leaves the big budget behind. It's the super-surprising fact that the film is shot on one set in 10 days.Phone Booth is quite efficient film, definitely worth watching. In other words, its psychological thriller with a morality as a main character.</fullReview>

The movie does exceedingly well at maintaining the tension throughout. It takes you to the edge of your seat - and holds you there. Kiefer Sutherland is the perfect choice for the man at the other end of the line. The role requires a powerful impact only with the voice, and Sutherland couldn't have done better. Colin Farrell does his part well, and we are convinced by the transition from insolence to helplessness and eventually desperation. Joel Schumacher has really risen well past his Batman movies and gives us a truly breathtaking thriller.</fullReview>

Although I live in Toronto not New York, I know many movies were taken in Toronto instead of New York. However, I saw this movie again. I still think the movie told a very good story,although fake (I believe) but almost flawless. The story was described by thrilling way, and I cannot pause just wanted to know what would happen in the next minute. Therefore, 9 out of 10 is from mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ringing phone has to be answered...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepard is an arrogant publicist lying his way to success in New York. Everything changes when he unknowingly answers a call in a phone booth that he has been using to call a woman behind his wife's back. Now he is at the mercy of the caller who is watching Stu's every move with a high calibre sniper rifle somewhere in the buildings above. He is holding him hostage with the demands he comes clean to his wife and everyone else that he has cheated. He must rely on his wits and the unlikely help of Capt. Ramey. Stu knows that his life will change even if he does escape the booth alive. This film starred: Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker &amp; Kiefer Sutherland.PHONE BOOTH was released in 2003 and is a good film in my opinion. It is a very suspenseful film and really messes with your head. Fantastic acting performances from Farrell, Whitaker and Sutherland really helped this film otherwise it would have been a boring story of a man stuck in a telephone booth unable to convince the police that he is not a killer. However with me being a huge fan of Sutherland I knew at the end that he had survived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Death is talking on the other end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Phone Booth' is essentially one-act play turned into a movie. Alfred Hitchcock would have licked his chops over this script written by Larry Cohen and the two to three line pitch must have been one of the easiest to sell to Studio Executives of all time. Those of you who have a background in Theater and Playwrighting as I do, I would urge to study this film as it is a primer and a clinic in how to move a drama from the stage to the film lot.Despite the sweeping and suspenseful visual effects supplied by Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, this is film driven more by dialog than by anything visual. There is the sleazy publicist played by Colin Farrell; walking the streets of New York and making deals on his cell phone in that '-let's do lunch-' manner we have come to associate with his ilk. There is Radha Mitchell as his wife and Katie Holmes as his 'something-something' on the side, filling in the Madonna- Whore complex which seems to be such a fixation and obsession with Western Man. Finally, there is Kiefer Sutherland as the mysterious sniper from on high who turns the phone booth where Farrell's character arranges his lover's trysts with Holmes into a confessional.Now you're good to go. If you are a fan of simplicity as I am, I do not have to intone Scott Meredith to you and his rule for effective storytelling. Farrell's character Stu enters a phone booth and thereafter finds himself in a pickle as whores and a pimp and cops orbit around him and wonder what's taking so long for him to finish his call and why he won't even come out for a cigarette.I remember lines of dialog more than anything else. That is why I am interested in how this would have played out on the stage. It's even more a character driven drama and all the characters are very vivid in my mind. Stu becomes the main character in a Street Theater performance where he is advised to come clean under threat of death and the constant staccato racking of a high powered rifle. The tension and suspense are skillfully accelerated by Director Joel Schumacher and before you know it, you have arrived at the climatic scene where Stu is literally holding his life in his hands before being advised to go and sin no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense movie for such a simple premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Farrell is pretty amazing here as he takes on the role of an egotistical publicist who picks up a random ringing receiver in a N.Y phone booth and is told that if he hangs up, he'll be shot.This was a very intense movie for such a simple premise, filmed entirely in a phone booth and apparently in real time, "Stu" (Farrell) is held hostage by the voice on the other end of the phone, a menacing sniper (played brilliantly by Kiefer Sutherland). Stu is informed that if he hangs up or doesn't comply he will be shot and anyone who tries to interfere will also be shot. Before long someone is shot and the police are involved assuming Stu is the killer.Enjoyed this way more than I expected to, Sutherland is very creepy as the voice on the phone and that ending... 12.27.13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very tight and very good thriller that really surprised me. I must have picked the DVD up for almost nothing and it has sat with others while I vaguely wondered why I had bought it. Rather annoying and bit off putting at first with video multi screens and flashy effects but once this settles into the phone booth - what a gem! Colin Farrell is so very good but so is Forest Whitaker in another vital role. Between them the two basically run the show but the fantastic script from good old Larry Cohen is a great asset and it was probably difficult to go very far wrong especially as this is virtually a single set film. Not overlong by any means and it is a wonder nobody insisted on extending it for commercial reasons but we have what we have and that is a near perfect film that makes you wonder if this is so effective when it is so simple, why do we get presented with so much junk?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sounds corny? No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic. Stuart Shepard finds himself trapped in a phone booth, pinned down by an extortionist's sniper rifle. Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose. I refuse to totally dismiss this, because I find it quite engaging, in a guilty pleasure sense. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. My final rating for it is 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Taut, Tense Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a much better film than I expected and what truly amazes me is how this thriller works with practically a single location, which is a public phone booth in New York City. Not only does this film work as a thriller, it also scary. I don't think I'll be able to pick up a ringing phone in public ever, which is impossible to do nowadays. This film started slow, but once the voice chimes in......bingo! Joel Schumacher(yes, the guy who did the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin), directs a very clever film about a man who is obnoxious, self-centered, and a very big liar. But he makes the mistake in picking up a ringing pay phone and on the other side is a voice that will change everything in this man's life.Colin Farrell was excellent in this movie. We can easily see a transformation in his character from start to finish. He seemed to give off genuine fear and despite the person he was, I hoped his character would remain intact by the end. Kiefer Sutherland as the Voice was great, mainly because he has such a menacing voice that really works well.Overall, Phone Booth was an excellent thriller due it's simple premise, but rapid execution. It's very fast-paced so the film keeps rolling right along. With a single location, I never thought the film would be as tense as it is, but without Sutherland's voice, this film would be in the dead zone. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching this waiting for another show to start but I enjoyed it enough to watch the whole movie. Farrell plays such a convincing part.... Trapped in a phone booth by a snipers rifle, and his own dirty deeds. His frustration and fear obvious.. I also liked Forest Whitaker s part. He has a way of bringing such reality to his characters, you can easily relate to him as Captain Ramsey. The action in this movie is constant and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The sniper targets when aimed on body parts were eerie, terrifying as you'd imagine. Kate Holmes is the mistress he is calling in the phone booth.....when the phone rings back with an extortionist on the other end with a lot of personal info....its hard not to get involved in this gripping action packet film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is still one of my favourite films to date. The main reasons for this is due to how for the majority of the film being in single location. I am still yet to see a film that can keep me interested for the entirety of the film when the location remain constantly in a single location. The intensity of the situation "Stu" (Colin Farrell) is put in keeps me constantly on edge even after multiple viewings, especially with the Sniper "Kiefer Sutherland" as his voice is perfect for the job. Even now when I'm watching the TV Series "24" I still think of this film. Which I assume is the same reason that Metal Gear Solid V is using him as the voice of Solid Snake.Overall, this film (in my honest opinion) is one of the most unique films to date due to the single location aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My one reservation with this is that I wish someone other than Joel Schumacher had made it. It really needed a more precise filmmaker, or someone who could give it a trashy 70s vibe. Instead we get tacky choices like the pointless and disorganised intro that lessens the claustrophobic nature of the premise, and the strange stylistic effects that look like old Joel has just discovered the effects console I had in my college editing suite.Having said that, the back and forth between Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland is riveting, and Farrell's performance is terrific. It could have been a great little film, but instead it's merely very good. It's certainly the best thing Schumacher's ever done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought a movie about a guy in a phone booth would be as interesting as it was? I suppose when Joel Shumacher is directing an all-star cast, anything, even an entire movie that takes place in a phone booth, can be interesting! Colin Farrell stars as a man who lies, cheats, and does anything it takes to get to the top of his profession. He thinks he's on top of the world, with a wife, a girlfriend, and a group of clients, who don't know what scum he is, but someone has noticed the real Stu Shepard and has trained a rifle on him. Shepard has to do as he is told or risk becoming yet another victim, of a man who has been targeting New York City's businessmen. Colin Farrell is a very versatile actor, it's always been his biggest strength, but generally I find his performances to be kind of flat. Farrell has never been someone who I would consider a top tier Hollywood actor, but looking back on this early performance, I have to tell you, I was impressed. The setting of the film was so limited, that the only way it works is if you have a strong and believable cast, which Phone Booth certainly has. Every character has a unique back story and everyone is interconnected, in a film that is full of intrigue and edge of your seat action. People may not know what a phone booth is anymore, but this film is far from outdated. It is an excellent edge of your seat thrill ride that is perfect for the person who wants a short, but exciting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He had him at 'Hello' ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Tom Cruise a few years back (is it a coincidence Katie Holmes stars in the film?) Colin Farrel does a great job portraying an arrogant prick you'd love to hate. In fact, the director Joel Schumacher begs us for that as soon as the film opens.Basically, Stu never communicates without a cell-phone, and directs his life like all the workaholic businessmen we'd love to kick their asses once in a while. He's naturally followed by a boot-lick who treats him like God, he's got a wife, a girlfriend, but even these people are only agenda fillers and wouldn't compete with his greatest asset: an ego. In fact, Stu has such a big ego it wouldn't fit in a phone booth and this where his nightmarish journey with a mysterious caller will be trapped in.Right in the beginning the narrator tells us that when a phone calls, someone has to answer. Stu will commit the fatal mistake and as soon as he grabs it, his life would hang on a thread, a little red dot warning him that the caller rhymes with killer. That's the premise of Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth", an interesting thriller superbly combining the claustrophobia of a small booth with the hugeness of a city, New York naturally, where each citizen tries to have one inch of space to breathe in. All through the film, we wonder if we should envy the man in the phone booth or the worm-like population evolving in the Big Apple.But there's no premise without a point, which the villain has to make so we know where he comes from, literally. During his long dialog with Stu, we start emphasizing with the victim in his position but in the same time, we try to understand the caller or killer's motive, and during their long conversation, Stu will make many encounters that will all play a part to the plot. A bunch of whores who need that phone booth to call their client, an immigrant vendor whose toy is shot to pieces (to prove that killer rhymes with sniper)? we know there has to be THE fatal bullet, the one that will play a pivotal role by calling the Police, the ill-fated guy who gets it is a Pimp who only got it because his whores couldn't shut their mouths.At that time, I was perplexed; I thought no matter what point the killer was supposed to teach, yeah, the key word was 'redemption', I didn't think it had to cost the pimp's life. If we were to agree that Stu is a worthless human being, well, his life isn't worth more anyone. So with one person dead, what's left for us to root for the killer, except a sort of charisma and some black humor. But Schumacher doesn't leave us much time to mourn the poor pimp, the Cavalry comes, the TV vultures join the party and the fun starts. It's obvious that Stu will be regarded as a killer, but thankfully, the script doesn't turn the Captain into a stupid guy, well he was played by Forest Withaker, that's a good sign.Captain Ramney feels something fishy, if Stu is trying to be killed in purpose, no way, he wouldn't give him that pleasure, now, we're relieved. This is where the killer's behavior gets weirder, he orders Stu to ask the most awkward question to the Captain. Naturally, Ramney understands that Stu is taken in hostage and start looking at the buildings, another good sign. It's also interesting that later, he tells Stu's wife that he divorced and went into therapy. The question is: how can a villain so capable of quickly reading a man's personality in a glimpse of an eye make the hostage say the very words to clear him. This is going way too far but the strength of "Phone Booth" is that the plot goes faster than the script. It's a film shot in real-time, and the caller-killer hasn't time to waste. Obviously, the mysterious caller rhymes also with ringmaster, one of a show that can only culminate with a breakdown.Which leads to the obligatory confession, saved by Farrel's emotional performance, he opens his heart, asks for forgiveness to all the people he hurt, and it's with that relief that he can finally shout at the killer, waiting for any bullet to stop him. The Police finally identifying the call get to an apartment and find a man who apparently killed himself before they come: a corpulent pizza deliveryman, the same who was dismissed by Stu, in his prick's days, one hour earlier. I guess no one bought this ending, if only because the killer's voice is pretty identifiable, and no one would value his life lower than a stranger's redemption. The ending comes fast enough to comfort us about our intelligence.Indeed, we understand this is one of these stories where the villain gets away with it. And the film, which can be seen as a 'Dog Day Afternoon' of the 2000's shows how everything gets back to status quo in a city where things run so fast, they're quickly forgotten? except that Stu must NOT forget his experience, and the knowledge that the killer is still alive is perhaps the best warning he could have. As far as storytelling goes, "Phone Booth" is far and solid entertainment, but it left me wonder if it really deserved the death of two men who had nothing to do with Stu in the first place. If the killer was so concerned by Stu's behavior, he should have question his own contempt for life as well.Apparently, the director wised up and left the film without a second part. But maybe for once, I wouldn't have minded a sequel where the killer would be in Stu's place, and see where it can go, whoever calls him ? obviously Stu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gimmick movie that works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a fast talking publicist. Every day at the same time he calls young actress Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes) from a payphone. He doesn't want his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) to see the calls on his cell. Then a mysterious stranger (Kiefer Sutherland) calls the payphone. When the stranger shoots a guy, the cops surround the phone booth. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) try to figure out what exactly is going on.This is quite a nice little thriller from Joel Schumacher. It's a tight little movie depending so much on the interplay from a faceless voice. It never gets gimmicky. The tension does wear thin even with such a short running time. They do need to update the phone booth idea. Even in 2002, that was already outdated. However, Colin Farrell is supplying tremendous energy in such a confined role. Kiefer Sutherland delivers the right kind of menace. The tension in the first hour is incredible. I think the movie needs someway to release some kinetic energy for the final third act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always put off watching "Phone Booth", because it stars Colin Farrell, whom I am not particularly much fan of. But I must take my hat off for him in this movie, because he really did a good job.The storyline in "Phone Booth" is rather simple, but quite captivating and thrilling. It is a movie that is based on emotions and really running on how well the actors were able to use the spoken words. And the banter between Stu (played by Colin Farrell) and the caller (played by Keifer Sutherland) was really great, it was witty and sharp edged. And that is what made this movie work well. But the performance by Forest Whitaker was also quite good, as he usually always deliver a good performance."Phone Booth" is not the type of thriller that will have you riding high on adrenaline or suspense, but it will keep you entertained in the sense that you want to know what happens next and see the outcome of the situation.And for a movie that didn't make use of a lot of locations and stages, then "Phone Booth" pulled it off quite well. I enjoyed this movie from start to end, and found it to be a rather interesting plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best message in a movie ever!!! (especially for this generation)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILMI saw phone booth in bits and pieces, whenever it came on star movies. I became curious. My mom always commented about the intensity and Suspense this movie was bringing up. So my dad and I bought the DVD Later. Dad was reluctant to buy it because; it was a onetime watch. Then I finally saw the film a lot later. The movie was fantastic in a way, because of its message, which is completely necessary for the present generation. That is "Don't you dare cheat on your Partners/spouses. Especially if he/she loves you madly" I felt like applauding at this idea. This film was about a man, a Publicist names Stu Sheppard (Colin Farrell) who makes up a life by Selling out lies. He keeps mentioning that he has world famous actors For friends and keeps lying to colleagues and add more lies to hide the Others. Thus he looks pretty cool, rich and expensive before everyone that even his assistant wanted to step into his shoes. The worst part of his life is that he is an having an affair with another woman and the fact that he is married is unknown to her. Things were going as he wanted until he answered the phone that rang in a booth where he always visited to call his girlfriend Pam(Katie Holmes).The caller(Kiefer Sutherland) puts him in a position where he has to offer special obligation for Stu to even breath normally.The movie is unique in every way. I didn't feel like getting up even for a second until the movie was over. It has the suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The movie takes place within a single locality so literally I am not surprised that they have managed to finish the whole thing within just 12 days. I even wondered if Colin Farrell got tired of standing the whole time. It was pretty confusing on whether the caller was really a super villain. He is and he is not. He is because he caused a lot of problem to the people, police and damaged the property. He killed the pizza guy at the end. He is not a super villain because in a way Stu deserves what he got. He was lying to everyone about him, especially his poor wife and girlfriend, so this caller whoever he is cured him of this weakness. And the people this man killed like the pedophile and the business man deserves to die. Then there is Leon, he deserves what he got as he was a pimp.I was not happy with the fact that there was too much swear words used though. But yeah i am pretty this film will highlight on how terrible it is to be in the big circle of lies.Joel Schumacher's direction was really nice. He had a nice vision about the whole thing. He managed to show the seriousness of the situation. I can't imagine anyone other than Colin Farrell in the place of Stu Shepard, the guy who initially shows off and then falls on his knees begging. He has a great talent and should actually do better films than substandard ones like Alexander, Swat etc. Forrest Whitaker shines really well as a frustrated police officer who himself went through a divorce. This was the movie where I actually started noticing him followed by panic room. Radha Mitchelle's character was very nice as Stu's wife. She loved him so much that she had absolutely no hesitation in forgiving Stu for cheating on her. She was also worried about him during the whole episode. Katie perhaps became famous after phone booth. The real crown was Kiefer Sutherland's voice. My dad and I were confused on who's voice was the best among Kiefer Sutherlan, Liam Neeson, Sam Worthington, Morgan Freeman and Harrison Ford.He had the creepiness, the humor and evilness in his voice as he talked thought the phone. He performed basically with his voice alone. He hardly appeared for three minutes at the end. That is another attraction of this film.I hear mixed reviews, Some find this film silly, other stupid, some say that it is epic, then some loves this film. My best suggestion is that it is definitely worth a watch. You will be in the edge of your seat. Afterall it highlights a good message on relationship with your spouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Thriller That Would've Fallen Into Mediocrity Had It Not Been for Collin Farrel and Kiefer Sutherland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been told that "Phone Booth" was a movie I just had to see. It had been shoved down my throat so much, I almost didn't want to see it for a while. But when I finally saw a copy for rent, I didn't hesitate to grab it and finally see what I had been missing out on. And I have definitely been missing out."Phone Booth" is about Stu Sheppard, a Public Relations agent who is the smoothest in his business. He knows exactly how to pull everyone's strings and how to work his way around everything. But everything comes crashing down on him one day when he picks the wrong phone booth, and now he's being held captive inside the booth by a sniper who want's Stu to be punished. Now, Stu must find a way out of this crazy hostage situation without getting himself or his loved ones killed. It's a simple and also very clever premise, and those are always some of the smarter ones in my opinion.Collin Farrell headlines as Stu, the suave businessman who knows all the tricks. Within five minutes, we know this character and you're laughing along with how well this guy can play people. He's a master of lies and you love to watch him work his art. The only thing that sucks is that it's confined to the first five minutes of the movie. After that, he becomes a nervous and frantic wreck. Collin Farrell completely knew how to do this character, and this is my favorite performance I've seen him do yet, aside from Bullseye in "Daredevil". But this truly is Collin's film and he carries the entire thing. He really gets to shine, and I find it kind of sad that he hasn't gotten the status I think he deserves until now, with him starring in the remake of "Total Recall".Kiefer Sutherland plays the anonymous sniper holding Stu captive. He talks to Stu through the phone the whole movie, and he has such a smooth and villainous voice. He's one of those classy, intelligent villains that have thought of every scenario and are completely in charge. Those are the villains that I find really intimidating and intriguing. Another great thing about the sniper is you don't know his motivation for doing this. It gives him a good level of mystery that really makes you think during the film.Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker are also in this movie. Katie Holmes plays Kim, a client of Stu's, who Stu wants to sleep with. Her character could've been played by anyone else, because she only gets about three minutes of screen time, but I guess the studio figured they needed more big names in the movie. And that's also where Forest Whitaker comes in. He plays a police captain. Nothing special here at all. Shallow, uninteresting, and I really don't care about him at all. There's also a younger Richard T. Jones in the movie as a cop. I will never forget him as Agent Ellison from "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles". Just a funny little side note."Phone Booth" is a great thriller. While some audiences may think that the whole thing being confined to one space is a negative, in my opinion, it's the most wonderful thing about the film and really helps the film have it's unique place in cinema history. The film is well paced and well-acted, with a sinister villain and a great lead. It's not even an hour and a half, but I don't think the writer could have put anything more into the film than there is without making it feel like there's too much going on. The film is a great time and I will definitely be buying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I can't really get into much detail, as there isn't going to be much going on. Joel Schumacher is a really bad director in my opinion, albeit a few decent films. When I first heard of this one, I passed it off as just another wanna-be thriller that contains no substance or depth. And the overall film itself looked exactly like a Joel Schumacher film, so that's that.. But you know that feeling you get, where your vulnerable and find yourself wanting to watch anything to at least give you *some* entertainment? This was me, three days ago. I wanted to watch something that would provide a twist, even if it came across clich or stupid. I was the complete antonym of relentlessness..So I watched it. Can't say I didn't hated it.. But can't say I liked it either...Phone Booth was that kind of film I wanted to get into. Cheap thrills and some comedic moments as well. The acting was cheap and wooden at times, but I was surprised to find that Collin Ferrell's performance wasn't too bad, especially in the scenes where he follows the man beyond the phone. The plot was new, hasn't been done before. But that gives it no reason to be clichd as points, and also a bit stupid. (the whole hooker part, really?) And the twist? Really? It wasn't expecting that overall "shock factor" that some classics give to you, but Phone Booth seemed to be lazy in it's writing. It just seemed a little silly, and also a bit clich. The man behind the phone wasn't that guy, it was this guy. Fade to black; credits roll. Haven't seen that before. And although I keep bashing it like I mean it, it isn't the worse film of all time. It was entertaining and fast-paced, but should be no way with a high point average such as 7.1! I recommend for the vulnerable feeling I was feeling. If there isn't any other movies to watch, and you're dying to pure boredom, I was suggest watching this; as it provides for your feelings. But the whole film as a whole? As an art? One word: forgettable..5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last film I saw that utilized an actor's voice with such passion, fear, and excellence was Ted Levine's character, Rusty Nail, a truck driving psychopath destine for revenge, in the 2001 horror film Joy Ride. Along comes Phone Booth, a superb claustrophobic thriller from a director more than capable of delivering one. It packs all the vital pieces to construct a thriller from the ground up, and most importantly, never feels heavy-handed, slow, or noneventful. It also doesn't feel boastful, occupying a very short runtime of eighty minutes. Anymore and it would feel like a merciless exercise.Apparently, Phone Booth was delayed for several months because of fear it would spark controversy because of the Beltway sniper attacks happening all over Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virgina, acts I remember scaring me half to death to the point of me not wanting to go out in public. I think the perfect time to release this would've been in the eighties or nineties, when phone booths were big. The film knows that the premise is a bit shaky in 2003, mainly because it keeps referencing cell phones and how they're becoming the normal everyday thing, unlike phone booths. While it would've been best suited for a release a few decades ago, it still is perfectly acceptable in the present.What we get is an intense, devious, and relentlessly entertaining flick that works on every level. Our main character is Stu Sheppard (Farrell) a cocky, arrogant publicist who is debating on cheating on his wife with a young actress he has as a client. Because he is aware his wife checks his cell phone for messages, Stu goes into a phone booth to call the woman. Upon ending his conversation with her, the phone in the booth rings and Stu picks it up by a force of habit.The caller (voiced stupendously by Kiefer Sutherland) says he has a sniper pointing at his head and that if he hangs up the phone he will be killed immediately. The man knows Stu, his past, his wife, the girl he's cheating with, and pretty much every detail about him. He wants him to confess to both his wife and the actress that he has been unfaithful, but it's difficult to do that when you're being bombarded with threats from not only a caller, but some loud-mouth prostitutes who soon call over their pimp.Being that this is a film that takes place mostly in one standard setting, screenwriter Larry Cohen had a real challenge on his hands to write as much dialog as he could for Farrell and Sutherland to share. Not to mention, director Joel Schumacher, who already made the excellent Falling Down, had to find a way to direct the phone booth and Farrell themselves without the film feeling like a never-ending exercise of monotony. There are multiple picture-in-picture shots of different angles capturing the New York City, technically Los Angeles, metropolitan area.While the visuals are fantastic, the truly remarkable aspects, besides the writing and directing which never seem boring or clich, are Collin Farrell's Stu and the caller himself. Farrell has a character that needs to act mainly in subtleties. For example, when Forest Whitaker, playing a cop, tries to get him to come out of the phone booth and piece together the details of this event, he begins to somehow know that Stu is in a lot of danger and that caller may not be the "psychiatrist" Stu says he is. Farrell and Whitaker need to communicate almost telepathically, and the result is very favorable.The caller himself is fantastic. Never would I have chosen Kiefer Sutherland to voice an unseen sniper. His voice is calm, fearless, authoritative, and manipulative. He means business and in his world, death is an option.Phone Booth is a terrific film in every sense of the word. The only thing I think it's missing is larger roles for its female characters. The wife and the actress seem to have such a big impact on Stu's decision making, but the downside is we never really hear too much about them or discover the real reason why Stu is cheating. Regardless, that aspect doesn't cloud the evidence that shows this is truly one of the best claustrophobic thrillers in many years.Starring: Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, and Kiefer Sutherland. Directed by: Joel Schumacher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people don't know it, but Joel Schumacher is actually quite a talented director. He'll never live down the embarrassment of 'Batman &amp; Robin' but since then he has had two films that are top notch productions. 'Tigerland' is one. This is the other. Schumacher and Colin Farrell re team for the second time (Farrell also starred in 'Tigerland', his breakout role) and really ratchet up the tension with a free-fall thriller that goes for broke at a breakneck pace. The story moves incredibly fast at a brisk 80 minutes or so, stopping a scant few times to try to develop some character moments. There's no time for silly subplots or excess narrative, which is one of the film's strong points. The performances are at the very least pretty decent. There are some ham-fisted moments among the tension, mostly from Farrell, but he does do a nice job of carrying the picture since he's in virtually 99% of the movie. Keifer Sutherland is sufficiently menacing and acerbic as the mysterious sniper/caller, although he sometimes sounds like Jeremy Irons' character Scar from 'The Lion King.' The ending is well done and doesn't lead to a silly action chase or dumb set-piece where the hero goes after the bad guy, which would have blown the whole movie completely. Congrats to Schumacher for making a small, claustrophobic film with some nice acting. It does have some silly dialogue at times, as well as a few lapses of logic, but it doesn't overstay its welcome and will remain known as a fast, cheap and rather effective exercise in small-scale suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do find Schumacher's films hit(Veronica Guerin) and miss(Batman and Robin), but the premise of Phone Booth seemed interesting, so I checked the film out. It was interesting and entertaining, but the script is sketchy with not much development to character, the ending is predictable and the story has several interesting and suspenseful moments but feels rushed towards the end. However, it is stylishly filmed, with some great camera work especially, Schumacher's direction is efficient and the soundtrack is compliments Phone Booth very well. The acting also helps lift, Colin Farell is very good and Forest Whittacker is solid as usual but the star turn was Kiefer Sutherland who was suitably malevolent as the caller. Overall, entertaining and mostly good. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth drops in on a glib, faithless Broadway media spokesperson who is using the last phone booth in Manhattan when he's entrapped by a sniper. The shooter seems to play either God, calling for a confession, or the filmmakers, taking their voyeuristic vengeance on publicists, and exercising an all-out impulse of the most excited voyeuristic urges and idiosyncrasies. The movie turns out to be a discourse between three very vivid present-tense characterizations, but it's Farrell's to make or break, because he's on screen literally the entire time, and he gives vigor and force to every shot. But every shot puts that pressure on him. We see an utterly ubiquitous array of perspectives, from the magnified sight of a sniper rifle to a screen split into two or more, sometimes way more, to fish eye lenses to news cameras. The shameful skeletons Farrell's desperate closet are being mercilessly forced into a feast of a thousand eyes and ears.The man as whom Farrell explodes with nerves in those cross hairs is Stu Shepard, who we've already seen stomping the streets, fibbing into his cell phone, scolding his miserable minion. Why does he now use a pay phone rather than his cell? Because he's calling his mistress, Pamela, and doesn't want the call to show on the bill his wife, Kelly, will see. The phone in the booth rings and Stu abides by the collective human custom of answering it. The voice is callous, mocking, sounds like it belongs to a man clever and warped, and with a sense of humor.Throughout relentless action that plays out for little longer than an hour and fifteen minutes, Stu will be attempting to stop the voice from pulling the trigger. The voice seems to know a lot about Stu, those delicate skeletons, but also things anyone could see, like the way he impolitely treated a pizza delivery man. He seems to feel that Stu is a blameworthy man who ought to die, and might, unless he can talk or think his way out of his circumstances. Or, and Sutherland's ability to be sinister is so eerie it neither implies nor negates this, he just views these tiny figures down below like insects, vulnerable little things at the mercy of his magnifying glass. Morality could just be his effortless tool with which he toys with this cocky ant. When you were a kid, didn't you sometimes break your toys, kill one, crash one, light it on fire?It's a very modest, efficient film. Schumacher is the director of several runaway successes, like two of the Batman pictures, but on occasion he leaves the big budgets behind. He shot Phone Booth on one set in 10 days. It's more or less a paranoid Twilight Zone-style microcosm, and it's not a shock to discover that Larry Cohen, the writer, created the concept decades ago, when there were still phone booths and morality plays. If the movie had been imagined in today's script development climate, Stu would've had a dose of hero worship in how economical he is with fidelity and the truth. As the predicament swells in pressure, anxiety and suspense, he develops a connection with Capt. Ramey, a cop played with a charming vulnerability by Forest Whitaker, practiced in hostage situations who initially thinks Stu may be the predator and not the prey. The two actors have to interconnect nonverbally to keep the intimidatingly observant sniper from realizing what's going on between them, and it's thrilling to watch them figuring that out.For the voice of his sniper, Schumacher acutely taps the key to Kiefer Sutherland's talent, having collaborated before in The Lost Boys and A Time to Kill, and here takes the mostly concealed role as a fantastically valuable good deed for Schumacher, for if the voice doesn't work, neither does the movie. It does. The way Sutherland teases Stu and just can't help but break into sadistic laughter in that unmistakable hoarse voice is something that will always get under my skin. He is the pure sadist manipulating all we see for his own gratification. "You know like in the movies just as the good guy is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun. Now why didn't he have it cocked? Because that sound is scary."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Booth" is predictable but good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone booths are a place where tourists and locals need to talk if they don't have a cell phone or for a secret purpose. But somewhere, on one street, married publicist Stu Shepherd {Colin Farrell} talks to his dream girl, Pam {Katie Holmes} on one of the last old fashioned booths in all of Midtown Manhattan. But then, the phone suddenly rings. Stu picks it up and a stranger calls to him and tell him to stay on the line. The stranger {Kiefer Sutherland} finds out Stu's secrets and information and then tries to get his and Stu's moment in the spotlight. Soon, before you believe it, Stuart is in for a long and terrified call. This is the set up for Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth". It's a little shallow but fun thriller about trying to invade the privacy of a person. Seeing it, I wondered that we don't know who to trust in real life, the stranger who is asking a question on the street, or the gritty beat of the streets that surrounds our cites, or the phone booths who many people put in coins to try to connect to people. I also thought that this movie couldn't focus on whether to become a real movie or a made for TV like production.Farrell, who has no trouble with his American voice and felt right at home with "Minority Report" {2002}, is strong right here as Stu but a little melodramatic. Holmes and Radha Mitchell as Stu's wife, Kelly are underused here. Forest Whitaker gives a strong and understanding side to his character, the Police Captain. But the movie's real star is Sutherland. He's really and truly a smart and though provoking villain of trickery that reminded me of Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in "Die Hard".Schumacher's direction is a lightweight but documentary-style effort. Larry Cohen's script is both second-rate and developed with little character development. If I was Cohen, I should have took out a subplot that involved hookers trying to use the phone and let it stay focused on Stu and the stranger. Matthew Libatique's camera work is fast paced and the split scenes that he provided help support the story. The opening sequence feel too stylish and the ending is cloying and predictable.At the near-end, Stu gives a saddening monologue about his life and secrets that shows an example of a character trying to make the right thing before deciding his doom. It gives a message that we must think what to do with our lives before trying to make it to the top. This film is not a tired exercise in our time, but I decided to give it a mixed recommendation anyway. My Pick: Yellow Light {Think about it}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young man answers a public phone in an open space in New York City. A voice tells him that a rifle with a telescopic sight and silencer is trained on him and that he must do whatever he's told or he'll be killed. He does what he's told.It's the kind of dumb idea that sounds as if it might have made a good half-hour episode on "The Twilight Zone." But actually it succeeds in generating a lot of tension.The man trapped in the booth is Colin Farrell, a shallow show-biz promoter who is married to the skinny but seductive Radha Mitchell and is, at the same time, boning another girl, Katie Holmes. He's a shallow and sinful moron whose chief interest is in Italian shirts and self aggrandizement.At first, Farell laughs off the pronouncements coming from the phone. (The voice is that of Kiefer Sutherland.) He thinks it's some disgruntled ex client making idle threats. POW. A silent bullet strikes down a burly man nearby. The passers by scream and run for cover, believing that Farrell shot the man. The police, led by Forest Whitaker, are called in and Farrell is soon surrounded by dozens of cops with pistols and assault rifles all aimed at his head. The television cameras are on him and his image is soon broadcast all over the city, bringing his wife and his girl friend rushing to the scene. All this does is add a couple of additional possible targets.What can the Voice of Sutherland possibly be getting out of all of this? I mean -- what does he WANT? The voice hems and haws, enjoying the unfolding moment, cackling once in a while, taunting Farrell in his helplessness.Ultimately, it turns out that The Voice knows just about everything that Farrell has done wrong and this humiliating and fearful trap is part of his punishment. The Voice might as well be that of Yahweh himself, the Old Testament God with the bad temper, who kicked Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden and banished them to the Land of Nod.The punishment really is bothersome too. Farrell shifts abruptly from the smooth-talking snake-oil salesman to a man genuine afraid his head will be blown off at any moment. Boy, does he sweat good.But that formula is limited in extent. Farrell can only sweat and twitch so often, and Sutherland can only shoot so many people without giving the game away.So The Voice becomes that of the New Testament, offering a chance at redemption and, perhaps, forgiveness. All Farrell has to do is lean out the door of the phone booth and shout his sins to the avidly listening crowd. The booth has turned into a confessional. Farrell complies, but not to please Sutherland. Rather, because he wants to get it all off his chest anyway.Ha ha, says The Voice (and the viewer). Farrell is going to have his frontal lobes removed anyway -- except that the quick-witted Whitaker has figured out what's up, that there's a sniper in one of the windows surrounding the public square.The ending leaves room for a sequel. If there were ever any doubt that this was no more than a successful thriller with commercial aims, that open ending should resolve it. I guess there was never a true sequel. What would a sequel look like? Sutherland traps Farrell in a public phone booth TWICE? And then has him do one hundred demi plies while the crowd stares and twits him? Then he moons the crowd? So -- no. No sequel exactly. Just an imitation: "Liberty Stands Still" (2002) with Linda Fiorentino on a cell phone, handcuffed to a fast food cart in a crowded public square.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Hitchcock were alive today he'd be kicking himself that he never thought of this simple but terrifying premise. Because it's definitely him. The good news is; it's unlikely that he'd make a better job of it.Bizarre psycho murderers have become so common on the movie menu that I'm inclined to give a big yawn whenever they show up. And I made a start with this one. But I stopped.An arrogant young snot walking past a phone booth when its phone starts ringing, steps inside to answer and finds it's for him. The caller is a stranger who knows all about his life. But the real bad news is that he has a sniper-rifle with a telescopic sight, pointed right at him. If he steps outside - he's dead. Moreover, if he doesn't do pretty well anything he's told to do - he's also dead. Terrifying, definitely bizarre, but it's oh so simple.Our schmuck is put through seven circles of hell as all manner of peripheral events impose upon his plight. The psycho at the other end of the line just plays him like a tune.The most disappointing element of the movie is that the only person we get to know well is the schmuck in the booth, and he's a ruthless, two-timing, spineless snot. It's very hard to empathise with him. Everyone else, including his wife, girlfriend, sundry police-officers, hookers, pimps and the like just fit certain predetermined character profiles and nothing else. They're competent, but they're not people we get to care about.The premise of this movie is so simple, and allows for such an economy of scale in terms of movie creation that the idea is a piece of genius. More alarming, however, is that this could actually happen. Even if the loony-on-the-line didn't know all about you and wasn't an electronics wizard; reprising this plot in the real world would be just as easy and economical. All that would be needed would be to know the number of a phone booth within line-of-sight, ring and wait till somebody - anybody - answered. Then give them a real bad day. I'm surprised there hasn't been a copycat.This is tense, suspenseful, often unpredictable in detail, highly original, and dead simple. If character development had been more detailed and sympathetic; it would have been a classic. Otherwise that is its fatal flaw.At least for an interim, I suspect this movie did for telephone boxes, what 'Fatal Attraction' did for one-night stands. I found it ultimately predictable in denouement and a wee bit disappointing, but it was a brave effort nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the movie has only 1 shot to sell! But what's amazing about it is that the shot of the booth keeps you glued to your seats, always pondering on a heap of questions. While you take your time to go through them, here, the villain, keeps you busy watching the film. He only has a voice in the film, except at last where he shows himself up, still I'd say, his acting is GOOD! Mysterious, killer voice, perfectly suited for the role. The main role is also portrayed very well, and as the film advances, we get to know each and every ounce of his character, both bad and good. His acting deserves a praise. A good mystery.

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer to this movie, I was intrigued to see it. Mainly because I wanted to know how entertaining a movie can be, when it mainly centers around a phone booth. And it was a lot more entertaining and intriguing to watch than I expected it to be. Colin Farrell put on a good show, but the real star in this is Kiefer Sutherland "The Caller", he mainly plays the voice mostly but his character is still charismatic and intimidating to the point he really grabbed my attention with his dialogue. For a movie that was shot in 10 days with a very low budget, it really proves that you don't need a huge budget to make a entertaining and interesting movie. The exchange of dialogue in this is well done and will keep most audience on the edge and even suspenseful at times, even menacing. The story is basically about a antihero playing mind games with a egotistical publicist and it's blended in very well. There are some questions that is unanswered but for a film like this, it's sort of a good thing. The pacing of this is well done as well.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonably Suspenseful But With A Weak Premise And An Unsatisfying Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is full of suspense. In that way, I liked it very much. The story was interesting and lent itself to keeping the viewers' attention with the most simple of plots. A man (played by Colin Farrell) picks up a ringing payphone and gets caught up in a nightmare - the guy on the other end of the line is a sniper who threatens to kill him unless he stays on the line and does exactly as he's told. So, it's a simple movie - set almost entirely in and around this phone booth. That in this era of blockbusters was quite refreshing. The guy on the other end of the phone also knew a lot about Stu - here the story started to fall down a bit. The movie never identifies who the sniper is or explains the connection between him and Stu. That left me a bit bewildered (and, frankly, feeling a bit empty) as this came to an end. I'm not convinced that this wouldn't have been an even better movie without the obvious (but unexplained) connection between Stu and the sniper. There was a pretty good performance from Forest Whittaker as the cop in charge once the police show up on the scene after the sniper shoots a man but everyone assumes that Stu did it, and you feel for Stu's impossible situation as he tries to convince the police that he didn't shoot anyone and he's not armed, but he can't leave the phone booth (because if he does, the sniper will open fire.) So, even though I thought the story could have been improved, there was a lot here I liked.Here, though, is my biggest problem with this movie. It's all based on the assumption of the sniper that Stu would answer a ringing pay phone. The sniper narrates this with the words "a ringing phone has to be answered." Really? Over the years I've seen pay phones ringing with no one answering them. So, this was too convenient a plot device. Frankly - the narration aside - had Stu done what most people would have done and simply not answered the ringing pay phone, there would have been no story! It made the rest of the movie - even though there was a lot of it that I liked - seem a bit preposterous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the get-go, Phone Booth pulls you into it's claustrophobic booth of thrilling drama that chills you to the bone. Kiefer Sutherland gives an outstanding performance as The Caller and is unrecognizable until you see his name on screen. Overshadowed by Kiefer is Colin Farrell in the shoes of the audience and his acting is so brilliant that your heart races along with his every second. Underneath the two leads comes an underrated actor in Forest Whitaker (who is such an amazing actor in too many roles to name), as the Captain of NYPD.In a movie of this nature, one set can make the audience feel claustrophobic and closed in. That's exactly what you're supposed to feel and you're supposed to feel like Stu Sheppard -trapped in a Phone Booth in a ride for his life. It's a cheap tactic for making a movie low budget, but the writers and actors were able to go beyond B-movie material and make it memorable and worth while.It's also not your run-of-the-mill "Hollywood" happy ending. To a more modern day audience this film will remind many people of "Saw" (2004) and The Caller has the likes of "Jigsaw". Speaking of audiences, it's got some offensive material and language and some disturbing violence. I would keep this film away from anyone under 14.It's a great film on many levels, but just a small lack of realism takes away from it's ability to be a perfect ten, as well, it's got nearly zero comic relief and is very tense and stiff from the first five minutes and really doesn't let up from there till the last frame. It's a mature film and intended for mature audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first hour of the movie is very exciting and you truly sit on the edge of your seat. Colin Farrell really does make you feel nervous for him, so that is why the movie gets some stars. BUT, the ending is just awful. To bring in some unknown character who is the bad guy, and have him walk away is disappointing. the movie leaves you guessing what his motive was, and the part of the pizza guy is just plain stupid. I was also disappointed by the way his wife so easily forgave him. She seemed to have no problem with him cheating on her. Need some more character development from people not named Stu.Just another thing to add, the hookers in the beginning are just flat out annoying. People don't act like that. If you see someone making a phone call, and at the time he had only been in there for a few minutes, you don't get annoyed and attack the booth. That just made no sense. So to sum up, it was at time exciting to watch, but the ending was so bad, and the movie was much worse than the trailer made it seem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been hearing about this one for a long time, hearing that it was a movie about a guy in a phone booth that actually managed to stay exciting and gripping throughout a 90 minute run time. So I sat down to watch it, challenging it to amaze me, thinking it wasn't possible for this movie to be any good. Well, it is. It isn't amazing, per se, but it's a lot better than I feared it would be. Phone Booth actually does manage to keep the viewer interested for a solid 90 minutes, even though the characters might be a bit wooden and stock-like. The suspense is good and the dialogue is good too. My only real problem with this is that it's a bit too short and blunt, trying to be this dark psychological thriller, but only half succeeding. It doesn't go far enough into depth with the characters to really make any big statements about humankind, do anything new or blow anybody away. Phone Booth is a very entertaining little flick anyway, though, so check it out if you want something fun for a Friday night at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart and watchable thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a movie that keeps you thinking what's going to happen next and keeps your eyes as wide open as possible. One thing you won't do watching this film is fall asleep or get bored. It's an adrenaline filled and rushed thriller that's full of smart conversations and witty remarks, (not to mentions the annoying hookers.) Colin Farrell does a great job of playing the main character who is trapped in a phone booth. Forest Whitaker also does a perfect job in his supporting role by providing a great cop-like performance. Phone Booth is an excellent thrill ride that soon won't be forgotten. And did I mention Kiefer Sutherland is the caller who traps Colin Farrell's character in the phone booth by giving him orders and by threatening him if he doesn't follow orders he dies? Phone Booth is a spectacular thriller filled with many great moments, kudos for the writers for taking such a small idea and expounding upon it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been something to last. It had a really interesting concept behind it, but who made it blew it. I suppose a great deal of responsibility should be given to Schumacher. He is incompetent, he drifts with the tide, he makes whatever he feels the audiences will consume more easily, and he doesn't really care about cinema or how he should build with a visual basis. His films work to me as visual pollution, his strategy is to fill the eye with all sorts of images in order to overcome the lack of his own ideas.Nevertheless, some good things were lost here: This was, in a way, the opposite of what Hitchcock did in Rear Window. That was a masterpiece, because he placed us inside the eye of the viewer, and the world of the film is everything he is able to see. No more, no less. Except for a very few special shots, we get the world in the same measure Stewart gets it. That was specially well done, and the story unfolds visually. Here we had the opposite. The world is centered around one character, such as in Rear Window, but the way we see that world is precisely opposite, meaning that we don't get the world the way Farrell sees it (at least not so many times), we get Farrell from several angles and points of view: . the snipper, he is the closest to god we have here, he knows everything, including what led to the situation we see, he has the upper look, he controls the action, all the way; . the policeman, he makes his efforts to get to know things, in the beginning he is as clueless as everybody else, but he gets to learn some things; . the wife and the mistress, they are clueless about each other, and they know only what Farrell wants to tell them . the press, this is the entity which has to conclude, which has to pretend to try and know, but it's practically absent its participation here; We had these 4 threads, plus the personal version of Farrell. This is so well explored by cinema, how to explore several narrative threads, starting with Citizen Kane, and following with a number of important or merely interesting projects. This one gets lost with useless editing tricks, useless sound editing, useless fireworks. At least this time we don't get to check nipples in the hero's clothes.My opinion: 2/5 some interesting concepts, but dreadful executionhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great concept but it didn't hold together the energy. from the start to around when the cops showed up i was glued to the seat. But it needed a bigger twist or a more epic turn of events. Spike Lee held it together on get on the bus, with one scene just dialogue. It is possible very difficult. Phone booth started that way but didn't end that way. It started to look like they were stretching to fill the time and get to the end hook.But serious concept as i said the intro and the set-up all of that was really strong but it just fizzed out and didn't arc and exploded near the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I come home after doing some work and what do I see, my two friends infront of my TV raiding my DVD stand. One of them, who will remain nameless, plucked Phone Booth off the shelf, and after never watching it and only paying ?1 for the privlidge I had let it collect dust at the back. He put it in, and I watched. Never in a million years did I expect what I got. It was tense, deep, and relyed on the dialogue to continue the story, and by god, there was a story. Unusual for a modern Hollywood movie. Sutherland is a great bad guy who keeps sweet talking Farrel on his toes as he flings him reason after reason for him to end his life, not have I seen such a great performance of a voice since Jeremy Irons in Die Hard with a Vengeance, playing Simon the bomber. You want a great, real time, suspenseful movie. Watch this. But be warned, you want huge set pieces and car chases, this movie is not it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only recently become a Colin Farrell fan not initially based on his movie performances but recent interviews - my favorite being the interview on the Today Show where he calls Matt Lauer "glib" in reference to Lauer's interview with Tom Cruise ( I will refrain from commenting on Mr.Cruise at this juncture). I have seen At Home at the End of the World and Minority Report. I bought Phone Booth after reading several reviews here and I really liked it- not never ending love- but a strong like. My impression of the movie is that it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful story that kept you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. If I am right, it did its job. Other reviewers mentioned a twist at the end, but it didn't feel very twisty to me. It was entertaining, very effective escapist stuff. Definitely made me forget about my day at the office. And does Keifer Sutherland have the perfect psycho nut job voice or what? I loved Colin Farrell's performance, I really believed that he was the integrity impaired PR person that he played, and I really believed that the experience in the phone booth made him want to mend his ways- for a couple of hours at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining roller coaster ride loaded with morals, some plausible others far fetched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's The Phone Booth is an entertaining roller coaster ride, a fast paced thriller loaded with morals, some plausible others far fetched.Collin Farell as Stu Shephard is the main character in a film that is practically set on one scenario: a phone booth, the last one in Manhattan. In the world of public relationships, business, change of credit cards, you name it, a man like Shephard is the king. He represents the inter-medium between half truths and public lies. He is a man without compassion, able to not pay his colleagues, lie at any price and sell his soul to the devil of public relationships. He is the perfect guy to threaten for truth He removes his marriage ring for a couple of minutes very mid day from the same booth to talk to his young (Katie Holmes) woman who is aspiring to be an actress, giving her false hopes about becoming a star. But someone seems to be aware of Shephard's ways. This guy is cold minded, capable of putting into great difficulties a man with a growing feeling of guilt, a fact perhaps overly underlined by Larry Cohen's screenplay. The phone booth of New York rings. Somebody must pick up the phone and Shephard is to close to ignore it. The guy behind the phone is the sniper, and he wants Shephard to confess his sins or get shot.The plot almost belongs to a short feature film but Schumacher does a great job of conserving the only scenario (with the exception of some scenes where we see the police) without ever being dull. This is partly due to the great verbal exchange between the victim and the sniper. The sniper's voice suggests a strong presence, a sadistic but mesmerizing tone. "Do you see the tourists with their video cameras, hoping the cops will shoot so that they sell the tape?", he says in one of the film's best moments. Collin Farell offers enough fast talk, gestures of fear and regret to bring his character to life, which is all the more compelling considering he is basically talking to a mouthpiece for the most part. The ever tightening camera work does a great job of increasingly adding to the tension.With this film, I can see what Schumacher was trying to do: to criticise without pity a society filled with adultery, racism and hypocrites (everything Shephard represents) who do not see that they are the deciders of their own destinies. The film's weakest point is the sniper's motive which is closer to morality than the ethic of behaviour which united with some fancy words, reduces some of the film to some very basic moral objectives that even a five year old could understand. But as a whole, this is a film worth watching just to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the thriller that started it all for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I first watched Phone Booth (I'm a younger guy), I was so impressed with the thriller genre so much that I went back and watched the thriller classics and the thrillers that have come out since. Phone Booth was probably the first movie that I truly wanted to watch in my life, and I got my wish, and it did not disappoint.Phone Booth stars Colin Farrell, who gives a remarkable performance in his first shot at a lead role. A lot of people have knocked Farrell in the past for his wisecracking roles in Minority Report and S.W.A.T., but this is Farrell's best performance. Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a New York publicist who is living a life of lies and deceit, promising clients big things, yet he is unable to follow through on those promises (we glance Ben Foster in the beginning as one of Stu's clients). Stu is also leading a young and beautiful actress (Katie Holmes; Batman Begins, Dawson's Creek) down this deceitful path, hoping she'll sleep with him, forcing an affair with his wife (Radha Mitchell; Melinda &amp; Melinda, Silent Hill).Just when it's getting nice for Stu and his assistant, Adam (Keith Nobbs; Double Whammy), Stu decides to use a phone booth to call Pam (Katie Holmes), since his wife checks his cell phone's calls. After a probably amusing scene involving a pizza man, Stu hears the phone ringing, and he answers it. It is a man, who is simply known as The Caller. Over time, The Caller explains his intentions: Stu must confess that his entire life is a lie, or die. Well, Stu, being the arrogant man he is, blows the guy off. After a showdown with a few prostitute strippers and a pimp, Stu realizes that The Caller is not kidding. From this point on, he is held hostage in his phone booth by The Caller, who could be anywhere....The police arrive, and it's here we see the only person that may be able to save Stu, the police Leutinent (Forest Whitaker; The Shield).Phone Booth takes place in real time, one of the few movies that actually does that well. The Caller's voice is just menacing and evil, and it comes as no surprise that he is Kiefer Sutherland, who has one of the scariest voices I've ever heard when angry. Sutherland is incredible in this movie, because you'll be scared of him without seeing him. He is in total control of Stu throughout the film. Forest Whitaker does well as Stu's negotiator, being a likable character that you also hate when you first meet him. Katie Holmes and Radha Mitchell don't really have a ton of lines, but each performs well, but Mitchell is better. She is the more important character, and her lines are delivered with passion, worry, and emotion every time. Finally, Colin Farrell's Stu Shepard is a phenomenal character, so well-rounded, so mysterious, yet so likable. Stu is a good person, but he's just made some not so good choices, which The Caller exploits.Joel Schumacher filmed Phone Booth in 12 days (10 days of the booth, 2 of other surroundings and other scenes), yet this does not deteriorate the film in any way. I was just ready to trust him after the disasters known as Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, and he delivered a powerful thriller that you'll watch time and time again, and it never gets boring...Have fun...9/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phone Booth, or Joy Ride?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW While the actual idea of the movie sounded cool, we were granted with another case of 'bad directing'. I forget who directed this film, but the guy was an idiot. Horrible directing brought down the quality of the movie.Several times, during phone conversations, a rectangular box would be displayed in one of the screen's corners, showing the person on the other end. This was kind of lame, because often times I felt that I was watching a Verizon commercial instead of an R-rated movie. Jerky, moving camera angles also kind of made me ill due to the motion sickness.The directing wasn't the only thing that was bad, however. As far as the acting goes, nobody really did a good job. Colin did alright, I guess. But, the voice acting of the sniper on the phone was horrid. I say this especially when he got mad and was yelling; it was more laughable than anything.The screenplay also wasn't very good. While the plot synopsis sounded interesting, they ruined the story by going for the stereotypical suspense movie 'twists' that were by far predictable and rather silly. Upon leaving the theater, I couldn't help but feel that I had seen the movie before; but it wasn't deja vu. A few steps later, I realized that it was basically a carbon copy of Joy Ride.I don't mean to spoil anything, but if you've seen Joy Ride, you've already seen Phone Booth. A creepy guy who you don't see stalks somebody, telling them what to do otherwise he'll kill them, etc. The body count was the same too; WITH THE SAME PEOPLE DYING IN THE SAME ORDER AND TIMES. In fact, it even used the same 'twist' ending that the average moviegoer would have seen coming a mile away, especially if they've seen Joy Ride previously.It's a rental at best. BTW it shows the killer's face on the movie cover. Kinda defeats the purpose of when you're actually watching it and waiting till the end to finally see him. Oh well.FINAL RATING: 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say, that even though there are very few different locations in this film, and for the whole thing taking place in a phone booth, it's an outstanding movie. The kind of movie, that frustrates you at times, because you feel like you're right there with the actor.After making a phone call in a phone booth in a seedy area of New York city, Stu (Farrell), answers the telephone after it starts ringing. What he never imagined was that he should have never picked it up to begin with. The film circles around this one phone call, that changes a man's life in a matter of hours.Intense, a lot of language, and fear are among the many elements that arise in the film. It's a movie that I will watch more than twice in my life, and will soon be added to my collection of films. It's in my top 20 for best films this past year, and I hope you'll check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He sounded like? mid-thirties"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stu Sheppard (Farrell) is a fast talking, charismatic, businessman who is forever making deals on his mobile phone. He is cheating everyone; is awkward, eager-to-please assistant, his clients and his wife. Stu stops at an antiquated Manhattan phone booth to chat to his mistress (Holmes). But their planned get together is foiled by a mysterious caller (Sutherland, in an almost unseen role) who is holding Stu captive in this cramped phone booth and threatens to kill him if he doesn't come clean about his sins. After the caller shoots a pimp from an unknown location, the people around believe that Stu himself has shot the man. Things escalate from there; dozens of police and TV crews are eager to know Stu's motives, but little do they know that it in fact an angel of death, brandishing a high-tech gun, which has their fate in his hands. There is pretentiousness and self-indulgence about the caller which I found extremely irritating. The irony that he is cleansing people's sins by committing far worse ones, I found incomprehensible; was it deliberate or just a discrepancy? This is not the only element of the film which I found unconvincing, Stu's wife's motives for example. After she has seen her husband distressed and surrounded by police, she decides to go and chat to the media. Not only that, but she apparently checks Stu's phone bill, what does this say about her? Another plot-hole we are supposed to believe, is that the caller has supposedly set up dozens of microphones throughout the phone booth, in the middle of a Manhattan street, the busiest city in the western world, but no one noticed. Also, we are meant to believe that the gun the killer owns can fire from so many different angles. Notice as the pimp is close to the phone booth how the little red laser pointer is hovering over his heart when he is facing the phone booth, and the caller is apparently aiming from behind and from the other side of the street. How can a gun aim around corners? This film is also quite misogynistic. All the women in this film are foul mouthed street prostitutes, bimbos or complete idiots. Stu's wife is incredibly thick, "He sounded like? mid-thirties" need I say more. As for Stu's mistress, she is obviously just using his publicity skills to get her in the out of cattle-calls and in to the spotlight. Joel Schumacher, I've never been a fan of. From the clichd TIGER LAND to the sentimental VERONICA GUERIN. But PHONE BOOTH succeeds in disappointing me the most. He uses novel split screens and the like, which just amounts in run of the mill, pedestrian and generic Hollywood crap. For me, the only (and I do mean ONLY) redeeming feature is Colin Farrell's performance, which proves that he can act, but just has awful taste in scripts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phonebooth is a great film from a not so credible director, Schumacher. Here Schumacher veers away from his clich type films of 8mm or Batman &amp; Robin and brings some originality to the suspense genre. Phonebooth has one set and it doesn't not go anywhere throughout the film, however it is amazing how intense and entertaining this film is. The performances are pretty good, i was convinced with Farrell in the lead, much better than his only average performance in Alexander. Sutherland and Whitaker were also impressive in this film.

Okay, the language really starts to annoy you, but thats a typical Colin Farrell. Also, the scene where Stu and his wife look at the body of the pizza guy, Stu should have realized that the voice of the pizza guy doesn't match Kiefer Sutherland's husky voice. Colin Farrell's acting is as usual: an arrogant fella who needs a head exam, and Kiefer Sutherland is playing his role as the Caller to his utmost evilest and should be commended, but Forest Whitaker should have been replaced by a talking plank, and that would have been better. That fact aside, this is a great movie and should not be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

I wish I could blame the script or the director, but unfortunately, she's like that in many of her other movies.Whether you think the villain, Sutherland, is crazy or sane in this movie, I think you'll agree he pretty much steals the show - as a character and as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behold the unbelievable acting prowess of Katie Holmes!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The release of Phone Booth was delayed by Fox until April 4, due to the DC sniper attacks, because evidently everyone in the country forgets about such incidents after 6 months. But boy, had they released it within 5 months, I'm sure people would have been fuming. Phone Booth tells the story of Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) being pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper because he's a sleaze. Despite his marriage to Kelly (Radha Mitchell), he's been trying to get in the pants of Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes) pretty hard, but she's not interested because she's a prude. When he is blamed for killing a pimp, Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) and a bunch of police show up because Colin Farrell is obviously a pretty dangerous super-villain; they must have seen Daredevil. Katie Holmes once again gives a stunning performance. How any actress can pull off so much with a repertoire of three different facial expressions is amazing. Here's a little sample of her academy award potential: Stu calls Katie: crooked smile. Stu says something nice: bigger crooked smile. Stu is about to be shot by a sniper: distraught look (known to the laymen as 'just standing there').Joel Schumacher directs, the man who takes credit for cinematic feats like putting the nipples on Batman's batsuit, and film atrocities like Bad Company. Even though he pulls off Phone Booth rather well, Schumacher is kind of hit (Falling Down) or miss (most of the rest of his films). At least he never fled the country to avoid rape charges... Despite a limited set and cast, the movie is pretty good, and hey, if you don't like it, it's only 80 minutes long, so go get a pretzel or some popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give a second thought before answering that payphone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Collin Farrell an excellent star for the role of a cocky publicist gets greedy and has to have more then just a wife. This gets him into trouble when he has been followed day after day to make it to a payphone where he must call his "side project." We see his cocky attitude gets him into trouble in many ways. We get the feeling of this cocky attitude when we see him striding down the streets of New York City in the bright light, checking out every attractive female that walks by. Keifer Sutherland, another great actor plays the role of a sniper/enforcer. He has complete control in the film and has the power to do anything he wants from the birds eye view. Forest Whitaker, plays the role as the head cop in charge of the crime scene. His role is almost as this is normal for him and does this on a daily basis. He is trying to make the calls but due to the snipers power, we see Whitakers power accomplish nothing even though he is a NYPD officer. The city is full of people all over the streets and everything is going as normal, until it comes to a complete halt when we have the situation of Collin Farrell answering the phone. He is cocky on the phone and does not want to take any orders until it is proved that he is being watched and the sniper is not messing around. We get this as well when the hookers are heckling him for taking up the payphone as well. We don't really see Farrell's cockiness end until we see his wife show up along with the "side project." He now realizes that he has made a mistake and is looking out for the best of his wife so she too is not shot. This is a great film full of action and suspense even up to the last minute when we see Farrell in the back of the ambulance. His cockiness is injured and has almost cost him his life. He realizes this and maybe now will make some wiser decisions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell Has Officially Frozen Over--A Joel Schumacher Film I Don't Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one wanted to hate "Phone Booth" more than me, since I absolutely despise Joel Schumacher and almost every movie he's ever made. I've actually taken the trouble to think about who my least favorite director of all time is, and Schumacher won the booby prize. So blame it on my incredibly low expectations, but I really liked this movie. I agree with the other people here that the script is weak. No effort is made to develop characters--it seems as if the screenwriter began to add dimension to Forest Whitaker's cop and then thought better of it. But do you really want a lot of script in a movie like this? The film makers were wise to keep the running time to a swift 80 minutes, and while I didn't think they were especially clever in the set up or execution, it was competent enough to hold my interest.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrell's performance. He's great, and does much more with what he's given than the material probably warrants. I watched this by myself, but was still slightly embarrassed to find myself moved by his speech in which he confesses all of his sins to the assembled crowd. Even as I'm writing this review, I can't believe I didn't find this display hokier, but I guess I was in the right mood at the time.This movie reminded me of the kind of "B" thriller they might have made in the 40's--slick, quick and not especially intended to impress. Frequently, because those films aimed low, they scored high, as does "Phone Booth" for me.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film accomplishes all that it can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two things that this film has to do to keep its audience's attention: 1) Make the audience believe that a man has trapped another man in a phone booth with the threat of death, and 2) create a victimized character that the audience sympathizes with. With these forces in place, the audience is mostly (not entirely, of course) distracted from the film's ridiculousness. The rest of the film writes itself, and the dialogue is fairly believable.Keifer Sutherland phones in a decent voice performance, and Colin Ferrell is quite convincing as the emotionally wrought man trapped in the phone booth. Forrest Whittaker is not challenged by his role, and so plays the straight man as only a veteran actor can.The film is essentially a one-act morality play staged in an urban landscape and with modern props. Yet the behaviors the film wishes to correct are as old as human existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart and intense thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Alfred Hitchcock's "Birds", followed by M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs", the idea of thrillers had taken on a new logic in my mind. The idea is that the victims are trapped in a small claustrophobic atmosphere and the impending doom is right outside; its no wonder that I was drawn right into Joel Schumacher's "Phone Booth". What really sets this movie apart from the many thrillers like it was that the impending doom itself comes right into this claustrophobic booth and torments Colin Farrell's character to the point of pure unsaturated fear. The cinematography captured my eye as well, that when showing multiple shots at a time, it displays all the observations and thoughts of a person in a situation like that. These thoughts transform into the paranoid vision of this person trapped by a verbally sadistic gunmen with a rifle barrel focused right at his head. The dialogue is witty and suspenseful, especially in Kiefer Sutherlands character, that with every line it becomes more and more intriguing, and therefore the duologue itself becomes an element of terror which builds and builds throughout the movie. Colin Farrell delivers an incredible performance, he captures perfectly the realistic and natural reactions of any type person stuck in a death threat dilemma. All in all, a great, intense and addictive movie to watch.</fullReview>

As he walks across a bad part of New York a phone booth rings and Stu answers it. On the other line, a man with attitude. he tells Stu that if he leaves the booth he'll be killed. Soon prostitutes are bothering him and their pimp is shot trying to drag Stu out of the booth. The man orders him to do many things: calling his wife, calling his mistress, and leading people to believe he killed the pimp. Trying to help Stu is Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) but Stu must figure out how to get out of the booth for himself.This is one of Joel Schumachers best films, it's original, it's smart, it's sinister. The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) deals an amazing performance as a villain and is able to bring out the worst in people. At points of Stu's most emotional scenes you almost feel like breaking down and crying. You'll take a hard look at your life after seeing this and give a second though to some actions you may do.Phone Booth. Starring: Colin Farrel, Forest Whitaker, Kiefer Sutherland, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must watch original "concept" movie. The entire team should be applauded for fusing life into the movie considering the fact that it was shot in just 10-days.Collin Farrel (Stu) enters a Phone Booth and gets a call from the sniper who threatens to shoot him if he hangs up the phone. And the sniper well means it. The rest of the movie is how the sniper takes control over Stu persuading him to do as he likes.The entire movie rests on the Collin Farrel who delivers great performance of varying emotions. Radha Mitchell plays the wife and Katie Holmes the mistress who have very little screen time. Its good to see Forrest Whitawker as the Captain Ramey who tries to help Stu. Kiefer Sutherland whom we hear throughout the movie as the sniper is great.The dialogues are crisp and the movie moves at a rapid pace keeping you at the edge of the seat.Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I saw this in the first place is because my friend's uncle is Larry Cohen (the writer of the picture) and he (my friend, not Larry Cohen) wanted me to see it. Now, it's one of my favorite thrillers. A lot of people I know avoided it because it seemed like a non-starter, like you couldn't go anywhere with it, but because of the razor-sharp directing and clever script, it goes more places than most Hollywood thrillers can ever hope to. Colin Farrell is incredible (watch for his monologue, it's spectacular) and Keifer Sutherland, whose voice is heard throughout, provides an exceedingly charismatic villain. See it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Farrell spends 70 minutes in a phone book talking to Keifer Sutherland. That's the gist of the movie. Now of course what happens in between are both fascinating and frustrating. This is the type of movie that puts the viewer into the situation and asks "what would you do?" Farrell plays Stu Shepard, and ad executive who is married (wife is played by Radha Mitchell) but has a long term fling with a younger woman (Katie Holmes). A man who we don't see takes the fact that Stu is a me-me-me guy personally, calling a pay phone that Stu answers one day and holds him hostage there. The caller is played (voiced is perhaps a better way to explain what he does) by Sutherland as the omnipresent voice from above, showing himself only by way of clues left in the phone booth or by the people he shoots. Forest Whitaker plays the police chief who is trying to piece together what exactly is going on. The movie is very quick, shorter than most animated movies, and had it's theatrical release delayed for months because of the DC sniper shootings in 2002. The primary feeling I had was frustration, especially after thinking about what I would do. I thought to myself often "Why not do that? Oh yeah, I can't because of (fill in the blank)." Many of the plot bases are covered, the movie never cheats. It's by no means a classic, but for 80 minutes of entertainment goes, you could do much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story: 8/10 Very good. Also very simple. A sniper calls a phone booth he watched and stalked for quite awhile so he knows what he's doing. This isn't your typical "Whats your favorite scary movie" type killer/caller. He loves to mind f*ck the guy too, which is just eerie! The victim, Stu also has his own mess of troubles and turns out being a lot less than he shows off to be.Acting: 9/10 Strong! At first Stu could give a crap about everything but ends up going near insane with anger and confusion and most of all fear of getting himself and everyone else killed by the sniper/stalker. The police chief also does very well in playing out the concerned role. I guess Stus girlfriend(s) would kind of count off on this.Sound Mix: 8/10 Sniper loads his rifle "KA- CHUNK!!!", heart beat "Thump thump thump".... its very gripping. you'll jump when he actually shoots something. you wont expect it at all.Camera-work / Lighting: 10/10 As measly as it sounds, there's only one REAL location; the phone booth. but oh so many angles and shots you can have on it. All of the camera-work was brilliant in this. Itll cause fear because you're not sure where in New York he could be hiding. Anywhere, and the camera swerves to show the excitement. During all of the intense scenes, the camera almost works like something on Cops with swerving and uneasiness all over the place. It really sets the mood.Editing: 8/10 Great. Going back from the plans the police force has to find out what the hell is going on with the phone call, to Stuwart stuck in the booth with no way of hanging up without getting shot, to the killer's sight scope dancing around with the red pointer laser aimed at people's heads.Uniqueness: 8/10 If anything Scream had a similar concept with phone stalker/killers but this really intensifies it. Being able to mind f*ck a guy into confessing everything he's done wrong in his life to save the lives of his loved ones; or watch them die... you don't see that very much.Worth: 9/10 Watch this! Its definitely a movie that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, trying to figure a way he can escape the sniper and the police and make it out alive with his balls intact. The movie is a bit short tho.Synopsis: A slick weasely New York publicist Stu gets a call in a phone booth (after he calls his cheating new girlfriend) is told that if he hangs up, he'll be killed... and the little red light from a laser rifle sight is proof that the caller isn't kidding. Any attempt he makes to outsmart the sniper ends up getting other people in the mix. Not even the police can help him.Overall Score (Not an average): 9.0 The movie definitely has a lot of grip to it. Something you'll be afraid to take a bathroom break through if you're at the theater because you might miss another sniping or chance/attempt for the guy to escape the booth. Reviewer's Insight: Get your Jujubees and Popcorn before the movie! missing one minute of this hour, 45 min movie could mean the end of somebody! The voice of the sniper is definitely much more freakier than the Reaper on Scream and boy does he know how to mess with this guy's mind. Heh, he makes him ask the police chief if he jerks off. That or sniper guy blows his head off. Wow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to start off, I thought this movie was very good. Good acting, good plot, some suspense (which is nice in a suspense movie). Probably Colin Farrell's finest moment. There wasn't any single actor (apart from Farrell of course) who tried to overdo their part and take away the focus from the situation at hand.Its a story about morals and trying to deal with them in the face of a single barrelled sniper rifle and the whole of America watching.I give the movie 7.5 out of 10, which let's face it is pretty good for a 'Hollywood' movie nowadays.Recommendation: Go watch it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this film, I had no less than 3 separate people tell me that it was " stupid" " boring" and a "waste of time". When you hear that, you just have to make your own opinion. I sat and watched "Phone Booth" with a mild sense of sceptism, and came away at the end of it, thoroughly impressed with Colin Farrell's acting ability. Sure, the plot was a little flimsy, but it zoomed along quite nicely with a little twist at the end. Forest Whitaker again a nicely understated performance, and a few characters like the pimp and negotiator to mix it up a little. I know I will my friends will look at me in disbelief when I tell them that I thought the movie was "good", but hey, diversity of taste is what makes the world go round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS**Stu (Farell) is a very busy person, trying to be someone and taking advantage of everyone and everything to promote himself. He does his daily routine to call a young pretty actress Pam (Holmes) who he is dreaming of, though he is still very much in love with his wife Kelly (Mitchell). After, someone calls the booth and Stu answers, getting told that if he hang up, he will die. Problems then arises when other people really wants to use the phone, which Stu can't let them, and the sniper who holds Stu hostage shoots one of them. Police is called on to the scene and Stu, who gets blamed for the murder, is treated like one. A very interesting situation arises when police tells him to come out of the booth and the sniper tells him that if he does, he will die. And of course, he can't tell the police what is really going on. The snipers demands is that he reveals and confesses all his sins, as both Kelly and Pam arrives on scene. The dilemma also gets worse when the sniper threatens both Kelly and Pam as well as the police in charge Capt. Ramey (Whitaker).This is a great movie right up to the end. The suspense is very good, the acting is superb, especially by Farell and Sutherland, even if we only get to listen in to Sutherland's voice. He really does the role as the sniper magnificently. Then there is the end. I don't really know what I want instead of what happened, but the end as it is does not come up to the high standards of the rest of the movie. One thing I think would have been better if we never got to see the sniper. Not very funny for Sutherland perhaps, but his great performance by voice only, and the character of the cold intellectual sniper, is somewhat diminished when he appears. I would have liked an end where we never see the sniper better. If that end included the snipers death, Stu's death or Kelly's and Pam's death or not I don't know.Very well, to conclude, a very nice story with a lot of suspense and mystery, masterfully played and directed, cut short by a premature and not perfect ending. Still, very good.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stu is the kind of guy you love to hate. He cheats on people, he is very hard for his co-worker, he thinks he's the king of the world... But than he makes a decision which will change his life. He goes to a phone booth in Manhatten, New York City, to call a girl, which isn't his wife, trying to get her in his bed. When he hangs up the phone, it starts ringing. He picks it up. A psycho sniper dictates his demands via the phone from somewhere in the surrounding buildings. If he doesn't do what the sniper wants, he'll get killed.This is a very good movie. Don't expect a sightseeing tour of New York, all the action happens in and around the phone boot. But when you don't mind about that, you'll see that this is a good movie, full of suspense. It's a relatively short movie, but it's better this way. You don't want to watch the guy standing there for more than 90 minutes. If it took any longer it would probably have been a very boring movie, now it is a very good thriller. I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile film about a dying system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to understand why someone would not like this movie, but it is just as easy for one to love it. The movie has an interesting concept: a man in a phone booth is being targeted by a sniper somewhere in the buildings around him and is forced to do what he says, or else... bang. As the film progresses, the man's likelihood of survival grows smaller, as he finds himself surrounded by police, the media, his acquaintances, police snipers, all the while the sniper is giving him breathless demands. The film is tense and intelligent, and conveys the use of clever cinematography, where multiple views are shown on one scene, while people talk from multiple locations. The ending is a tossup, but all in all, it's a worthwhile film about a dying system... phone booths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good thriller from 2002 at only 81 minutes long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---Basic Spoilers---I was a bit disappointed by the length of this movie considering the fact that tons of Disney films always have a minimum of 90 minutes. Colin Farrell stars with Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes.Colin Farrell stars as an arrogant publicist in New York City named Stu Shepard. He's a very busy man and starts off the movie with an assistant named Adam making calls to tons of places that link together with at least 5 different cell phones ringing at the same time. He then leaves his assistant to do his work and now he goes off to his daily cheating. You see he's married to a women named Kelly (Mitchell) but he calls another girl named Pam (Holmes) "just in case things don't work out" with his wife. Everyday after work, he goes off to the same phone booth to call his "extra". After today's call, the phone rings and he picks it up. The movie has now official begun.Kiefer Sutherland plays as The Caller who forces Stu to do the most embarrassing antics to save him from getting killed. Forrest Whitaker eventually comes in as a NYPD chief to find out what's right and what's wrong. Note that about 80% or more takes place in the phone booth.I liked this movie. It had a decent ending, depending on how you wanted the movie to end. I found that it ran short and I found it had to much language. Of course, the language is applied only to make the movie even more realistic, having said they're in New York City. A great thriller and a good, entertaining performance by Colin Farrell. Joel Schumacher does a good job as director. A very good thriller.My Rating: 7/10Eliason A.</fullReview>

Jones. It was a pure delight and a was a breath of fresh air to watch these actors work together in this great movie.Most of the credit must be given to the writers of "Phone Booth" because they took what could have easily been turned into an fast-paced and formulaic action picture and slowed the pace. Instead, the writers chose to create a dramatic film with the focus on character development and storyline. With strong performances and smart writing; the writers successfully turned "Phone Booth" into a clever and stylish film.Charisma and intensity are elements brought to the screen by everyone in the film, especially Farrell. I have never been a Colin Farrell fan, but I respect the talent he brings to the role. "Phone Booth" only furthers Farrell credibility as an actor as he seized the opportunity to step out of the shadows and into the limelight to take the road to super stardom.Based upon his previous film, "American Outlaws," it didn't take long to realize the discovery of the next big movie star would be found in "Phone Booth." I was smiling when I saw Farrell on screen because it meant the writers had created a character filled with imagination and ideas that made the movie a joy to watch.Aside from Farrell, another bright spot in "Phone Booth" shined with the emergence and second breakthrough performance turned in by his co-star, Radha Mitchell. With enormous screen presence and impact turned in by Mitchell, she is an actress whose name will be called as a winner of the academy award.The bottom line is "Phone Booth" is an underrated film that will bring everyone satisfaction and serve as great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is it that a two hour movie that's one and only scene is in a phone booth can have audience members entranced? I'm not really sure, all I know is that it got me. Phone Booth is about a successful publicist named Stu who walks into a phone booth to call the woman he's contemplating having an affair with, and as soon as he hangs up the phone, receives a phone call from a sniper threatening to kill him if he puts down the phone.At first glance, you think this movie is all about Stu, how he is in distress, and how he chooses to handle this deadly situation. But really, the whole thing is about the killer. Its about a guy who watches this man day after day, committing sin on top of sin on top of sin, and being baffled that the guy doesn't even know he's doing anything wrong. Finally he decides that he has to take drastic measures. He's going to give him the scare of his life, in hopes that he'll repent. Now that I think about it, its very similar to the killer in Se7en. It kind of makes you wonder who's the bad guy. Is it the guy who for a few hours points a gun in a man's face in order to make him not only realize but confess that he is NOT perfect, but has done wrong? Or is it the man who has spent day after day after day hurting the people he loves with his selfishness and greed, and is ignorant enough to think himself innocent? I loved this movie. I give it 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Media publisher Stu Shepard (portrayed by Colin Farrell) is using a phone booth to make a call. Moments after ending the call and stepping outside the booth, the phone rings. Stu steps back inside and picks up the phone. A voice on the other end of the line (Keifer Sutherland from 24) speaks, telling Stu that he has a powerful sniper rifle aimed at him and is ready to shoot if he hangs up. It turns out that the caller has been watching Stu for a while. The caller knows Stu has been cheating on his wife. The caller wants Stu to come clean. Stu refuses, and he and the caller engage in a entertaining game of cat and mouse.The concept of the movie is great. It's unique, interesting, exciting, with an air of humour and suspense. While some of the story is repeated a lot, this only adds to the suspense. Younger audiences will get bored very easily, but adults and older children will definitely enjoy this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, Joel Schumacher. The director who ruined the Batman franchise brings you "Phone Booth," a movie that was just diverting enough to keep me from changing the channel. Its ludicrously simple premise is both its greatness strength and its greatest weakness; being trapped in a phone booth (vicariously) is a harrowing, claustrophobic experience...but it's also damn monotonous. Thankfully, the booth is located across the street from a strip club, because what every movie really needs is sassy, underdressed women, right? Tsk tsk - it's all quite tacky, I'm afraid. But I did enjoy the performances from Forrest "I seek out bad movies like a homing pigeon" Whitaker and Keifer Sutherland.</fullReview>

Phone Booth doesn't offer much to look at. The action takes place in a Manhattan phone booth and its direct surroundings. A guy is called by a hidden sniper who orders him to come clear and confess his general dishonesty in life. *SPOILER* The only thing that disappointed me is that it was very clear that the guy that was found in the building was not the killer.

		<fullReview>This is definitely an unusual film. It doesn't even run for 80 minutes, the cast can be counted with your hand, and Colin Farrell is on screen for almost every single shot in the movie.That being said, I love this film. As someone who was isolated in the school ground as a child, I often see things with a different perspective. When a kid punches another for calling him an idiot, I thought he was over the top, but the kid thought it was justified. This is the same view taken by our beloved Sniper.Stu Shepherd (Colin Farrell) is a greasy publicist in a flashy suit. He has never made anybody famous, but his clients still follow him because they believe his life of lies. He is trying to get in the sack with Pam (Katie Holmes), his client actress, despite being married to Kelly (Australia's Rahda Mitchell). He calls her from a phone booth each day, but today he has a surprise. He receives a call from a man who constantly threatens to expose him and even kill him if he doesn't co-operate. Stu doesn't even understand why he's targeted, but our caller does, forces Stu to work it out for himself.Stu constantly lies, cheats and weazles his way out of situations. But he accepts this as okay, as does society, but the caller knows that it is never right to do so. Is Stu an innocent victim being terrorized by a maniacal sniper? Or is the sniper his angel trying to get the lying Stu to redeem his sins? I like to believe the latter.We all have a little bit of Stu in ourselves. We all lie a little and think that there will be no consequences. Each time the lies get a little larger, until we lose it.Colin Farrell is amazing to watch in this. He has such an incredible depth and we see him play cocky, paranoid, tragic, comedic and destroyed. All this in 80 minutes; no easy feat. *** SMALL SPOILER *** Kiefer Sutherland does play the sniper well, although I did not find him as menacing as the critics or other viewers ****. All the other characters in the film seem to be quite two dimensional, but the actors playing them give them a sense of grounded reality. Whitaker gives the best supporting performance with the worst character (his marriage-divorce sub-subplot is unnecessary and unresolved).I think this film is a must-see, as it is most relevant today as we hide behind our public image. It boasts a very strong performance from Farrell, a very taut story and some solid direction by Joel Schumacher.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly BRILLIANT performance by Colin Farrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Farrell is unbelievable and undeniably the best actor of our age - I would dare suggest that he is even better than Sir Laurence Olivier. I've seen Mr. Farrell in several movies now and am utterly sold on his solid rock-bottom palpable talent. He and Jason Statham are two giant talents that sell a movie for me. (You *must* see Jason in "SNATCH.")I have seen Mr. Farrell on a public TV show where actors sit down and discuss their industry. Mr. Farrell is Irish, with a *THICK* Irish accent. His singular ability to put his accent down and speak equally well in a New York/American accent is profound - and that's to mention the least of his talents. During his discussion at this "round table" his ability to toss out several vulgarities in one sentence was evident. I dare say he would embarrass a sailor with his special tongue. However, his ability to utterly succumb to the character that he is playing has put him above all the actors currently considered Hollywood's best. (Three come to mind: Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Johnny Depp.) Mr. Farrell has raised the bar and I personally don't think they can reach it. Mr. Farrell is in a class *BY HIMSELF*!Mr. Farrell is currently making "Alexander" (the Great). I might even see this movie in the theater - a good one - one in Manhattan... and I do not like the city anymore ["Mmmm, I love the City in the summer, it smells like a urinal." -Billy Crystal on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show (approximately 1 million years ago :)], nor have I been in a theater in ~8 years.Ok, now here's the funny part - I was going to avoid this "what-a-stupid-idea-for-a-plot-...-a-man-in-a-phone-booth" movie. Nothing was on cable (as is usual nowadays) and so I tuned this in. First you see Colin Farrell's character wheeling and dealing on 3 cell phones. Immediately you are impressed with the rhythm. From there it all goes uphill! (better and better).Ironically, b/c of Mr. Farrell's personality I think I wouldn't want to meet him - I don't think he suffers fools easily. :)TOP GUNMr. Farrell 100 out of 10 (can do *anything* *anytime* *anywhere*).Class AJim Carrey 10/10 (can do any American role).Tom Hanks 9.5/10 (can do any role, but Carrey is better).Johnny Depp 9/10 (can not do comedic role).Class BArnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Mel GibsonClass CChris Tucker, and Samuel L. JacksonClass DJackie Chang, Jean Claude Van Damm, and Steven Seagall-ZafoidPS: I really like this comment - it helped me to focus on the guys in Hollywood with real talent.

		<shortDescription>Short but exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was above average even though the plot was so simple. A guy stalked by a sniper for weeks is set up when he uses a phone booth. For the next hour, we get an exciting stand off between Stu, the sniper, and police. What makes it even better is when we learn the sniper is a seriel killer and could start shooting any time. Too bad we never learn the true motives behind the killer's actions.Farrell does a good job. He even cries without making it look sappy. His character definitely made the film.FINAL VERDICT: A tense thriller. It's not long and worth watching. Not to mention Colin Farrell is looking good in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcockian concept, fancy-dressed with modern flourishes and lots of strong language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is exactly the kind of film which Alfred Hitchcock would have loved to gets his hands on - a suspense thriller with just a couple of main characters and set entirely in one very small location. Before I watched the film, I had worries that the under-80-minute running time would result in the film being under-developed and uninvolving, but in actual fact, the briefness of this movie emerges as one of its big strengths. Colin Farrell adds to his growing reputation as a talented and appealing leading man. He plays Stu, a big city businessman who has built a successful life for himself by lying, bluffing and fast-talking his way to the beneficial conclusion of countless big-money deals. He has a lovely wife, but he also carries on with another woman, calling his secret lover every day from the same roadside phone booth. One day, Stu answers a call at his regular phone booth only to be told that there is a rifle trained on him and that if he fails to comply with the caller he will be shot. For the next hour or so, Stu goes through the most traumatic day of his life as he follows a series of painful and humiliating instructions from an unseen sniper who might just decide to eliminate him at any moment! Joel Schumacher has directed some real turkeys in recent years (Batman and Robin, 8mm, for instance) but he is back with considerable force here. He manages to make this one-set thriller very exciting and very cinematic, when many lesser directors might have let it become too saggy and theatrical. His use of multi-screen images is very thoughtful and his decision to have the sniper played as a "voice only" character adds to the sense of hopelessness that Farrell goes through. Phone Booth may be short and it may seem to be finished before it has barely begun, but it is a tight, exciting and thoroughly pared-to-the-bone thriller which proves beyond doubt that less can most definitely be more.</fullReview>

I found myself acually being angry at the end, because all throughout the entire movie I kept telling myself how great the dialogue between Farrell and Sutherland is. It was intense! Then all of a sudden the movie ends and you just feel numb and cheated, feel kinda like saying "that's it? that's the end of the movie???". I hope that the DVD has an alternate ending, because this one was crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Novel concept, almost all of movie takes place *IN* the phone booth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it does hold one's attention. Plus, at only about 75 minutes long, it moves towards the end briskly. Colin Farrell, an Irishman, is excellent as the NewYorker with no morals. While acting charming to everyone, lying and cheating to get what he wants, either for personal pleasure or to succeed in his job. The beginning of the movie lets us know who he is and what he is about, then the fun (if you can call it that) begins when he answers a public phone ringing in the booth in downtown Manhattan. As others have mentioned, it is a 'morality play', publicly exposing the cheating and lying of the protagonist, but the ending leaves many questions unanswered. Had this story taken place in a more traditional setting, it would not have been nearly as gripping. However, the phone booth figuratively and literally confines the viewer to a very small world. My rating is '6' of 10. The violence is rather mild, for this type of movie, but the street prostitutes and the pervasive foul language will turn many viewers off.SPOILERS follow --- quit reading, OK??Kiefer Sutherland is just perfect as the 'voice' we hear, but never see, until a few seconds near the end. We don't really find out much about him, or his motivation, but through his phone conversation with Stu we learn that he has killed the two previous people he picked and he will kill Stu unless he gets full cooperation. His targets are not random, instead they are people he finds are leading lives of deception and he becomes judge and jury to either let them live or die. Holed up at a window in a surrounding building, with a very accurate, high-powered rifle, and having his phone routed through a scrambled network, Stu and the police become his helpless pawns. He eventually forces Stu to yell to his wife and bystanders, 'I have been making calls to my girlfriend every day from a phone booth, to go undetected, and I wanted to sleep with her.' But he was also forced to say the explicit sex act, before he was let off the hook. The caller's location is eventually traced to a room, and when the cops get there find a dead man with his throat slashed, assuming the shooter killed himself rather than be captured. Felled by a policeman's rubber bullet earlier, Stu was in an ambulance, given a sedative ('We drive you to the hospital, but you will be flying.'), and as his vision becomes blurred, the shooter shows up at the ambulance, the voice unmistakable, and tells Stu he will be watching him, and he had better not go back to his old ways. We never, however, learn more of the shooter, who he is, why he took this on as his hobby. The dead man was the pizza delivery man who tried at the beginning to delive the pizza to the phone booth, compliments of the shooter.(Free loaner DVD from the library, obtained by neighbor Ron.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally charged film about honesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The PHONEbooth, directed by Joel Schumacher is an emotionally charged film about honesty in day-to-day life, as well as in relationships. Stu Shepherd, played by Collin Ferrell, is a man whose relationships are built on lies and dishonesty. An then he answers a ringing phone. Ferrell has never been honest with his wife, clients, employees, nor with himself, and the caller on the other end is determined to change that.The nemesis, known only as `the Caller', played by Keifer Sutherland, demands honesty from Ferrell. He begins that process with small and sometimes crude confessions of mis-deeds. With each confession, Sutherland demands bigger, deeper confessions, until Ferrell is forced into complete self-honesty.The PHONEbooth has no traditional chase scene or shoot 'em up action, but keeps viewers riveted. Sutherland plays with the emotions of both Ferrell and the viewer. The film is shot within the confines of a phone booth. It is as if you can see Ferrell's world closing in on him - and his only chance of survival is complete honesty. The split screen effects are very well done, so the viewer is able to keep an eye on Ferrell and see what is going on around him at the same time.A departure from his action-packed movies, such as Minority Report, Ferrell has no control, and is seemingly powerless over Sutherland. Sutherland is in control and demands respect by way of truth and honesty. Ferrell's character must confess, and offer complete honesty in order to show Sutherland, and the world respect.The PHONEbooth kept my interest the first, second and third time I watched it. I am drawn to the range of emotion Ferrell portrays as the call progresses. Helplessness becomes that which give him the strength to persevere. I can not imagine finding that within myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, quickly running out of steam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers and teasers for Phone Booth, I was thinking: 'wow, how is that gonna be interesting for 2 hours'? Schumacher helped the movie in the end by keeping it short, but still you wonder if the idea alone of a guy in a phone booth talking to a maniacal killer is worth making a whole movie about. As there are other shortcommings: the motive of the killer isn't really clear, the ending is what you always thought it would be (the last scene where Farrell is drugged up is laughably bad) and Kieferson's voice is annoying to say the least. Still it has some things to offer: a nice basic idea, great acting by Farrell and the always good Whitaker, slick camerawork &amp; design.. oh and it's always a plus to have Katie Holmes in your movie :). But it ain't no hidden Schumacher-gem like Falling Down (which it did remind me of in some ways). In short: good flick, though running out of steam in the end, 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiefer Sutherland is the real star of this good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed "Phone Booth", even though I don't care too much for Colin Farrell or his acting. It was a great suspense thriller and it had a great plot. But I thought the real star of this film was Kiefer Sutherland. He was a great villain. He has an intriguing voice and I just loved listening to it throughout the film. And it saved me from having to listen to Colin Farrell's fading accent and his profanity. Kiefer added some great black humor to the film and it seemed like he was really angry when Colin didn't obey him. Some of the acting was a little cheesy, like Radha Mitchell as Colin's wife and Katie Holmes as "the other woman." But all in all it was a good film and well worth the price of the rental. I thought the ending could've been a little better but at least we got to see Kiefer. I really like his acting abilities. I don't think this film would've been as good if he hadn't been in it. But it was fun to watch and probably Colin's best role. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Joel Schumacher film - once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>64 year old veteran filmmaker Joel Schumacher has directed spectacular masterpieces ("Falling down", "8MM") as well as awful turkeys ("Batman &amp; Robin"). As far as I'm concern this is definitely one of his most successful films. I've always thought Colin Farrell is a great, skillful and a highly promising actor because he was quite excellent in splendid films like "Tigerland" and "Minority report" and after I saw "Phone booth" I was even more impressed. We are going to hear a lot more about this guy, I'm telling you. If you think the role of Stu was easy, think again. Camera constantly focuses on Farrell. It really takes a wonderful actor to perform in a part that's as challenging as this. Another thing: I haven't seen a film with such an interesting baddie for years. Knowing that the caller is a murdering psychopath he's actually "a good guy" which makes the whole plot even twice as fascinating. Kiefer Sutherland is spectacular in the role even though we mostly hear his deep and powerful voice. Wonderful Forest Whitaker also makes a fabulous performance as Captain Ramey. "Phone booth" is a clear proof that movie can be cheap, short and simple yet still terrific and nowadays we desperately need these reminders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was a real hit with me.From the unique and bold idea (events are all depicted in real time, and there is basically only one scene throughout the film), and the excellent performance of Farrell, to the accomplished pace and tension courtesy of the script and Schulmacher's direction, this film scored all around for me.I don't need to say too much about the plot, for fear of spoilers, and the fact that you can read them elsewhere, so I will largely deal with the character interaction.Farrell's character is a master study of both scripting and acting performance. Here we have an obnoxious, deceitful, self-centered, and apparently self-confident publicist introduced to us, and through the film, this character's is broken down morally and emotionally, to reveal a fragile man underneath, and one who appears ultimately repentant for the sins he is being judged upon by "the voice" on the other end of the phone. Amazingly, at the end of it all we end up sympathising for this obnoxious yuppy.Sutherland, as "the voice" brings a remarkably black humour to the whole proceedings, and achieves his task well of manipulating Farrell's character like a puppet through "moralist terrorism."A daring film venture - extremely well executed by all concerned, and highly rewarding to experience.Score: a (rare) 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

Its highly entertaining and very nice made.The story is simple, but very gripping and interesting right from the opening. The plot is maybe not a big secret when you hear the title: PHONE BOOTH, you see the cover; a man standing in a booth nervous with a bullet hole in the glass and the tagline: your life is on the line. Well, the thing is; its not a secret either, its just a highly nice made thriller with great dialogs and excitement!Colin Farrell is absolutely great in the role as a slick, nasty and smart guy named Stu Shepard, we can also see Forest Whitaker in the character as a calmed down police captain-and hear.......** The secret isn't big for those who've seen some movies in their lifetime when you hear the caller's voice: its pretty recognizing all the way. The ending is nice, very nice actually, so is the opening. You get a sort of relationship with phones as you get to the shower in PSYCHO! Well, that's maybe over doing it, but I tell you, its a very nice thriller we've got here! STARS: **** 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An innovative suspenseful thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schumacher's latest outing PHONE BOOTH takes a familiar formula and applies some clever new spins. We begin with a stereotypical `Scream' like psycho killer (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) who loves to taunt and terrorize his victims via the telephone. However, Schumacher deviates from the standard psycho killer fare in intriguing ways. Firstly, our primary victim is male (Colin Farrell) not female. Rather than being trapped helpless and home alone, the victim is duped into answering a phone call in a busy New York City telephone booth. The killer then threatens to open fire with a high power rife unless Farrell (playing a New York City publicist) stays on the line and does everything he's told.  Schumacher takes pains at the beginning of the film to paint Farrell's character as a lying, manipulative self-centered lowlife. Again, the director breaks with the stereotypical formula in which the killer's victims are innocents who draw the audiences' sympathy, by painting Farrell as a worm, Schumacher cleverly inverts the formula so that the audience actually enjoys watching the victim squirm.  The killer tells Farrell he has set other victims up in the same manner and has killed before. To prove to Farrell he means business, he kills a bystander. This acts as a reality check both for Farrell and the audience ? it's one thing to see a low life being made to squirm but quite another for the sniper to open fire on a crowded New York Street. The audience now expects Schumacher to start running up the body count. But the director again dashes audience expectation and turns the film primarily into a psychological thriller rather than the action suspense or slasher fare we've been led to expect. The camera and action focus almost exclusively on the phone booth (reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE) and the publicist's agony and humiliation as the killer forces him to stay in the booth, now surrounded by police, and carry out his twisted wishes upon threat of death. Unaware of the sniper's presence, the police think the publicist has the killed the bystander. Farrel's character must continue playing the killer's deadly game in hopes he can somehow tip the police before either they, or the killer, end his life. Schumacher caps the film with a nice (though not totally unpredictable) twist ending. An innovative suspenseful outing! I gave it an 8 out 10!TarryRobWpg, MB Canada</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS***This is a fantastic film. Eighty minutes of pure delight, it just goes to show that even if you keep it simple, you can create a thriller of sheer suspense. With no special effects, little in the way of locations, Phone Booth keeps it simple and it works a treat. This film does for phone boxes what Jaws did for going to beach and what Psycho did for showers. The film is a fantastic thriller that never outstays its welcome (it only lasts for about eighty minutes) and creates suspense out of the smallest of actions. The nightmarish plot is well thought up and Joel Schumacher delivers his best film since Falling Down.What I love most about this film is how writer Larry Cohen really squeezes every inch out of his plot. The film starts of slightly humorous, with the whole notion of this plot quite funny and how the main character of Stu reacts to the strange man on the other end threatening him. It is the fast paced development of the script and how this peculiar plot turns into the worst nightmare of a scenario. Stu gets harassed by a couple of prostitutes looking to use the phone, then gets harassed by their pimp which turns physical which results in said pimp's death. Then come the police and then the sharp shooters. This is what I really look for in a thriller. It has what Hitchcock knew that makes up a great thriller. A regular man in an extraordinary situation. Stu finds himself in a waking nightmare that may result in the loss of his marriage and life.The central performance from Colin Farrell is quite frankly superb. His flawless American accent to his on the spot response to the situation right through to the stunning moment where he 'confesses' his sins truly makes this an enthralling and gripping film. Special mention must go to Kiefer Sutherland for his fantastic vocal performance as the shooter. The dark humor and menacing threat that exudes this performance is undeniably superb and makes, for the first time I can remember, the first instance where a voice is more frightening than a killer with a knife and a mask. Completing the central trio is Forrest Whitiker, magnificent as the cop who must defuse the situation.This is a superb thriller on every level. The direction, script and performances ensure this is as one of the best Hollywood thriller in recent years, made all the more surprising that this is a film as far away from Hollywood that has been made in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose the one aspect of this movie that might put people off wanting to see it is the short running time, these days a fair indicator that hostile test audiences have caused a film to be truncated. But in this case, less is most certainly more. At around 80 minutes, Phone Booth very effectively takes on the stark and unflinching emotional journey of one man. I have only previously seen Colin Farrell on the big screen in Minority Report and Daredevil; here he surpasses both roles easily. At the beginning of the movie, you will hate his character Stu, a nasty, lying New York publicist. But come the finale you are cheering him for the strength and honesty he finds within himself. The whole movie hinges on Farrell's performance, and he displays the huge range of emotions and feelings that Stu faces superbly. He is well supported by the always-reliable Forest Whitaker as the Police Captain on the scene, who steadily begins to realise the situation at hand, and Rhada Mitchell and Katie Holmes as the two women in his life, who both do very well in surprisingly small roles, Mitchell in particular as Stu's wife, Helen, as she tries to deal with the confusion of her husband's actions. Then of course there is Kiefer Sutherland, his profile revitalised by the stunning TV series "24". His menacing tones are perfect for the role of The Caller, and his single scene at the end of the film is chilling. This is a taut, economic and gripping thriller, and is by far director Joel Schumacher's finest film since "Falling Down".</fullReview>

Collin Farrell's acting is second to none, and Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland are truly great as ever. One goof I did notice, the sniper claimed to be able to "see" the dial on the pay phone, however the angle at which he was looking was 90 degrees to it and therefore it would not of been possible.

		<shortDescription>Could It Be? A Joel Schumacher Film I Actually Liked?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one wanted to hate "Phone Booth" more than me, since I absolutely despise Joel Schumacher and almost every movie he's ever made. I've actually taken the trouble to think about who my least favorite director of all time is, and Schumacher won the booby prize. So blame it on my incredibly low expectations, but I really liked this movie. I agree with the other people here that the script is weak. No effort is made to develop characters--it seems as if the screenwriter began to add dimension to Forest Whitaker's cop and then thought better of it. But do you really want a lot of script in a movie like this? The film makers were wise to keep the running time to a swift 80 minutes, and while I didn't think they were especially clever in the set up or execution, it was competent enough to hold my interest.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrell's performance. He's great, and does much more with what he's given than the material probably warrants. I watched this by myself, but was still slightly embarrassed to find myself moved by his speech in which he confesses all of his sins to the assembled crowd. Even as I'm writing this review, I can't believe I didn't find this display hokier, but I guess I was in the right mood at the time.This movie reminded me of the kind of "B" thriller they might have made in the 40's--slick, quick and not especially intended to impress. Frequently, because those films aimed low, they scored high, as does "Phone Booth" for me.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic on many levels.While it is highly entertaining, it is just as disturbing. The thought of someone knowing your life, your routine, the most intimate details of your private world...how genuinely perturbing.This production is very thought-provoking, extraordinarily written and the direction is surprisingly coherent, considering it was done by Joel Schumacher, the guy who DROPPED THE ATOM BOMB on the Batman series! (the badly done Batman Forever and the horrid Batman and Robin). The characters were well developed enough to allow the audience to care what happened to the lead, and the talents of the thespians involved were very well used and displayed. Though, in my opinion, Forest Whitaker's was above and beyond any other performance in this entire production.I could go on and on, but I will refrain. I do not even intend to outline the plot here. If you appreciate a good psychological thriller/suspense, then by all means, see this movie.It gets an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanting a Shorter Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering how a movie shot almost entirely in a phone booth could last for 90 minutes. After watching the movie, it became clear that you can't. Or at least you can't and keep the interest of the audience.This is the story of a man who learns from the fear inflicted upon him by a gunman who makes him admit to his failures as a person or face death. In order to keep the movie going for a sufficient length of time, the plot starts to feel more and more contrived. I felt there are considerably more reasonable paths that the movie should have taken, albeit ones with less drama.It is not a terrible movie by a long shot, and in fact, could have been an interesting 50 minute short film. The acting seemed to be well done. In all, not bad, but I don't quite understand the high 7.5 IMDB rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's good to see that Hollywood can still come up with some original stories. Although the premise of these movie is improbable, it is pulled off by some excellent acting from the likes of Farrell and Whittaker. It captures your curiosity from the beginning and has you glued to your chair throughout. Good entertainment.</fullReview>

Colin Farells acting was quite superb and really believable. So was Forest Whitaker (who's just a great actor!) but Radha Mitchell (the wife), who coached her? She didn't translate at all!

		<shortDescription>Excellent, short suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly good movie, and also unpredictable. I spent almost all the movie time gripped to the chair. The movie is a big dialogue between a common guy with a sin, being it falsity and artificiality, and a bullying psycho with a sniper rifle pointing at the former, kind of blackmailing the former. The whole movie is shot at a single New York street, which makes me think this script could even be a theater play. Also, this movie is an excellent sample of a lost art these days: a less than 1:30 hour movie, worth every minute, in a time in which all directors make the corniest movies stretch up to 3 hours. Joel Schumacher is definitely still one of my favorite directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Reason Not To Pick Up A Phone Since "Scream"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that combines the plots of two of the greatest films ever, "Rear Window" and "Taxi Driver" can not fail to be a great film itself.This is a bold contention to be sure, but one I'm willing to make for this film. If Alfred Hitchcock were still alive today, this is the kind of film he would be making. Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece of suspense (in my opinion) was "Rear Window." The reason for this particular Hitchcock film's greatness was that the entire movie took place within the confines of one inquisitive newspaper photographer's apartment. Yet in this limited setting, Hitchcock managed to build suspense in ways that some of his other movies could not. The only shortcoming of "Rear Window" film (and it was a minor flaw) was that this voyeur's life was only in real danger for about five minutes and that it was his snooping that got him into the mess.Perhaps it's because the villain "Rear Window" was not someone with a mission, merely someone who wanted his wife gone and then to hightail it out of town that this danger element never showed its face as much as it could."Phone Booth" is not constrained by this villainous motivation. Keifer Sutherland (although only seen at the end) plays a man with a Travis Bickle (from "Taxi Driver") complex in more modern times. He wants a rain to come down and was the scum away and he wants to be the one seeding the clouds. His victim on the day of the movie, shot in real-time (although there are others in the past) is an up-and-coming publicist played by Colin Farrell (whose character, Stu Shepard may not have an honest bone in his body).Match these two characters up for a fast paced 80 minutes and you have a heart pounding drama all in the confines of less than a city block. This is a one act play (so kind of fitting that it was set in New York City) filmed for the big screen and losing none of its drama with its budget. This film was philosophically sound although there are a couple of holes in the plot (i.e. the police not being able to figure things out much sooner).And it's scarier than "Rear Window" because it was not Colin Ferrell's character's spying that gets him in trouble, but just living his life. While we are all not wheeler-dealer publicists, who does not have their flaws? And, what would happen to any one of us, if someone decided we should not live for those flaws? What would happen if we were faced with death's metaphorical angel? Could we face our flaws?I can see how action fans would hate the film because there's not a lot of action. I can see how cinematography snobs would hate the film because it's all shot in a phone booth (although I do admit that some of the real-time split screen work is a little iffy). But, this movie has all the elements of what drama used to be but with a flair and sensibility that are modern (read the ability to show more gore and grittier situations).Hitchcock was actually offered this film before he died and he turned it down. I'm almost glad it was made now and not then since this is a gritty story that needed to have no punches pulled (and who better to do gritty drama than the director of "8MM"? Once you've tackled snuff films, snipers are hardly more shocking). It's drama of the highest caliber. Possibly the most underrated movie of 2002 due to its mixture of a Hollywood cast and director and non-Hollywood plot (it's a movie both critics and fans are able to hate).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's one interesting call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently Hollywood seems to have this thing for making us stay away from ringing phones. First we had "The Ring," and then we have this one. The difference of this is clearly about morality because "Phone Booth" is a lesson in how our small lies can ruin us and kill us in the end... probably literally. The film mainly works because of its intricate plot and fluid camera work in the limited area of a small and claustrophobic phone booth. Reportedly based on a short student film and shot in just 10 days, the film tries to have Stu's confinement in the phone booth shape both the story and its impact as there is almost no action here other than the dialogue between Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland. Director Joel Schumacher's main job here is to totally get the viewer's attention in a labyrinthine plot involving hookers, pizza delivery guys, and Katie Holmes, so that at the end of the film you haven't even noticed that virtually all the scenes are in one place.The climax and the ending, however, tend to be this film's greatest misfires. It seemed all the energy the movie had to offer was used to the limit in creating tension and edginess for the other parts of the film that the climax was left heavy-handed and pretentious. The attempt for the twist at the end was also predictable.But Colin Farrell carries this film noir suspense thriller straight to the end with his convincing performance. Because the movie is told in real time, he has to create a significant degree of tension among Sutherland and Whitaker. And he does, which makes an otherwise boring premise interesting to watch.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farrell is Superb Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth starts off following a day in the life of sleazy New York P.R. man Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) who's got a quick wit and a knack for double-talk. He's a small time guy pitching small time names, based on the principle that "Getting mentioned is the first step to getting noticed."On this particular morning, Stu is, like every morning, on his way to a phone booth in the middle of Manhattan to call Pamela (Katie Holmes), a cute young actress whose name he's been dropping, and whom he calls every day from this very same phone booth. To call on his cell phone, understand, would tip his hand to his wife (Radha Mitchell), whom Pamela knows nothing about.It's just an ordinary day of misleading and little white lies for Stu, until the payphone rings.When Stu answers the phone, he is told by the caller (the disembodied voice of Kiefer Sutherland) that if he tries to leave the booth or hang up, he will be shot with a high powered rifle. To prove his point, Sutherland first shoots a toy robot at a nearby vendor stand, and follows with the execution of a strip club owner who has been harassing Stu to get out of the booth.Soon the police have gathered in force, led by Forrest Whitaker, believing that Stu was the one who shot the club owner, trying to diffuse what they think is a man gone berserk on a city street.Before his afternoon is over, Stu Shepard will be made to confess his two-faced, conniving ways to his wife, his would-be mistress, and to the world, at the hands of an unseen killer.What follows is a surprisingly gripping, entertaining hour and a half of movie packed with more than enough twists, turns and verbal pyrotechnics to make this thin premise work.For all that this film doesn't do in terms of movement, it more than compensates with a thick, verbal tension that rises and falls with moments of sheer terror and of much needed comedic relief. And while the film does possess a poorly hidden "trick" ending that doesn't wash down easily, when it's all over, the whole overcomes the lesser sum of its parts.Instead of the action-oriented drama created by such mindless "thrillers" as The Fast and the Furious and XXX, this film's refreshing hook is its use of words and genuine emotion to propel its story with as little gunplay and actual physical violence as is possible. This is the genius of this film, and why it's easy to overlook its flaws.For his part, Sutherland (The Lost Boys, TV's 24) is terrific. Both sadistic and moralistic, his caller is a man whose methods (illustrated in a brief description of two other victims) may be vicious and unnerving, but whose moral center seems uncomfortably familiar. It's easy to identify with his distaste for Stu and for other people he deems phony and dishonest.He is a mirror of our own morality and values.The case of Amadou Diallo, shot 41 times when the police mistook his wallet for a gun being pulled from his pants, is mentioned more than a few times, and it serves as also as a part of this film's mosaic of violence and morality.In an age of ambiguous morality, where people are waging war in the name of peace and where even police are prone to irrational acts of sudden panic and violence, this movie asks the question of how different are we than Sutherland's gunman?This film continues the credibility comeback for Schumacher, whose work here and in 2000's Tigerland, also with Farrell, have just about dug him all the way out of the hole his Batman movies dug for him more than half a decade ago. The real story here is Farrell.A steadily rising star since his head-turning performance in Tigerland, Farrell has scored supporting roles in such big budget, big profile flicks as Daredevil and Minority Report, and here delivers the goods as a leading man.His Stu Shepard is both disgusting and sympathetic, deceitful but painfully honest when pressed, and his performance is completely moving.When Stu finally breaks down under the weight of his impending death and threats to his wife's and to Pamela's safety, his confession is a raw, soul-bearing wrench of sobs and half-hearted laughs that is so raw and uncomfortable that it barely feels like acting.Here Farrell, a regular in the gossip columns for his various affairs with the likes of Britney Spears and Demi Moore, and a talk show regular for his boundless energy and profanity-laced humor, is absolutely astonishing, and every bit worth the hype that has surrounded his name.Written by B movie legend Larry Cohen (It's Alive, and The Stuff), Phone Booth has more than its share of holes and inconsistencies, and nobody is going to mistake it for great, but the performances and the sharp dialogue keep this movie well above sinking level. Farrell's performance alone would be worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie over the holiday (Labor Day) weekend and found it very frustrating.The movie is clearly a high budget Hollywood movie with good acting and quality visuals.But the people are sooooooooooooooooooooo stupid. You mean to tell me that the police could not figure out that a 'sniper' or a generally 'bad guy' is on the other end of the phone line of which the victim is speaking? But, noooooooooo. The cops drone on about how the lead character in the phone booth is actually the bad guy.How long would it take a competent cop to see that the pimp in the movie was shot IN THE BACK so it couldn't have been from the dude in the phone booth? How long would it take for the police to show up with huge microphones (the kind you see on NFL sidelines) to find out what the victim is saying ("sniff sniff - Why are you doing this to me? Why are you killing people?") to a unknown person on the phone?This ruined the whole movie for me. It took 60 minutes for the cops to figure out the guy in the phone booth was a VICTIM and not the shooter.AND...when the cops DID figure out that the dude in the booth was a target of a sniper, they let the victim's wife continue to get out of the police car (where she was safe) and back in to the path of the sniper's bullet.I just couldn't take the defiance of human nature of this entire movie.Turns out that this is a "Yeah, right!!!" movie for me. (Yeah, right - as in Rambo running across an open field with 20 M16s shooting at him and never getting hit - yeah, right!)The cops (and prostitutes for that matter) couldn't figure out the guy in the booth was in trouble and not the bad guy?Yeah, right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cerebral, high concept thriller plays well on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intriguing concept isn't it. A film that takes place entirely in a phone booth in which a man will be assassinated if he leaves the area. And then the police attempt to negotiate when he is thought to have shot someone. From the start, you can tell that this will be a good movie. The concept in itself is worthy of 80 minutes of your time. The movie gets all of its power from the long high-octane thrill, which carries on from start to finish in a deadly one act. The premise never wears thin and ends just at the right moment. It is very strange that instead of being a small-scale A grade flick, this is a large-scale summer blockbuster. And that is one of the films downfalls. Schumacher completely overplays the effect, which bogs down, what should have been, plot subtlety.I'm not saying that `Phone Booth' was bad. I'm just saying that it had the potential to be IMDb Top 250 material as a landmark in cinema history. But too often does Schumacher rely on 'outsider' help. The creation of modern era New York is perfectly realistic, but did this really need a narrator? This isn't helped by fast edits, split screens and flashbacks, which do nothing but lessen the effect. It must have been very easy to make. It might have been slightly better had they done the entire movie in one take and perhaps degraded the shots to make them look slightly less Hollywood like.The small details are occasionally impressive, but others are un-necessary. Case in point is the fact that they fiddled with the 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning. This was a neat idea when directors first started doing so, but here it just seems pointless. And they gave the opening a glossy `Broadway musical' style Barbershop score. But they have a dazzling `zoom in' on New York City. The outcome is accelerated by a shock ending which is followed by yet another shock ending which de-shocks that which we thought was true. That sounds confusing, but watch the film and you'll understand.Colin `I've been in a million movies this year' Farrell quite frankly overdoes the `look at me! I'm an asshole' act in the opening moments but once he's in the booth, the performance kicks in. They should really have an Academy Award for `Best Voice'. If they did, Keifer Sutherland would be a shoe-in, as the menacing, antagonistic vocals are right on target. It's just too bad they made the inexcusable mishap of putting him on the front cover, as it answers the question of `Will he show up or not?'. Supporting turns are good from Radha Mitchell, Forest Whitaker and Katie Holmes.Of course then there's all the symbolic, philosophical hokum that just doesn't work. Schumacher shouldn't have tried it out in the first place. You've probably noticed that most of what I've done in this review is complain about the picture, yet I still claim to like it. `Phone Booth' is great high-octane, thrilling fodder, but it had the potential to be a classic. My advice is to go in with low expectations and you won't be disappointed. My IMDb rating: 6.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was going into Phone Booth expecting a good movie to kill an hour and a half with. Instead I ended up watching a great movie that seemed alot longer, but in the good sense.I was completely unsure of what was gonna happen, and found myself starting to actually care about the characters which is a pretty rare occurance in today's films.Colin Ferrel gives a great performance in his role, truly showing that he has incredible range. On an unrelated note, I only found out he had an Irish accent about a week ago. He completly captures the character in his deliverly by at least looking like he's trying to not look scared.Kiefer Sutherland's job with his role should be etched in the mind of every voice actor on the planet. I don't think any other actor on the planet could of pulled this off so well.Every other performance in the movie aren't really memorable (with the possible exception of Forest Whitaker) but are solid and keep the quality of the film up.My only real complaint with the movie is the ending. It just took a lot away from Sutherland's character, showing his face took away alot of the mystery surrounding him.Regardless the movie kicks ass, probably the best movie of the year that doesn't completly cater to the Academy. It deserves at least a rental so go do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is different from the usual Hollywood stuff. A guy (acted by Colin Farrell) gets nailed in a phone booth in Manhattan by an invisible snipper at the other side of the line. He is far from being a bad guy by our current standards, but he is blackmailed by the snipper open his life and reveal his little dirty secrets first to his wife and girlfriend, and later to the local and national TV which show up on the spot - of course, together with a regiment of NYPD. The story is not fully bullet-proof, and some more logic could have helped. However, it is well acted, and the director Joel Schumacher put into story more artistic logic, which is what counts. Though similar fixed location stories have been screened previously, this film looks fresh and different in the context of the recent seasons. 8/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie I must confess that I didn't think it would be that good. I was like a movie about a guy in a phone booth, how exciting could it be??? But then I heard that Colin Farrell was in it and also got curious as to how it would end. Unfortunatly, I found that out right after it left theaters. So I decided to rent it. Believe it or not, I found it to be very exciting! It was very suspensful, and I think well put together. It's not like Oscar material or anything, but its really good. And every time Colin would cry I would really feel for him, so he is a really good actor in this movie (plus totally hot). And throughout the movie I was like, OMG how is it going to end! I was getting so curious. So I would watch it, and there is even like a twist at the end, but if you pay attention like I did throughout the movie you will catch it. I don't wanna give anything away but I will quickly tell a summary of the movie without giving anything major away. The movie is about this publisist named Stu (Colin Farrell) who is really kind of snobby. He thinks he is like better than everyone else. He has a beautiful wife at home, but yet he is still sorta cheating on her with this younger woman named Pam (Katie Holmes). I say sorta cheating because they have never actually slept together or kissed, but he like secretly calls her and stuff. Anyway, one day Stu goes in this phone booth to call Pam, and after he hangs up, the phone rings again. He picks it up and its this voice, aka. the bad guy (Keifer Sutherland). Anyway the voice starts to threaten him and stuff, but Stu doesn't take him seriously until he shoots this guy and kills him. Stu realizes that this guy is a sniper and can kill him at any moment. Anyway, to sum it up, throughout the movie the guy threatens Stu and then this whole police force shows up, of course thinking Stu killed the guy. Stu can't tell them he didn't because the sniper will kill him and the head police guy (Forest Wittaker) It gets really exciting. For instance the part where both Pam and Stu's wife Kelly show up and the sniper wants him to chose which one dies. Anyway, you really should watch it. I give it 3 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

The action proceeds quickly and the movie doesn't lollygag around with unnecessary character development.However...The fake laser dot blew everything. Here is a man supposedly facing death. Farrell is giving it everything he's got, but then he's asked to look down and react to a blatantly fake laser dot that has been superimposed on his shirt. And I'm telling you, it is an absolutely AWFUL job of faking the dot, too. I mean, it is a $4.50 special effect in a multi-million dollar movie. It is a tense scene, but I almost burst out laughing when I saw it. Everyone else watching the movie reacted audibly, most of them with a moan and a giggle.Other than that, a good effort for an unassuming film.You need to get a clue, Joel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*It is in the grand tradition of the very best of the king of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock that B-movie screen scribe Larry Cohen wrote the screenplay for 'Phone Booth'.A concept thriller that is not totally dissimilar to one of Hitchcocks classics.That being 'Rear Window' which starred regular Hitchcock star James Stewart.That took the simple premise of a wheelchair bound man who sits in his apartment and spys on his neighbours in the flat opposite with his binoculars.The result being that he unwittingly believes to have witnessed the brutal murder of a neighbours wife.It's not completely without surprise then that Cohen pitched 'Phone Booth' to the master of suspense back in the 70's.Sadly however Hitchcock passed and went on to direct 'Family Plot' which was his final movie.It wasn't until more recently that director Joel Schumacher(whose movies were as diversive as his eighties teen horror flick 'The Lost Boy's' up to the brilliant satirical thriller 'Falling Down' which starred Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall)decided that he wanted to direct an updated version of Cohen's script.The result would be a highly favourable one.The movies slight but fantastic premise involves a New york publicist by the name of Stuart Shepard(A brilliant Colin Farell).Shepard is the personification of the anti-hero.A,smarmy, arrogant,manipulative S.O.B. who coasts through life with little or no care for those around him.He lies not only to his clients but his loving wife Kelly(Radha Mitchell).Stu has a simple every day routine.Each day he visits a near by Phone Booth(which as mentioned in the movies prologue is to be pulled down)so that he may call a struggling waitress/actress called Pamela (Dawson's Creek star Katie Holmes) who he wishes to seduce.The reason for Stu's use of a phone Booth is that Kelly see's all of her husbands cell phone records and bills.What happens next though when Stu hangs up the phone after his conversation with Pamela is what reels the audience in.Stu makes the mistake of picking up the phones reciever when it begins to ring.On the other end is the movies sinister caller(Kieffer Sutherland)who tells Stu that he is armed with a rifle and that if the obnoxious publicist hangs up he will be shot and killed.Like wise if our 'anti-hero' attempts to call the police, again he will be killed.This is not totally unlike the premise of the Jan De Bont actioneer 'Speed' starring Keanu Reeves(If the bus drops below 50 it will explode.If you attempt to remove any passengers from the bus it will explode).To prove the point even further.When Reeve's first reieves a call from the movies villain as played by Dennis Hopper in the movie, it is from a phone Booth.What possible reason or motivation the caller might have for doing this to Stu is not what you might think.Immediately you are thinking that he he is a client that the smarmy publicist has wronged in some way.But that would be all too easy and obvious an answer.All too easy for someone as clever as Cohen who does the wise job of quickly erasing all possible causes or reason from our heads.straight away Cohen sets the cogs in our brains in motion.Never forgetting in his script to up the tension that bit more.Immediatly, beacuse we have seen how much of a manipulative bastard that Stu is, we side with the caller.But it is down to the combined manipulative talents of Cohen as a writer,Schumacher as a director and Ireland's own Colin Farrel as the obnoxious Stu that our loyalties shift and we begin to root for Shepard.It's all about the lesser of two evils as we find later on in the movie.Farell does the impossible.He manages to make Stu who we have seen thus far to be a complete arsehole,to be a likable human being with real conscience and emotions.Not an easy task but Farrel does it with raw talent and nerve.We actually begin to question how much of a creep Stu really is.He is of course aided by a good script from Cohen and what's more a first rate supporting cast.Of course as the movie plays out the police get involved and what better actor to portray one of New York's finest than the underrated black actor Forest Whitaker who was last seen in David Fincher's 'Panic Room'.although a flawed character, it is in the roll of Captain Ramey that Whitaker offers a parallel to the even more flawed man that Stu is.Ramey is basicly a decent guy who's obsessive dedication to his job resulted in the end of his marriage.Kudos must also go to Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes who offer stalwart support.Last but not least being Sutherland who is fantastic as the mysterious caller.Being limited to using only his voice, Sutherland somehow manages to make the caller a believable force to be reckoned with.Although quite obviously unhinged,Sutherland through his vocal talent is able to convince us that there is some sort of sound and clever mind beyond the insanity.A deadly combination indeed.Ultimately though this is writer, Cohen's movie.Without his script there would be no movie.That said however it is not without it's flaws.Too many immediate questions are left unawnsered.Such as how the caller knew so much about Stu's private life.That and the movies denounment seems a little uninventive and lazy.That said this is an above average thriller that utilises a simple premise to good effect.I only hope that future aspiring directors and screenwriters take note.Robs Rating:* * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually the first film i have seen that Colin Farrel has starred and if this performance is typical of the man then his hype is justified. Phone Booth is a very entertaining film that has a premise that has hardly been used before(the only time i can recall something like this is in Die Hard 3) and that is refreshing to see. 90% of the film is set in a Phone Booth and you would think this would get a bit tedius after a while but this is not the case and if anything the film was not long enough. It's unusual for a feature film to last only 80 odd minutes and perhaps the reason is that the director thought the audiance would not put up with a longer length of time in one place but in fact the short duration of the film is the film's biggest flaw. Good entertainment. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so stupid its unbelievable! The whole idea is to try to make a film thats cheap but has no story line so to get people to rent it and think its good is to put a good looking actor in it that everyone fancies like Colin Farrel. The film is SO short but i suppose you cant spend a whole night in a phone booth! What makes it even worse is you wouldnt bother staying on the stupid phone you would just hang up or not bother answering it at all!! I will never watch this film again as long as i live. And i wouldn't recomend it to ANYONE! Also what a waste of 91 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a strange little film this is! I cannot decide whether or not to like it or hate it.What you have is an amoral publicist, Stu, (played EXCEPTIONALLY well by Colin Farrell) who, one day, finds himself sighted by a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) when he calls a woman from a phone booth to have an extramarital affair. Kiefer Sutherland decides that force must be used to correct the amoral peoples walking the street.What conflicts me about this movie is that it is not clear what it tries to be and how to resolve it. This movie is packed with suspense, yet the ending leaves the viewer dissatisfied on many levels. It is very hard to empathize with the sniper who wants to correct Stu's behavior in an, albeit, misguided way. Yet, it is very difficult to empathize with Stu, whose only fault is the interest in having an affair. It is never established if he actually intends to carry through with this. As such, the viewer is left wondering who the real good guy is: the sniper who wants Stu to become honest with people? or Stu - who never has actually had any moments of indiscretion? Perhaps it is the Officer (Forrest Whitaker) who gets emotionally victimized by the sniper, in some ways, more so than Stu?If you want to see a really well done movie where good guys go on random murder sprees to kill bad men, then i would strongly recommend "The Boondock Saints". The suspense of this movie will entertain you for the 1hr 30 min run time (which is more like 1 hr 10 min without credits.) My lingering question is this: It is a shame that Hitchcock is not alive to have seen this film. I can't help thinking that he would have done a phenomenal job touching up the story...and am intrigued to guess at what scene he would've had his requisite cameo in... :)summary: For mindless suspense, thumbs up. For anything else, thumbs down. I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in years, mostly because it was so simple and skillfully directed. This film could well have been incredibly boring- after all, over 80 minutes focused on a man in a phone booth talking to a sniper could be as good as a sleeping pill, yet Colin Farrel's stellar performance and a witty script make it extremely watchable. While simply through its setting and plot it will never be able to reach the heights of a massive blockbuster, for what it is and its budget it is the greatest achievement filmwise i have seen in a very long time. The storyline is well worked out and builds to a nice climax, and without realising it you will be tense and on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. Twists and sudden turns in the movie make it unpredictable and hence keep the interest levels high. I had intended to enjoy my girlfriend's company when i went to watch this- instead i ended up engrossed in a fantastic drama/thriller which is sure to please most viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm, what can I say about this movie? Weak plot, overacting, unbelievable characters, plot holes so large you could drive a bus through......Like why did they keep letting "Kelly" jump out of the police car, when Forrest Whittaker's character knew there was a sniper out there? Shouldn't the police have been protecting her? ...Or why didn't Kelly mention to the police that a prank caller predicted her husband would tell her something important. Hey, your husband just confessed that he had a relationship with another woman -- why aren't you connecting the dots, lady? Maybe a sniper has him pinned down in a phone booth. ...At the end, why in the world would they give the suspect/victim a SEDATIVE?????? Don't you think the police would want to ask him a few questions first?This movie was utter and complete nonsense, which apparently went unnoticed by those wearing the Colin-Farrell-is-a-good-actor glasses.Very seldom do I feel cheated after seeing a DVD. After watching "Phone Booth", I felt robbed of 81 minutes.</fullReview>

The whole plot becomes tedious and at times predictable leading me to mentally urge Kiefer Sutherland to just shoot Farrell and get it over with. It's not the worst film I've seen by far, though you can only really expect to take a limited idea so far before it levels out and turns to boredom and frustration.Highlight of the movie? It's got to be the hilarious hookers harassing Farrell at the start.One other thought, this must have been the cheapest Hollywood movie to film ever, seeing as it's all literally shot in a phonebooth...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers Ahead*** Ok, ok, I already knew that a movie with a man stuck in a phone booth with some cuckoo telling him what to do and say could be boring, but I was with a friend and she really wanted to see it. I agreed only because I like Kiefer Sutherland as actor, even if I don't think Colin Farrel is neither cute or a good actor (actually, I can't stand him). The only thing worth the money was Sutherland voice, soo deep and sexy - you do not really pay a lot of attention to the voices if you see the faces too, I pay more attention to woman voice's - don't know why. Regarding the rest of the movie...thank God is not too long and about the moralistic part...who cares if Stu wants to have sex with the girl? He had just some thoughts, but he did not do it. If we all have to be punished for what we think, nobody could walk free!!! Who cares if he is a liar? He's in PR, people are supposed to know that he's lying!! If I was alone, I would have left after one hour...and I would have lost nothing, because at the end there is no surprise (c'mon, did you really believed that the killer was the pizza man? And that Stu was really shot to death?)Thank God, I had discount tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reluctant to see this film the first time i had the oppritiunity to watch it, mainly because of the trailers inability to grasp my attention. The concept of a man stuck in a phone booth seemed shallow to me.however....I did eventually watch it, and I have to say that I was tottaly impressed. In short, it was alot better than it looked. The film turned out to be a gripping suspense thriller, and in no way shallow. The caller turned out to be a beter antagonist than I could have imagined, and Collin Ferrel delivers a powerful performance as he is whittlled down by the all knowing Caller.The only negative points are the over use of curse words, and the occational continuity problem (you'll notice it, trust me) But those points aside, this movie is without a doubt a must see.9/10</fullReview>

You're never bored.I was however so impressed with Colin Farrell's performance in this film that I can't bash him. He is truly a rare talent. And it only took him one take to do that last dramatic monologue scene. The director's commentary was interesting in explaining the simple aspects of the film. I liked everything about this movie.

He shoots a man to prove again that he is for real, and everyone thinks it's Stu. With the police surrounding him, Stu cannot hang up the phone or he is gonna repaint the booth red.Completely taut, energetic thriller keeps you watching and never bores you.

		<fullReview>Phone Booth was a well-filmed, well-directed work. It contained excellent acting aside from the bit over-dramatized monologues from Forest Whitaker, but other than that it was relatively good. The best thing about this movie is the length. It is 75 minutes long, and then the credits roll. The length is perfect because there weren't any what I would call bullsh*t scenes that is just needless filler. The movie is short and sweet. However, I do have three complaints. The first is that the prostitutes were annoying, the acting, although good, is unrealistic, and the ending didn't resolve the way I felt that it should have. The movie has great suspense scenes and I would highly recommend renting this for a good movie quickie!</fullReview>

Colin Farrell gives the best performance i have seen him in, even though i have not seen many of his movies. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is so chilling yet often humorous. Very little action doesn't make it a boring flick. In fact, i only looked at the clock hoping the movie would keep going. Which brings me to my only complaint: it's only 81 minutes. Still, a fun movie with great acting, plenty of twists to keep you interested and possibly good enough to watch multiple times.

		<fullReview>In the world of New York City, one mans day of routine lies and betrayal becomes a situation of unexplainable events that pushes his own ego and life to the limit of collapse and heartbreak. Stu Shepard is a successful publicist who works the job of deceit living with it all in complete comfort disregarding those who are not valuable to his wallet and style. On a very well moving day, a trip to the nearest phone booth becomes a tiring battle for survival as he is held hostage by an anonymous sniper with the intent of punishing him for his sins and endless roads of lies. Collin Farrell leads the scene away into movie in his most groundbreaking performance to date, along with a great matching supporting cast of likeables such as `Forest Whitaker' and the chilling `Mr. Kiefer Sutherland'. `Phone Booth' is almost as good as the tension can get these days with Hollywood rapping up any half decent story they can find and throwing it at us with the hope that we'll actually pay to go see it. Fortunately, for us all, and with my intentions of laying my cards on the table, this is not one for those films. It is mind-teasing break into the world of suspense using very crafty plotting and camera work. Director Joel Schumacher has finally struck gold in this modern piece of entertainment by involving us into the feelings of the movies protagonist. We get our grins and edge of our seat moments by really beginning to care for our character and the ordeal he is going through. The whole movie gives a great sense of real time clockwork that adds up to the whole thing as the audience is thrown in to the situation of the whole `gun-point' scenario with great front row tickets. Topping it off with a cute twist along with a neat non-stretched time frame and were given a satisfying piece of filmmaking that's not attempting to be more than it is. `Phone Booth' gives us all the goods and I like the fact that you don't really have to go looking for something personally entertaining when you watch it. Sit back and enjoy the flick because finding a movie these days that really does put you on the edge of your seat almost throughout the complete feature time is pretty darn hard to dig up. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and gripping ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few flaws, including the introductory voiceover and a couple of minor and fleeting lapses in plausibility that don't affect the overall premise or plotline. Biggest problem for me, though, was the use of fast motion (not time lapse, which can be OK) in a couple of instances. To me, fast motion is unacceptable in a quality film, but at least the sequences were short enough not to kill the buzz.(Unlike others, I'm not bothered by the cops discussing the wiretaps though - c'mon guys, it's a standard plot device. Get over it.)That aside, it's very well scripted and acted. I thought that for the most part Farrell played his character perfectly, including the obnoxious jerk at the beginning and the somewhat altered character later in the film. Powerful stuff. I was absolutely gripped and at the edge of my seat, which doesn't happen on my couch cushions very often. Not groundbreakingly original, but still quite fresh and no one is just going through the motions here. A good story, well told. What else do you want?Ordinarily, I would not be able to rate this movie movie any higher than 7/10 due to the flaws mentioned above. But because of how exceptionally well it grabbed me personally (which is absolutely THE primary reason a movie in this genre should exist) I'm bumping my rating up to 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Phone Booth is one of those movies that's better to watch on video than in the theatre. The film is 81 minutes long, and those 81 minutes are spent entirely with Colin Farrell's character inside a phone booth, being held down by a sniper. Some of the dialogue is quite hilarious, and considering what a scumbag Farrell's character is, maybe being held at bay with a rifle scared him into going straight.Kiefer Sutherland almost steals the movie as the sniper on the other end of the line, and we don't get to see his face until the very end!Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie makes up for all the movies you've seen that are all actiona and no plot, but this movie is mostly plot with very little action. The acting was great, but it is difficult to have a full length feature film with a single location. You see, in Speed, even though most of the movie was on the bus, the intro and finale were in other locations, and there were flashes to other primary characters throughout the film. The stagnant nature of the setting made the movie a little tough to watch, but, all in all, a positive experience. Don't watch this movie thinking that you're going to be able to concentrate on anything else, though, because you'll probably miss something you'll regret later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" is about a New York publicist Stu Sheperd (Colin Farrell) who is your typical a**hole. He's stuck-up, snobby, selfish, and an all-around liar. He goes to the same phone booth, every day at the same time, to call his girlfriend Pam (Katie Holmes), so his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) won't find out. But one day, he goes to call his girlfriend. When he's done, the phone rings again, and he's instantly target of a sniper (Keither Sutherland), who makes him follow his orders and threats.I thought this movie was brilliantly planned and amazing. Colin Farrell does a wonderful job as Stu, and I was also impressed by Katie Holmes's job because I think she's usually a teen actress. Forest Whitetaker and Keither Sutherland also got my attention in the movie. Overall: acting, plot, setting, and characters were well-done (A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who will sigh and classify this movie as a rather boring one just after knowing the fact that it features basically one telephone conversation running throughout one hour, I say, don't be so frustrated yet. Yes, what you know is right. But what you think is not right. You can never presume what's waiting for you. Go watch the movie... and in the end you'll come up with an experience that an average Joe Moviegoer is less likely to have.The reason behind I praise this so much is simply that it creates a tension all throughout with just a conversation. No scene change, no location change, no chase sequence, no creepy or gory scenes, no dark thrill... and definitely not an usual eye candy. Yet, it is the one of the most stylish thrillers I've ever seen. Thanks to superb cinematography and director Joel Schumacher. The cult beginning is one of its plus points too. The screenplay contains too much f-words, yet it is the heart and soul of the movie. I liked it very much, with that chilling voice of Keifer Sutherland.Man of the moment Colin Farrell is always nice to watch. He has his special style in full bloom in the first part of the movie. Yet he becomes quite able to portray the rapid change in Stuart's character throughout. I think it is his best work since Tigerland. The other casts, especially Forrest Whitaker also acted accordingly. In the end I grade this movie as a very stylish indie film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phone Booth: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cell phones are quickly overtaking pay phones as the premiere on-the-run communications device. However, that doesn't stop Joel Schumacher from making a fast-paced 80-minute thriller that takes place inside of a simple phone booth, one of the only ones left in New York. Much like Panic Room in that it takes place in an enclosed space and like Se7en in the motives of `The Caller', Phone Booth almost entirely takes place inside of a phone booth in which Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) enters to make a call to his current fling Pam (Katie Holmes).Stu is a PR man, and he's not exactly the most honorable of all people. He calls Pam from a pay phone because his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) checks his cell phone bill. However, as he's about to leave the booth, it rings and on the other end is a mysterious man, The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) tells him to stay on the line or else he will shoot Stu with a sniper. Because the MPAA thinks that after national tragedy we can't handle movies that are even somewhat based on the topic, Phone Booth was delayed five months from the Washington, D.C. sniper attacks. Although the hulk of the film is around The Caller, it's also interesting to look at how Stu changes throughout this 80-minute film. It's pretty amazing that we could feel so much for Stu when we don't know much about him, and what we do know was in a brief part of 80 minutes.Not only is Phone Booth an interesting character study, it also is pretty thrilling. There's nothing worse than a feeling of helplessness, and that's what we feel along with Stu. He has to do what the Caller says or else he'll be shot, and he has to do what the police say or else he'll be shot by the police. He has no choices, and has to do what people tell him to do. What makes Phone Booth an interesting ride is how much I liked the Caller. Sure, the movie couldn't work without the police coming into play, but I was just waiting for another scene in the phone booth with the Caller preparing to wreck more havoc. Sutherland was perfect for the role, with his unique voice and his exceptional acting really holding the film together. Farrell, who I liked before he became the subject of tabloids, does a pretty good job.One of the most remarkable parts of the film was its cinematography. Matthew Libatique did an exception job, with varying distance shots and great angles. A few times, when Stu was in the phone booth, it had a rounded shape to it. It's hard to explain but it looked really great. Now, I'm sure you're wondering if I've only said good things about it why I only gave it a 7/10. I hated the ending. I thought that it was just a cheap way to tie everything together. Did anyone not expect it? Also, it wasn't highly thrilling, just mildly. But, if you overlook that, you'll find a big film based on a small idea that really is a small-budget film hiding under the cover of Hollywood.My rating: 7/10Rated R for pervasive language and some violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising, but not only in good ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife rented this movie thinking that it would be "my kind of movie" and I'm glad to say that I wasn't horribly disappointed. For such a simple story, it was able to hold my attention for most of the movie. Unfortunately, there were several moments when I felt myself being drawn out of the story because things just didn't jive. It was very obvious to me that this movie was short on budget and short on time.For example, there is a scene where the cops are discussing tapping the phone, and the officer in charge, has to ask the patrolman what the rules are for doing so. It's ok, to trace a call, but not listen in... It's just a little too obvious an attempt at explaining why they were handling things the way they were. Add to that other not so clever attempts at making this a meaningful movie and you find yourself repeatedly being immersed in the gripping story, then yanked back to reality because something just didn't mesh...Those finding a religious theme to this movie would find it on a trip to the grocery store. The only thing clever about this movie is the basic premise of a guy trapped on the phone by a sniper. There is no deep meaning behind the any of the sniper's actions and the movie ends kind of flat with a very overused ending. There was no revelation. There was no retribution. Nothing.Overall, I would say this movie is worth watching, but if you're looking for action, this isn't for you. If you're looking for horror, stay away. Although there are funny parts, this is not a comedy. It's not a love story. Basically, it's a suspenseful thriller with parts of the above movie types thrown in to keep it from being too boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this in a moment of weakness (it was free) and lived to regret it. No one in the family liked it, although we watched it to the bitter end, hoping something would come along to redeem it. From the get-go, the plot is preposterous: a no-account hustler answers a ringing pay phone and can't get himself to hang up on the nutjob on the other end. This unfortunately goes on for 90 minutes. Most of us wouldn't have answered the phone or hung up pretty quick. Split screens, employed to break up the monotony of watching a guy talking on a phone for 90 minutes, only make matters worse. They are poorly done. And to top it off, the ending is a cheat. No spoilers here but I will say this same kind of cheat has been done in a dozen films over the years, usually to the detriment of the film. Colin Farrell is an interesting actor, but not here. Schumacher has done far better work. FALLING DOWN comes to mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PHONE BOOTH is an interesting film-school exercise adapted for the big screen with a big star. Its short running time is merciful, although my complaint is not with the performance of Farrell, who is required to carry the movie entirely on his shoulders and manages admirably.My major issue is that the film's hook - that of spending 84 minutes watching Stu talking on the phone with a madman - calls for irritating split-screen and picture-in-picture execution, which is used continuously until we're accustomed to it. Then, for no reason that I can discern, the director abandons the device for long stretches of time - 45 seconds, a minute - during which the protagonist, as near as I can tell, does nothing.I could overlook how fast and loose the story plays with police procedure (no photographs taken of a body at the scene before it's carted off in a coroner's van, for example), but not how fast and loose it plays with its own supposed theme. (Potential spoilers follow.) We are supposed to believe that Stu is in the same league with other victims of this sniper, who seem to have deserved their executions; however, Stu is neither so nice as to gain our sympathy nor so bad as to deserve what he's getting. The point of the film, therefore, seems to be that "everyone is guilty of something and will hate themselves for it if enough pressure is applied." I'm not sure I needed to spend 84 minutes of my life being told that.This may be worth watching for Farrell's performance, depending upon whether you're a fan, but I don't recommend it as a great film. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension around every corner...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting quite a long time to see this, and now that I have seen it, I am amazed. PHONE BOOTH manages to keep the tale flowing smoothly and in such a confined space. Director Joel Schumacher hits out two in a row with first BAD COMPANY and now PHONE BOOTH. This film was the better of the two.Well, when the movie first started, I was a little worried. Because, there is no music, bad sound, and the picture wasn't the greatest for the first ten minutes of the movie and it almost seems like you're watching some cheap independent film. But, when Colin Farrell finally gets into the booth, things heat up immensely. Colin Farrell...hmmm, is he the guy who has been playing in every other movie to try and make a name for himself? He sure is! Now that everyone saw him in THE RECRUIT, DAREDEVIL, MINORITY REPORT, and AMERICAN OUTLAWS everyone likes the guy. All the young girls think he's hott for some reason, and he is actually able to reel in the money. Wow, he really made something of himself quickly. He does also have some real acting potential.The film is actually kinda preachy and has religious undertones to it that not too many people actually noticed. It has eerie similarites to David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN in which a killer kills people according to the seven deadly sins. This is very similar. Because this sniper that holds Farrell in the booth did not just randomly pick him out. He thought about it first.Aside from the film's biblical and preachy sub-theme, PHONE BOOTH didn't bother me too much. It's confined area (which supposedly got on some people's nerves after a while) really isn't all that bad. The street is shown, there is a lot of tension which causes people to move around in their seats, I'm sure, and Colin Farrell keeps the story moving. Forest Whitaker doesn't have that big of a part, and neither do Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes. Keifer Sutherland on the other hand is hardly ever even seen in the film. He plays the voice of the caller and is seen in brief shots only. Funny how he managed to recieve star-billing. My bottom line-rating, PHONE BOOTH is tense beyond all belief. I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it. Recommendations: PANIC ROOM, and SE7EN.PHONE BOOTH: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning possible spoiler This is a thrilling drama for adults who can handle the mature subject matter... This intense drama, which takes place in and around a single phone booth in New York City, a man who is being watched by a killer with a sniper rifle must use the phone to save his life. The Caller with his god complex was out to force Shepard to repent and redeem himself of his sins against all those to whom he had lied, especially to Kelly and Pamela. Redemption of our sins is possible only through the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ, but at least it is a choice [Heb. 5:9]. Redemption, as vain as it might be, at gunpoint is not. This film was artfully done...in addition to being gripping and artfully done, the film makes moral statements that reflect Scriptural truth.Your sin will find you out (Num. 32:23). What a man sows he shall reap (Gal. 6:7). Marital fidelity means being faithful in thought as well as deed (Matt. 5:27-28. I liked the scene where the Caller blows apart a street small toy robot near the base of the phone booth. Stu picked up parts of the toy, making it appear Stu destroyed the toy. The vendor demanded Stu pay for the toy. To avoid the vendor getting involved and possibly killed, Stu paid for it. Though he did not have to pay for he wasn't the one who shot the toy. He did for the vendor's sake, not his own. Much like Jesus paid for our sins without ever having sinned Himself. Jesus did not have to pay the price of our sins, but He did [Matt. 26:53]. For our sakes, not His own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really have never seen a movie like this before. Technically it should be boring because it all takes place in one area, but it isn't boring. In fact, it is one hell of a suspenseful movie. The beginning is kind of cheesy, but it sets up a story that most of us already know anyway. This guy named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) has to get to this phone booth in New York City. Well, he gets to that phone booth about 10 minutes into the movie and leaves that phone booth once after he is in it and that's like 7 minutes before the movie ends.Between those times so much happens, yet so little changes. This is probably one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen since John Carpenter's "The Thing." You really fell like you are the one in the phone booth, but not like your life is threatened, but for some other reason that just makes your heart race.They managed to put Colin in the booth for and hour and a half and still found things for him to do. To tell you the truth he could have been in there longer if they wanted to make that happen. While the twists are kind of predictable, they make what could have been a "Everyone lives happily ever after..." ending into something more. I think the movie would have been a lot better, suspense wise, if they didn't give Kiefer Sutherland a box cover credit. Other wise,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Mature Climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The normal mainstream scury of the New York streets gets a rude interruption when a man gets singled out and held hostage in a phone booth by an unknown sniper. It's understandable why this movie was not released on its original date due to sniper shootings in the D.C. Metropolitan area. What I can not understand is why this movie wasn't released on HBO or DVD instead of the big screen.The movie is not horrible, in fact it is well done. Suspenseful with a 'Dog Day Afternoon' humor (and split shots). I just feel that with the extending movie prices (don't make me say I remember when...) the audience should be getting at least 90 minutes of footage, even if it's a 15 minute close-up on Colin's eyebrows. Currently, today's prices cost us a little over ten cents a minute for a 90 minute film. Films such as 'The Pianist' cost about 6 cents/minute. 'Phone Booth' costs us 13 cents a minute to watch and presents no considerable evidence of why we pay extra.There's my rant. Other than that the movie hits home to many I'm sure, though I never have been appreciative of 'the bad guy teaching us good morals' plot, the falicy lies there within. The movie's main focus is the 'what would you do' factor in which the newest Ausie Sex Idol, Colin Farrell delivers an amazingly emotional performance. There are tense moments abound as the swat team surrounds the area and constantly cocks their guns (ironic to the caller's earlier statement). However, the final confrontation comes unexpectedly and fizzles off to the credits too soon, there was plenty of room for more movie (even if just a close-up of Colin for the ladies). The split scenes as well were random, distracting, and no help to the mood of the movie.Bottom Line: Sorry to those who saw it at the theaters, maybe worth renting, but better when it comes to cable. Good movie for the short attention spanned ADD television addicts.</fullReview>

There are only three gunshots with only one man shown killed. Everything happens in real time with the whole movie being filmed in 12 days. Overall, this was a one-man movie-Colin Farrell?fs. This kind of opportunity comes once in a lifetime and I think that Farrell failed to take complete advantage of it. Or perhaps that?fs his potential. I am not saying that he wasn?ft good just that it could?fve been better. "Phone Booth" is far from flawless, nevertheless because of the aforementioned reasons worth a call.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a self-centered egotisical publicist who uses others to his advantage. One day he answers a phone ringing in the phone booth that he uses regularly to set up his clandestine meetings with girlfriend Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes). On the other end of the line is an unknown caller (voiced by Keifer Sutherland) who threatens Shepard with death if he hangs up. At first, Shepard doesn't take the caller seriously. But then events unfold which prove to him that the caller is very very serious. Soon the police are alerted and arrive on the scene headed up by Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker). Meanwhile, the caller starts playing mind games with Shepard, in effect becoming his conscience. He forces him to admit to his affair with Pamela to his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) and to berait and be-little Capt. Ramey. But why has the caller singled out Shepard? Who is this caller and will Shepard be able escape his claustraphobic prison? Colin Farrell gives a superb performance in the lead role. He has to carry most of the film from within the confines of a phone booth. His character starts out as a self confident devil may care individual, but is reduced by the caller's taunts to become a repentant quivering and blubbering mass, embarrassed in front of his wife, mistriss and eager assistant Corky (Arian Ash). Paula Jai Parker in particular, and Tia Texada are good as two hookers trying to get Stu off of the phone so that they can set up their next "appointments". Director Joel Schumacher gives us 81 minutes of gripping psychological drama that will keep you riveted to your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Phone Booth" is a psychological thriller about a publicist (Colin Farrell) who is held up in a phone booth by a mysterious sniper (Kiefer Sutherland). Chaos ensues, and soon a police captain (Forrest Whitaker) shows up to "help".As you can probably imagine, the hardest part about making this movie would be the fact that Sutherland is off-screen for the entirety of the film. This would mean that the two would have a hard time communicating (and making it believable) throughout the film. The actors still manage to do this perfectly. Sutherland's voice is needed alone; he sounds creepy and cold, while heartfelt and funny. Farrell is believable as the scared, weeping Stu.The best scenes of "Phone Booth" would probably be when Stu tries to make deals with The Caller to protect himself. The Caller acts along with it for a while, and then laughs it off. The Caller is funny, philosophical, cold and creepy, and all with his voice! The Caller goes down in my list as one of the best movie villains of all time."Phone Booth" is a fast, intense movie that is definitely worth watching, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some good films you miss for one reason or another. Thankfully, I picked up the DVD, not knowing what to expect. This is a sensational piece of filmmaking. I speak as one who has spent his life in the business. First Colin Farrell's performance is career defining. His range is huge. He has superstar written all over him. Second, Kiefer Sutherland, the voice on the phone gives a vocal performance reminescent of Orson Wells during Radio's Golden Era (if you've ever heard Lucille Fletcher's "The Hitchiker" you know what I mean). The direction was a combination of MTV and the best of Oliver Stone. It rivets your attention for the relatively short 81 minutes of the film. The only other actor I can imagine in this film with the range necessary is Al Pacino, and I'm afraid he's a little long in the tooth. 99% of what gets on the screen is formula. This was about making a film in ten days on one set. The director's challenge, same as in "12 Angry Men", how do you keep the pacing up on a one set shoot. It's all about cutting, and one fantastic tracking shot that begins the film. This was the work of pros. I'm a pro and I should know. I give it a 10/10. If you haven't seen it, run, do not walk to your local rental store or buy it, which I'm going to do. I'll put it next to "Any Given Sunday" another filmmaker's masterpiece and "Dog Day Afternoon". This is what our industry should be turning out instead the "The Incredible Bulk"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[insert spoilers here:]Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth is a film that is best watched alone, or with an intimate group of people. In the tradition of Liberty Stands Still, Phone Booth basically mimics the screenplay of that film, but on a slightly less of a standard. Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a froo-froo NYC businessman who is having an affair with a significantly younger woman. The girl, Pamela (Katie Holmes), is a struggling newcomer actor to the city, in hopes of Shepard's attempts to make her a household name. Radha Mitchell stars as Shepard's wife, Kelly. The film starts with Stu parading around downtown NYC, and talking to Pamela in the "possibly last remaining solo standing phone booth" in the area. The reason Stu calls Pamela from the phone booth opposed to his cell phone, is that his wife Kelly may get suspicious about countless calls to a mysterious girl who she may believe Stu is seducing. The trouble is that he is trying to get into Pamela's pants, and he's not the only one who knows about it.On this fateful afternoon, Stu Shepard receives a call in this phone booth, shortly after hanging up with Pamela. He answers, and soon realizes that his life has done a complete 180. In an 80-minute interval, Stu's entire scandal is played out as a man who knows all his secrets keeps him on the line, threatening him with a gun which could take him out without a single person noticing. The thought is frightful, but it's been done before.The film Liberty Stands Still is basically Phone Booth with the booth switched for a hot dog cart. Since Liberty was, indeed, made first, I believe that Phone Booth, though semi-entertaining, was a blatant ripoff.Shepard and his mysterious phone pal treat the audience to a series of mostly predictable sequences, before the entire film wraps up in ultimate cliche fashion. I wouldn't say I was let down after this film, but I wasn't blown away either. Halfway through, I felt the film was a bit dragging; this could possibly because it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadfully slick formula flick, but maybe the first "feel-good" sniper movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gimmicky, long-winded performance skit has Joel Schumacher directing his pal, Colin-bad-boy-Farrell, in what should have been a cable-TV-movie-of-the-week. It's a hack job from the get go, filled with goofy characters and sappy dramatics. More sex and violence might have made this into a pleasurable junk piece, but it's about as feel-good a sniper picture as you could get! Ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many times the best films are the simplest ones. The ones with almost no sub-plots; and with an economy of running time, dialogue, and characters. "Phone Booth" is such a film.During the opening moments, a narrative voice mentions that there is one enclosed phone booth left in all of New York, that it is scheduled to be replaced with a phone kiosk tomorrow, and this is the story of the last time it will ever be used. And then *BANG*! Well, not really. About 5-10 minutes are used to set up the character of Stu (Colin Farrell), but in just a few minutes, we know that he is a hot-shot publicist and egotistical jerk. He goes to the phone booth to call a fledgling actress he represents--and secretly fantasizes about (Katie Holmes). When he hangs up on the girl, the phone rings and he picks it up. It is an anonymous sniper (this site and countless reviews have already given away who the actor is, but I still think revealing his identity would be a spoiler) who makes it known that he has been following Stu for a long time and listening in on all his phone calls. The sniper has been picking off selfish yuppie scum over the last few weeks and Stu is next. Apparently Stu's main crime is to fantasize and flirt with the actress, even though he has no intention of leaving--or even cheating on--his beautiful, devoted wife (Radha Mitchell). And if Stu hangs up on the sniper, he will be dead.And it just escalates from there. To reveal more would be unfair.This film's great strength--as I mentioned earlier--is its simplicity and compactness. There are no throw-away characters (with the possible exception of a white gangsta rapper in the opening scene), scenes, or lines. Unfortunately, the simplicity sometimes also undermines the film. Katie Holmes--normally a very fine actress--is given almost nothing to do. And Stu manages to get out of his predicament doing something that an earlier scene showed he could not do without the sniper's knowing.But overall, this--like "Rope", "Dial M for Murder", or "Wait Until Dark"--provides a great amount of thrills with only a limited amount of running time and only one set. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiefer's Best Performance (Even though he's not in the movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hopefully Phone Booth will take away some of the stigma Joel Schumacher earned for himself as a result of Batman and Robin.I won't bother running down the plot-points, since that's been done thoroughly throughout. This is an above average movie with an engaging plot and solid performances. Even though Kiefer Sutherland only has about 8 seconds of actual screen-time, he is clearly the most captivating aspect of the entire spectacle. Not only does he have one of the most instantly recognizable voices in Hollywood, but his abrasive staccato easily dominates every scene.The movie has an adequate running time of 81 minutes which is just enough to accomplish everything the film sets out to do. Any longer than that and you would end up with a tedious monotonous movie that drags on for far too long.My only real criticism is the illogical segue into the second act. A pimp gets shot in the streets of New York and before you know it, eighteen cars with cops with kevlar vests are on the scene. The only reason they are there is based on the unreliable witness accounts of three overly-dramatic prostitutes. This was a bitter pill for me to swallow. But if you can get manage to turn off your "logic circuits" for a few minutes, I think you will be able to forgive it in light of the later dramatic sequences.Sutherland rocks. I'm glad to see him doing movies again. (Or NOT see him, as the case may be).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having finally seen this exceptional and original movie I can now safely say that this is the best movie of 2002 that I have seen so far. Exciting, emotional, intense, genius, brilliant ? all these words and more can be used to describe this amazing thriller that is ?Phone Booth'.Stuart (Colin Farrell), a New York publicist, is at a phone booth after just finishing a conversation with Pamela (Katie Holmes), a young woman whom he is trying to get into bed, despite already being married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell). When the phone rings Stuart picks it up probably believing it to be Pamela calling back, unfortunately for him he has just answered a call from a man with a rather twisted view on morality (Kiefer Sutherland) and now is at the mercy of the caller who proves to the distressed Stuart that he is able to see Stuart's every move through the sight of the sniper rifle he has targeting the phone booth.This movie is pure genius in my opinion. In the space of around an hour and a half we are taken through almost every possible emotion without ever really leaving the phone booth. ?Phone Booth' is certainly an emotional rollercoaster of a movie and it's surprising that such a simple idea can result in one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion, and now my favourite movie of last year. ?Phone Booth' is a chilling and intense examination of how far one man will go to keep his secrets. Which is more important ? your life or your secrets? Just how much would you try to withhold if your life were on the line? On top of that, would you value your own life over that of those you love? All these questions are tackled in the movie and are dealt with extremely well and with a definite air of credibility. Despite his dishonest traits it becomes easy to empathise with Stuart to the point where you can literally feel what he is feeling. This is a brilliant quality for a movie to have and ?Phone Booth' manages to immerse the viewer into its world. Morality questions are also asked, is it right for someone to kill someone else on the basis that the victim was morally corrupt? In some ways there is an underlying social commentary on the state of the world today present in ?Phone Booth' which asks a lot of questions without taking an overly serious approach. Even though it cannot be denied that this is indeed a very dark, and in some ways disturbing, movie there are still some humorous times intermingled with moments that can almost bring the viewer to tears.The acting has to be some of the best I have seen in a long time from almost every member of the cast even right down to the actors with lesser parts. Colin Farrell puts in a performance that in my opinion is worthy of so much more than an MTV Movie Award and he is supported brilliantly by the veteran Forest Whittaker who plays his role as police Captain Ramey with style. Between Stu and Ramey a bond forms almost reminiscent of the bond between McClane and Powell in ?Die Hard'. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is chilling as the twisted `caller' and certainly helps to create the dark atmosphere that ?Phone Booth' portrays. This really is a film that needed strong acting to work, and luckily strong acting is what it had. As more than ninety per cent of the film takes place in one area there is no need for rip-roaring action scenes or multi-million dollar special effects but instead a need for a strong cast. Every single performer in ?Phone Booth' deserves recognition as they are the people who made this movie great. Joel Schumacher deserves some credit too for the way he directed this movie and Larry Cohen for writing such an amazing screenplay but even so it is the cast that made the film what it is.I'm not going to go on and on about how amazing this movie is as I believe I have already said enough. If you haven't already seen this movie I certainly recommend that you check it out. My rating for ?Phone Booth' ? 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colin Farrell shines in this movie, portraying Stu Shepard, a publicist who takes advantage on everyone around him. He's married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell), but is trying to get young female Pam (Katie Holmes, Dawson's Creek &amp; Go) into bed. On this particular day Stu, as always, has gone to a phone booth (the last closed one) to call Pam, which he has to do from the phone booth, since Kelly checks who he's called from his cell phone. After having finished the call the phone rings. Stu answers it and for the remaining 70 or so minutes we really get to see how great an actor Colin Farrell really is.He is hardly outside the phone booth during the rest of the movie, which leaves him with not much space to show off his acting-skills, but he not does it not only good, but fantastic.Kiefer Sutherland plays the caller. He is also left with not much space, as he only has his voice to "act" with. He too does it great.Forest Whitaker is great as well portraying Captain Ramey.And let's not forget the three hookers (Paula Jai Parker, Arian Ash &amp; Tia Texada). Those three are quite simply hilarious whenever they're supposed to be and the rest of the time you just feel like jumping out of your seat to break their necks.Overall: Top class performances.The movie is a psychological thriller and would fall completely through if it wasn't for the chemistry between Farrell &amp; Sutherland as well as Farrell &amp; Whitaker. However great the performances are the movie just doesn't make you sit, and stay seated, at the edge of your seat. The only times I actually felt that happening was when there was complete silence. Then you're just placed solid in your chair wondering what's going to happen next.After watching Phone Booth, the first movie that came to my mind when thinking of other movies to compare it to, was Silence of the Lambs, another psychological thriller. Silence of the Lambs can really make you sit at the edge of your seat, at times forgetting you actually have to breathe. That is the one thing Phone Booth doesn't make you forget often enough. Phone Booth also has its funny parts, not just the three hookers. Especially the Farrell &amp; Whitaker-scenes are fun, mainly when Farrell passes on comments from Sutherland to Whitaker. They're cruel, but hilarious.Definately a must-see for anyone who enjoys this genre. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, I'm sure you'll find this one good as well.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth, from director Joel Schumacher, is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat for all of 81 minutes running time. Larry Cohen, who pitched this story to Hitchcock many years ago, has constructed a screenplay so engaging that hesitant viewers will immediately be taken with the story and the many twists that unfold throughout the film. Colin Farrel is perfectly cast as Stu who comes across as a jerk at the beginning of the film, but as the story progresses we eventually feel sympathy for this character and care what happens to him.Kiefer Sutherland is also worthy of note as The Caller. Kiefer Sutherland was also brilliantly cast as the voice of the Sniper that holds Stu hostage in the phone booth, but for those of us who watch 24 (like me) some of the impact may be lost. The way this film plays out is so similar to that of 24, (although of course this was filmed before it) - it unfolds in real-time, there is excellent use of split screen and there are slick visuals and photography -, that Sutherland's voice could be seen as a distraction.Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes are both competent in their roles as Stu's wife and girlfriend, but it is Forest Whitaker as a sympathetic cop negotiating with Stu (somewhat similar to his character in Panic Room) who gives the film an emotional and believable edge.Phone Booth is an accomplished ,taut thriller which is both unpredictable and believable and does not insult the audiences intelligence like so many other films these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The setting should limit the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion the setting of the film, at first glance seemed quite ignorant. I didn't see how anyone could succesfully base a film about a man trapped in a phone booth. However Schuemecker is able to make the phone booth seem infinitely larger than it really is. Also I liked the trivial back story about the history of the phone at the beginning. The true joy of this film though is its' simple eccentricities. The way that you truly dislike the main character of the film only five minutes into it. The fact that you can see how naive and self absorbed nearly everyone in the film truly is. The acting from Forest Whitaker was unuasually weak in this movie, and this proved to be quite an annoying missing link. Because of Kiefer Sutherland's brilliant voice-over, playing off of Collin Farrel so well Whitaker stuck out like a sore thumb. His place is in B films and he should just learn to stay there. Farrel however again proves to everyone that he is capable of acting to a degree. Though his character was pretty one dimensional and the emotional degree to which Farrel drove his character seemed unnecassary to me, he did serve the purpose of the role very well. He was a perfect patsy, a man we could all point the finger at and go "I've done that but I can't believe he's doing that...". A normal man driven over the edge in his own world. But when someone steps in to set things right the film really takes off and from that point on you are glued to the edge of your seat. I'd give this movie eight out of ten stars and here are the reasons why: It has been so long since a good movie has been under two hours I can hardly rememeber it. Kiefer Sutherland, Kiefer follows the footsteps of his father into some of the best actors that have ever graced the silver screen. And the originality of the film, GOD ITS GOOD TO SEE SOMETHING NEW! I don't remember when something this radically different from everything else hit the screens... everything from the settings to the actual plot line itself is wonderfully original. I suggest you rent it right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth: 7.5/10One of the best concepts in recent times, this movie could easily have failed because it was set in virtually the same place for most of the 81 minutes (it seems longer). It took a strong performance by Colin Farrell to make this a super movie. Basically, he's in a phone booth talking to some nutjob who knows more than he should. Some hookers bother him because they want the phone. He won't let them, and they get their boss, and the boss gets shot by a sniper rifle. The police come and think Stu (the character, not me) shot the guy, so Stu has a sniper aimed at him from the nutjob in a high-rise and guns pointed at him from the police. He can't leave the booth, or the sniper will kill him, nor can he tell the police why he won't come out for the same reason. This turns into a wildly intense psychological thriller, and never gets boring. Farrell does a great job, and makes this one of the highlights of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a member of the minority, in that I, proudly and without revocation, HATE Joel Schumacher. Whenever I say this, after ducking out of the way of the rotten tomatoes and kitchen appliances aimed at my head, people throw "8MM" and "Tigerland" in my face.I'll admit, these were great movies; phenomenally acted, brilliantly written, standouts in their respective genres. However, I can't, try as I might, get past the death of Batman. Not the character, obviously, but the franchise was murdered when Schumacher took the helm from an absolutely brilliant visual mastermind in Tim Burton. Neon tommy guns? Characters flying through the air on rigs so poorly constructed that you can see them change speeds in mid-flight? And characters who, though over-the-top by nature, are so far flung from the carefully crafted reality built by Burton that Batman was no longer a Dark Knight; hell, he was 2 steps shy of being Captain Amazing from Mystery Men, with his cape and cowl plastered with the corporate logos of the crap he was schilling. After walking out of the theatre in disgust and cursing the cool Spawn action figure I COULD have bought with my $12, I swore I would never again see another movie by Joel "I Killed Batman" Schumacher.And then along came Phone Booth. I learned a while ago not to too fully research a movie before going to see it, for obvious reasons, and as such, as I settled into my seat to see a film that had garnered the review of my friend of "Dude, this movies kicked ASS", I was mortified to see Schumacher's name emblazoned on the screen in those huge blue letters. I stayed, but was prepared to not even give this one the benefit of the doubt. And then, after the opening montage, it began. It began so quickly I felt like I was running along the street with Farrel trying to keep up. The dialogue was perfectly hackeneyed, the camera shake was perfectly, the dirty-silver-nitrate treatment on the film added that hot, hazy New-York feel...I felt wrapped up in the moment almost immediately. And this if the first 10 minutes.All in all, I'd say Phone Booth is a triumph of writing and acting more than it is of directing. This is another fine example of how casting can make or break a film. WHile I'm sure there a dozen a**hole actors out there who could play Stu's part (Jay Mohr, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Damon all come to mind), I doubt that any of them could have been that good an a**hole; as easy to hate as to have pathos for, as easy to reject as to identify with. Keiffer Sutherland lends the perfect touch of villainy, acting as judge, jury and executioner to any "evil-doer", to use a coloquial presidential word-o'-the-week, that he feels is a denigration of modern society, ethics, and just plain old manners. By the end, you wind up being not too sure whom to root for, but a very satisfying climax ensues, and the ordeal is over as quickly as it started. Just another New York day that will be forgotten by dinner time.Phone Booth is quick, smart, edgy, and best of all, short. It is no longer than it absolutely needs to be. There are no superfluous characters, no side plots, no in-jokes, no tangents, no life-altering lessons about the state of the world. It is simply a very entertaining movie with all the essential components: An excellent cast, an engaging story, and a director who did a good enough job that I just might be able to overlook the fact that he killed Batman.R</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colin earns his pay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is an experiment in making a film shot almost entirely on one location. A move that would have given this film a fantastic feel would have been to also shoot it in one take, as Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas) did in Time Code. However, as it stands, Phone Booth is certainly an acceptable piece of cinema. While it's plot is relatively standard as suspense thrillers go, the acting done on Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherlands part is outstanding. Colin Farrell in particular earns his pay as the bombast publicist, put in his place under the gun of a psychopath. He sweats charisma and emotion that will give him staying power in Hollywood. Keeping his performance just shy of over the top (and I'd love to see him do something really over the top), Farrell makes the movie work.This is definately worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, (SPOILERS!!) also the acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS!!!)Some criticize certain plot holes, like the cops letting the wife in the open after seeing the sniper sight on her forehead. That one is the worst plot hole, but the rest can be explained.1.- Why she checks Stu's phone bills if she's a trusting loving wife? Because keeping tabs on your sleazy happy-go husband is a good way to remind him that loving doesn't equal stupid or naive.2.- Why she forgives him so easily after his confession? Because they are in public and just saved their lives from the sniper. I bet the second they got home she would've handed him his @$$.3.- Why the cops don't just rush Stu out of the phone boot ot take him down and ask questions later? Because there are people with video cameras around (the snipers points it out) and any mistake by the cops caught on camera can cost them dearly in court (ever heard of a wrongful death lawsuit?).4.- Why Stu doesn't hang up and leave at the begining before he knew about the rifle? Because he obviously wanted to know more about someone who knows a lot about him and took the bother to call him at the boot. No one wants a stalker just roaming free with a case against you...5.- Why didn't Stu take his chances and run out of the boot later (chances are he'll get away and the sniper will give himself away by shooting)? Because the wife and would-be lover are outside (necesary plot device) and can take a shot in revenge from the sniper. And even without them exposed, the cops can very well interpret that as a hostile action and shoot him full of holes. Too risky.6.- Why can't the sniper run off and leave Stu to get arrested by the cops for the dead pimp? Because even with the hollow points deal (no bullet to match up to the rifle), The gun doesn't have Stu's prints and even if it did, the pimp took the shot from the back while facing Stu, no way Stu could shot him there (chest or face at most). And even that aside, Stu hasn't fired a gun recently (the cops have a test for that), so he can proove he didn't shoot anyone. The only way for the sniper to get Stu killed is to kill him himself (and give himself away silencer or not, his laser sight has been spotted) or gettin Stu killed by the cops (better scenario, he can get away easily later).7.- Why the case against Stu (pedophile and corporate scum are more clear villains)? Because Stu has what the sniper dreams about daily (he says it must be great to have a pretty lovely wife waiting for you at home) and the sight of Stu throwing it away ticked him off (simple envy). Besides, redeeming Stu (the alternative to kill him) is much easier than redeeming a corporate crook or pedophile. Because killing them leaves no visible victims, but killing Stu leaves the wife (someone the sniper likes) a victim, so the sniper will avoid that if possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the start of this movie I though now here is something I could enjoy, but unfortunately by the finish I was just trying to justify my reasons for sitting through it.This could have been a great movie if it had been a little shorter or had more plot twists and definitely if it had a better ending.Either I am getting old or just old-fashioned but the script was absolutely pathetic except for Kiefer Sutherland who had some great lines.Why does every second word have to be f'ng this and f'ng that? Everyone seems to believe that Colin Farrell is the next huge thing in movies well he disappointed me in this for sure, I reckon Kiefer Sutherland and Forest Whitaker were loads better.In the end it had some good parts but it did drag and the weak finish really didn't help me give it a higher score, wish I could have a voice like Kiefer though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth was possibly the best action film i've seen in along time! Colin Farrell is a quite SUPER actor. he shows every emotion under the sun in this fast paced 80 minute action pack film, when i heard that it was only 80 mins long i thought ok this isn't gonna be that good how can a film only last 80 mins and when i heard that for 70 of the 80 mins it is filmed in the a phone booth i thought again how can this be a go film! but how wrong i was this film was brillent Colin farrell plays the roll of a agent for some stars, he's going about his day as he usually does every other day, but today is different he stops to make a call from a pay phone to call his bit on the side and it all goes wrong from there! the phone then rings as he puts it down, so he anwsers only to find out the the voice on the other end of the phone isn't to far away watching him with a sniper rifle pointing at the phone booth then from there the story twists and turns! i will be buying this film when it makes it to DVD. this is a must see, even if your not anaction movie fan! if you watch it you'll like it! Oh and one last thing i think it won't be to long till we see Colin as the new James Bond, he is a top actor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was finally able to catch Phone Booth in the theaters, having been expecting its release since before the Beltway Sniper hit. Being a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland (because of 24) and having enjoyed Colin Farrell's performance in Minority Report I went in with high expectations, and was NOT dissapointed. My only gripe was the sound mix for The Caller's (Sutherland) voice, youll see what I mean once you see it. Aside from that, the movie really shows what kind of film-making can be done with a small budget.Its tight and manages to keep you in the edge of your seat for the duration. I was specially surprised at this, because being a fan of Kiefer Sutherland, I was already well aware of his voice and who he was, which sort of spoils a certain aspect of the film, and the movie was STILL able to maintain my attention and the tension in me, i can only imagine what someone that might not recognize the voice might feel when watching it! Overall a very solid film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of Phone Booth, it is mentioned that the particular phone booth of the title is set to be removed. After all, in the city of New York, millions of people use cell phones.One of them, Stu, played by Colin Farrell, seems to live and die by his up and down the streets of Manhattan. In his everyday routine, though, Stu stops to make a call to a young woman(Katie Holmes) who isn't his wife from the phone booth; there is a reason for that.After refusing a from-out-of-nowhere pizza that he didn't ask for, Stu answers the call that will change his life. Still in the phone booth, a stranger on the other end of the line informs Stu he will be shot to death if he leaves and/or hangs up.And so finally, we get the performance from Colin Farrell that is worthy of the hype that surrounded Phone Booth, whose release was delayed due to the sniper shootings in the fall of 2002. The similarities to the shootings and this movie, whatever they may be are purely coincidental. If anything, a man stuck in a phone booth with a police force AND the sniper(a very creepy sounding Keifer Sutherland) is like a blip on a screen compared to the real-life sniper shootings.While I recommend Phone Booth for its use of split screens to illustrate phone conversations, the ending bothered me slightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to applaud this movie. It is strong, vivid, and quite brilliant.Joel Shumacher has given this movie the energy and intelligence it so rightfully presents, which makes it hard to hold Batman and Robin against him. I love this kind of movie. The setting isn't so visually spastic, and stays within a relevant boundary that keeps the characters enjoyable and believable. Colin Farrell is one of those guys who's going to be in everything for the next ten years or so. And who says that's a bad thing? Absolutely saturating his schedule with Daredevil, The Recruit, this and that new historic epic he's apparently in, he doesn't seem to have a lot of free time. But he makes up for it. While some may think him a target for tabloid spam, he's got as great diversity in his character abilities. This role is particularly good, since he goes from a spiffy business man who thinks he's on top of the world to a subdued man with his life spread before him. Keifer Sutherland is an incredible actor. Not only does he have the coolest evil voice, his has set and is the bar for dramatic thriller acting. In this movie he plays the villain, although it is really an extremist vigilantism. I don't want to explain why - you have to see it. And trust me, you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie back in April, and it really drew my attention.I found the movie to be a taut thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.I didn't like Stu Shepard that much at the beginning, but after he entered the phone booth, I was hooked.The movie also gave me a lot to think about in regards to forced confession, repentance, unconditional love (from Kelly), and sacrifice.SPOILERS BELOW: Kiefer Sutherland's appearance at the end scared me. Just when I thought that everything was okay now. :-)The only thing I didn't like were the prostitutes. I found the scene with the prostitutes and later with Leo to be annoying.I was also a bit disappointed that this movie wasn't just about anyone answering a public payphone and therefore being trapped into being a hostage. Instead, Stu was targeted because he wasn't exactly a nice guy.Other than that, I really liked this movie because of its entertainment value and because it really got me to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflects and Warns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of those movies that reflects and warns.. it reflects the current state of morality in society and warns of certain judgment if nothing is done about it, via vigilante or otherwise. Interesting perspective, rather subtle and convincing acting by C. Farrell. It is a successful hyper-genre; borrowed an old theme and set it in context.It reflects the breakdown in relationships, business or social, lying and cheating in our daily affairs has become the norm. It portrays a loss of innocence; a hardening of hearts. A people caught in a vicious cycle of lies; spiraling uncontrollably. All at the same time it reveals our heavy reliance on communication technologies (in a wider sense, our dependence on it) and our confidence placed in it to the point that we think no-one knows our actions. But someone knows..K. Sutherlund is fabulous as the "voice" and he played the perfectionist-moralist role excellently (if there's such a word!) I rather liked the light touches, intentionally or otherwise, on his dark rimmed eye-glasses.. reminds me of the portrayal by M. Douglas in "Falling Down", though this time round, the moralist survives and has become more tenacious and expert in his craft. He's still a zealot about the truth, and champions to make the world a better place.The movie begins and ends in the same scene as if nothing really happened, like a warning that this could be a possible scenario. It adds to the "what if", or "Sliding Doors" effect played out in his mind.. like deep down, he wants to tell the truth, to be himself. He does in the end, which is nice.Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very taut production with acting honours going to Colin Farrell who plays the lead role as Stu, a liar and a cheat being forced to examine at the point of a gun every detail of his character and unsavoury lifestyle. Stubborn at first, he finally breaks down into tears and the good side of his character small as it may be begins to shine through.Filmed in a street in New York, the action takes place in and around a public phone booth. Much of the dialogue is in the form of a telephone conversation between Stu and an unknown mysterious but well-informed stranger.Convincing in its detail the film sends a reminder to all of us that we are being watched and our movements monitored by strangers more often than we are probably willing to accept.This is real edge of the seat stuff and will satisfy most thrill seekers. Watch the red spot of the gun sight as it aims at and hovers near the forehead or heart of an innocent victim.Stu probably deserves the fearful gruelling he gets but even so we tend to feel for him in the closing scenes. I wonder now.... will you be answering the phone the next time it rings?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there is quite a lot of other comments where you can find what is this movie about. I want to write, what did I like and what not. Generally, I enjoyed this movie a lot.Please note that some minor SPOILERS might follow!I was wonderfully thrilled. I believed that the Voice is some kind of madman, dangerous, but still balancing on the edge of sanity. Actually, he was more sympathetic for me, than protagonist was. I could not decide - do I want "poor" protagonist to escape into safety, or would I prefer the voice to finish his purpose, whatever might it be ..? I liked protagonist "vile" character as well as insane logic and "truth" of the voice. Hard choice ;o)There are few issues I did not like so much. First, protagonist wife left police car several times, although they already know, that she is in serious danger from the sniper. But they did not even try to stop her. Hm.. Second, she was so suspicious, that he checked all his husband phone bills. But all we can see is loving forgiving wife. Quite a discrepancy. Third, the police was too much dull for my liking. Yea, I know that people want to see them dull, but I got already tired of this.Final result: 8/10</fullReview>

Sounds boring, doesn't it? Sounds like your mom or your wife, doesn't it? Well - this is the exception. It's about 80 minutes of razorsharp thrilling. The movie evolves around Stu, a young publicist who is lying to himself, his clients, his wife and his mistress. A random day in his life, he is doing a phonecall from Manhattens last phonebooth to his mistress, just after hanging up the phone rings. Voice is calling him. Voice wants him to confess, confess his sins. If not, Stu will be a dead man. Voice is sitting somewhere in a building near stu, pointing a telescope rifle at Stu. Obey or die - it's as simple as that. The movie will keep you stuck to the screen every minute. It's not predictable, it's not something seen before.Watch it - it's thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe movie opens with low angle shots of Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), the flashy publicity man oozing confidence walking along Time Square with his assistant. After handling a number deals with efficiency and flare, on the phone as well as in person, he sends his assistant off and stops at a phone booth at 8th and 53rd to make a call. The remainder of the 81 minutes of the movie takes place entirely at this location.Pinned by a sniper, Stu is depicted with a couple of aerial shots which dwindle him to complete helplessness at the phone booth. His panic and confusion is then cemented with a few POV shots of the crowd gathering around him.Let me not unduly criticise the obvious weakness of the plot. There are a million ways Stu could have called his girlfriend without his wife knowing, and the phone booth is completely unnecessary. This flaw, however, is easily forgiven because the movie is really good, and dares to be different. While many people may think that they are cheated unless a movie is at least over 100 minutes, PB is just barely over 80. While just about every Hollywood movie has become a carbon copy of the one before with the standard action, car chase and contrived climax, PB is refreshingly different, with everything hanging on just one phone call, and successful is keeping the audience's full attention. (This has been done before though, in The Slender Thread (1965)).Some of the praises heaped on PB however are overdone. After seeing all the self-revelation and confession Stu is forced to made, I was left with the feeling of "what's all this fuss". His "sins" are so commonplace that they're hardly worth the commotion. The only conclusion I can draw is that the caller is a complete mad man. For a study of human character that has depth and substance, one has to turn to director Schumacher's earlier work Falling Down (1993). PB does not have the same depth. It's just a thriller, but a darn good one.Finally a few words on the cast. The achievements in Colin Farrell's lead role and Forest Whitaker's support role have been clearly confirmed by the general movie-going population. I particularly like Radha Mitchell, whose charm seems to come from the line of Jessica Lange and Robin Wright. What really thrilled me is Keifer Sutherland. I knew that his voice had been featured as the caller, but didn't count on actually catching a glimpse of him at the end. The choice of Sutherland is excellent as he is an accomplished stage actor and knows how to use his voice. I had the opportunity of enjoying his stage performance a few years ago in Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a short and snappy movie. I assume you already have the plot outline available, so I'll cut right to the chase:Phone Booth relies almost entirely of the performance of the actors, and then particularly on those of Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker. They do a very solid job here, the former especially so. There is a particularly crucial moment toward the end, a moment where you're likely to either stay in the movies grasp, and then walk away five minutes later feeling you got your money's worth, or fall out it, and end up with a faint nauseous sensation as you leave the theatre. Phone Booth kept me, barely, believing in the protagonist. But barely is enough, I was impressed by the end of it, and had gotten food for thought. That is more than I mostly get, so for anyone after a thrill and some reflection, I can safely recommend this movie.Viljar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a story that writer Larry Cohen first talked to Alfred Hitchcock about in the 1960's and its taken this long for it to get made. If your a writer and you sold a script to Hollywood I probably wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to get made! Story is about a man named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) who is generally not nice to people and uses them as he pleases and suddenly as he walks down the street while using a pay phone he gets a call from a mysterious stranger who some how knows a lot about him. The caller tells him to start doing things or he will kill someone because he has a rifle. After arguing with some prostitutes a guy comes over with a baseball bat and tries to attack Stu when the sniper shoots him. People on the street think Stu did the shooting and they call the cops. The sniper has also placed a gun in the phonebooth to blame him. The cops arrive and Captain Ed Ramey (Forest Whitaker) is in charge of the scene and now they don't know what to do. The sniper makes Stu admit to many things to everyone like telling his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) that he has a mistress named Pamela (Katie Holmes). Director Joel Schumacher does a good job of keeping the story and the film down to about 90 minutes so the action that takes place comes fairly rapidly. The best thing about the script is the way that it makes the protagonist cleanse his soul to everyone around him. The sniper makes him yell to all listening that he is guilty of infidelity. This is Farrells first big starring role and he does a good job of keeping the viewer interested even though 90% of the time is spent in a phonebooth. Story is unusual and unique and even though its farfetched the film doesn't come off as contrived. Rather, its a pretty absorbing drama and it reminded me that Schumacher can be a very effective director. Not a great film, did anyone really believe that its New York? And we get the obligatory side story of cop Whitaker trying to remain in charge of the situation while being berated by another law official to get the job done or someone else will be in charge! Pretty good film creates good tension and is a breakthrough role for Farrell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert I've read a few reviews by people who were repulsed by the concept that this film represented something so "close to home", being the September-November 2002 sniper shootings in Washington D.C. Its worth pointing out, this movie was actually produced in 2001 but was not released because of the WTC terrorism, and was also suspended by the aforementioned snipings.This movie is suspensful, enjoyable and frightening, and none of it is gratuitous. Its suspenseful in that you don't really know whats going to happen, not quite recognising Kiefer Sutherland's voice and wondering if one of the policemen around the booth might be about to get nervous and shoot, even though if they did that the movie would end too early... its frightening in that its unfortunately something that very easily could happen in this day and age, and I don't know about everyone else, but that scares the living bejeezers out of me.I also enjoyed the fact the "villain" got away at the end.To each his own, but this was one of the best hours and a half I've had in recent memory.I wish they'd make more movies of this calibre. it doesn't need to be "Final Destination" to be frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a taut thriller that, aside from a couple of plot holes, largely delivers. It builds tension, shows appropriate emotion and generates sufficient sympathy.It's possible to criticise the scale of the crime that Stu is being persecuted for, but the film would have been difficult to resolve otherwise.My only real personal annoyance is with the situation policeman that comes in and tries to overrule Ramey. I cant see any justification for him; he may even jarr the flow of the film.The other plot holes can largely be put down to suspension of disbelief - it's a film - not an object lesson in ballistics or police procedure people.A must see, at least once.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like Mr Farrell is going to be the next BIG thing!The Irishman pulled off a convincing New York accent and played the classy PR agent brilliantly (I think his personality is similar to who he played - very cool and confident)Even though it was a cheap movie to make and basically revolved around the one area, you were on the edge of your seat the whole time. It was only about 80 minutes long but it was a perfect amount of time. Never did you think, "When is this going to end?" - It kept you 'glued' to the screen the whole time.Well acted by Col, and great support with Katie Holmes (sorry she's a fave), Forest Whittaker and Radha Mitchell (Go Aussie actors!)Well worth a look.9/10!Ljuek - Actor, Director and Critic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers PossiblePhone booth provides a rare gem of modern-day short cinema. The 'feature,' being a mere 77 minutes long and set almost entirely in a phone booth, it portrays a psychopath with a sniper rifle (sutherland)psychologically torturing a greedy publicist(farell) on the other end of the line.This film is pretty good and it's also short, which makes it an ideal 'quick watch.' It builds up the suspense nicely and ends, somewhat predictably, but nevertheless good.Probably won't be worth watching twice, but 8/10 for the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is one of the top movies of 2003, for the simple fact that it's an original. Every movie out there is about things blowing up and fighting (matrix an exception) drug dealing, but it's not everyday you see a movie like Phone Booth where the majority of the movie takes place in one spot but it does give you an outlook of how people are in this world. Farrell played an excellent role of Stu Shepard, who's a very egotistical, cold-hearted person who cares about him and him only and gets confronted by "The Caller" Sutherland, who's voice is so dangerous that I could not have picked anyone else for that part. Even though it's a short film (88 minutes) Phone Booth does stick out as one of the tops in 2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a scintillating film by any means but an interesting enough idea.. There is some tension that gently builds as the film progresses but the tight scenario eventually becomes a little monotonous. However it is quite a satisfying film that leaves one feeling a little wary about any phonebooth. I'm glad I saw the film but would have reservations recommending it to anyone especially as the dialogue had a little too much bad language. I can't help thinking the producers nearly got there, but missed an opportunity to make this quite average film outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On hold for 80 mins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to take a chance despite this Joel Schumaker flick looking short on ideas. We should all trust our instinct more... There is no really good acting (I got teasing flashes of what Forest Whitaker is capable of) and a script/storyline that couldn't be saved by it anyway. There are SO many moments in this film where people seem to be taking decisions purely to keep the suspense going in the movie, rather than as a necessity of the narrative. At one point Farrell improvises the excuse that he is talking to his shrink - well, there are plenty of times during the film that one thinks the only way to explain the bizarre, incoherent one-liners (of all charcetrs) and decisions is that Farrell is, in fact, mad.Kiefer Sutherland plays the hostage-taker... I saw '24' for the first time yesterday and was warming back to him after a period of nonplussedness. Well, he looks cool but there won't be any serious voiceover work troubling his agent. The (principal) women are just decoration. The reason that this film appeals at any level is the creeping suggestion of satire (dealt with much more thoroughly in another average film, 15 Minutes) and a fun docu-filmed opening sequence of Times Square.I'm going to go and see Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation to cleanse my retinas and make a 4/10 mental note not to see anything where the trailer looks to contain all the interesting moments. Because it probably does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot about the plot holes and I have to admit, there are many of them in such a short movie. I can't believe that one guy with no visible weapon is surrounded by police forces like this. With half a dozen snipers on the roofs, cops with shields and two or three dozen at gunpoint. Yes, that's stupid. Given the obvious evidence of a sniper on the other end of the line, that's even more so.But try to forget about this for a while and you will have fun and you will laugh a lot (I did) cause the psycho shooter played (well, sort of) by Kiefer Sutherland has a load of good lines. He is really funny while commenting the sometimes pathetic attempts of his victim. The dialogue is the main strength of this movie. Those who are complaining about the length should keep in mind that the story is based on a short film. And tell me how to keep tension in a phone booth for any longer than they did?The outcome is not very intelligent I might say, but it at least works well enough. This is an unusual situation we're facing here. It's not easy to make a good movie in a phone booth with a super-plot hole-proof plot. You can always say that they tried to keep it low budget as possible by filming in and around a single phone booth and in less than two weeks. That's what it is about, yes. I don't mind it. Joel Schumacher delivered a very bad Batman, but you forget about Flatliners, Falling Down and Lost Boys. Those are far from being bad.This movie is a good example of sacrificing a well-rounded plot for the sake of dialogue and to that extent it works perfectly well for me.8/10</fullReview>

This is the smart idea to be implemented in the movie and I can say. Brilliant.

		<shortDescription>shallow, two-dimensional characters don't complete the call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to really pinpoint exactly what it is about Joel Schumacher's, `Phone Booth' that makes it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But first, let me describe it.The entire movie takes place in and near a phone booth in New York City, where Ferrell plays Stuart Shepard, a small-time two-bit publicity agent who finds himself pinned inside a phone box by an extortionist's sniper rifle. Apparently, the sniper's done research on Shepard and knows that he's had `bad intentions'. He's threatening to kill Shepard and anyone else around him if Shepard doesn't do exactly what the sniper wants, including hanging up the phone. What does he want him to do? Confess his sins.In short, `Phone Booth' feels like a really poor attempt at a movie like `Speed', where the bad guy plays the good guy like a puppet for his own musings. Not that I liked that movie either, but at least it had tension. `Phone Booth', however, is an example of just about everything that can be wrong with a movie. The script was dreadful from the outset, with logistical errors and manipulated dialog that begs for a tomato to be thrown at the screen. Obvious things take place that go entirely unnoticed by the characters for the sole reason of building `suspense', but it only leaves you on the verge of screaming at the screen in anger and frustration.That aside, the main drawback of the film is a common one: failing to give any depth to any of the characters. Shepard is a two-bit, sleazy sort who'll never really amount to much, that he becomes an uninteresting victim for the antagonist to choose in the first place. In fact, he's so shallow, that he never actually did anything wrong in the first place. He's contemplated having an affair, but it seems more like a fantasy he never really intended to follow through on. At this point, even if Shepard confesses, we think, `so what?' He's simply not important enough to care about his confessions.Similarly, the sniper himself is questionable. We are presented with a shadowy figure acting as the omniscient judge and jury by forcing them to see their actions at the end of a gun barrel. If the sinner doesn't repent, he's killed. But anyone that has any knowledge of human nature knows that people who are under duress ? i.e., have a gun pointed at them ? will (and do) say anything that the killer wants them to say to save himself. So, what value is there to watching someone confess sins under these conditions? If Shepard confesses, we don't care, and if he doesn't confess, he's just an idiot.I rarely make this statement, so I don't take it lightly when I say that `Phone Booth' is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. So, if you do see it, at least make it a collect call by having someone else pay your way.</fullReview>

But LSS surely delivers a better plot and a far superior ending compared to this one.While Colin Farrell doesn't look bad in this movie, the plot stops to make sense as soon as the cops arrive.A single person in a phone booth, no hostages, no visible weapon... and 50 cops around doing NOTHING. I really laughed my ass off...Why didnt they shoot him with some tranquilizer weapon, or why didnt they just moved in and get him. No, he stands there, phoning, keeping 50 cops at distance just with his voice..It's still enjoyable, because the movie won't bore you. It's 80min thriller fast-food.

		<shortDescription>"Hot Shot" almost gets shot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** My personal rating to this movie: 9What an original movie this is! In the style of the famous TV series "24", we can also discover the influence of Kiefer Sutherland in this masterpiece.The originality of this movie is the foundation of my high rating. For more than 90 % the movie is settled in a phone booth, but nevertheless this movie doesn't irritate at a single moment. That's a remarkable fact on itself.The story of this movie can be told very shortly. Stu Shepherd (Colin Farell) is a so called hot shot, who's lying to everyone (his wife, his girlfriend, his "colleague" and lots of persons that hope to start a career as an actor) just to make a personal profit out of it. This doesn't stay unnoticed. When Stu picks up a ringing phone in a phone booth ("somehow you know it's your call") he doesn't know that this will be the longest and most confrontating conversation he ever had by phone. The caller (the voice of Kiefer Sutherland, who has the perfect voice for this!!) makes him confess all his lies to anyone that is close to him by keeping a sniper rifle pointed at him. At first Stu doesn't believe the caller, but when a local pimp is shot down, just before his eyes, this suddenly changes. Stu becomes the main suspect for this murder, and in no time he is surrounded by policemen, interested people and TV stations. Almost every movement of him is now being watched by millions of people nationwide including the caller. The turning point in this fascinating movie is when Stu knows to open a second line with a mobile phone, not noticed by the caller. The police can know hear the input of Stu in the conversation that he must keep with the true murderer. They can now trace the call, and in the final scenes everything comes to a happy end, which is according to me the only unsatisfying point. The movie gave me the idea that this wouldn't have to end like this with a moral. The impact would have been even bigger when Joel Schumacher created another end.But everyone that likes original movies must go and see this movie. To me it was too long ago that we could see one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Contains minor spoiler.You know, for a man who destablized, dismantled and nearly destroyed the 'Batman' franchise, I am surprised that director Joel Schumacher continues to work. This man cannot spot holes in a screenplay any better than the cigar chewing execs can who sit with their big feet up on their big desks and think they know something about creativity and what an audience wants. 'Phone Booth' starts off well but like an inexperienced pilot, it can't hold its altitude and it crashes almost as fast as it takes off. Come on, people! As of this review being written, it has a user rating of 7.6/10. Get real! Let's look at the plot holes, shall we. There are 5 BIG ONES. Number 1: The police arrive and they think Farrell is the perp. There is a huge bullet hole in his phone booth. Are you getting the picture here? Number 2: His ear is bleeding a lot. Let's see. Hmmmm. A bullet hole and a man with a bleeding ear. Maybe he isn't the perp. Maybe he IS being held hostage in this phone booth. Duh! But we are movie cops so we can't figure this out yet. Number 3: Tracing the phone lines. The real perp and assassin (Kiefer Sutherland) has balled up the lines to block the police from getting a trace. Well, have you ever heard of the phone company? Call them and their techs with extensive knowledge of this stuff and LET THEM HANDLE IT! Number 4: The public isn't kept back far enough and once the cops do figure out what is possible, there is no way the public stays that close. Number 5: When Farrell is being loaded into the ambulance near the end, the assassin walks up to the ambulance's back doors and talks to Farrell as he's being sedated. How many crimes scenes do you know of where anyone from the public can just walk up and infiltrate it? And carry a big case in the process that just might contain a large rifle. Larry Cohen wrote this script back in the 60's for Alfred Hitchcock and it staggers me to learn that he couldn't pick out these plot holes after more than thirty years. WOW!!</fullReview>

Considering his passion for explosions and fast-cutting, he made good use of the claustrophobic setting of the phone booth. Suprised at the decent level of acting which made the characters believable; Colin Farrell basically had to carry the film because he's on-screen nearly all the time, and it benefits from his presence, he's going to be huge, good luck to the guy.

		<fullReview>I just watched phone booth and I found it really exciting. During the whole movie I wanted to know what would happen next, in what kind of situations the sniper would put Stu Shepard next. First, Stu only has to somehow send away the hooker who needs to make a phone call. Then he has to deal with her friends, then with the pimp who wants to beat him up with a baseball bat, finally it's the police, so it's getting worse and worse.Colin Farrell really does a fantastic job here, he is really convincing as the man in distress. He goes through a whole lot of emotions from being arrogant till breaking down in tears, and you really believe him. Although Stu is not a very likeable character, you can imagine how he must feel being trapped in this phone booth and you start rooting for him. Also the other actors are first class. Kiefer Sutherland's calm and controlled voice (as the sniper) is quite eerie and makes a good counterpart to Colin Farrell's character, who after having spent quite a while in this phone booth is totally stressed out.The cinematography is also great. I mean, what can you do when a movie is shot in only one place, namely a phone booth? So when Stu is making his phone calls with his mobile phone, the picture gets divided so that you can see him and also the people he is talking to.The film was shot for about 13 million Dollars, but you don't see it. There are no special effects and stuff, but you don't miss them at all. The whole atmosphere of the movie is so enthralling that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth ***1/2-Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell), a New York publicist, is a man full of lies, selfishness and deceit. He lies to his clients, he lies to his wife and he lies to the woman whom he wants to cheat on his wife with. He strings along an assistant who is essentially a slave and promises to pay him with no intension of doing so. This man has scams on top of scams and all systems are go. He is at the top of his game and the city, and everything in it, is at his fingertips. Until one faithful day he answers a ringing phone in a booth. His whole world unravels as the snipers voice on the other end forces him to confess and pay for his sins. We the viewers have a front row seat to this delightful and thrilling morality play.This film is a refreshing step away from the special effects and big time Hollywood blockbuster who ha. What we have here is a first rate thriller shot in a very minimalist fashion directed by Joel Schumacher who has given us some big time titles such as Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, A Time to Kill, The Client and the ill fated `Blockbusted' Bad Company, just to name a few. Here Schumacher sheds the blockbuster formula. There is no marquee star, no big budget. I say no marquee star because this film was shot 21/2 years ago well before Farrell was the up and comer that he is today. 90% of this film was shot in one place and it is rumored that it was shot in just 10 days. The release was delayed due to the beltway sniper and it was worth the wait. Schumacher delivers and Farrell proves that he is the real deal.This movie falls directly on the shoulders of Colin Farrell (Daredevil, Minority Report) and Kiefer Sutherland, who has resurrected his career with Fox's hit series `24'. These two play beautifully off each other with Sutherland playing the enraged sniper, who is hell bent on teaching Shepard a lesson in morality that he will never forget. The script is tight and well written. With so few characters and the film taking place largely in a phone booth, nothing here seems to be forced. Schumacher manages to keep us captivated with a well-timed ebb and flow of tension and a natural flow to the story. Forest Whitaker (Panic Room) is solid as the Police negotiator and Katie Holmes (TV's Dawson's Creek) is just kind of there as Shepard's mistress as is Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black) as his wife.I enjoyed this film. In fact I enjoyed it so much that I'm quite embarrassed to say that the bait of the twist hooked me. Don't worry I'm not giving away anything by telling you this. A twist is inevitable and it is expected with this type of film. Even though I knew it was coming I still took that bait and was hooked like a fish. I was hooked so badly that hours after the film I could feel the wound in my mouth from the hook. Actually I think the wound is more on my pride than it is my mouth. I guess that's the sign of a good thriller. It reaches out and grabs you, just like the ring of a public phone. We've all heard it. Its ring baits you to answer its call and unless you have no skeletons in your closet, you may now want to think twice before picking it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino is one of the actors Colin Farrell is often compared to, so it is appropriate that Phone Booth remind me so much of Dog Day Afternoon. In both cases, we see a man break down over the course of a really difficult day. Phone Booth takes things a step further by having events occur in real time.Farrell is awesome, particularly in the end, revealing complete vulnerability. Keifer Sutherland's voice also adds a great performance. He is just as apt playing the bad guy in this as he is playing the hero of 24. His motive in the end is better than the usual 'I'm someone you barely remember from your past.'Joel Schumacer does a good job directing, keeping the intensity up. In my book at least, he has finally lifted the stigma attached to him since Batman and Robin.One final note: I really enjoyed the mean hookers, a nice break from all those prostitutes with hearts of gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This top quality `real time' thriller is such a simple idea, yet it grabs your attention from start to finish. Colin Farrell acts his socks off as Stu Shepard, a man who answers a ringing phone in a random phone booth on a busy street, the man on the other end of the line threatens him that if he hangs up he will be shot. All kinds of scenarios unfold and soon his wife, actress `friend', a cop with marital issues of his own, a pimp and his hookers and even a pizza delivery guy are all suckered into Stu's nightmare. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight, taught, tense and tidy thriller with strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of notorious bloated 80s bratpack movies like Lost Boys and Flatliners, Joel Schumacher has achieved something distinctly different with Phone Booth. Think along the lines of a Hitchcock thriller combined with a Twilight Zone episode.Schumacher had become associated with blockbuster action franchises like the Batman series, but everything about Phone Booth is pared down; there are only three main characters, almost the entire movie takes place in a single scene and its just over 80 minutes from start to finish. Still, less is definitely more, as Phone Booth is a thought-provoking and suspenseful thriller that relies on strong performances and some premium-grade screenwriting.The centrepiece of the film is a dialogue between a low-rent New York wheeler-dealer 'publicist' and a mysterious caller who contacts him through a payphone and forces him to look at his misdemeanours down the barrel of a gun - or more accurately - the telescopic sight of a sniper rifle.The rules of the 'game' are soon set; hanging up on the call or leaving the booth mean death for Stu, our aspiring 'fixer', although the sniper/caller contrives all sorts of situations to force him to do that, including some angry hookers and their pimp, a full police seige and, most terrifyingly - his wife AND girlfriend!Interwoven into the dialogue is a razor-sharp satire both on the media and the curious moral values of our age. Stu attempts to bargain with our psycho by waving the carrot of artistic recognition, media celebrity and popular understanding and empathy. Time and again the writer manipulates the audience between unease and black humour.Correspondingly, Schumacher captures the essence of a wafer-thin sliced of NYC, its intimacy and its alienation. The vignettes of police inter-departmental tension and the detached curiosity of the inevitable gawping crowd flesh out the setting.This is a contemporary morality tale: where the most traumatic experience is not death, but stripping away the onion layers and revealing the true self. This is a moment of catharsis which trembles perilously on sentimentality, and you think Schumacher has blown it: but not quite - it rings true; plus, there's a predictable 'unpredictable' ending.But these are quibbles compared to the craft and the boldness with which Phone Booth is delivered, conceptually and visually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great premise. man in phonebooth, if he leaves, he's dead. could've been superb, but instead turns out to be just very good. The pacing is done nicely, and the film seems to fly by, almost like an advert, and you expect the main feature afterwards. Colin Farrell is the main man in the booth, and he does the best job he could do in that tough role. He yells a bit too much, but the downward spiral of the ongoing situation is very believable, with him provoking enough sympathy for him to care. However the caller's voice (kiefer sutherland)is a little on the bad side. It's not realistic, no-one talks like that, and it's through him that the weak dialogue shines through. It didn't need to be brilliant, but some of the lines are just too bad to forgive. However, the tight direction, and plot twists, keep it moving nicely enough, and the ending is much more twisted, and religious, than people may expect. Probably the best and most enjoyable 'timewasting' movie ever made. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon mentioning this exciting movie, the words that come most often from the mouth of those I am talking to are 'How do they set an hour and a half movie inside a Phone Booth.' The truth is that the majority of the movie takes place not in a phone booth, but in the dialog of a killer, and their victim. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*** A tense atmosphere resounds the moment the phone is picked up to reveal a voice familiar to many. In this instant we are introduced to the killer, and a world where one man realizes that being at the top is not necessarily the place to be. Redemption comes hard for Stu Shepard when he must decide between telling the truth, and letting it be known that he is not the man he claims to be, or being shot by the sniper who could be hiding behind any number of the windows overlooking his booth. Teeth are set on edge at the sound of the gun being cocked, where the viewer truly realizes the desperation of the situation. The tempo of this movie allows it to be saved from possible redundancy for the most part. I had wanted to see it from the moment I heard of the plot, just to see how one might pull off such a situation. I was not let down. Superb acting, and situation control made this movie believable in most aspects. In the future I hope to see more like it, the general originality being hard to beat. 9/10 minus one for certain situations that were not fully explained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you hear me now? Goooooood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that interested me about Phone Booth was the fact that the whole movie took place on such a limited physical area. A lot of people that I had talked to about it before having seen it said that they thought it would be boring because of that, but on the contrary, a limited set like the one in the movie is a VERY good sign, because you can see from older movies that (with the exception of relatively dull ones like 1999's Deterrence), limited sets not only imply, but REQUIRE good acting, good direction, and most of all, a good story. All of these and more are found in Phone Booth.I admit that the overall message of the movie is a little bit preachy, with Keifer Sutherland playing the part of the God-like watcher who goes around punishing low-life New Yorkers for their crimes, but the thrill of the film is there. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows are rivaled only by the unbeatable Freddie Prinze, Jr., delivers a spectacular performance as the cocky public relations representative who goes through life feeding lies to everyone he meets, including those closest to him.I loved how the movie takes such a simple premise and keeps it going so well. When I first saw him enter the booth and pick up the phone and start talking to the killer, I knew that, if I learned anything about the movie from the previews, he had to stay in that booth on the phone for the rest of the movie, and I wasn't sure how they were going to manage to keep it interesting or that long, but they definitely managed it.(spoilers) It's true that the whole situation works out a little too perfectly for the killer's plans, since everything that he wanted to happen happened, but this is a highly entertaining thriller that entertains and delivers a great message at the same time. There is a particularly impressive interaction between Stu (Colin Farrell) and Captain Ed Ramey, as Stu needs to let Ramey know what's going on without letting the killer in on it, which is difficult and exciting since the killer can both see and hear everything that Stu does. It's great the way that the killer has fun with Stu, demanding that he say offensive and disgusting things to Ramey and to his own wife, especially when you realize that Ramey is beginning to realize what's really going on. This is a challenge, of course, because of the excessive oddness of the whole situation (which Ramey sums up as soon as he arrives on the scene ? `Let me get this straight. This guy shot that other guy and then hung around to make a phone call?'). The end of the movie is where it falters a little bit, although there is a great twist involving the pizza guy, which was pretty interesting, although if they had left it with that it would have been a letdown because Keifer Sutherland's voice it too well-known to be passed off as this other guy's. It was pretty believable though, kind of reminds me of that thing that Kevin Spacey pulled as John Doe when he dressed up as a photographer in Seven.But where the movie falters a little bit is the part where the killer wanders up to introduce himself to Stu while he's laying in the ambulance. I thought that was a great turn of events, but it's the point in the movie where it approaches, just barely, but distinctively, the point of being altogether to preachy and cheesy. This is where it introduces the suggestion that the killer is just some guy out to rid the world of injustice and clean the scum off the streets with his sniper rifle. The pimp was just another dirtbag that he purged while attempting to get through to a more complex one, and the pizza delivery guy and the walking and talking robot were both collateral damage. There was some great commentary about the capacity for stupidity of the LAPD (Michael Moore was a little more blunt in this area toward the NYPD in his TV show The Awful Truth), as well as about the greed of the human race in general as the killer taunts Stu about all of the tourists pointing video cameras at him, hoping to see some shooting so they can sell their tapes.The only problem with the message of the film, about cleaning up the streets of these filthy people, is that if snipers cleaned out all of the sinners from the human population, not many people would be left. Maybe Phone Booth will someday help people to realize that sinning is part of human nature, and that 100% of the human race sin at some point in their lives. The hope is that they can come out and admit their faults, the way Stu does at the end of the movie. Imagine the relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From some of the first comments that were written here that I read on opening day, I thought this would be a masterful piece of cinematography in an unusual setting.**** SPOILERS ****Sadly, there were several things that were not exactly as advertised. The main character (Colin Farrell) is not evil. He's a sleazeball, sure, but no more than any other fast-talking salesman. By the end of the movie, he's been 'reduced' to that of a typical movie hero.The protagonist is, however, much more evil than first shown. Of course, he's also superhuman (the angle of the laser shots that he takes varies throughout the show, meaning he is moving all over the scene, and he makes shots that are solely the realm of movie-land. Shooting out the Stu's ear? Umm...right.) Again, the angles shown in this movie are beyond belief. Even disregarding all other factors, how do you target (supposedly from the upper floors of an apartment building) the west ear of someone from the east side? Answer? Its not possible.BUT, technicalities aside, this was an enjoyable movie. The characters are good, and the plot line is neither too slow, or too quick. Kiefer's voice was perfect for the slot that he is in.Overall, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schumacher always seem to end up with interesting concepts and good ideas but when they fall into his lap he doesn't know what to do with them. The problem with Phone Booth isn't Colin Ferrell, who delivers a wonderful performance, or the script, which has some very nice literary moments, the problem is bad directing.Schumacher doesn't do this story justice in the least. First off, he's no good with suspense so many scenes that could be exciting, tension building scenes end up dull and dragging. The only times this movie moves quickly and excitingly is when the script is chock full of suspense itself. Schumacher quite simply brings nothing to this script.However, the movie does have some interesting themes behind it and I think it is worth seeing for those and for the wonderful performances by Ferrell and Sutherland. Forest Whitaker gives an okay performance that I feel lacks substance, but the other two main guys are great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe the criticism for this film (spoiler at end)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Reading through some of the foremost reviews on this film, and concentrating on the bad ones i just find it hard to see how anyone could find this film lacking in suspense and deep characterization. and i can't stand reviewers who criticise films for doing something one way then failing to explain how it SHOULD have been done according to them. i canlt see how the film should have been done differently. personally i found very little to complain about in this film.ultimately a film has to entertain for me to come out thinking it was good, and this film did nothing short of exhilerate me. colin farrell (despite a slightly dodgy american accent) actually surprised me with some pretty spot on acting, forrest whittaker while not given much to play with, was good as per usual. keifer proved that voice acting is something that can be done in an oscar-winning style. the rest of the characters really play no part excpet in allowing the story to take place. criticising the female actors is like criticisng farrells choice of suit. and they were hardly bad. the film essentially only has 2 characters, farrel and sutherland.criticising the plot for lacking originality i find hard to deal with. firstly i thought the plot was pretty special - yes, its a hostage thriller, hostage thrillers hae been done before, but whats your point? how many films surrounding a phone boh have been made? there are VERY VERY VERY few genres out there, if at all that haven't been done more than once. the setting (a phone booth for gods sake) was inspired. sure, the idea probably came from some dude feeling watched whilst making a phone call, but who said the concept had to be deeply comlpicated to make the film good? the film is essentially about a life changing moment. sure some of the end sequences felt cheesy in their "the moral of the story is" way, and kiefer (SPOILER) killing the pizza guy as a decoy and this escaping wasn't incredibly unpredictable, but when i realised that kiefer got away with it, it made me smile. he plays a sort of twisted angel, come to earth to change peoples lives, going from one to the next, with some successes and some failures. sure he does it in a twisted way, but that merely adds to his oddly moral psychoticism.the style of filming i thought fitted it superbly. while schumacer could have employed standard action style direction, he went for a handheld feel that i felt suited the panicky nature of the movie. had he shot it with motionless shots, it wouldn't have pulled off.the "confession" scene is an essential part to the movies underlying moralism. if you sat there throughout the movie unrealistically wishing farrel had whipped out the gloc in the roof of the booth and picked off he sniper in an unpredictable manner to justify the apparently missing originality of the film, then you're missing the point of the film.farrel played an exceptional protagonist who goes convincingly from cocky to humble. his character WAS dislikable, the ways in which he mistreated WERE made obvious to the audience, and it was easy to growingly sympathise with his downtrodden character as kiefer layed down the law.what made the film work for me was the realistic feel it emitted. the premise perhaps is far fetched, but the manner in which is was carried out was spot on. i didnt think the film was perfect, but i strongly disagree with the majority of the complaints made here. and i AM an open minded person, i guess i just had strong opinions on what made the film GOOD, and some people sem to think that those things were actually bad. and to the guy who put "Avoid" in the subject matter, ur deluded. go and watch it again without assuming it's going to suck...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like the phone. I refuse to have a cell phone (as if anybody would call me). When I'm on the phone, I feel compelled to fill the dead air unlike when I'm with someone face-to-face.How would a film maker handle the big problem with phone conversations: actors not seeing each other face-to-face or rather the audience knowing the actors are not face-to-face? Joel Schumacher gives it a shot. For one he uses elaborate split-screens to show all the people in the conversation. With the one big exception of course in the antagonist. But even with him, the audience hears all the voices as if they are in the same room. None of that metallic sound one usually hears in movie phone conversations.The vast majority of the scenes take place at a phone booth located in a seedy part of Manhattan that I thought Giuliani had eradicated upon the orders of Disney Co. The booth was Colin Farrell's character's choice to set up his rendezvous that instead became his cage locked in by a menacing Caller.Here's my biggest problem. Who is this Caller who would threaten not only Colin, his loved ones and kill cold-bloodedly just because Colin is a massive heel and needs to see the error of his ways? And invest so much effort to do so? No human for sure. Is this caller supposed to be some evil spirit visiting upon us? I don't know.As an aside, this movie has way too much swearing in it.</fullReview>

Indeed, it was one of those rare movies that hadme squirming around in my seat wondering how on earth Stu wasgoing to get out of the booth alive! There were also humorousmoments every so often to help relieve the tension, and I gratefullylaughed in appreciation of the temporary release before beingdrawn straight back into the anticipation of it all. Multiple camerashots were used to show all the main characters points of view, aswell as some split screen work to show what was happening inthe street and in the booth. I was impressed by the film makingtechniques, and I definitely felt the suspense and tension werethere right through until the very end.Phone Booth is definitely a unique film that conveys originallyentertaining ideas right through until the end. The film wasreportedly shot in just 11 days, which clearly adds to the superbtension of Colin Farrell's performance. Indeed, I have newfoundrespect for Colin after seeing Phone Booth and plan to check outmore of his work. There are solid performances all round, andKeifer Sutherland's voice as the caller is fantastically creepy.Phone Booth is definitely one of those movies you have to see totruly appreciate. It is a truly entertaining ride from beginning to end.</fullReview>

The world would be a poorer place without them. I don't care what your views on monogamy are, the whole premise is just ridiculous.Which brings me to my second point. This movie isn't terribly original. Yeah it was mostly shot near a phone booth, but one need only go as far as Silverstreak to see a better example of location usage. This film is all pulled punches. My mother is more threatening then Sutherland comes off here. Please, he's just a lunatic. Al Pacino makes him look like a girl scout.

		<shortDescription>fine exercise in "confined cinema"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" is a lean bubblegum thriller that knows its audience, and makes the most of its confined setting and split-screen images. The tension mounts respectably (the use of zooms, fisheye lenses, and different film stock complement the action), and director Joel Schumacher, who has a bad reputation of mucking up his own films, curbs most of his heavy-handed tendencies (namely lots of neon and high-stunt spectacle). Colin Farrell's big "confession" scene is the only moment where the movie smacks of melodramatic schmaltz. Following in the footsteps of last year's "Panic Room," "Phone Booth" is another exercise in 'confined cinema' that's not as deep or endearing, but, at 80 minutes, passes quickly and is never dull. (One complaint: the opening sequence, which indulges in slo-mo, fast-forward, zooms, split screens, and an out-of-place voiceover narration, plays out like a commercial for AT&amp;T. I almost expected the disembodied voice to ask me to switch my long-distance service.)6/10</fullReview>

The caller is someone who will put Stu through the biggest ordeal he's ever suffered, but saying any more would merely spoil it.The roles of caller and victim are expertly played by Keifer Sutherland and Colin Farrell - both get the tension and level of stress to a tee.Given the claustrophobic nature of the story there's little point revealing more, apart from the character of Farrell - an arrogant, superficial public relations executive, who is perhaps the perfect person to go through this.An excellent exercise in thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I would like to say, this is all my personal opinion..I don't want to step on any toes, so don't think I am trying to sway you to my way of thinking, I'm not. Just stating my opinion. Okay...I'll state it for the record...I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan. I didn't like him in the Recruit. He didn't have much of a role in the first Daredevil, so nothing really bad to say there, just kind of a boring role. He also didn't do much for me in Minority Report. Kiefer Sutherland was incredible in this movie. It's easy to show emotions on the screen when you have an audience to play it up for, but to only be a voice on a phone line makes it so much more difficult. Now, don't get me wrong...I saw some emotions from Colin Farrell...as opposed to his normal hurt puzzlement (that's what I call his one and only emotion), but Sutherland was incredible. And, regardless of my feelings, I did think the movie was better than average..well worth a matinee price at a movie theater, but not worth the evening $8.50.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suddenly hot, new Irish actor Colin Farrell is everywhere: "Daredevil", "The Recruit" and now "Phone Booth". In this movie, he is rarely off the screen, since the action is real time(ish) and largely located in and around the Manhatten booth of the title, thanks to the use of split screen and superimposed images that keep the action tightly focused.It's the kind of lean, single-site thriller that Alfred Hitchcock might have made (think of "Lifeboat), but actually comes from director Joel Schumacher (maker of two of the Batman movies) and scriptwriter Larry Cohen.Farrell plays slimy publicist Stu Shepard who uses the phone booth to set up a liaison which he hopes will lead to an affair, while a virtually unseen Kiefer Sutherland is the self-appointed moralist sniper who has him pinned down physically and psychologically. Early on in their bizarre conversation, Stu pleads: "What do you want?", to which the anonymous caller insists: "I want your complete attention". Thanks to lively camerawork and sharp dialogue, plus a running time of only 81 minutes, the film commands our attention throughout, although the ending could have been stronger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie 2 nights ago with a friend and an audience of about 10, since it was late night and one of the last showings. I bought my cotton candy and fruitopia and sat down for what I thought was going to be a mediocre, yet good movie. Well, after the only one preview (which I think, if I can remember was for The Core) the movie started. It looked like a freakin cell phone commerical but then came out celebrity agent Stu. I didn't particularly like the cinemetography but nonetheless it added to this brave, unique film. All thoughout the movie, noone in the theatre talked, everyone on the edge of thier seat, like me! The storyline and direction is very good, and from beginning to end it was a great all around movie. Spoiler Alert 9/10 - I deducted one because SPOILERS AHEAD after he got out of the Phone Booth, and found the pizza guy dead, it was pretty much obvious the killer was still alive, most movies do end like that!</fullReview>

Colin Farrell is certainly proving to be one of the greatest actors of the year with 5 of his films all coming out this year. Kiefer Sutherland is also great and makes a perfect voice for the part of the caller. Katie Holmes is absolutley gorgeous and so adorable and overall this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is the movie that exposes the BT advertising of years ago that told us it was 'good to talk' as a cruel lie as Colin Farrell uses a public phone to call a girl he has designs on so it won't show up on his mobile bill and alert his suspicious wife. Sadly, Kiefer rings him on the same number and is one of those irritating people who just talks and talks and loves the sound of own voice. Hes got so much to say in fact that he'll kill Farrell if he hangs up. Anyone who's had a conversation with my mother will know how he feels. From then on this minimalist thriller grabs the attention and holds it until the end, due in no small part to Farrell's believable turn as the shallow pr guru who realises over the course of his 90 minute chat that he needs to take stock of his life, buy a new mobile phone and be a better person should he survive. Director JS (as hes known to no-one)uses split screens to open the field of view a little and as the psycho on the other end of the line, Sutherland is suitably menacing. If Phone Booth drops the ball toward the end with a hurried and somewhat anti-climatic last 5 minutes then its still worth watching if only to see Katie Holmes as Farrell's would be bit on the side and imagine her naked in 'The Gift'all over again. If Farrell had the guts to have reversed the charges this would be a 10, as it is i'm calling in a 7.</fullReview>

It wasn't what I expected and even based on what it was it was underwhelming. What we have with "Phone Booth" is Joel Schumacher taking this idea - an idea so simplistic that it's nearly brilliant - and turning it into a standard commercial Hollywood hostage-crisis flick instead of expanding it into all that it could be. The basic story and some of the rich dialogue (all from The Caller), strives for depth, existentialism and beats with the heart of an independent film. However, Schumacher has pounded away those aspirations with a Jerry Bruckheimer/MTV/ADD style. The movie does looks good (love the picture-in-picture box showing us who Colin Ferrell's Stu is talking to on his cell phone) and the movie does sound good. But, while it works superficially with the onscreen action, it doesn't meld with the deeper ideas the film is trying to get to us. The constantly pulsating music keeps the pace of the film moving along, but doesn't do anything in the way of making it suspenceful or exciting. It's a diverting afternoon at the theater, but ultimately I took nothing away from it.The other big mis-step is how wasted the talent is. Particularly Forrest Whitaker who is given the thankless hostage negotiator role. In true Hostage Crisis movie form, Whitaker even has to deal with the other high-stung-negotiator who disagrees with everything he does because it goes against his own shoot-first-ask-questions-later plan. While Stu stands in the phone booth and the sniper harasses him on the phone an array of unoriginal, uninspired movie cliches parade around them. Katie Holmes does little more then stand around, but Rhada Mitchell (Pitch-Black) is pretty good as the cheated-on wife. Another problem I had was with Stu. Colin Ferrell does a fine job turning this guy from creep to torn-down man. Problem is that we never really hate Stu enough to demand we see him change, and on the flip side, we don't like him enough to pull for him to live. While it has a distinct villian, the movie has no hero. It is resigned to keeping Stu standing idly by in the booth while the cops do their usual thing to get him out and take the movie from him. This simple concept would have really given us our money's worth if Stu had challenged the Sniper and found some ingenious way to save himself. The ending is a total let down. We've see it all before and although I really want to because they were great, I won't mention all the movies the ending recalls because it would give it away.The star of the show, from begining to end, is Kiefer Sutherland's voice on the other end of the phone. After being so great on an A-list show like "24" he is pretty much slumming it here dipping back into movies. It's his creepy, charasmatic voice and his sometimes quite funny lines that keep out interest in the movie long after it's gone on autopilot. He channels all sorts of unforgettable recent villians from Hannibal Lecter to Kevin Spacey's John Doe with just a pinch of "Rusty Nail". The ending payoff should please the crowd of new fans he's gotten because of "24". It begs the question: Why isn't there an Oscar category for Best Voice Performance? Is it just me? Seems like they've been talking about this for years (ever since Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Woods in Hercules) but it's never happened. Sutherland proves that not only could the category be used for animation but also for voice overs in live action.

		<shortDescription>an impressive tour-de-force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a movie industry in which thrillers are, quite literally, a dime a dozen, it takes a certain amount of creative ingenuity to make one that stands out from the crowd. Writer Larry Cohen and director Joel Schumacher have hit on just the right formula to achieve that effect in `Phone Booth,' a cleverly conceived tour-de-force that knows ? as so few thrillers do - that the best way to get into the psyche of an audience is by keeping things simple and by tapping into basic fears we all share.And nothing could be simpler or more basic than the blueprint for this scenario. Stuart Shephard is a driven, self-absorbed, and slightly amoral Manhattan public relations `executive' who one day makes the fatal mistake of picking up a ringing pay phone on a busy New York City street. On the other end is a madman who tells Stuart that, if he hangs up, he will be shot dead on the spot. With its intriguing single-location setting, `Phone Booth' is able to strip its story of all the clutter that goes into the plots of so many thrillers and concentrate on the human drama at its core. As the narrative unfolds, Stuart finds himself looking down the loaded barrels of the NYPD sharpshooters who mistakenly believe Stuart has shot a man and consider him their primary suspect. The reason the film works is because we can all imagine ourselves caught in a similar situation, knowing the truth but being unable to tell anyone what it is. We are also made aware that our whole comfortable existence could be forever altered by an action as simple as picking up a phone. The film also works as a compact morality tale, as the killer becomes the disembodied Voice of God, calling the `evildoers' to account and raining destruction on their heads if they don't confess to their wrongdoings and seek dispensation and redemption. By the end of the film, Stuart has turned into a surprisingly complex character as he comes to reevaluate his life in terms of his personal and professional ethics and values, coming to realize finally what is and what is not important in this life. The film gives Colin Farrell a chance to command the screen in a way that few actors ever get the opportunity to do ? and he does a splendid job. The camera focuses on him for almost every moment of the movie's taut 80-minute running time. In addition, Forest Whitaker provides him with a stalwart foil as the police captain who is trying to cope with a combustible situation that he cannot fully comprehend. And it's amazing that the writer can make such a strangely compelling character out of the killer who is revealed to us through nothing more than voiceover narration. In fact, the madman here is probably the greatest unseen character since the computer, Hal, in `2001.' There are those, I've found, who balk at this film for being too simplistic and claustrophobic ? but it is just those qualities that make `Phone Booth' a cut above the rest of the thrillers out there now. Cohen and Schumacher could have gone for the easy sell ? multiple locations, screeching car chases, blazing gun battles ? but that would have made `Phone Booth' just another `innocent man on the run' clich. All involved with this film deserve credit for helping to revitalize a genre that has grown mighty lackluster and stale of late. Their product is one of which they can be justifiably proud. </fullReview>

It also puts the actors right out the front and let them do their job without some disturbing cheap effects to attract viewers.What I didn't like though was that it got just a little bit too moralising towards the end.

		<fullReview>spoilers..SPOLIERS... I think Katie Holmes is in this movie, though I have only seen the trailer. However, in seeing the trailer I pretty much gathered all the information I need to review this movie. The film is about a young man who for some reason doesn't have a cell phone, or possibly his own apartment/house with a home phone, thus he answers random phones around the city. I assume that he assumes that every call is for him since he doesn't have his own phone. It turns out that Keefer Sutherland is on the other end of the phone and didn't, in fact, want to speak with Will Farrell, who plays the lead, (note that Will Farrell also has had sex with Britney Spears). Sutherland wanted to speak with Katie Holmes who couldn't get to the phone on time because she was busy with James Vanderbeek and Pacey. When Holmes, (sister of Preist Holmes?), gets to the phone she sees Farrell and recognizes him as the guy who bonked B-Spears, she goes crazy cause Dawson starts whining like a little homo so she shoots this fat lady in the back of the head. When Farrell sees this he gets upset cause he likes fat chicks, then some idiot cop, possibly Carl Winslow, assumes that Farrell shot the fat broad when it was obviously Holmes cause she's holding a gun bragging about she just offed the fat sloot. Anyway, the movie goes on for a while while farrell calls some phone sex lines and whacks off in front of everyone. Everyone gets disgusted, except Spears, and then the movie ends while Tony Danza beats Christopher Lowell to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Wasted Second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**WARNING: SPOILERS (FOR A DIFFERENT MOVIE): The best thing about Phone Booth is its brevity. It is a short movie, but in this case, "short" translates as succinct, to the point. There really isn't a wasted second. As characters are introduced, we are given a very shorthand version of their personalities and their place in this particular tale (though it is amazing how intricately cult screenwriter Larry Cohen manages to work in threads of their pasts in order to give us a fuller view of the person). I saw this two days after seeing The Core, and it is interesting to compare the two. The Core, while fun-ish, is really a bloated and overloaded contraption with one crucial flaw: the crisis gets solved, but the movie doesn't end. When the earth-drilling vessel ended up trapped on the ocean floor, the movie just stopped cold; the crisis was over, why add an anti-climax? Phone Booth, on the other hand, gets to its point, and then--bam, bam, bam!--the plot just catapults along, the central issue gets resolved (I won't say how), and the movie is over. It's so quick even uber-hack Joel Schumacher doesn't have a chance to destroy it. What a fun movie; it moves so fast, it's embarrassingly bracing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Colin Farrell gives a near show stopping performance as a cocky publicist who is two faced in relationships, both personal and buisness. Then one day he answers a public phone. The man on the other line claims to have a sniper rifle aimed directly at him and makes his next 24 hours purely suspensful. A story that packs one hard hitting, shocking scene after another, Phone Booth is destened to be one of the best films 2003 will ever see. Farrell throws us a shocking performance as the star, showing that he can act really well. In his other work we haven't seen a lot of potential, but man did he give us potential here. Keifer is a pure treat as the sniper. His voice shows that he has excellent acting potential that doesn't require physical acting in every film he does. The only thing this film lacks (and although it's one thing, this concept torpeedos the whole movie): it is just too short. If things dragged on longer and more complications were involved then 90% of the audience could enjoy it more. Never-the-less Phone Booth is a movie that no suspense film fan shouldn't see. 8.7/10</fullReview>

To be honest with you I didn't even need to watch the film to know that I wouldn't like it! Why, because the advert for it told me it was a complete copy, maybe not literally, but it's obviously a complete of the film 'Liberty stands still', the only difference is that the hero of the film in Phone Booth is a guy and in Liberty stands still she a girl. And the fact that she uses a cell phone and is chained to a hot dog stand where as obviously the main character in Phone Booth is in a phone booth!Of course there are differences, but only minor ones, but basically the plot is exactly the same! So if you have seen 'Liberty Stands Still', don't watch it, and if you haven't seen it don't watch it, it doesn't deserve that, coz it's complete fake!

The premise behind the film is the breakdown of a man who "pretends" to have it all. I recommend you to see this movie if your not the type that is going to dwell over the fact of why he stays in the booth and even goes back after he hangs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone here see Phone Booth? I really liked it. It was well paced and very suspenseful. All the performances were great! Colin Farrell was superb. He really carried the whole movie. Forest Whitaker was great too.I think that this is director Joel Schumacher's best film. The screenplay was worthy of Hitchcock. The cinematography had interesting camera angles. Even the special effects at the beginning and end were pretty cool.Overall, I had an enjoyable afternoon at the movies.My grade: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You just KNEW it wasn't gonna be a tidy ending after such an involvedstory-telling. Never mind the lingering questions (How DID the sniper get all that information on him? Just by bugging the phone booth?) the film was a great ride. Sutherland, like his father, has such a wonderful and menacing voice andappearance. He was perfect. I didn't know he was in the film and throughout the thing I was wondering where they got the great voice talent... I didn't recognize him. Colin Farrell did a great job of taking his character from a thoroughly unlikable lout to a truly sympathetic character. I'm still thinking about the use of the last phone booth in a world of cell phone ubiquity as a vehicle to force the confessions of a man who exemplifies the duplicity and mendacity that themodern world takes for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great set-up, disappointing finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Phone Booth' was shelved for months in the wake of the sniper attacks in the DC area last year. Now it's in full release, and since it was made, Colin Farrell has become the hottest thing in Hollywood. So here's a chance to see a rising star in a film he made before his big breakout. It's interesting enough for that - and its strong setup - but unfortunately not enough else.The hook for the film is outstanding. Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a conniving press agent who manipulates everyone he knows to get marginal gains. His phone is his lifeline - it defines him. Every day, he uses an old-style walk-in phone booth in NYC to call a young ingenue that he's heavily flirting with (played by Katie Holmes). After making his daily call, the phone rings - it's a man who tells Stu not to hang up, since he's got a rifle aimed right at him. That's it - the rest of the movie plays off of that tension.The good: Farrell gives a paper-thin role everything he's got. Stu is the kind of guy who thinks he's a player, and maybe on some basic level, he is one. But he's just one of a million faces in New York, and isn't given any depth by this script. We know he's married (to Radha Mitchell), and for all his sleaziness, apparently hasn't cheated on her. Yet. But his story is incomplete. We don't know where Stu comes from, how on earth he got into this situation, or most importantly, why we should care. Despite all that, Farrell almost pulls it off by portraying Stu's false bravado and quickening panic - it's easy to empathize with his plight.Keifer Sutherland is used brilliantly here as the voice of the sniper. He has the perfect voice - great pitch, distinctive sound, and puts just the right emphasis on the sinister and the nearly-psychotic. He's very threatening. However, the character of the sniper is a problem. He has way too much information about Stu (from what, bugging the phone booth? Does he do anything else but follow Stu around?), and is shown as the all-powerful, all-knowing villain who can't be beaten because he sees everything. Even the cops become wary of him. A voice like this definitely creates tension - he could do anything! - but there's no rhyme or reason here. Thin motives are suggested rather than offered - it's clear that this isn't a script designed to get in the head of a sniper, but one designed to make everyone watching nervous as hell. Does it work? For a while. Then it becomes repetitive and even silly.On the downside, we have Forest Whitaker misused as an earnest-beyond-belief policeman who seems to have read the script - he realizes Stu's predicament from what seems to be pure intuition. Radha Mitchell cares way too much for a guy the movie spends a lot of time turning into a superficial jerk, and Holmes is nothing more than window-dressing.After a promising start, 'Phone Booth' doesn't seem to know where to go. It gets wrapped up in false finishes and teases, but works itself into a corner, and doesn't seem willing to commit. If Stu was supposed to be a jerk that gets redeemed, then what's the problem with *really* making him a jerk, and giving this a real payoff when he sees the error of his ways? If the tension is to pay off, we need to have real emotional investment, and it just isn't there. Without giving spoilers, there's even a hedging on the sniper himself near the end of the movie, regarding his motivations. I would rather have seen this with a tighter script, trimmed down to about 45 minutes, and aired on TV as part of an anthology series. Whitaker's 'Twilight Zone' would have been a better home for this. Rating: 6/10, based on the strong hook and the performances of Farrell and Sutherland, who carry the whole film on their backs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Phone Booth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are millions of cell phones in the United States alone. Hundreds of millions in Japan, England as well as other European countries are used every day. But when was the last time you used a phone booth to call your wife or to call a client or something like that? Not many people can really say "Just recently" in the modern high-tech world we live in today. But the phone booth is the backdrop for the new thriller starring rising star Colin Farrell. The film has been delayed several times due to the recent sniper shootings in the Washington D.C. area but has finally made it to theaters. But will the delay kill the project or will movie-goers rise above the bad memories and catch the flick?The story goes that a man named Stu Shepard who is a big shot New York publicist. He makes many phone calls day in and day out to many clients. But today is different. For once, he is getting a call. Not from his cell phone but from a phone booth. A phone booth that is planned to torn day the next day. Stu does not know the man who is calling him but he does everything the man tells him. Why? The man who calls Mr. Shepard is a man who is aiming a sniper rifle right at him and if Stu does something he doesn't like then somebody has to pay for his mistakes. Stu is forced to face his fears including the thoughts he has had about cheating on his wife.The story for Phone Booth is very well done. Going into this film, you might be a little worried about the film especially after the recent sniper shootings in Washington but the film is presented in the right tone so no one is offended by any material presented within the course of the feature. Another worry is the director, who many blame for killing the Batman film franchise but those worries should be put to reset with Phone Booth.The cast of Phone Booth is very well assembled. There were many A-list actors offered the lead role in Phone Booth. Among those actors were Jim Carrey, Will Smith, and Brad Pitt. But perhaps it was better they did not land the role. In this type of situation, the celebrity playing a character in a phone booth is just a celebrity in a phone booth. You don't actually feel for the character if you know they are an A-list actor. Colin Farrell, who is becoming a rising star being featured in such films as Minority Report, The Recruit, and Daredevil, is the perfect match for the film. Since he is not as big as a star like Tom Cruise, he makes you feel worried for him throughout the course of the film but his rising star power does take some of that feeling away as well. Though you do not see him much in the film, Kiefer Sutherland is fabulous as the voice of the sniper. It is more difficult to convince an audience that you are a certain character just by using your voice then it is acting on screen and the movie audience should applaud what he does for this film. Maybe it was better he was not seen with many recognizing him only for his work on the television series 24 more then anything else. Forest Whitaker, who is the host of the new Twilight Zone on UPN, is pretty good but you don't see much character development from him which is slightly disappointing. Katie Holmes is fine as the girl Stu is interested in but you only see her in a few scenes so her character is nothing more then a small spot within the course of the whole film. Not that her character is not important but you never get to see her full range of acting.Overall, Phone Booth is very fascinating thriller that is highly recommended especially with the large amount of low rate fare that is currently out in theaters. Though the film is wonderful, there are some things to pick at. Such things include the length of the film. The film seemed too rushed at moments. Another thing to pick at is the use of slow motion and fast motion effects throughout the course of the feature. Some of them were well placed but many were unnecessary. This was also a problem in another Colin Farrell feature, Daredevil. Also some of the characters could have used better character developments then they received. Other then those small things, Phone Booth is highly recommended except for those who may have bad memories about the recent sniper shootings in Washington or any terrorism attack for that matter.My Rating: **** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've Been Even Shorter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is the perfect idea of a good idea made into a terribly uninteresting and repetitive movie. Every five minutes Kiefer Sutherland (who is normally a great bad guy) says something like "If you do that, I'll shoot you" or "If you don't do this, I'll shoot her." To start off, the use of picture-in-picture at the beginning was not only annoying but took away from the dialogue of the film. Then after the first 20 minutes it was never used again. The fact that Colin Farrell's face is on screen for 77 of the 80 minutes might appeal to teenage girls, but not to the average moviegoer. And I don't mind that it was short, but it shouldn't have been so repetitive. The best fifteen minutes of this film should be pieced together to make a really intense short. And it could certainly go without its little "moral message" at the end. Farrell, Sutherland, and Forest Whitaker are all very talented actors, and Joel Schumacher is normally a rather innovative director (especially Falling Down). But Phone Booth, although it keeps your attention, makes you more than anything wish that all the characters would just get shot and end it. Overall- 2/10, for a creative idea.</fullReview>

I'm not going to give away any plot detail because it's simple there's a man who answers a phone at a phone booth and he can't hang up or he'll die. There's more to it then that, and that's what made it so exciting. You can also see that Collin Pharrel's peronality shows through his character of Stu because Collin likes to swear a lot and so does Stu. If you do not want a waste of eight dollars or maybe twenty whenever it comes out to DVD then go and see Phone Booth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb suspense film with fine performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film without prior knowledge of its existence at a screening immediately prior to the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. Truthfully, I and colleague Gerald Pratley had time to kill between scheduled viewings and seats were avalable for Phone Booth. and a quick glance at a fact sheet told us that Forrest Whittaker was in the cast.The plight of the press agent, played by Colin Farrell, whose existence I was unaware of until this moment, had me on the edge of my seat with sweaty palms. He musty surely be considered a nominee for 2003 awards. Writing, direction and editing made what, in retrospect, was a rather unlikely set of circumstances, throughly plausible and we surrendered to the creators' wishes.But isn't that what good thrillers are all about?This is a film I'll watch again, but of course the suspense will be gone, as it proved with all suspense films. I'd like to see it in the company of a person who comes to Phone Booth cold but that's likely impossible since the film's box office status has ensured it will continued to be talked about..I implore the curious to stay away from internet spoilers on this one and even to avoid brief synopses.</fullReview>

The plot was amazingly original, and the acting was more than decent, with major props going to Kiefer Sutherland for the voice of the sniper. And thankfully, the movie was short, I can't imagine how much this would have sucked with another twenty minutes of footage, meaning the entire movie was consice and to the point. My only complaint? Farell's accent, which seemed to appear and disappear at will got kind of sad. Overall better than average, I'll give it an 7.5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER!!!! If seeing human emotion really sways you, you'll love this movie. It's light on the action side, so if that's what you need, don't bother with this movie. Granted, there is some action, but for the most part its talking.Phone Booth is about Stu Shepard, a publicist who gets into a phone booth to call one of his clients, whom in truth Stu only helps so he can cheat on his wife with her. However, after hanging up, he gets a call from a man who seems to know about his toying with the client, amongst other things. When Stu tries to leave, the caller tells him he has a gun and will kill him if he hangs up. Soon, a local pimp, enraged that Stu will not let his hookers use the booth, tries to smash down the booth. Just as he is about to get to Stu, the caller shoots the pimp, which is interpreted by the unknowing crowd as a shot from Stu. The police soon arrive and the caller twists with Stu's head while the police try to figure out what is going on.This movie really plays with your emotions. The caller is not your typical psycho, he is really a good man out on a mission. Each moment becomes more suspenseful and the end is really impactful. This movie, in my opinion, is the best display of human fear ever to hit the screen. Everything feels real and not scripted. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Quality Popcorn Flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**The premise is simple. Man answers phone; will be shot if he hangs up. But telling a story from that premise is much trickier. Countless omissions or flaws could have easily dragged down this movie, but the script covers all the outs. Some of them take longer to get to (one in particular came late in the second act and added another dimension to the tale), but the small twists and turns fit nicely into the flow and pacing of the story. The acting in "Phone Booth" is solid; the entire cast provides exactly what is needed. Colin Farrell is very good as the slick-talking publicist, and his transformation throughout the film is both believable and effective without going over the top. An impressive job considering he was probably on screen 80% of the movie. Kiefer Sutherland's almost gravelly voice is perfect for his nearly invisible role as the sniper. Forest Whitaker provides another good performance ("Panic Room") as a flawed and sympathetic gentle giant. Everyone else fits in dutifully. The hookers annoyed me, seeming over the top. Of course I've never been around NYC hookers, so maybe they do actually behave that way.Technically, "Phone Booth" contained more originality than most flicks of this genre. I loved the picture-in-picture effects. Not only were they fun and refreshingly different, they were also a plot device, keeping you in the movie by holding you at the dramatic scene, yet simultaneously providing needed glimpses of other characters. The choice not to reveal Sutherland until the epilogue was perfect. It maintains tension by veiling the threat, and a hidden threat is almost always better than a visible one. Speaking of maintaining tension, the length (80 minutes) of "Phone Booth" was a wise decision. Long movies are not inherently bad, but too many movies seem like they have been stretched out in order to hit the two hour time mark. "Phone Booth" did what it had to do and got out on top. It set the stage, introduced the necessary characters, then dove headlong into the suspense. The suspense held up via crisp pacing and the constant logical thinking of each character. All that led directly to the final act, which was both satisfying and entertaining. Some will say that "Phone Booth" moralizes too much. I understand the argument, but disagree with it. What moralizing there is works because of its universal appeal to whatever inherent good humans possess. While Farrell's smooth yet deceitful character appeals on the surface, when the proverbial push comes to shove, no one truly wants to be that kind of person. Many people would welcome being forced into such brutal honesty, although preferably not under similar circumstances. Bottom Line: A superb popcorn flick, featuring good pacing and smart thinking. Very enjoyable and satisfying throughout. Three of four stars.</fullReview>

It didn't ever get boring, and all of the performances were good, especially Keiffer Sutherland, well voice I guess. The really cool thing was in the theater, the sound was played according to where the character was at, so if Stu was talking to someone on his right ear, then that characters voice came from the right side of the theater.

		<fullReview>I must admit that I was skeptic about watching a movie that failed to change locations. Not only that, but I was skeptical about watching a Joel Schumaker movie, since he tends to ruin a large majority of the films he directs. But, I'm happy to report, that Phone Booth surpassed my expectations. The film starts out with some background on our main character Stuart, played wonderfully by Colin Farrell. Stuart, is a cocky New York publicist, who goes to the same phone booth everyday and places a call to his girlfriend (Katie Holmes), at the same time. Of course, this repetitive behavior has made him a prime candidate for a stalker. Today, when Stuart goes to make a call, he won't be able to hang up. Phone Booth was an amazingly well done film, however still flawed. I found it to be interesting, yet predictable. Shocking, yet typical. However, compared to most of the films you could be watching, Phone Booth comes out as a winner.</fullReview>

I thought that this movie was casted very well, in that I believed that Colin Farrel portrayed the role of the arrogant publicist who realizes the truth about himself. On a similar note, I thought that Forest Whitaker's part as as the cool and composed police chief was a good fit for him.

		<shortDescription>WICKEDLY ENTERTAINING, BUT FAR FROM A GREAT FILM...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows in the footsteps and even surpasses some of the films of the last decade dedicating and priding themselves simply on a highly entertaining plot (both "Speed" and "Panic Room" come to mind). Although none of these films are truly amazing films (duh....), they are very fun if you're looking for a good use of $10 and two hours at the movies. "Phone Booth," ending after only about an hour and twenty minutes, succeeds where "Speed" and "Panic Room" could not--it never lags, and doesn't try to wrap everything up in a corny Hollywood bundle. From the first frame to the last you are entirely engaged and hardly can wait for the next plot development. "Phone Booth" is indeed very intense and almost so much so that at times it's hard to watch. As with all these rollercoaster films the dialogue was only average, but "Phone Booth" does blow-away its predecessors in two very important categories: Script complexity and quality of acting. Both Farrell and Whitaker are fantastic, and don't just make the movie believable, but really a nail biting experience. Farrell's transformation from a cocky and pretentious playboy to a fearful victim to a man pushed to his limits was truly solid, and finally establishes him as a fine actor (if only he could choose his projects better...Daredevil??). My real problem with the film was the complete hack direction job by Joel Schumacher...lime green split screens and other equally nauseating cheap effects prove that the director has no respect for the intelligence level of his audiences, and reminded me of the 1970's sex-ed films I was forced to watch in junior high. Schumacher obviously likes Farrell, and I will give credit to the director for bringing out a great star-performance as well as solid supporting roles. I also enjoyed the stable and to-the-point cinematography, but Schumacher really made an error with the crappy effects. Where "Speed" and "Panic Room" really failed was their lack of any thought-provoking moments in the script, and "Phone Booth" proved to be a taut physical AND psychological thriller . Anyway, I do suggest this film, rental or theater, as it's a rapid hour and a half and a good use of a few bucks. Very Fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute thrill ride. You can't take your eyes away from the screen. It's definitely worth your time and your money. Colin Farell does a great job at convincing the audience of his suffrage. And no matter how much of an A-S-S he was during the first 10 mins of the movie, by the end you can identify with him on many levels. The thing that I loved is that the movie is long enough to develop a coherent story line, but short enough not to start falling apart and boring its audience. Great Great Job!</fullReview>

Writer Larry Cohen has crafted a good script which comes out better than one might expect especially from a diretcor like Schumacher. Colin Farrel gives another great performance following the one he gave in Daredevil and Kiefer Sutherland is down right creppy as the sniper.

		<shortDescription>Finally! Finally! Finally!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a movie that's worth going to see at your local cinema. I just got home from a screening of Phone Booth and I have to say that it was terrific. While I was a little reluctant to go and see it after I found that Joel Schumacher, the man who brought us the terrible Batman and Robin, was at the helm of the film. I decided against this seeing as I liked the trailer. It was that simple.The movie starts out with Stu Shepard (Farrell) trying to prove to everyone that he can run with the big boys when it comes to being a publicist. However, when he stops at the only phone booth left in New York City to make a phone call to the woman he loves, outside of his marriage, things turn for the worst. Stu hangs up from Pam (Holmes) yet he receives one more call. A call that will change his life.One thing that makes this movie unique is Joel Schumacher's usage of split screens, letting the audience see what Stu and the caller (Sutherland) sees. Another thing that makes this movie interesting is the usage of grainy footage that looks as though its been recorded off of a home video recorder. While I can't exactly find the purpose of this camera technique, it does add to the drama and chaos that is escalating outside of the phone booth.All of the performances are strong. I'd have to say that the weakest performance in the entire film is that of Forest Whitaker's Capt. Ramey. Don't let this disuade you from seeing it though. His part just wasn't written as well as it could have been.All in all, I have to give major credit to Joel. While I, and a few others, bashed him for stomping the life out of the Batman franchise, I did genuinely enjoy this film. This is what making movies is all about.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This is probably the first great movie of 2003. Colin Farrell is spectacular as a sleazy New York publicist named Stu who is trapped inside a phone booth on the phone with an anonymous sniper who says he'll shoot Stu unless he follows his demands. The timing in this movie was really brilliant- the whole thing with the strippers and the poor cop (Forest Whitaker) who tries to negotiate with Stu to find out what is really happening is very interesting and clever. Colin Farrell proves that he is a true star, he is really quite amazing and shows a great range of emotions, going from sly and cocky to his raw, heartwrenching "breakdown" at the end. I think his "breakdown" scene is incredibly powerful. If he doesn't get nominated for an award it would be a shame. Also, Kiefer Sutherland does a great voiceover as the creepy sniper. Go see this when you get the chance, you won't be disappointed! 8/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed Joel Schumacher's work. The same goes for this great piece of work. I was amazed at how well one could build a whole story around a man in a phone booth. Points in the film had interesting presentations. Such as, displaying four different scenes at the same time. Plus, the sniper's voice is non-directional, as opposed to just a voice on the telephone. The only drawback with this film, is the rather slow beginning, but once the lead character steps into that phone booth, that's it. This is an excellent film with a great story, and excellent acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Stylish thriller from sometimes brilliant/often mediocre director Joel Shumacher (Good - "Falling Down", Weak - "Batman and Robin"). Nice eye candy supplied by the beautiful Radha Mitchell ("High Art") and the oh-so-cute Katie Holmes, still trying to break out of the "Dawson's Creek" shadow. The usually brilliant Forest Whitaker is fine with his small role, but make no mistake, this is the coming out party for Colin Farrell. Yes, he is the Hollywood bad boy of the moment, but he has proven to be more than capable on the big screen. Quietly intriguing in "Minority Report", Farrell explodes on the screen in "Phone Booth". Great face, great hair and great voice - Farrell has superstar stamped on his forehead, provided he keeps his head screwed on straight. His cocky bravado literally melts away under the pressure of outright fear caused by the creepy voice of the creepy Kiefer Sutherland. This is a very short film, but the intensity never wanes over the 80 minutes. Kind of a goofy ending, but doesn't really detract from the body of the film. Looking forward to Shumaker's film version of "Phantom of the Opera" next year, which will also include Katie Holmes. Note to Colin Farrell: Don't blow this. We are expecting great things from you. Choose your films wisely and work at your craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thriller has rising star Colin Farrell playing a cocky public relations guy who winds up stuck in a phone booth while a snipper forces him to chat on the phone.. meanwhile the cops surround him thinking he is the shooter.. A bit of a flawed premise because the cops initialy come off as pretty dumb in that this guy doesnt have any visible gun yet they take the word of a couple of hookers that he killed someone and they dont take him down even though he has no gun again.. Still the film does keep your attention and works fairly well due to the energetic performance of Farrell.. who doesnt bore you as he occupies pretty darn near every frame of the film. The movie does waste Rahda Mitchell and Katie Holmes who play his wife and possible mistress respectively, neither is more than window dressing. A hit and miss affair that works well enough.

		<fullReview>Minus the unnecessary outer space prologue and epilogue, the film is much more suitable as a special extended "Blue" TV program, in a 90 minute time frame (about 66 minutes without commercials). Set in a noisy, gritty New York City downtown area, Dennis Franz (Sipowitz) could play the Forrest Whitaker role, supported by all his cast regulars, while a special guest star would take on the Colin Farrell character. The film, featuring unsavory hookers, a pimp, and two lovely leading ladies, easily imitates the classic TV program's style in look and action, also recalling the top=notch "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975), which starred Al Pacino in a better, and more developed script for a feature film length. Even at 75 minutes (without the end credits), it's much ado about nothing, with an unsatisfying ending.</fullReview>

Just because a movie doesn't have explosions or other typical movie conventions, at least it was well paced and well put together (even if it was in just one location. While Kiefer Sutherland's role got a little preachy near the end of the film, at least it had a somewhat intriguing premise. Colin Farrell showed some actual acting ability, which displays his possible staying power in the industry. This film also may have saved Joel Schumacher's damaged career, after nearly ruining it with the likes of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful Script, Great Acting by Farrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher has directed so many bad movies I was certain this would be yet another notch on his bad movie belt. Instead, it was a pleasant surprise. The script was solid and suspenseful--which is no mesne feat given that virtually every scene takes place in a phone booth on a street corner. Farrell believably takes a call that he can't refuse. He displays tremendous range and control in this film, which is made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was holding a phone to his ear pretending to talk to someone on the other side of the line for probably 10 weeks of shooting. Okay, I realize that the premise is pretty far "out there," but the writer does a fine job of glossing over that fact and focusing on the credible portions of the script. Impressive. Sadly, Radha Mitchell gives perhaps her worst performance ever, and Katie Holmes is unusually bland, even by teen movie standards, but Farrell more than makes up for their shortcomings. Amazingly, his Irish brogue is nowhere to be found. Now will somebody explain to me why Leonardo DiCaprio got the lead in Gangs of New York instead of Colin Farrell? Casting is still a mystery to me. Sigh. Well, at least this film is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of a sniper teaching a lesson to a morally bankrupt sleaze was recently done more convincingly in the Wesley Snipes/Linda Fiorentino flick Liberty Stands Still. While Phone Booth has the edge in terms of continuity and pacing, its characters mostly lack depth and/or motivation with the exception of Farrell's Stu. And the trouble with him is that you care for him as much at the end as when he's introduced, ie not at all.His tormentor goes to ridiculously elaborate lengths to single him out for persecution. Psychotic he may be, but he's obviously very intelligent and could surely find a more deserving target than a nobody like Stu?It all zips along at a fair old clip, so there's not much time to ponder why Stu's wife puts up with the selfish sod and what the animosity between Forest Whitaker and the negotiator is all about. Annoyingly, the moviemakers don't know whether they want to warn or reproach us about the fact that we're all phone junkies. So what if we are? It's called progress.The result is a lean but forgettable thriller that plays like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits but shoots itself in the foot with its underwritten supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth (2003) D: Joel Schumacher. Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, Paula Jai Parker, Arian Waring Ash, Tia Texada. Incredibly suspenseful thriller about a slick New York publicist named Stu Shepard (Farrell) who is trapped inside a phone booth (the last remaining one in Manhatten), on the line with a sniper (Sutherland, unseen until the film's final minute) who frames Stu for a sniper murder. Highly original film is suspenseful from beginning to end, offers several plot twists, and doesn't drag on like most thrillers do (running time is only 80 minutes). Farrell delivers an unparalleled performance and Whitaker is almost equally as good as the police captain who is determined to negotiate with Stu. Holmes, however, is completely wasted. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence and profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a mixed review of this film.On the plus side, the acting is great, especially Colin Farrell. He's in the entire movie from start to finish, but he does a very good job. Aside from the fact that he's very easy on the eyes, he plays a wide range of emotions very believably, and he's a great actor.Also, it's very tense and exciting at times, it's shot in a modern, hip kind of way and it's an intriguing premise with a good cast.On the negative side, well for one, it's far far too short. It's only about 80 minutes, which makes it not much more than a tv show. I found that disappointing. It also has no set or pace changes, and for some may get a little boring after a while. Finally, I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the ending is a disappointment. So, if you're a Colin Farrell fan or are bored one day, go see Phone Booth, if you're easily critical of films, you may not like it.B- from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine got me to break one of my cardinal rules and actually go see another Joel Schumacher film. And you know what? It wasn't half bad. In fact it was pretty good.A variation on one of the most difficult films to pull off - i.e. a movie where all the action takes place in one location (one of the reasons so many stage plays fail as effective cinema) - Phone Booth is a tour de force for Colin Farrell and whatever the merits of his over inflated price tag he's up to the task with some considerable help from Forrest Whitacker and Kiefer Sutherland. A fun movie that at 80 minutes long does not overstay it's welcome. Why can't more flicks end when they are obviously supposed to - instead of tacking on 20 to 30 minutes of garbage that was so obviously inspired by the inane notes from a bunch of agents and studio suits? Those unbelievable "twists" that most studio movies end with only inspire the audience to leave the theater muttering in disgust and annoyance. One more quick note to any studio hacks that might be reading this (and I know that's a bit of a stretch - movie hacks reading fan posts rather than gumming up the message boards with fake comments) - this film was successful at the box office (the first week anyway) and it was written by a man who is over 60 years old. It played young and hip - and was written by a man over 60 years old! It played believable and it was written by a man over 60 years old!!!</fullReview>

But I do hope people noticed the great looking and gifted talent of John Enos in this flick who played the part of Leon, the guy who got killed in the gold shirt. He really creates a fantastic presence and has quite a reach of talent if anyone has seen his other projects. He projects himself well and fits into this sniper theme picture so beautifully.

		<fullReview>I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie! My heart was pounding the second Colin Farrell picked up the phone and we heard the killer's creepy voice. The story is about an agent named Stu who helps make aspiring actor's famous. Well one day, he takes a wrong turn into a phone booth to call his mistress. Before he has a chance to speak to her, a pizza guy interrups him from dialing, saying someone called him and told him to deliver pizza's to that phone booth. Stu rudely tells him he didn't order pizza's, but gives him money anyway. The pizza guy leaves. He then calls his mistress, but soon after, a madman with a rifle threatens to kill him if he hangs up. Stu dosn't believe him, until a man is shot. Witnesses claim Stu was the killer, and the Sniper says if he tells them the truth he will kill him. This movie was so scary! The acting was excellent. Colin Ferrall was outstanding, and truly deserves an Academy Award for his role. Every character in the movie acts excellent as well. You get scared of the killer the moment you hear his voice. This is Schumaker's best film yet! He's a genius! I gave this movie a 10 out of 10! It's a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(minor spoilers within) The screen debut of this relatively simple concept, delayed first by a lack of notoriety on the part of its main stars, and again by the Beltway sniper shootings, probably will leave a lot of 2nd year film students wondering "Why didn't I come up with something like this?"While the film derives the main idea of its plot from the 1996 indie film "End of the Line", Schumacher's direction (reminiscent of TV's '24', with real-time, split-screen shots, as well as numerous looks through the sniper's point of view, complete with crosshairs) gives a very entertaining cinematographical look to what is, with virtually no exception, a single-scene piece.Farrell delivers the latest of a long line of excellent performances (along with the latest of his seemingly endless bag of accents). His performance only wavers once or twice, particularly late in the movie during a rather emotionally overdone monologue scene.Sutherland's voiced character ends up as something of a vigilante, although his motives aren't made wholly clear as we're made to believe that he was almost justified in his actions. While this unresolved and inadequately explored "morality play" aspect of the film is what may prevent it from becoming a true classic, the film was still quite well done as a thrilling piece.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino circa Dog Day Afternoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is one of the best entries in the thriller category so far. I thought Colin Ferrell did an excellent job with his character. I hate to use this word, but he really did an Homage to Al Pacino; and this movie had feel of Dog Day Afternoon. I too was a little annoyed with the real time photography. I hope this is not a popular trend.Anyway, other than that no other complaints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was incredible. I loved this movie. This has, quite possibly, been the best movie I have seen all year. Kiefer Sutherland is amazing. He is extraordinarily creepy, but absolutely hysterical at the same time. The dialogue is awesome, and for a movie with a set that has a 100Ft radius, it is very exciting. If you haven't seen it yet, go. Screw Vin Diesel, go see Collin Farrel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just voted on the movie and the men voted higher than the women. The movie itself was excellently put together and you think Colin Farrel would have some kind of higher impact on the female viewers. That's my shallow reasoning, but even so, the movie was believable unlike many movies that put average people in intense situations, and the dialogue was written and played well enough that had the rest of the movie been weak it would have been worth seeing. No doubt in my mind this movie is a keeper for DVD and getting a high recommendation for theater goers. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique in it's premise, but just an okay film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Colin Farrell is one of today's up and coming actors, putting up good performances in the Recruit and Minority Report, his acting here can't quite carry "Phone Booth."The aspect that most of the movie is set on one phone booth in Manhattan and involves a dire situation between Farrell and the sniper is yes, interesting and new. But that said, the movie severely lacked in many areas. The voice, and dialogue, of the sniper became a little annoying by the end of the movie and I found myself just wanting the sniper to be killed or whatever just so he would shutup. I was almost laughing at times at Farrell's character and his demise or his life of "lies." At times the movie tried to be suspenseful and also tried to be funny, which has in the past worked out with movies, but with this one didn't quite make it.Because of the auspicious time of it's release during the war and the recent sniper massacre in DC, it was a little weird at times watching it. However, I think this type of movie will span many "copy-cat" movies that are set in one location for their entirety. I wouldn't see this in the theater, I'd wait for the rental, and only rent it if you are a)a big Colin Farrell fan or b)really bored on a Saturday afternoon. I give a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Colin Farrel was awesome in this movie. at first you want to hate him and then as he breaks down and confesess his sins, you cant help but feel a bit sorry for the guy. kiefer southerland was great too with his creepy voice on the other line. this was quite a movie and the ending is pretty much identical to "joyride", yet different. trust me the ending is perfect for a perfect movie! a must see for fans of suspense flicks, colin farrel,and psychotic snipers with a moral duty to judge sinners!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was priviliged to have seen a pre-release cut of "Phone Booth" and I must admit that the movie far surpasses my expectations. Not since "Cube" have I seen a film that takes what is essentially a single set for the whole movie and uses it effectively throughout. Colin Farell is fantastic as a self-involved businessman, and his performance really gets you to dislike his character, even though you must also feel sorry for his predicament. This balance is what drives the movie. Kiefer Sutherland was perfect for the role of the creepy sniper -- his voice just sounds scary. I was also very pleased that the director opted out of the feel-good, cookie-cutter ending that so many films seem to suffer from these days. In closing, even though I was able to see "Phone Booth" for free days ago, I still plan to go out to the theater and spend my eight dollars. The movie is that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your money on this movie. This was one of worst of the year so far, without question. The movie starts out with an unlikely PR guy (Colin Farrell) who cares about no one but himself getting stuck in a phone booth talking to a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland). The movie's attempts at suspense are continuously interrupted by corny one-liners in Sutherland's script, which effectively leave viewers bored out of their minds. The only good aspect was that my suffering was not prolonged, as the movie only lasts about an hour and 15 minutes. Take my word for it, and go see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times gave what I fear is an alarmingly typical review of _Phone Booth_, calling it a thriller that becomes "tedious moralizing." Oy. The only thing I can say to you people is to run along and watch _The Core_ or whatever movie is currently making fun of African American culture for cheap laughs._Phone Booth_ is a fantastic film, as well as one of the more socially important movies to come out lately. The basic idea of the movie is that, while you may not need to be a firefighter to be a hero, you don't need to be a rapist or murderer to be a monster, either. Stu Shepard is just such a monster. He's not being punished for his past actions so much as he is reaping the benefits of his attitude towards his fellow human beings. This is a simple but effective story about humanity and redemption, and to look at it as a moral treatise is to do it a great disservice.Technically, the film doesn't demand much. This is good, considering that Schumacher has proven himself to be a fairly incompetent director (having inflicted upon the world such cinematic wonders as _Batman Forever_ and _8MM_). In fact, the beginning sequences of the film led me to believe that Schumacher would indeed ruin the experience; they are the only times he is really given creative freedom and they are so gratingly annoying I actually felt myself getting angry.The film is script and actor driven, though, and it has plenty of both to go around. Colin Farrell is a knockout and Keifer Sutherland strikes just the right tone for the film. Forrest Whitaker looks a little confused (like always) but is ultimately satisfactory as a misguided cop who secretly fancies himself a therapist.The main thrust of this film is as simple and powerful as that of the writings of Flannery O'Connor decades before: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The right thing is always easy to do when you have a gun pointed in your face. _Phone Booth_ realizes that the audience members aren't in that situation, but challenges them to be excellent human beings anyway.See it if you're willing to reflect on yourself after watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead....Phone Booth is Colin Farrel's first "leading man role" since Tigerland a few years ago. Or I should say, its his first Hollywood Leading Man role, as Tigerland was a small independent movie that didnt get a wide release. For those who know him only as Bullseye, the villian in Daredevil, it should come as a surprise that he's talented enough to carry a movie on his own. And Phone Booth is a movie that quite literally requires just that, as he's on screen for 99% of the runtime, save for a few shots of the scared crowd, Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker. Its unfortunate, then that his best peformance in years comes in a film bogged down by its director, Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, Falling Down and most memorably...for all the wrong reasons...Batman and Robin). Schumachers More-is-More approach to film-making makes what should be a tense, Hitchock-ian thriller into a Bruckheimer knock-off with so many flashy techniques its like watching MTV on 3 different screens. But even Schumacher's style cant totally ruin the movie, it does have a few gripping, "whats-gonna-happen-next" moments. However the last fifteen minutes becomes a yuppie-redeeming-himself movie with a message which, while not entirely bad, kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting urban thriller thanks to Larry Cohen's playful talent, a creative filmmaker who doesn't take himself too seriously. Phone Booth delivers a few good B-Movie sequences that warrant its belated appearance in theaters (Cohen played with the idea of this particular script about thirty-years ago).However, this thriller requires a bit more suspension of audience disbelief : nobody with half a brain would even bother answering a public telephone! It's just too risky nowadays (at least in the movies) to answer any anonymous callers. Rule of Thumb: Let your machine take a message, or just walk away from the ringing.Actor Whitaker is truly a man of many talents as well but, frankly, he should stick to directing. Yet here he manages to come across as just another actor who agreed to play a formula "Columbo" (that thing he 'does' with his eye) without the forced naivete, or the characteristic patience required to endear the audience to his character. It would have been far more interesting to see him play the man trapped in the booth, and have Scottish actor Farrell play a gung-ho officer. Note to future directors/screenwriters: Phone Thrillers are definitely a thing of the past. Neve Campbell (Scream) and Colin Farrell are the only ones doing this particular type of thriller lately. And Cohen, let's bring back your "It's Alive!" babies with plenty of digital-effects so that we don't have to worry about whether we should be picking up an anonymous phone call (who even cares, really!)Lastly, how can you feel sorry for the main character? He's a pathological liar and a weasel, among other things, so one can't help but feel he had all of this coming to him. Stu, you got a cellular phone, for cornsake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good man is hard to find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times gave what I fear is an alarmingly typical review of _Phone Booth_, calling it a thriller that becomes "tedious moralizing." Oy. The only thing I can say to you people is to run along and watch _The Core_ or whatever movie is currently making fun of African American culture for cheap laughs._Phone Booth_ is a fantastic film, as well as one of the more socially important movies to come out lately. The basic idea of the movie is that, while you may not need to be a firefighter to be a hero, you don't need to be a rapist or murderer to be a monster, either. Stu Shepard is just such a monster. He's not being punished for his past actions so much as he is reaping the benefits of his attitude towards his fellow human beings. This is a simple but effective story about humanity and redemption, and to look at it as a moral treatise is to do it a great disservice.Technically, the film doesn't demand much. This is good, considering that Schumacher has proven himself to be a fairly incompetent director (having inflicted upon the world such cinematic wonders as _Batman Forever_ and _8MM_). In fact, the beginning sequences of the film led me to believe that Schumacher would indeed ruin the experience; they are the only times he is really given creative freedom and they are so gratingly annoying I actually felt myself getting angry.The film is script and actor driven, though, and it has plenty of both to go around. Colin Farrell is a knockout and Keifer Sutherland strikes just the right tone for the film. Forrest Whitaker looks a little confused (like always) but is ultimately satisfactory as a misguided cop who secretly fancies himself a therapist.The main thrust of this film is as simple and powerful as that of the writings of Flannery O'Connor decades before: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The right thing is always easy to do when you have a gun pointed in your face. _Phone Booth_ realizes that the audience members aren't in that situation, but challenges them to be excellent human beings anyway.See it if you're willing to reflect on yourself after watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising Suspenseful Movie Shot In One Location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is remarkable about Phone Booth is how the action and suspense can be sustained for so long with almost the entire movie shot in one location. Except the dorky opening music that eventually blends into a much more in sync sound, for two slight but irritating plot flaws, a relatively weak character development of the women in this movie, and a somewhat transparent ending, Phone Booth is mesmerizing with its unscene villian and the intensity and psychological rollercoaster that is presented on the big screen. Colin Farrell's character isn't the most likeable, even towards the end, there's still a question of redemption. The script for this movie and the acting required some tight and well thought out direction to keep this movie interesting and alive. While it bordered on becoming tedious, it never really disappoints. This is a powerful, compelling indepth look in the life of one man who must face the truth about his life. Seven out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a clever and highly watchable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tense, suspenseful thriller which takes a small idea and effectively expands it into an entertaining movie. The story highlights a cocky young N.Y.C. publicist and charlatan who answers a random phone call on the west side of Manhattan that makes him the target of a ruthless sniper determined to play a deadly cat and mouse game: by any means necessary. A simple concept played for all it's worth as the film is smart, innovative, and acted with conviction. Farrell?as a man caught in a life or death situation?has never been better, while Sutherland is a strong and menacing presence as his deadly antagonist. Far from a masterpiece, but very memorable considering the simplicity of its premise. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been really looking forward to this film since i first heard about it last November and I must say, I am rather disappointed. All I have heard about this movie is praise, but I just don't get it. The only saving grace for this film was colin farrell's acting, which was done well enough to be convincing, but still felt empty. Though it was nothing next to the hollowness of the chemistry of the characters. from Stu Shepherd's aide, to his wife, Pam, even the sinister voice, there was nothing. And to me, this is what brought this film down, I sat through the movie bored, because I couldn't care about any of these characters, and I didn't believe it. Not to mention the retarded idea of bringing in the police chief's personal problems, boy was that awkward. and ugly. Throw in the hasty ending that seems to have no thought behind it and you have yourself 81 minutes of a flick that is worth a watch, but certainly won't be going anywhere, or resurrecting Joel Shumacher's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the day it came out, which is the day i am writing this, and i have to say, it is one of the best movies i have seen in a while. I will say that i am huge fan of Colin's, i think he is an amazing actor, and in this movie he really shows what he can do. The accent is a little weak, but you have to forgive him, the guy's Irish. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It doesn't feel short because it moves in real time and so it would ruin the movie, i think, had it not run in real time, it adds a lot to the movie. By the end of the movie you really feel for colin's character, even though Katie Holmes character and his wife, kelly, aren't that great, Colin really carries the movie. The style is creative and really fits the movie and even if you think the story is a little far fetched, it'll probably suprise you for how good it really is. It really is worth it to see this movie, it's amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can I say... after about 4 years since I first heard about this film (plug for Patrick Sauriol and Corona for that one) I was really looking forward to tonight, the much delayed "Phone Booth" opening.No film, and I mean no film, is truly worth that long a wait to see and this one is no exception. But I want to praise it for what it DOES give. It gives you a good 1hr 20 mins show that only slows down to let you catch your breath before you're back off to the races again.The film was advertised correctly. What they hint at in the trailer is what you will see in the film. Nothing p***es me off more than a movie that promises to be one thing in an ad but in reality turns out to be something different. This movie held up its end of the bargain.I cannot praise Colin Farrell enough for his performance. He does a wonderful job. There is one scene in particular where he absolutely shines and you'll know it when you see it.Keifer Sutherland phoned in this role (ba dum boom ching). Actually he did do a good job considering he had to sell the audience on his voice acting for them to buy him as a threat. Good job Keif, glad to see you back in form again (cause as much as I dig it, "24" will run out of gas eventually so here's hoping the movies start rockin again for ya)The ending did leave some to be desired. But when you look at it.. why would this seemingly omnipotent sniper REALLY want to spend so much time and effort on a guy who is as tame as Farrell's character anyway?Anyway, it was a good film. Not great, but good. Kudos also to Schumacher for somewhat redeeming himself here. This is a good date film and one I'll add to my DVD collection. I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie mildly entertaining. The film was well written and well acted, yet I found my own personal qualms with the storyline, like the disregard for human life(note, I will try not to spoil the movie for anyone.) It basically just comes off as Kiefer Sutherland voicing a pseudo-psychologist trying to change the ways of one man. Sure, two innocents die in the process, but hey, it works, doesn't it? It did manage to hold my attention though and didn't drag on for too long. Good dialogue too, comprising most of the film. You'll never be able to guess the ending either (hint sarcasm). Overall though, it's probably better than most of the crap out there clogging up the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Intense Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is one of those rare intense thrillers that doesnt really take itself to seriously.The movie starts of were we introduce Stu Sheppard(Colin Farrell) as a ruthless lying Publicist. Stu finds himself unwillingly in a life or death situation in a matter of minutes. Trapped in this little Phone Booth on a busy New York street, with a madman breathing down his neck. What i enjoyed about the madman part was you never saw his face you never had a picture of him you only hadd the voice. Stu is eventually caught up in all his lies and bad deeds and make horrible decisicons about which way his life will turm. The intense part of this movie was how quickly the caller got Stu's life all tangled up and in his own hands, He had absolute control and there was nothing Stu could do. The movie plays with your own mind it makes you wonder what you would do in that situation, hang up or talk to the man and find out what he wants. Overall Phone Booth was a intense thriller about a man with literally his life on the line and what he has to do to get himself out alive. This movie is also bakced up by a great preformance by Colin Farrell, and Forest Whitaker. ***outof****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although it follows a simple concept, "Phone Booth" manages to keep you on the line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My two-thousand dollar watch is fake, and so am I," Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is forced to confess to all of the New York television cameras trained on the phone booth where he is holed up. Although everyone watching on their TV sets thinks that he is a crazed killer, in reality, he is trapped by a hidden sniper who won't let him tell hang up the phone or tell anything about the sniper's existence. Forest Whitaker plays the sympathetic police captain who tries to negotiate Stu's surrender.PHONE BOOTH, an efficient and effective thriller about a moral vigilante, directed by Joel Schumacher (8MM), may have plenty of schlock-filled moments, but I bet you'll be on the edge of your seat for all of its adrenaline-pumping 81 minutes. It does for phone booths what SPEED did for buses, turning them into very scary places.Stu is a lie-a-minute publicist who is brought to the emotional edge by a man known only as The Caller (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland from "24"). In addition to the usual business prevarications, Stu hasn't been telling the truth to either his beautiful wife (Radha Mitchell) or his gorgeous young girlfriend (Katie Holmes). The Caller forces him to fix that.Picture-in-picture, a trick from the video world, usually proves to be just a distraction in films. But Schumacher uses it quite effectively in PHONE BOOTH, enabling him to stay with the booth while simultaneously showing the action elsewhere.If Schumacher ever comes out with a longer, director's cut of PHONE BOOTH, don't waste your time watching it. The short length of this current version is perfect in maintaining the tension without ever lapsing into tedium.Grab a box of popcorn and prepare to be entertained by PHONE BOOTH. And, if you have any stock in a payphone company, you may want to dump it now, before too many viewers see PHONE BOOTH.PHONE BOOTH runs a fast 1:21. It is rated R for "pervasive language and some violence" and would be acceptable for teenagers.</fullReview>

Multiple windows not unlike "24" show different angle of the same shot or multiple characters at the same time.Colin Farrell is extraordinary in this role. He shows a wide range of emotions as the film progresses and each of them is completely convincing.Kiefer Sutherland is the only person with the voice able to pull off this role.

I had my doubts about this movie at first but I have to say that this movie grabs you in within 10 minutes of the starting point and doesn't let you go. I was so into this movie that even though I had to go to the bathroom extremely bad 30 mins before the movie was over I stayed in the theater because I didn't want to miss a single thing, and I always leave to go to the bathroom because I get to see movies for free so I can always go back some other time to watch what I may have missed. Just go see it! It's a lot of fun. Colin Farell is a brilliant actor, it's just a shame that he's a egotistical ass in real life. Hopefully he'll get a reality check soon because he could be great, he just needs a little attitude adjustment. And Keifer Sutherland is just awesome, chilling and thrilling. All around a great cast. I also love the way it was directed and edited. There's so much going on that it keeps you on your toes at all points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Phone Booth' is a modern morality play about personal disclosure in one exciting short movie making you respect the moral majority's power and suspect the neutrality of any phone call.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just realized grammar-school teacher Sister Alexia was right when she said confession is good for the soul. Joel Schumacher's `Phone Booth' is a modern morality play about personal disclosure in one exciting short movie making you respect the moral majority's power and suspect the neutrality of any phone call. Colin Farrell plays a publicist hurrying down a NY avenue much as a cocky PR man Cary Grant did in `North by Northwest' with an assistant in tow. Farrrell's cell phone is the only one he doesn't dismiss in his race to a telephone booth. Farrell ducks like Superman into a booth to call his mistress (His wife could trace a cell call). Sniper Kiefer Sutherland calls to inform Farrell he is in his sights and must confess his infidelity to his wife or be shot. The righteous in the audience were undoubtedly supporting the anonymous caller's call to confession. A pimp and his hookers, especially Paula Jai Parker concerned about her `dick hand,' try to wrest Farrell from the booth: They are as funny and menacing an ensemble as you will see in any urban story this year. The gritty street, the onlookers, and the police remind me of the urban realities Sidney Lumet created in a similar film, `Dog Day Afternoon.' Forest Whitaker as the cop in charge has a lazy eye perfectly suited to the slow machinations of the law. Schumaker's camera is active enough as it descends godlike from a satellite through phone lines, finally settling at the booth, gaily moving in and out and about to keep a potentially static one-act story kinetic with danger.You'll never pass a booth or open your cell again without thinking about this slight but engrossing thriller. Remember, Cary Grant in `NNW' had a hard time escaping the effects of a telephone call.The film closes showing the pervasiveness of the telephone and its allure. Although `Phone Booth' goes on to show us how insidious modern technology and telephones can be, the story is really about fidelity and truth, both old-fashioned notions with murderous implications here. And confession? Sister Alexia was right--I went deservedly every 2 weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: May contain minor spoilers!!!I was lucky enough to see Phone Booth in a special screening a few weeks back. I left the theater as satisfied as I could be. Colin Farrel did a stunning job as Stu Shepard, a publicist living it up in New York, who basically makes a living by lieing. He finds him self in the worst position possible as he is now trapped in a phone booth on 8th avenue with a man pointing a sniper rifle at him. Now this movie has got its twists, and its turn. But I just had one problem with the ending... I predicted it. Right from the begining with the pizza man, I had a feeling the end would involve him. But I knew it couldnt be him, being as home his voice and the man on the telephone had different voices (sure maybe he couldve had a voice changer thing..but no). When they lift the blanket to show who the killer was, and when it shows it the pizza man, your going to know it wasnt him. I wasnt suprised at all to have the man show up outside the ambulance, saying good bye to Stu. However, all in all, I thought this was actually one of my top 5 favorite movies of the year. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is about an unsavory individual that is trapped in aphone booth by a sniper who torments him for his misdeeds. Youmay be asking yourself (as I was) "you can make this plotinteresting for 2 whole hours?!". Yes, for nearly two hours this filmencompasses a 50' area surrounding a phone booth... and it'spretty darn good while doing it! I won't ruin any surprises by tellingyou the 'twists' (such as they are), but it's a fairly well-handled filmthat is an indirect (or not-so-indirect) commentary of indiscriminatecellular phone usage and society's newer seedy underbelly (videovoyeurism, ignoring the plights of others, big city indifference,overly aggressive police tactics, and much more). For thetrivia-minded; this film was completed quite some time ago butwas seriously delayed due to the sniper incidents in theWashington area last year. Seems political correctness hasdelayed yet another film for fear adults cannot control their ownemotions nor separate reality from fiction. Thank you censors! Ihate having to make my own decisions about what I can andcannot 'handle'!The acting is merely average. Colin Farrell does pretty well withwhat is essentially an hour plus of facial close-ups but I neverreally 'believed' his situation. Whether that was the script or theacting is open to debate (I suspect it was the latter). The sniper isvery well-voiced by someone you'll recognize if you go to themovies with any regularity. There are some mid-level namedactors you'll recognize and a nice surprise appearance near theend. I personally feel the writers/editors copped out (no punintended) on the ending, but I'll let y'all be the judge of that. I trulydisliked the opening and ending sequences as I felt theyGREATLY detracted from what was otherwise a fairly solid,straightforward film. The voice-overs are simply unnecessary andirritating.There is lots of profanity, indirect drug usage and implied nudity(mostly in the background), violence, and adult situations galore(yup, all in a phone booth for 2 hours). Not a film for the kiddos, butnothing there that will truly offend the sensitive (unless they arelooking to be offended or have a low tolerance for profanity). It's afairly original movie and that goes a long way with me these days.Go see Phone Booth if you get the opportunity. It may not beregarded as an 'instant classic' but it's a solid, original film that youwon't regret having paid to view.</fullReview>

The movie is 80 mins long, but they didn't take more than five minutes to develop his character. Anyone that has seen People I Know has seen a publicist live a fast paced life that leaves little room for caring for other people, etc. At least in Al Pacino's case he still made a somewhat endearing character.Some kind of twist at the end, perhaps Stu's evil past would have made this a better story. The caller was supposed to be a crazy vigilante, but he just kills an innocent guy on the street so Stu would eventually tell his wife that he is a loser. At least kill a guy for some good reason if you are trying to pass moral judgment.Phone Booth was a unique film, but overall didn't quite give me what I was looking for, 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to catch a private screening of this film last night in Toronto, and to sum it up in three words, it was; unique, clever, and surely enjoyable.Straight up, Phone booth was an edge of your seat, nail-biting, rear-end scratching, crotch holding thriller. You wouldn't want to devote a second of your time during the course of this movie to make a trip to the men's room, or refill that $8 coke bottle you guzzled down during the previews. Joel Schumacher did a magnificant job keeping you glued to your seat by focusing the cameras on that single phone booth and its surroundings. Though there are some obvious flaws during the course of this movie, it surely pleased the heck out of me. Colin Farell delivers a strong and at some point, sensative performance which may not be an oscar contender, but I must sure as hell give him credit for it. Equally, all the other actors are mediocre and above.If you have nothing to do on a friday night, go spend the $10+ and catch this flick, you sure as hell won't regret it.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do Kiefer Sutherland and phones go so well together?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, the Joel Schumacher who directed "Dying Young," "A Time To Kill" and "Batman Forever" is abducted and replaced by his good twin brother - the Joel Schumacher who directed "D.C. Cab" (hey, I was a kid when I saw it), "Flatliners" and "Falling Down." "Phone Booth," blessedly, comes from Good Joel, and has the same feel as the latter, in that both movies involve a day in a character in a big city where everything starts to blow up in his face.The story of a New York publicist (Colin Farrell) who's lying to his clients on one hand and to his wife on the other, and who suddenly finds himself very much on the spot when an unseen phone caller with a telescopic rifle traps him in the phone booth he uses to call Katie Holmes from (on account of his not wanting wife Radha Mitchell to know), it doesn't sound like a terribly gripping movie - apart from a few split-screen shots, the movie takes place entirely in or around the phone booth; there's very little violence (four people do get killed in the course of the movie, but I won't name names); and most of the action is verbal.But this movie's written by veteran Larry Cohen, an old hand at spinning compelling yarns in his scripts (admittedly he didn't direct this movie, but I always have time for the man who gave us "The Winged Serpent" and "The Stuff"), and the blueprint for "Phone Booth" ensures that the exchanges between Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland as our hero's nemesis - who remains offscreen for most of the movie - are as tense as if they were accompanied by all guns blazing. There's absolutely no way of knowing who if anyone'll make it to the end alive, especially with the noose constricting around Farrell's neck tighter and tighter as circumstances around him get out of control. Seeing him come practically to the edge is very unsettling, and the mindgames Sutherland's psycho plays drag the audience in as well.The last time we had such a creepy match of hunter and hunted was probably with the Morgan Freeman-Brad Pitt-Kevin Spacey discourse in "Se7en," with which this film shares some ideological ground - both involve villains acting out of motives more intriguing and morally complex than the norm, both involve the seedy side of life (though "Se7en" lacks prostitutes haraunging our hero, and "Phone Booth" lacks disorienting David Bowie tracks over inverted credits), and both feature extremely human characters - even Forest Whitaker's police captain isn't the standard gruff type, but more of a troubled soul both in his personal and private life (one of the many good touches in Cohen's script). Farrell's character may be a jerk, albeit an enviable jerk (being silver-tongued and having two fabulous babes in your life can't be all bad), but note that even with his life literally depending on what he does he can't help lying. It's frustrating, but it's hard to reject - it ends up enhancing the suspense.Cohen and Schumacher keep the tension going for the duration of the movie, with even the performers in smaller parts making you think it's all for real - but it's Kiefer Sutherland who makes the movie; it might have been just as effective with Jim Carrey in the booth, but without Sutherland I don't know. He's every bit in control here as he is as Jack Bauer on "24," and this should wipe out any bad memories of "Young Guns" once and for all.Farrell uses the gambit that he's talking to his psychiatrist at one point, and the movie does feel a bit like a therapy session open to one and all, as if we're seeing the man be stripped down to his essentials by the ultimate in primal scream theory... which in a sense it is. Admittedly there are a few plot flaws, but nothing to wreck the movie - propelled along by an edgy Harry Gregson-Williams score, and with a total lack of anything that's unimportant to the story (and all in only 81 minutes), "Phone Booth" is a tense and absorbing movie all the way to the credits; it'll probably increase the other "Dawson's Creek" graduates' collective envy of Katie Holmes's agent as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stu Shepard (Farrell) thinks he has it all: great job as publicist to the stars, a beautiful wife (Radha Mitchell) , lively lifestyle and fancy accessories. Until one fateful day with a seven foot giant. That of course, is a local phone booth. Stu uses this same phone booth in the heart of NY to call his mistress (Katie Holmes)so that his wife cannot trace the calls to her on his mobile. On a seemingly normal day, Stu heads for the booth and calls her. As he puts down the receiver and leaves the booth, the phone begins to ring. And, as human as Stu is, and as the film astutely points out, that any ringing phone will be at some point be answered. Stu answers the phone, only to be greeted by the voice of a man who is aiming a sniper rifle directly at him. This begins the longest morning in Stu's life, having to bow to the callers every demand in order to keep his, and others lives intact. Before he knows it, Stu is entangled with the caller in a game of bluffs, deceit, betrayal and the fight for survival, with nail-biting results. The film, directed by the overly criticised Joel Schumacher, is a superbly crafted, original and tense tail of peoples obsession not just with phones, but with fame and taking things for granted. With the films original and high-tech plot, Schumacher superbly collaborates close-ups, point-of-view shots and fast-moving pace to fantastic effect, and his use of the now infamous split-screen format used so effectively in "24" is also a standout joy. But this type of standout film requires a standout cast to support it, and although I have my reservations about Colin Farrell, here he proves his "Next Big Thing" status fantastically with a superb performance, which is not only charismatic and captivating, but is also poignant and powerful. Mitchell, Holmes and Forest Whitaker also add there own terrific, powerful performances, Whitaker in particular again proves his worth with a tremendous turn as the mixed-up cop trying to help and ultimately save Stu. But the film belongs to the invisible man, and that man is Jack Bauer himself, Kiefer Sutherland. His menacing, malevolent and all together nasty performance as the caller is truly outstanding, only heightened by the fact that we never see him, relying on a malicious, ill-natured tone of voice, which doesn't disappoint, being both terrifying and vicious. (Don't worry, this won't influence the producer of "24" into turning Jack Bauer to the dark side! At least I hope not!) Aside from the "24" fanatical quibbles, the film really is a treat from beginning to end, and although it does take itself slightly too seriously at times and at times seems a little far-fetched, these are only minor shortcomings. All in all, it is still a stunning film, superbly crafted, brilliantly scripted film with some super performances from the ensemble cast, "Phone Booth" well worth 81 minutes of anyone's time. Fantastic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phone Booth does for payphones what Scream did for home phones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set entirely within and around the confines of a New York City phone booth, Phone Booth is a quick paced as you're going to get. What sets this film apart from anything I've ever seen is that the audience is constantly on the same page as the main character, Stuart and much like Stuart the audience feels the chill as the caller on the other line omniously warns Stuart not to hang up.What is most effective about Phone Booth is that the audience never sees the caller on the other line which is brilliantly played by Kiefer Sutherland. As the voice of the sniper, Sutherland adds a level of intensity and angst that makes the viewer feels as if they themselves are on the phone. Colin Farrell delivers a remarkable performance as the movie's tortured hero who finds his life at a standstill the moment he picks up that phone. He goes through a transformation from an introlerable jerk to a nervous, complacent to a distraught man who is watching his worst nightmare come to life.Phone Booth works particularly because of Kiefer and Colin who are, simply put, engaging in this film, but with an original premise like the one planted here, you'll think twice about answering the phone on the corner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie while waiting for the ticket sale for The Two Towers to begin during one cold night. I knew nothing about this picture, so it was quite a surprise that this pretty short movie had such a strong and interesting story to tell. Phone Booth reminds me of Requiem For A Dream. They both have that unique visual look. The very beginning reminded me of Unbreakable. The best thing in Phone Booth is that it actually has nothing wrong. It's perfectly done, actors look and sound realistic and the set looks as real as it could really exist somewhere there in Manhattan (and actually it does, right?). The movie gives you two plot twists in the end. Just when you thought it was over... Look again. And again. Hard to believe it's the same director as in Batman &amp; Robin. Even harder is to believe, that Americans won't see this until March 2003 because of some strange serial killer who got caught. Go with the show and see this movie!9/10</fullReview>

He stepped into a role that Mel Gibson, Will Smith, Jim Carrey, and Brad Pitt all shyed away from because it was to difficult. And finally Katie Holmes is good in a movie. It almost made me forget Teaching Mrs. Tingle. Notice I said almost. If there is any justice, and baring a cavaclade of phenomenal movies this fall, Phone Booth should Garner a few Oscar nominations.

If we start with the plot, and this isn't a to heavy spoiler. Why doesn't the police just arrest the guy? I mean, yeah they think he has a gun, but they are like a million cops there. Surely they would have arrested him without a problem if they had to. This is actually the only problem to the movie. The acting is good, and the movie is well directed, and has a good morale to it. Kiether Sutherland does a great job sounding creepy and scary. I understand why i liked this as a kid, but no I see that it has some very basic plot holes. 6 out of 10 for me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly well-made movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of Joel Schumacher. He's responsible for a few films down in my "most-hated" list, including "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Batman and Robin". I approached "Phone Booth" skeptically. The idea was interesting, but I trusted Joel Schumacher to screw up again. And for the first 10 or so minutes, it seemed I was right.Joel Schumacher has an uncanny ability to play inappropriate or annoying music during the opening credits of his films. "Phone Booth" was no exception, as the song grated on my nerves.The movie rarely strays from the phone booth. Boring as it may sound, it is a pleasant surprise, just as "Speed" was a surprisingly good movie, although it mostly took place on a bus.The movie begins in the style of a boring documentary produced by Disney. I was tempted to shut it off before we even met the "last occupant of the phone booth". But the movie skyrockets as soon as we meet Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell).Stu is caught up in a web of lies, cheating on his wife (Radha Mitchell) with Pam (Katie Holmes), who is not even aware he is married. He calls Pam from a phone booth everyday (although he has a cellphone, he doesn't want his wife Kelly to see any record of his calls). On a day like any other, Stu enters the booth, removes his wedding ring, and calls Pam. After a talk with her, he gets ready to leave the booth when the phone rings. He picks it up.The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) is without a doubt the most important element of the film. Mostly invisible throughout the film, the Caller reveals to Stu that he is a sniper and will kill Stu if he leaves the booth. Sutherland's voice is bone-chilling. It is the voice of a psychotic person, yet an extremely intelligent and calculating one. The Caller's voice has to work in order for the movie to work, and boy, does it work!Just a last comment. I'm not sure if this was a glitch with the DVD or if the movie was edited this way, but I should mention a problem I had viewing the movie. Whenever a "conversation window" was on the right side of the screen, only Stu's side of the conversation was heard. (Thank God for subtitles!) This and the opening few minutes are the only things that keep me from rating the movie as a 10.So Joel Schumacher CAN make a good movie after all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth (2002, Dir. Joel Schumacher) Stu Shepard is an arrogant publicist who thinks he has the whole world in his hands. Every day he uses the same phone booth to call the woman he is cheating on his wife with. But on the last day, before this particular phone booth is demolished, the phone rings. Stu naturally answers the phone, only to find the caller on the end is an invisible sniper who knows everything on Stu, including his relationships. The caller now has Stu as his hostage, who demands he comes clean with his wife.To be honest, i was not completely fond of Joel Schumacher's work and really did not think he could produce a decent thriller. I was wrong, as he was able to produce not a decent thriller, but a fantastic thriller. Restricting the film down to a single phone booth was a wonderful concept and everyone was able to make it work. Colin Farrell was able to provide a convincing performance and the voice on the phone was just so eerie. Add to that, the wonderful Forest Whitaker and you have yourself a successful thriller which really does make you think. A word of advice though. If you haven't seen the film yet, and are unaware of what the caller looks like, then do not look at any of the advertisements of credits. The film is more fun without the prior knowledge of who plays the caller."Voodoo on you-do, motherf*****, from Big Q to Big Stu!" - Big Q (Ben Foster)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Joel Schumacher's better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film directed by Joel Schumacher is something to be wary of. He has quite an horrendous body of work behind him. In fact some film critics have labelled him as the worst director in the world. The reason I don't care much for his films is because they're only concerned with stylish sets and eye-popping visual palettes. There's almost no substance at all, and they're populated by characters we care little about.After the disastrous fiasco of Batman &amp; Robin, Schumacher was forced to turn away from the big budget extravaganzas that were his trademark. Instead he had to make films that were stripped back to their essentials. And in the case of Phone Booth, this minimalist film is actually quite a decent effort. Being a Schumacher film it has flaws, but for once, he doesn't allow his trademark theatrics to swamp the story. He relies on solid acting instead, and draws out a considerable amount of strength in the process.Phone Booth is built upon a very simple premise. A man walks into a phone box, and is contacted by an anonymous caller. This man can't leave the box because the caller has a sniper rifle aimed at him from any one of the windows surrounding the phone box.Its quite a slim idea. But wisely Phone Booth has got a very lean running time. Only 80 minutes. And its a good thing the film is so short. Because otherwise the situation would soon grow to be very tedious. The fact it doesn't shows that for once, Joel Schumacher's direction is right on the money. He keeps things brisk, accessible, and very very edgy.Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard, the arrogant NY publicist who remains trapped within the walls of the phone booth for the duration of the film.Kiefer Sutherland plays the Caller. We never find out his name. And we don't see him until the very end. But Sutherland's voice is enough to make the Caller a character in the story.A failing of Joel Schumacher is that he usually gets distracted by visual flair and gloss. But because the screenplay by Larry Cohen requires the film's surroundings to be that of a phone box on a city street, it means Schumacher has no choice but to restrain his flamboyant tendencies, and allow the strength of the acting and writing to be the hook to hang the story on.Colin Farrell is at the centre of it. And although I'm not a huge fan of the man, he turns in a nicely modulated performance. The way he goes from a slick, superficial snake to a crumbling, gibbering wreck is quite absorbing. And the way Schumacher slowly brings Stu to his knees over the course of 80 minutes is generally astute and reasonably assured.Kiefer Sutherland has a much trickier part to play. Because he's only heard, and not seen, he has to rely on the power of his voice alone to make him a threatening presence. And Sutherland has a great deal of fun in the part. Taunting Stu. Misdirecting him. Bluffing him. He gets one of his best roles in years.But despite the fact that Phone Booth is very economical and slick, if you look hard enough, the film has some glaring faults. They probably won't occur to you until after the film has wrapped, but they are there. For one, the motivations behind the Caller's actions seem slight. He claims he does this kind of thing to people who really deserve it. Which seems a tad simplistic to me. Stu is picked on generally because he's not a nice person, and because he's having an affair with one of his clients, the insipidly blank Katie Holmes.It means that Phone Booth is a little empty on the surface. And I blame that on Schumacher. A lot of the characters in his films are little more than blank surfaces. Its a testament to Farrell and Sutherland's acting that they convince you as much as they do.And the ending is something that's been ripped off from about a dozen other hostage thrillers. That's not too unexpected since Schumacher's limitations as a filmmaker means he often steals other directors ideas to compensate.Still, for any failings the film might have, Phone Booth is a largely successful endeavour. Its not quite the insightful analysis of the human condition that it likes to think it is. But it does what it sets out to do. It entertains, unnerves and occasionally shocks. Qualities not often found in Joel Schumacher's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thriller with great suspense. The whole movie will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire 81 minutes. You feel the roller-coaster emotions of the character. The film incorporates all the qualities such as suspense, thriller, comedy, sadness and any other emotion you can think of. The film does not drag at all and is very to the point and easy to follow. Its a very straight forward plot and is entertainment at its best. One of the best movies i have seen. Mulitple activities take place outside the phone booth to keep the storyline going. There is great range to the film and the director did a fantastic job with it in the end. You start with hating the main character and at the end you really feel his emotions and really feel sympathy with him which each event that takes place and actually feel sorry for him. By the end, you feel drained and he actually feel what he has been though...which is very rear in todays movies. It has a great soundtrack to go with it and the music makes you feel the ambiance and seriousness of the scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS Booth* Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is an arrogant New York Press Agent, who lies his way around everything and tries to bed one of his clients, Pam (Katie Holmes) despite being already married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell).He calls Pam every day, at the same hour, from the last phone booth left in NYC. But one day, he answers the ringing phone, and finds out that a sharpshooter (Kiefer Sutherland) wants him to repent and ask for forgiveness to all those he wronged, and will shoot him if he doesn't.After a pimp is shot to death outside the booth, Stu is trapped between two fires; the sharpshooter and the NYPD, led by Captain Ramsey (Forest Whitaker)...This is a very short film (only 77 minutes long), takes place in one place and there is no big action scene (even though the director is Joel Schumacher); you'd think it's a bore, right? Wrong. This is all about psychological tension (this idea was presented to none other than Alfred Hitchcock, who wanted to do it, but never did) and is actually helped by the setting, which gives a feel of entrapment.And you just gotta love the cinematographer; look at the shop window behind the booth, and you'll notice there are stickers on it that say 'Who Do You Think You Are?' and are shown at the beginning of the film, when Stu is rude with the pizza guy, like it was a question to him! Phone Booth: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" is an energetic, suspense-filled and intense thriller that everyone will enjoy from start to finish.Colin Farrell surrounded himself with a very talented group of actors including Forest Whitaker, Kiefer Sutherland, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes and Richard T. Jones. It was a pure delight and a was a breath of fresh air to watch these actors work together.Most of the credit must be given to the writers of "Phone Booth" because they took what could have easily been turned into an fast-paced and formulaic action picture and slowed the pace. Instead, the writers chose to create a dramatic film with the focus on character development and storyline. With strong performances and smart writing; the writers successfully turned "Phone Booth" into a clever and stylish film.Charisma and intensity are elements brought to the screen by everyone in the film. I'am not a Colin Farrell fan, but I respect the talent he brings to the role. "Phone Booth" only furthers Farrell credibility as an actor as he seized the opportunity to step out of the shadows and into the limelight to take the road to super stardom.Based upon his previous film, "American Outlaws," it didn't take long to realize the discovery of the next big movie star would be found in "Phone Booth." I was smiling when I saw Farrell on screen because it meant the writers had created a character filled with imagination and ideas that made the movie a joy to watch.Aside from Farrell, another bright spot in "Phone Booth" shined with the emergence and second breakthrough performance turned in by his co-star, Radha Mitchell. With enormous screen presence and impact turned in by Mitchell, she is an actress whose name will be called as a winner of the academy award.The bottom line is "Phone Booth" is an underrated film that will bring everyone pure satisfaction and serve as great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a sandwich with awful bread, but a damn good filling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is a classic example of a simplistically made thriller which contains an easy plot consisting of uninteresting, two dimensional settings and tight, sharp, un-nerving dialogue. The one thing that springs out in good films in this genre is the characters. Everyone who has seen a Hitchcock film knows that Hitchcock is the master of suspense and thrillers in particular.'Psycho' revolved mainly around a very plain, everyday setting (a motel) and was reasonably simple plot-wise with the dialogue that I've described. The same with 'Rear Window', this time it's an apartment block, but the un-natural traits of some of the characters, most particularly the antagonist but not forgetting Jeff's obsession and persistence also, mixed with unusual activity which is going on behind the 'closed doors' in the film is given to us and the rest of the characters through clever little clues. These are the focus of attention, this is the important stuff. Thus, it is this element of the film that is important in films like Phone Booth and it does deliver rather well.In this thriller, it's a (surprise, surprise) phone booth which is the setting for suspense. The small, tight enclosed setting for the struggling protagonist, or arguably anti-hero, works well in this film and plenty of predictable close ups and fast edits are present. Another strong point of the film is the principle of the antagonist. He's unknown, unseen and is clearly in control of the situation, in fact we're told early on that he's done this sort of thing before. He's delusional, and although he's angry at liars such as our hero, he's not afraid to lie himself now and again about rather sensitive subjects such as difficult childhoods and over one mans struggle and bad experiences in Vietnam. I quote: 'Pigs picking at napalm burnt bodies and hand grenades planted in your boots', in fact there are a number of memorable quips and quotes planted throughout. So, here we have a creepy bad guy which is superbly voiced by Sutherland. This is a tick in the 'good' column.Phone Booth suffers from other things, though, mainly through the principle of the PROtagonist (The good guy). Nobody likes a liar, especially in films and unless the genre is crime and everyone is as greasy and slippery as each other; a liar, a cheat and a full of himself PR is hardly a great list of traits to give a guy we're supposed to root for for an hour and a half. In fact, it's very difficult to sympathise with someone like this, even if his life is threatened.Another thing is the point of attack in this film, or the 'setting of the stage' which is very poor. Character introductions make up a good part of this section, as well as any past trauma our hero has suffered, but no ? not here. In fact, the opening fifteen minutes of this film is amongst the worst I've ever seen. Granted, there aren't many characters to introduce but we're given some rather disorientated scenes involving a 'p-in-p' (picture in picture) technique and the entire build up of ten minutes or so is just our hero, the good guy, mouthing off and proving to us what, to be honest, a complete jerk he is. We are shown a little of his good side when we realise he cancelled a meeting to be with the girl he likes, but that is immediately distinguished when we then realise he's using her to cheat on his wife. This isn't how you set the stage.Another problem I had with the film was the final act of the film. Some things are just best left unknown. This is what makes for a good ending, especially in the thriller genre. Some endings I can refer to are 'Reservoir Dogs', and 'Saw'; two films set pretty much in the same place for the duration of the film if you exclude the flash backs, and two films that have endings which although are worked out after time as to what EXACTLY happened, can still leave that question mark feeling over your head when you watch them now and again. This is how a film like Phone Booth should have ended.I'm not analysing the conclusion too much due to risk of a spoiler warning but I will tell you it's weak. The concluding camera shot and SFX merely suggests the film has some sort of 'loop' to it but this is something I've only really seen 'Twelve Monkeys' do with some real effect in the last ten years or so, and as a result ? it doesn't work well here.Phone Booth isn't a bad film; it's just let down by a number of things that could have been avoided with better writing. The first fifteen and last fifteen are terrible but the actual battles that happen within the film between Farrell and Sutherland are pretty good. It mixes suspense, good dialogue and reasonably tense situations nicely to create a nice little pressure cooker.Don't worry about the direction or the camera work in this film but the editing and split screen effect does drag on.I'm sure that if Hitchcock was still alive, I doubt he'd be using that effect in his films and look at how well he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vaguely entertaining, but ultimately a waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say one thing for this film: it holds your attention. Unfortunately, I found myself regretting that by the time it was over, as the plot line is so stupid, pointless, and utterly implausible that I would really rather have got bored and switched it off early. Most action films require a certain amount of suspension of reason. That's not the problem. The problem is that there is virtually nothing believable in the entire film - from start to finish. The premise is flawed from the outset, and descends into the realms of absurdity from the moment Stu answers the phone. If the sniper had been Godzilla it wouldn't have been any more believable. It exceeded my "oh come ON" quota several times over.Furthermore, not since "Flatliners" have I seen a film dress up a facile moral message - in this case, basically the Golden Rule - in such ludicrous clothing. I felt afterwards as though I had sat through a(n extraordinarily convoluted) sermon.If you're bored at home and this is on the telly, there's no reason not to put it on. But I wouldn't go out of my way or spend a penny on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest thrillers ever made: Farrell's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone BoothI don't care much for superlatives, but this is one of the best thrillers ever made, if not "the" best.The simple plot of a man held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper seems a bit dry in retrospect, but the duo of Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland dazzle the screen with a fiery electricity that burns throughout the film.Director Joel Schumacher uses bits of flashy camera-work here and there, but in no way does the film try to rely on it. No, the film is fully supported by the engaging dialogue and Oscar-worthy acting. Colin Farrell graces the screen with his finest performance, nearly bringing tears to me at one point. His performance is the best of the film, his career, and in my opinion, of the last several years.Still, Sutherland works wonders in his seemingly limited role. He doesn't in any way get tied down by not being seen. In fact, it's as though he took the quality from his acting and added it to his dialogue to make some sort of super-hybrid voice. Listening to him is mesmerizing, and Sutherland and Farrell play off each other so extremely well.Forest Whitaker also provides a solid performance, one of his best. Still, the bulk of the kudos go to Sutherland and (mostly) Farrell; again, this is easily Farrell's best performance, and he gives any other actor in any other movie ever made a run for their money.If you are a Sutherland fan, a Farrell fan, a thriller fan, I strongly encourage you to see this movie. If you are not.... I still strongly encourage you to see this movie. Be ready for some profanity, but also be ready for a thriller that puts all others to shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about phone booth , I was doubtful that it be worth the time of day . " A thriller about a man stuck in a phone booth from the director of batman and robin ?" I thought " that sounds stupid !" Thankfully though I thought wrong ! Phone booth is wicked !It definitely deserved to be a much bigger box office hit than it was .Phone booth is a chilling , edge of your seat thriller that wrings every ounce of tension from its ambitious concept of a guy under siege in a phone booth from an unseen menace. The performances are all excellent , and the script is inventive and smart.The best thing about this masterful thriller though is the unseen sniper who terrorises stu from the other end of the phone line . Sadistic , sarcastic , and down right creepy , he is up there with best movie villains .Phone booth is a film that deserves classic status and must be seen ! Don't be surprised if you develop a fear of payphones after viewing it though.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Conceit That Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man and his relation to a tight space, when caught in an unexplained situation, is the theme of Joel Schumacher's film PHONE BOOTH written by Larry Cohen who would reverse the scene for CELLULAR. A gimmick which could have buckled under its own weight, this short movie takes off like a rocket and for 80 solid minutes proceeds to tell its remarkable, tense story.Telephone booths have been interesting spaces to use as plot devices. In THE BIRDS, Hitchcock enclosed Tippi Hedren in a very British phone booth as a mass of seagulls engulf Bodega Bay and all but dive bomb through. In ROSEMARY'S BABY, Rosemary Woodhouse was seeing her world crack right before her eyes as she awaited a fateful call inside a booth. However, these were individual scenes -- never an entire suspense thriller. PHONE BOOTH begins and ends its story in one. Stu Sheppard (Colin Farrell), not a very nice guy, learns what it is not to have control as he picks up a ringing phone (an action many New Yorkers do as if this were an everyday occurrence) and encounters a voice on the other side.This voice (Kiefer Sutherland) orders him not to hang up or he will kill him. It's that simple. And the point is taken when the unseen owner of the voice shoots a pedestrian inches from where Stu stands, ensuing a progressive chaos on the streets and a battle of wills as both parties try to survive this deadly game of cat and mouse. No plausible reason as to why this man is doing this is given. It just is.Much like the similar CELLULAR the plot in PHONE BOOTH is a gimmick and one that requires a prompt presentation, execution, and conclusion. Schumacher, a director with no autonomous style, is great at building tension and bringing events to an explosive head, and while the final sequence rings a little false, for the most, this is a solid, airtight plot that manages to kick ass. Forest Whittaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes also co-star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. The story is wonderful and the acting is not bad either. Kiefer Sutherland played an excellent role as "The Caller" and Collin Farrell was also very good. The suspense is excellent and the ending is pretty good too.It was obviously well thought out and planned. I liked the suspense which kept me watching throughout the whole movie. The cast fit perfectly and I didn't see anything wrong really except for the large amount of swear words used, but that isn't anything too major.I highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it. It may be old but it is still good. Find out what real suspense is... in the phone booth.10/10 - Well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch phone booth for the first time, you think wow! That was such an good movie. Only took up 80 minutes of my time, was thoroughly enjoyable and kept me glued to the screen. Tense, suspenseful and so unique and all this made in about 10 days - that is something. Good director, good cast, esp. Colin Farrell who I hadn't seen in any other films before this and has made a name for himself. Also the script is good. One bad thing, which isn't really a bad thing but 2nd time watching it is a little boring. Its such an awesome film. Fantastic. So if you have not noticed it yet - hurry up and buy the DVD. This is a film you need to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phone Booth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was told by a few people that this was good, and I saw maybe a few clips of it, so I was certainly not going to miss the opportunity, from director Joel Shumacher (Falling Down, Batman Forever). Basically New York publicist Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is fast talking and wise cracking, but he is also dishonest because he is married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell) but having an affair with girlfriend Pamela 'Pam' McFadden (Katie Holmes). Every time he wants to speak to Pam he does it in the same street phone booth, as his wife checks his calls, and it is from this same phone booth that he innocently answers from an anonymous Caller (Kiefer Sutherland). Stu is told by this voice he knows everything about him, his business and obviously the lies he has been telling to his wife, but also he is also watching him. But then the danger really kicks in when he says that he will kill him if he hangs up the phone and leaves the booth, he is watching him through the telescopic sight of a rifle. When a man outside the booth demanding him to get out is killed by the psychopath shooting him, Stu is obviously mistaken for the shooter and the police led by Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) soon show up. As time passes Stu tries anything he can while staying on the phone to get help, prove his innocence, and when both Kelly and Pam show up at the scene. The Caller wants him to confess all his lies to Kelly, and obviously point out Pam to her, and while he stays on the phone Ramey, the rest of the cops and technicians are trying to find out what is going on. Stu is forced into doing what he says, but he is shocked then however to see that he has a weapon in the booth in the above light panel, so he is trapped there and could be caught even more guilty looking. After finally coming out with the truth to his wife and the girlfriend Ramey and the police may have found the location of the Caller, Stu comes out demanding he shoots him is desperation to end it, instead the cops shoot him to end it, but the final moment sees the Caller himself say that he must stay loyal, or he'll call again! Also starring Paula Jai Parker as Felicia, Arian Waring Ash as Corky, Tia Texada as Asia, John Enos III as Leon, Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Cole and James MacDonald as Negotiator. Farrell is good as the man tortured with words and trapped on the phone, Whitaker does well as the Captain trying to help the situation, and of course Sutherland with his gravely voice is fantastic as the malevolent Caller, it really grips you with all the words and the tiny twists and tense set pieces, a very worthwhile thriller. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Sleazy Publicist by the name of Stu Shepart (Colin Farrell), who decide to pick up a ringing phone from a New York City Booth, after he calls his girlfriend/mistress (Katie Holmes). Once he picked up the ringing phone. Stu is talking to a mysterious deranged and intelligent man (Voiced by Kiefer Sutherland). Then Stu finds himself on the deadly end of a High-Powered Rifle Scope. Now Stu must outwit a Psychotic Pniper before He's out from the Phone Booth to Freedom.Directed by Joel Schumacher (8MM, Falling Down, Tigerland) made a clever, suspenseful, taut dark comedy/thriller. Farrell gives a dynamic performance and a chilling voice work by Sutherland. This film was shot only in 12 Days in December of 2000 and The film was release in April, 2003. It was probably the best way to shot the film to keep the mood realistic.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director and the original theatrical trailer. Do not miss this unique psychological thriller. Written by Larry Cohen (It's Alive Trilogy, Guilty as Sin, Q:The Winged Serpent). Terrific Cinematography by Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream). Best seen in Widescreen. Panavision.

		<shortDescription>A movie that proves that a good story makes a movie not the locations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth: This is one of those rare movies that proves you don't need a ton of locations to make a good movie. This movie has one main location which sounds like it would be boring except the exceptional camera and acting keep from this. Stuart Shepard play by Colin Farrell is the guy pinned down in the phone booth by a sniper play by Kiefer Sutherland. Without giving anything away to those who have not seen it is gets more intense from there. I think the fact that this movie only had one main location added to the intensity of the movie which moved along quite nicely. Some have told me they thought it was slow in pace but I thought it move along quite well. Now it is not one of my top movies,but it is one that I would watch again after it had been awhile. I think the movie is one that shows you don't need anything more than good acting and decent story to make a good movie.Which is why I liked it. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different than your normal thriller. The reason I gave it an eight is that it does not have rewacth ability which is typical of these kind of movies. The suspense factor is in the not knowing what is going to happen next which fades when seen a ton of times. These are not the kind of movies I would buy unless it was something above and beyond or super cheap like on VHS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the Wesley Snipes movie with the same premesis didn't do it for you, this one will. Something about this type of story makes you want to scream, since (WARNING: SPOILER) the bad guy doesn't get his due. You REALLY want to see the bad guy (Keifer Sutherland) get his due after this crazy stunt this guy pulls. If a guy wants to cheat on his wife, let him...hehe. Let the woman find out herself and cause some trouble!!! If you want to see a movie where a bad guy you really learn to hate (in the movie of course...heh) gets his due go see Stalag 17 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046359/)...great movie from 1952...one of my favorites.But yeah, the Wesley Snipes movie called Liberty Stands Still was the first to do the "guy-makes-person-his-pawn-with-a-sniper-rifle" theme. Sure, they were both in 2002, but the Wesley Snipes movie was first.Both movies are exactly the same. Some person has some kind of "issue" that this crazy guy with a sniper wishes to make this person admit to on TV and such. And while holding this person in the sniper's scope, the person is unable to do anything that would attract the attention of anyone, namely the law enforcement. And of course in the process there are innocent bystanders who are killed, as they interfere with the person talking to the sniper.The nice thing about these kinds of movies is that its all shot in one place and the number of actors/actresses are minimal. So there is little chance that viewers will get lost in the movie...and its not that hard to jump into the movie half-way through. And, if you have to take a bathroom break while you are watching there is really no need to hit the pause button...hehe.I'm not a big fan of these movies where someone is playing a game with some other person...well then again, the movie The Game with Michael Douglas was a game, but the idea of pulling a game of life that was so serious yet fake made the movie fun and interesting. But these movies, I just don't like the fact that (WARNING: SPOILER) the bad guy doesn't get his due. At least in The Game, they make it seem like the bad guy gets his due when Michael Douglas starts to realize its just a game and he decides to do something about it...There is no replay value with Phone Booth or Liberty Stands Still. Once is enough for me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film not knowing what to expect. What started out as movie watched on a whim turned out to be one of the most rewarding film experiences I can recall.Many viewers of this film would say that it's a great thriller. I agree, but I think it's more than just that. It's a story about reconciliation, realization, and change. It's a theatrical metaphor for the changes people go through in life.Colin Farrell plays the role of Stu Shepard, a cocky and rather dishonest Manhattan publicist who finds himself in the struggle of a lifetime. While making a routine phone call from one of the city's last remaining phone booths, Stu receives a phone call from a sniper who claims to have Stu in his crosshairs. The sniper has only one demand: for Stu to come clean about his corrupt way of life.What ensues is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that you won't forget. But it's not the thriller aspect of this film that you'll remember. It's the symbolism of the phone booth that will remain in your memory. The phone booth represents the time in one's life when a person has to choose to carry on the path of right or wrong. It symbolizes Stu's re-birth as a new man.I would recommend this film not just to those who are in the mood for a great thriller, but also to those who have experienced great change in their lives. This story fully encompasses the journey of human experience.Watch this movie with an open mind. Try to see the story from the allegorical point-of-view. You won't forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When he's not busy destroying the Batman franchise, Joel Schumacher is capable of making moderately entertaining films. This one about a New York publicist trapped in a phone booth by an unknown sniper depends on how much you like Colin Farrell as an actor for how much millage you can take from it. I, myself enjoy Collin's work so I enjoyed this film. Not tremendously enjoyed, but enjoyed all the same. I found it to be taunt and a bit suspenseful thanks in no small part to Larry Cohen's writing. That guy hugely under-rated.

		<fullReview>I had thought about renting this movie for some time but never got around doing it until now. As some of you may know, Colin Ferrell is scheduled to play no other than Detective James "Sonny" Crockett in an upcoming big-screen adaption of the 80s cult TV show "Miami Vice"-- potential sacrilegy for die-hard "vice" fans like me who would be more than happy to see Don Johnson take up his old role again. So my objective here was to see whether Colin Ferrell is "worthy" at all to begin with - but I got lots more than I had bargained for :-))**spoilers** At a first glance, the premise of this film may not look like something you can wrap a good thrilling story around - Stu Shepard (Colin Ferrell), a young, slick, self-absorbed, narcissistic, uppity (insert similar pejorative expressions here) PR agent answers a coincidental phone call in a phone booth, only to find out that there's a sniper on the other end who is pointing his rifle at him from one of the countless windows on 53rd street in NYC. The sniper threatens to kill him if he doesn't do exactly as he says.But from then on, the movie evolves into an an all-out, edge-of-your-seat, mind-blowing thriller. It turns out the sniper has been watching him for some time. Stu uses the same (bugged) phone booth every day to call his "make-out interest" so his endearing, unsuspecting wife won't find out through his cell phone bills that he is cheating on her. Stu suddenly has to realize that the sniper is for real when he shoots and kills one of the disgruntled bystanders who want to use the phone. Police rush to the scene because everybody thinks Stu did it. The whole thing turns into a real spectacular when news people and bystanders (as well as Stu's wife and his "girlfriend") gather around, and the sniper really gets into the game of pushing Stu's buttons and having his way with him, the whole time threatening to kill him if he doesn't obey him (in Germany, this movie is aptly titled "Don't hang up" for this).The film really is somewhat innovative in its own right: An entire movie shot from the inside and outside of a downtown telephone booth, creating an air of fear, paranoia and suspense that will keep you glued to your seat until the final minute (and you'll be rewarded with quite a twist at the very end, which really puts the film right up there with some of Hollywood's all-time thriller masterpieces!! If Hitchcock wasn't dead, I'd seriously wonder if he masterminded this movie!).Much more can be said about the many different aspects of this film (such as the morality play of Stu being forced by the sniper to spill his own sinful guts in front of his two women and rolling cameras)... but that is for you to find out as you go and rent/buy "Phone Booth" - you'll definitely enjoy it! And if you're anything like me, you may even feel a bit uneasy the next time you use a phone booth ;-)As for Colin Ferrell, now that I've been able to witness his way-above-average acting talent, I'm comfortable knowing that he'll be chasing bad guys through Miami next summer! My vote: 9 out of 10 phone booths</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Phone Booth was an excellent movie. I just viewed it last night and thought the whole idea was just great. I thought at first that I would be disappointed and bored with the concept of a man stuck in a phone booth talking to a psycho. But with the cinematography, the details, and the great acting, it kept me in awe of the entire spectrum. This movie left you thinking about the little things you do and how you might consider it just part of life that everybody does, but how others see our actions differently than us. Keifer Sutherland is so talented to keep you so enthralled with his character when all you can experience is his voice. Collin Farrell did a great job with his character Stu there was so much emotion and passion in his performance. I truly recommend this movie to anyone who can sit down through five minutes of something without satirical comedy, something blowing up, or so much CGI that you wonder if they even use sets in Hollywood anymore. I think in a time when everything is shock value and special effects, Phone Booth was a breath of fresh air. It reminds us that there are some people out there who still act for a living, and they do it with such an air of dignity. I hope everyone takes 2 hours out of their busy, putting on heirs and keeping up with the Jonses life, to truly admire and respect what this movie does in its simplicity of telling the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth is kind of like a one joke film... or a one idea film if you like. A self-obsessed, adulterous PR man becomes the target of a killer in a New York phone booth.Phone Booth seems to owe a lot to the TV show "24" with all of its various camera angles and its cast (see Kiefer Sutherland) - but I don't necessarily think that is a good idea given the dodgy-ness of that show.It is essentially a one idea film (sort of like Panic Room) but where Panic Room delivers unexpected thrills and excitement all the way to its conclusion... Phone Booth doesn't. To me - Phone Booth keeps with the same idea throughout the movie and it doesn't really go into new territory. The killer keeps making the same threats and towards the end - it gets fairly predictable.The killer's moralistic motives are somewhat questionable - this is such an elaborate way of killing someone - why all the trouble if it is just someone who cheats on his wife?!Anyhow - this movie tends to drag in places and it doesn't deviate heavily from the basic premise. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth has some interesting ideas, unfortunately they only last about half of the film's very short runtime. Having Farrell being stuck in a phone booth under the watching eye of a crazy sniper works surprisingly well - up to a point.As the movie progresses, it fills up on more and more clichs and plot holes (how many times does the sniper reload his rifle without actually firing it?). Towards the end there is a scene that feels like it could have been lifted from an episode of South Park.I can't complain on Farrell's acting (although his character is really to nice for the film to work properly), but all the other characters are just there to watch and utter some pretty stupid lines. The use of split screen images serves no real purpose, and are only distracting. I guess that they felt compelled to add something that would give it an "edge". Also, Sutherland's voice over doesn't sound like he's on the phone at all - perhaps necessary for the quality of the sound, but still a bit odd.What could have been a pretty good film (too) quickly runs out of steam and limps over the finishing line. (On a side note, the producers of Joy Ride/Roadkill can at least take pleasure in knowing that the guy who wrote the script for Phone Booth have seen their film and liked it.) [4/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since when do snipers enforce morality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****MINOR SPOILERS****This movie is about a sleezeball public rep to the stars and how a sniper decides to teach him a lesson in values. Farrell is an incredibly slimy deal-making leech. The movie opens with him strolling down the street with his assistant in tow. He pumps the public image of his clients in order to make it appear that he is doing a favour to venues when they decide to host his clients. I have no sympathy for him. The rep enters a phone booth to make a call to his mistress. He only calls her from this specific phone booth because he doesn't want a paper trail. I have less sympathy for him. What we have is a MAJOR break in logic. Mr. sniper-man decides that he must teach Mr. Sleezeball a lesson about fidelity while having no qualms whatsoever in shooting completely innocent bystanders. WTF!? I have several gripes about this flick but I'll stick to one more at this time: A handgun fired at the chest of an individual will not leave a similar wound as a high-powered sniper rifle fired at the back of an individual! I found the movie excruciating. I felt no empathy for Farrell, no desire to see him win, and no eagerness to have the sniper defeated. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw a preview for this movie on TV. My sister, in the room at the time, said the plot looked ridiculous. I thought of the hero-villain interaction in Speed that, in my opinion, really made that movie great, and wondered.Both of us found what we were expecting.My sister saw a segment of it and disliked it -- she didn't like watching something like that happen to a person, she said; and of course, she still thought the plot was ridiculous. I watched the whole thing. Many times. In fact, I taped it (an honor rarely accorded). I got exactly what I was hoping for.Farrell's acting in this was exceptionally good. He has a way of presenting a reaction so authentic that it is startling to watch. ****SPOILERS An example of this is when he first sees the gun near the light in the booth, he has this moment of surreal terror that was so effective, it gave me and my brother chills. And the way in his climactic scene he goes for broke, and you can hear the pain when his voice cracks and he tries not to start sobbing. Also, when he reaches for the gun the first time, he has an expression of please-don't-let-what-I-think-is-gonna-happen-happen that increases the audience' sympathy almost suddenly. END SPOILERS**** Sutherland's performance reminded me of Anthony Hopkins' in Silence of the Lambs... smooth, and evil. Even Whitaker gives us a realistic police chief, even with those irrelevant, unnecessary and really quite irritating lines about his marital difficulties.But what a film that takes place entirely in a phone booth boils down to is dialogue. This was a good script -- as I mentioned before, the most interesting part of any action movie is the hero/ villain interaction (tragic, considering that most movies now are reduced to horrible pre-fight cliches). This movie took on not only themes of morality and sin, but also had an interesting subtext with isolation in such a connected/ wired society. of course, I pondered the "issues" on my third and fourth viewing -- the first and second were all about the conversation itself, not the meaning. the first time there's suspense, but even after that there is the joy of Sutherland's lines, the way the Caller toys with Stu... there is a streak of wicked humor, and Stu's clever (increasingly desperate) attempts to worm his way out. "I know just the spin to put on this!" he says of publicity he has frantically offered his captor; the Caller replies drily "How your terror inspires your creativity?"9/10, demerits for the sub-plot involving Ramey and the extraneous attempt at irony with a negotiator with a grating personality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers* I've kinda started to get quite fed up with movies where the bad guy knows everything about his victim - just to create some thrill in the movie. There is no originality to it that the bad guy just knows all stuff! In silence of the lambs the bad guy is a skilled psychiatrist who arrives at his detailed conclusions in a rather logical manner - he doesn't just know everything. In Phone booth the bad guy has "followed" the victim and gotten to know him through time... well, it's plausible but really irritatingly tiring that that has to be the method of the day to create some excitement. Sadly there are so many other movies where that kinda trick is used, like in an otherwise very good movie like Insomnia - there too is a plausible explanation, but its the same cheap trick! In phone booth tho all that is kinda pushed to the limit. The bad guy is so godlike that he has forseen every little thing... but since that is unrealistic (if for one would have chosen the next possible moment whenever the door was open to run like an idiot into the next building - show over and it'd become a short movie!) the victim has to clearly follow the movie script in order to keep within the limits of what the bad guy could forsee - and that shows! SAD thing.You don't need a new and modern movie to get a similar feeling from a movie. Just watch the classic called "Rear window". It's about a billion times better, more thrilling, more hair-raising and will definatly make you chew your nails down to the bone!Phone booth: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Thriller You'll Ever See!! (Spoiler Alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has to be the best thriller(not horror) movie ever!!! Colin Farrell is in one of his best performances ever. The performance of Kiefer Strutherland as the caller was a great. His voice gave the movie more suspense, such as when Stu(Farrell) had to choose among he wanted to die: his wife, his friend Pam, or himself. Strutherland's creepy voice gave the scene more suspense by sounding he could shoot at anytime. That's the beauty of suspense/thriller movie: you'll never know what will happen next.As I said, this is the best thriller movie ever. Colin Farrell was perfect for his role, because any other actor would just be horrible. Farrell's lines would only sound perfect for him. Like, when the pizza guy tries to sell Farrell a pizza, when the hookers try to get Farrell out of the booth, and when the caller shoots Leon(the guy who tries to rip Farrell out of the booth), Farrell says his lines perfectly. Any other actor would say it pretty badly.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was quite a intriguing premise, really. A man answers a ringing phone in a booth in which he's just made a call. A man's voice promises that if he hangs up or leaves the booth, he'll be shot dead.If you were that man, would you have the nerve to hang up?What if you further found out what the potential killer wanted, and it wasn't money or anything on your person? What if he wanted you to apologize for something?Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a hotshot New York publicist who systematically walks over everyone he meets and lies to those who can help him. He's been carrying on an affair with a struggling actress named Pam (Katie Holmes, looking cute as a button as always) while married to Kelly (Radha Mitchell). In fact, he's just gotten off the phone with Pam when the phone rings ominously. "A ringing phone must be answered," we're told as the movie opens, although I'm not so certain that's true. I myself feel no strong urge to answer a ringing pay phone, as it's generally not for me.But Stu does answer it, and the voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland) has him in his trap. Hang up, you die. But it's not long before other people are involved - otherwise, it'd be a quick or at least awfully dull movie - and sure enough a group of prostitutes wants to use the phone. Only Stu can't hang up, so they get their pimp Leon to take care of things. Leon smashes in the side of the booth, and the killer - provoked according to his own code of what is bad and what is not - shoots him down from above, although we never know quite where.And that's what really gets things going. Soon the prosties are getting the cops, and there's a big standoff, with Stu still clinging to the phone, refusing to give it up. Of course, the killer is telling him what to say to the cops, warning him that if he doesn't comply, Stu will be killed. In the interests of self-preservation, Stu does comply.Interestingly enough, the killer's complaints about Stu center around his perceived selfishness, his look-out-for-number-one attitude. And yet it's that very attitude that keeps Stu alive. If he were the Good Boy that the killer wishes he were (he wants Stu to atone for his past transgressions, such as lying to his wife), then Stu would have been dead. Life's funny sometimes, ain't it?Of course, the police have no idea there's a killer on the other end of the phone. They're operating under the assumption that Stu killed the pimp, and that he's armed. In most movies where there's a police standoff, the cops might act a little differently, choosing instead to rush the phone booth. But the cop contingent is led here by Captain Ramey, played by an earnest Forest Whitaker. Whitaker is always a treat to watch, with his hangdog eyes and self-serious expression. He's easily the best part of this otherwise tepid film (much as he was in last year's Panic Room). Ramey instead chooses to talk Stu down, to discern what the actual threat is. His character is thoughtful but tough, choosing to place himself in danger .The movie runs only 81 minutes, but it's still too long and probably would have been better served as an episode of an anthology series, like the old Twilight Zone or Outer Limits series. It's interesting to see the character development of Stu Shepard, but in the end the viewer still doesn't care too much about him.</fullReview>

In my opinion, and you know what they say about opinions, this movie was a rip off. It marketed Colin Farrell as some type of action figure, a role he plays well, but instead delivers a low budget, poorly written, well acted, piece of garbage obviously designed to lure in the public with sexy advertising and then give them nothing in return for their time and money. I would imagine the 7.5 rating comes from people who might feel that there was some hidden message in this movie that went deeper then an obvious bait and switch piece of trash but let me assure you, this was no 12 Angry Men.</fullReview>

All in all it was a disappointment - I never really felt that Stu was in any kind of mortal danger and it really felt like it dragged - quite an achievement for a film only running circa 80 minutes. And just what the hell had Stu done that was so wrong?? He'd lied to a few people in the course of his job and he wanted to sleep with another woman (not just any old woman either - Katie Holmes for Gods sake) - bow down sinners for we are all going to hell!!!</fullReview>

You know you're in trouble with the tacky opening--for some reason, it starts in "outer space." Whatever. Colin Farrell works himself into a lather over 81 minutes and not much else. The script is completely inane--and knows it too. It's very defensive--almost as if it knows how stupid it is and is trying to beat it's critics to the punch. Poor Forrest Whitaker--he must not have thought this would ever see a theatrical release. Farrell is as slickly impersonal as ever--the rest of the cast, particularly Radha Mitchell, is just wasted. It's about a moralising sniper, for heaven's sake! I didn't have the stomach for it. About 80 minutes too long.</fullReview>

Who cares what happens to this pissy schmuck? How could anyone be interested?Another characteristic of suspense movies is that a lot depends on the end. It should be clever and meaningful in some way; it should make you utter the Ohhhhh! of realization, and get you thinking back on the various plot twists and understanding them in a new light, now that you know more than you knew before the end. (What follows is a spoiler, maybe, but how can you spoil what's already rotten?) The end of this movie reveals nothing.

A smooth, scary voice (Keifer Sutherland) on the other end informs him he has a gun trained on him and he will be killed if he hangs up.This is a great premise--for a 60 minute movie. Unfortunately this runs on for 80 minutes. It drags ocassionally and has a really bad ending. But it's well-directed with great use of split screens, Farrell is fantastic (as always), Sutherland's voice is just perfect and it does have some very intense, frightening moments--as well as some funny ones too.No masterpiece but worth catching for Farrell and Sutherland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PHONE BOOTH (2003) **1/2 Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, Katie Holmes, Richard T. Jones. Farrell gives it his all as a slick entertainment public relations agent who winds up the pawn of a demented serial killer (an oily and affective voice over by Sutherland) when he's subjected to being his next victim while being confined to the last public phone booth in New York City unless he does everything that's been requested including his confessions of his less than pure thoughts and actions resulting in either his death or his public humiliation. A one trick gimmick of having a character stuck in one setting proves to be the main problem of an otherwise intriguing premise cooked up by ?70s schlockmeister Larry Cohen (who wrote the script) and flashy direction by Joel Schumacher echoing his own `Falling Down' and dare say `Dog Day Afternoon'. My biggest gripe is the film was shot in LA outside of the opening on location set up in Times Square which gives the whole feel of the film screaming `fake' and ultimately the crazed gun man's lack of a reason to target Farrell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***** couple of spoilers below ****The idea for the movie is great, but what a stinker. I am the first one to lose myself in a movie, let reality leave me and accept plot lines that make no sense or scenes that just would never happen. In real life this scenerio of Colin in the phone booth would have been over 5 minutes after the NYC cops showed up. I mean, he is surrounded by cops all within 30 feet of him. His hands are obvioulsy free and not holding a gun. There are riot police with the steel sheilds - how fast could they just storm the booth and tackle him, even if he did have a gun in his pocket. That is just one of dozens of examples of this nonsense movie. That red dot from the lazer on the gun - come on, did you see how ig and bright that was. It was so fake. No matter where it shined, nothing got in it's way, it was so badly done. Then when they realize there is a sniper somewhere, what do they do? Nothing, they leave all the citizens on the street, all the cops stand around... Come on, they would have cleared the street in a second. They made some excuse in the movie about why they wouldn't clear the street, but it made no sense. And his dopey wife - 1 second she is in the cop car, then she gets out, then she goes in, then she gets out... And the Keifer voice over... How come all the other people he spoke to on the phone sounded like they were on the phone (sort of), but Keifer's voices boomed over everything like a god.This movie is beyond words, it was horrible. Colin was fine, but the plot line sucked. They must have spent about 2 million total on the dump of a movie and we got suckered into seeing it. No kidding, the movie theater I was in just started laughing at everything 1/2 way through the movie and then all booed at the credits. Save your money, don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Phone Booth' is a film about a man who calls to answer a phone ringing in a phone booth, and he is warned that if he leaves the phone booth, he will be killed. The film follows his anxiety of being trapped in this booth and the different things that he does to try to get out. The action of the film literally takes place on the street and around the phone booth where a crowd has gathered. It is everyone's worst nightmare. It's a clever idea, but I do not think it works as a film. The action and events were a clich, and it was easy to predict what was going to happen. Sometimes, the events were funny when they should have been serious. (They were funny because of the outrageousness of the situation.) Unless you like action thrillers a lot, I would not bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those of you who were unfortunate enough to see 'Hard Cash' (has Val Kilmer really fallen so far?) know that I'm not saying much for Phone Booth by comparison. I was unfortunate enough to catch this at a friend's house after a BBQ. The only thing that saved my viewing from being an utter disaster was that I had already heard from another buddy of mine that it was such a terrible movie. Keeping that in mind, it was fairly entertaining to watch among friends over a few burgers. I am somewhat surprised to see that the user rating for this movie is so high... of the 9 or 10 people that I watched this with(and discussed our collective disappointment with afterwards), I don't think anyone there would have rated it over a 3 or 4. The back story was nil (of Kiefer's character, in particular); the delivery of about 90% of the dialogue seemed like it had come from the first reading of a high school play, where most of the actors were there only because they had to be to get their fine arts credit; the trim 75 minutes or so (thank goodness it wasn't any longer) seemed like 2 1/2 hours...and the ending was a total let down. Any hint of suspense was quickly dissolved by the total lack of caring for any of the characters (I found myself hoping many of them would get picked off by Kiefer's character, just to shut them up--or to at least make the story more interesting). At any rate, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone; you'd be better off watching most anything else (except, maybe, for Hard Cash)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" was not worth the rental fee. I was hoping to like this film due to the good reviews that friends had given it and the presence of Colin Farrell, whom I like as an actor. I was very disappointed.I was confused by the beginning because it was all Colin Farrell talking on a cell phone about deals with magazines. It was not fast paced and very slow. It also looked like it had been filmed on poor quality film. I got used to the look but, cringed as the story just went nowhere.It was 81 minutes of Colin Farrell in a phone booth...and even he cannot make that interesting. I found myself fighting the urge to get up and walk away to do something else. It was a movie that made me want to walk away and not bother with the rest of the story.I never felt the sense of unease or suspense in his character's situation since only one person was killed with the sniper gun. Really, it took away from the urgency of the phone call and Farrell not hanging up to not have more danger. Yes, the sniper killed someone and caused Farrell some pain by shooting his earlobe...but I never worried about the situation or got caught up in it.It was also very "anti-climax", or as my brother told me, "The ending is a cop out". It just ends...nothing is really resolved except that Farrell is gotten out of the situation and then threatened by caller for the future. It left me thinking, "That's it????". I was so disgusted that I turned the movie back into the video store so I wouldn't forget about it and have to pay overdue charges on such a terrible movie. I say pass on this one, save your money, and rent something else. I have to give it a 1/10.</fullReview>

As a TV play or stage show it might work, but as a movie it really doesn't. Interestingly, the same year saw the release of Liberty Stands Still starring Linda Fiorentino. Watch them both and it's impossible to conclude anything other than that one is a straight rip-off of the other. I don't know which came first, but I know which is the better film, and it isn't this one! Don't get me wrong - there are some good performances here. But there's no plot, no back-ground information, no beautiful photography or lighting, no inspired directing, no thrilling stunts, no endearing love story, no sharp human observation ... etc etc. Whatever makes a good movie, I don't see any of it here. This is pure exploitation of the cinema-going public, a shameless, cynical exercise in money-making. Quite disgraceful really.</fullReview>

But gut wrenching as in if you were lactose intolerant but just had a big, cold glass of milk. This has to be his best comedy ever.I have to admit, I found myself hoping that Keifer's character would just shoot everyone on that street and put the audience of it's misery. The most memorable character was the cop that shot Colin "what's his name" in the gut with the beanbag. He was cool! Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you care to learn not how to shoot a movie. And oh yeah, don't even get me started on the narrator that seemed to have disappeared by the end of the film.If you really want a good crime drama, follow the producers of this film... they took the studios for quite a chunk of change.</fullReview>

Keifer Sutherland could have spared us the agony and shot Colin Farell 15 minutes into the movie.Wait... I take it back... this is not among the worst films I've ever watched.

		<fullReview>"Phone Booth" - an excellent, suspenseful, scary 2002 film was made in ten days, basically in a phone booth on a New York City street, and the results are amazing. The film had no luck but because of its quality, wound up being very successful. It was held for release the first time because the powers that be wanted Colin Farrell to become well known. When that happened, it was held up again because of the sniper that ran rampant in Washington, D.C. Finally, "Phone Booth" saw the light of day.Colin Farrell has a tour de force as Stu Shepard, a fast-talking, low-level, wheeler-dealer publicist who walks the streets of New York talking on his cell phone and fielding other calls with the help of an apprentice publicist who follows him around. Because Shepard is married and his wife sees his cell phone bills, he steps into a an 8th Avenue phone booth to call a young woman (Katie Holmes) he's attempting to seduce. At this point, he gets a call from a sniper, "Bob" (the voice of Kiefer Sutherland) in a nearby building, and the man has a gun pointed right at him. Shepard can see the laser beam right over his heart. "Bob" apparently been responsible for several street shootings recently. When prostitutes harass Shepard so they can use the phone, their john comes over, and the sniper shoots him. It's assumed Shephard killed him, and the police are called.Farrell does a terrific job as a man who gradually realizes how bad his situation is and is forced by the sniper to do and say what he's told to do and say - and it's not always comfortable, particularly when his wife (Radha Mitchell) and almost girlfriend show up. Forest Whitaker is very effective as the captain trying to figure out what's going on."Phone Booth" was written by Larry Cohen, who after 38 years, is still grinding out excellent product. The company I worked for many years ago used to type his scripts, and I had the privilege of meeting him once in his beautiful New York City home. After writing multiple TV movies and shows for series like "Columbo," as well as low-level independents, this Joel Schumacher-directed film is a wonderful and deserved coup for him. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie ruined by profanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>simply put: a good thriller movie with twists and edge-of-your-seat suspense, but is ruined by the constant stream of profanity. it seems that every other word coming from the main character is f***. I'm in no way prudish about language, but when it goes to this extent, it's more of a distraction from the movie than anything else. honestly, I enjoy watching the TV version, in which it's edited out, so i can get more into the story, rather than trying to sort out what he's saying through the constant cursing. the plot itself is interesting and the acting is well done. once again, an overall good movie which is lessened by the excess of profanity. my advise: watch it edited on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget, High Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly entertaining little psychological thriller.True, the gimmick is what got me interested: a entire movie that takes place in a phone booth. That's a slight exaggeration, but that's the premise that got cult film writer/director Larry Cohen to write this screenplay over 30 years ago, and he reportedly pitched it to Alfred Hitchcock shortly before the Great Man's passing.Since it was first laid to paper, the script had to have a lot of rewrites. In fact, technology almost made this script obsolete. We are told that this phone booth where the film unfolds (of a type first installed in the 1950's) is the last of its type in Manhattan (as of when the film was made, 2002), and is scheduled to be demolished. I wish this film had actually been made in the 1970's, in a world without cell phones. That would have amped up the tension, in my view. But, they managed to do some rewriting and push that problem to the side.It's Cohen's taut writing that is the real motivator here, coupled with searing acting by Collin Ferrell and Forest Whitaker. Radha Mitchell and Katie Holmes don't have much to do. Kiefer Sutherland is perfectly menacing yet not without some layer of rationality, but unfortunately we only hear him for most of the film. Joel Schumaker's direction is fine, but not nearly as remarkable as the writing and acting.For a film shot in 10 days (with 2 days of pickups) for 2 million bucks, the studio got quite a lot of entertainment value for its money. I hope it turned a profit, but with a budget that low the odds are probably good that it did.Well worth your time. No sex, but there is violence, death and plenty of "naughty words." Highly recommended.Now, sequel anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead, as indicated above, so do only read, if you're OK with me talking about what happens in the movie! Can a man trapped inside a phone booth be suspenseful for the length of a feature film? It seems that he can! Or better the movie can. The movie is almost completely in the phone booth, but at the end they steer away from it (logically, to get the man responsible). Kind of like Speed meets Hitchcock, but with a bit of a message. A message carried by Keith Sutherland, but still the part of the movie, that in my eyes is the worst! Trying to make the villain human is one thing, but giving him sort of kudos at the end, is another. It almost ruined the movie (experience) for me ... I can't say how that affected your judgement of the movie, but that's something you have to make up for yourself! :o)</fullReview>

He picks it up and there's a man on the other line. The caller says if Stu hangs up the phone, he'll have to shoot him. Now Stu has to find a way out of the situation. If Stu doesn't follow the callers instructions, he's dead.This movie is thrilling. It keeps you to the edge-of-your-seats. In the beginning of the movie, you meet Stu who shows his selfishness in his actions. He gets punished for his sins by a man who might shoot him. Why does Stu have to call Pam in a phone booth everyday? Becayse his wife, Kelly check his phone bills so she doesn't noticed that he has been cheating on her.I have to admit it. I did cry a little. The way the film brings out the emotions is just powerful. This movie will also keep your heart pounding. The whole movie takes place in a phone booth the whole time, as you guessed. Police gets involved in the plot, later on. This film is also funny. Like the hookers. The acting is great, I have to say, by both Colin Farrel and Forest Whitaker.Larry Cohen, who wrote this film, also have written Cellular, another film that is also thrilling.This is a great thriller that keeps you to the edge-of-the-seats with some humor, excitement, and some emotions. It's short that you can watch it over and over again. It's just that good. Well, not better than Cellular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my homework of phonebooth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of this movie it shows us a phonebooth that is situated in New York City. It says that it is about to be knocked down the next day but before it is we are informed that it has a last surprise for its last user. We are now introduced to Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) who is a publicist who is highly ranked in his field, and enjoys all the pressures that come with his job. To get infront of all his rivals in his business he lies, manipulates and cheats his clients so he can get the best results. As well as cheating his clients he also cheats on his wife whom thinks she has a happy married-life, although this isn't the case as each day Stu visits the local phonebooth to speak to one of his clients called Pam. Pam is a newcomer to New York and relies on Stu to promote her talents although after a while they started sleeping together.After one of Stu and Pams phonecalls at the same phonebooth that's being knocked down tomorrow the phone starts ringing as Stu is leaving the phonebooth. Stu answers the phone and a man who claims to be a sniper at a near point window aiming at his head and commands him not to hang up. To prove that he isn't joking the sniper kills a pimp that is trying to get Stu out of the phonebooth because he is taking to long with his call. This doesn't make things better for Stu as the whores that are with him think that it was Stu that killed the pimp. The media and New York police soon arrive to the scene to cover this serious situation. As if thing couldn't go any worse both Stu's wife and Pam turn upto the scene having seeing it on the television meanwhile The Sniper continues to play mind games with Stu commanding him to do numerous things for instance admit he was cheating on his wife and confessing to all his lies in his business life.The sympathetic police officer Captain Ramey tries to solve the issue suspecting that someone is on the end of that phone telling him what to do. The sniper continues to play mind games with Stu telling him to call Captain Ramsey names and abusing him. Coming to the end of the story the sniper tells Stu that there is a gun above him stored in the roof panel, Stu puts his hand up there and claims he cant feel anything although he can as we see his hand touch it. The sniper knowing he's touched the gun then tells him that his fingerprints are now on the gun. The ending to this story takes a twist as you find out who the killer is and where he was which all comes in around 60 seconds.All in all I think Phonebooth was a great film and doesn't lose its suspense even if you watch it again and again. Although the movie was only 80 odd minutes it seemed much longer but not because it was boring but because it kept you on the edge of the seat from the second he answered the phone its nearly finished</fullReview>

A rich smart- looking man named Stuart Shepard who answers a ringing pay phone in New York, and on the phone is a sniper who tells Stuart that he'll kill him if he hangs up. The sniper can see him and he knows everything that Stuart is doing. Police and newscrew come. This film is great! Great acting, great plot,great actors, and great cast. The film wasn't long but it packed so much into it. This film is also tense and exciting, I enjoyed all of it. The film's ending was great too! I'm writing this review a day after I watched it.

		<fullReview>I must admit that I'm impressed to see how high rated this movie is so far, as I sure do not share that opinion. And guys, please, how amateur can you be! Stop rating everything 10 stars, PLEASE, use that opportunity to make a mature, precise and well analyzed rating, alright? It gets annoying for those who take the time to think... Well, anyway... A few days after seeing this film, I heard a colleague almost yelling to everyone how GOOD, how breathtaking and loaded of suspense this movie was, he was almost sweating, just talking about it... pathetic. Well, I remained silent; thinking to myself how fool this guy was anyway.No, really, although I'm glad to see an American movie breaking the usual linear scenario recipe, and being confident enough to keep it that short, in the end; it still left me somehow in a state of confused emptiness. I mean, OK, I'm alright with short movies, I'm okay with sad endings, or whatever most people dislike to see in a regular rental. So the problem isn't there, I guess the lenght has more to do with the inner limits of the "Phone Boot"'s concept, as a longer production would quickly turn in circle.Problem's neither about actors, which most are established talents delivering convenient performances. In fact, the hiccup isn't about what the movie got right or wrong, it's not about what it does, but more about what it does not. It doesn't innovate in any artistic way, nor in any psychological way. The way the subject is shown doesn't match the way it intended, pretended or wanted to be. This story sure was better on paper than on screen, no doubt about it. The strenghts aren't shinning enough, all of this 'cause of the boring and standard technical execution. Oh, yeah, and it's in New-York, wow... almost impressive, but especially original, really... Oh, and main characters HAD to be well known actors, yeah, sure... it wouldn't have been attractive enough for the middle American customer, of course, of course... A lot of these kind of stupid details would have made a much better piece of work. Some scenario bits should have been changed, like seeing the "mysterious" sniper guy, at the end, wasn't necessary, it was even clich (and everyone knew it was Kiefer Sutherland from the first time you hear him anyway). And the ending could hardly be worst and more uninspired. The spectator needs to leave, at the end, with something still working his mind. Otherwise, you get the "emptiness syndrome", and "Phone Boot" is the best example of its kind.The unusual scenario stepping is a slippy way, and it hurts. Focusing on a single element like this "selfmade -playing god- justice" doesn't leave enough meat around the bone, and quickly blow itself. The rest of the movie will or will not succeed, depending of your naivety and impressionability. It personally didn't bring me on the edge of my seat at all, it just seemed cheesy and repetitive to me, and maybe 1h20 was short, but it still felt like a waste of time, as it left me deceived, unsatisfied and, EMPTY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you hear such a great premise, you want to get to see the movie as soon as you can... but when you hear that such a talentless hack of a director gets to be in charge... we're talking, the man who, until Christoper Nolan came and built a new foundation for it, ruined the Batman franchise, after Tim Burton created two(not equally, but still both) grand entries... you feel, shall we say, less inclined to. Bottom line, I gave up on seeing this at the theaters for that reason, and now that I've finally gotten to see it(on the TV), I certainly wish I had given it a chance to win me over, because tonight, that's just what it did. Schumacher may not possess much talent or directorial skills, but what he's got, he certainly puts to good use here. The film plays like an episode of "24"(rather appropriate, with Sutherland in a role, one might say), everything happening in real-time and things being inter-cut and such. This, along with some very nice camera-work, keeps the intensity high and keeps the film moving constantly from the get-go. The plot is intelligently crafted and well told. The way it evolves ensures(if the intensity won't) that your eyes never drift off the screen. The characters are credible and interesting. The acting is top-notch, most notably by Sutherland and Farrell. The cinematography is masterful. The writing is magnificent. The villain is terrific, and the idea of keeping him hidden like that works excellently. The voice alone, maybe because that's all it is, a voice connected to a sniper rifle, is incredibly effective and scary. I read that Hitchcock originally wanted to do this in the late sixties... it's really too bad he didn't get a chance to. As good as Joel did, Hitchcock would have hit this one out the park. Very nice execution of a spectacular idea, but could have been just that little bit better. I recommend this to fans of thrillers and of the actors(I'd say of Mr. Schumacher, too, but I strongly doubt he has any). Definitely worth a look. 8/10</fullReview>

When it reaches it's grand finale, I felt thoroughly cheated and as if I had wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life. I was waiting for either the promised "twist", maybe something original I'd not seen before, or at least a bit of emotional melodrama, but all I got was a wet blanket. It's a real shame because the project had a lot of promise and with a decent climax could have been really memorable, but this is one I will forget very quickly and goes down as a major disappointment in my book.5/10</fullReview>

Strange audio (e.g. the god-like deep relaxed voice of the rifle shooter ... on the phone !). American-style happy ending (yeah, he made it ! yeah !). Overuse of stereotypes ("the corrupt executive" ... "who got out of a stock before the little investors" ... oh how sad.) Crazy sense of right and wrong (a sniper of high morals ...). Big ado just because of an immanent affair of the protagonist (well, very puritan, i guess). Implausible story (how and why did the sniper guy know all this detail about a very insignificant person living his odd little life?) Unconnected camera and film sequences in the beginning (more like a product placement for a certain US phone company.)Gave it a 5 but probably should have given a 4, thinking again.</fullReview>

See My Dinner with Andre if that's what you want.I feel the movie totally abuses the soundtrack to add suspense with the beating heart crescendos. And if you are the kind of person that finds yourself yelling at the screen when dumb characters miss obvious solutions, I wouldn't see this movie.For example (***SPOILERS AHEAD***) if you hear the shooter has to pump the rifle, then run after he shoots something. And once you figure out its a sharpshooter with a scope, then run because he won't be able to re-aim within a mile of you.At least it doesn't last long.</fullReview>

I have to admit the idea is original and thanks god the movie was not so long. The end is an a-ha-effect. I dont tell you more, just see it and judge yourself. My wife found it not as good as I did and our vote is finally 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an interesting (if simple) premise, made into an unremarkable movie. There were no surprises, and every move was carefully telegraphed well ahead of time. The characters were all based firmly on very old, very tired cliches, so I suppose the filmmakers didn't feel the need to try to make them more than one-dimensional. To describe the movie as "predictable" would be generous. In the hands of a Hitchcock, this could have been an excellent film. In the hands of Schumacher, it's just dreck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed the idea of this movie, the actual film was not as good as it could have been. There were so many police procedural problems that I had to laugh. How does his wife keep getting out of the back of a cruiser? (if she can do it, so can a suspect) Why would they allow her at the scene? Why does Forrest Whitaker immediately offer to disarm himself? After all is said and done, why are people allowed to roam freely through a crime scene?Colin Farrell's acting is fair but his accent is horrible. Keifer Sutherland provides a great voice for the sniper, but his character's motivations should have been developed more. I like the idea of a man pinned down by a sniper that can't hang up the phone. It's just almost everything else about this movie that I don't like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this film is interesting - a man is caught in a phone booth by a sniper - but it just doesn't work. Like 'Liberty Stands Still', another movie that failed with the same premise, the movie has little action and rather flat dialogue, and this is coming from a guy who really doesn't care for action films. I feel a bit bad saying that, since I really can't think of anything better, but it's not my movie, so it isn't my job to make it better anyway.Colin Farrell is an interesting person: an actor who is both good and overrated at the same time. Considering that most young actors his age are practically painful to watch, seeing Farrell display a range of emotions through his facial expression is refreshing and reassuring. He's not great, however; many people tend to gush about him a bit much. He's still young, and although he is good, it doesn't seem that he's gotten over that "I'm trying so hard and it will break my heart if people don't like me even though I pretend I don't care what people think" attitude yet. I guess that's not his fault, since he isn't as experienced as other actors yet; it's just that some people say he's going to be the next great leading man, and I say: wait. I think he has the potential to be, but only time will tell.Also, I have to talk about the film's ending. So, this is the *SPOILER* warning here.--I was very put off by the ending. This trend in Hollywood to have bad guys never receive retribution bothers me. In fact, in many popular films now we're expected to sympathize with robbers and thieves, who are often leading characters. Farrells character is by no means a good guy, but Sutherland should not have gotten away. He had no right to do what he did. I just had to say something about that.Aside from that, the film is adequate. They didn't do as well as they could have with the premise, so I would say it's an average film.</fullReview>

Colin Farrell certainly couldn't save it, so I didn't expect that Kiefer Sutherland would (even though I didn't realize he was cast in it since I had no desire to really see this movie in the first place).When your first instinct says, a movie that entirely takes place in a phone booth, this is going to suck...and then you try to give it a chance but 1/4-way through you realize you're right, you just want it to end. Luckily this one doesn't go on for more than 2 hours or I'd probably shoot myself. ***-1/2 out of 10. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

My problem with Collin Farrell is that he is an Irish man with a strong Irish accent. I could not get over his accent in this movie, sounded like a cross between Antonio Banderas and a drunk Benicio Del Torro; Why not just use his regular voice?All in all, I would not recommend this movie, instead check out 'The Pianist' if you want to see a truly remarkable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special, mildly entertaining at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure exactly why so many IMDB user comments are praising this film. It was entertaining at times and had potential to be quite gripping, but I found it to be typical Hollywood mediocrity. Nothing was particularly inventive about the film, although the premise certainly should have been adequate enough to make a good B flick out of. I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this movie, but I got even less. The attempts at suspense were noble, but left much to be desired. There was nothing particularly wrong with Colin Farrell's performance, although he needs to stop doing Schumacher films if he wants to go somewhere with his career. Forest Whitaker's performance was dismal and disappointing (I normally like him). The dialog was ok but the concept was just plain stupid. I have no idea why Stu had so much trouble admitting his "sins" to his wife and to Pamela (Katie Holmes), especially at gunpoint. I also have no idea why Whitaker's character was so feeble and easily manipulated by some guy who is sweating profusely in a phone booth -- I thought he was supposed to be a New York police captain.Overall this movie had very few suspenseful moments or clever lines, I don't recommend it to anyone until it comes to home video rental.</fullReview>

I believe this movie is not a redemption story and it is not a morality story. It is a much darker story than it first might seem. It reminds us that there is this little voice in each of us that condemns us, but we rarely stop to listen to it. If we do, it drives us crazy with its oppressive demands to redeem ourselves. The story was summed up in the end with a chilling reminder that the oppressor could call again if the Colin character got out of line! To me the moral of the story was -- it's good to be good and it's good to be redeemed, but better find another way than yourself to straighten things out.I liked it -- I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever happened to Colin Farrell ? A pretty boy Irishman he seemed to star in nearly every Hollywood movie being released at the turn of the century then he quickly disappeared as quickly as he appeared . Possibly this was down to Farrell star vehicles being the type of movies that are released in to the multiplex then are quickly forgotten . Director Joel Schumacher is another name from yesteryear who to put it kindly has a reputation as one of the worst mainstream directors to have worked in the industry . This reputation is ill deserved and mainly down to internet band-wagonism . It's difficult to defend the big budget mess that was BATMAN AND ROBIN from 1997 but Schumacher's output is no worse than any other journeyman director in Hollywood and PHONE BOOTH is a better thriller than a large number of Hollywood thrillers from the same era PHONE BOOTH works simply because it's not like so many Hollywood thrillers from the same period . The likes of Jerry Bruckheimer was giving gigs to the likes of Michael Bay and demanded light noise , loud soundtracks , explosions and car chases . PHONE BOOTH is in many ways the anti Bruckheimer thriller . It has a single setting of a phone booth in New York where showbiz publicist Stu Shepard answers the ringing of a public phone and finds himself being taught a lesson in respect and redemption by a hidden sniper Somewhat conscious that the screenplay by Larry Cohen might be a bit too static to hold the attention of the mainstream audience Schumacher decides to embellish the visuals with what American film critic David Boardwell describes as " intensified continuity " which in simplified terms is MTV style direction but actually works very well and much of this is down to cinematographer Matthew Libatique As bizarre as it seems at the heart of the subtext of PHONE BOOTH is a tale of redemption as Stu is forced to confront his shallow showbiz life as a publicist where careers are discarded on a whim . Cohen's screenplay is more than efficient for the vast majority of the running time but does suffer slightly from a twist at the end which probably isn't needed but for a film dealing with a person held at gunpoint by a callous sniper this is far superior to the almost identical LIBERTY STANDS STILL released at the same time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really smart &amp; enjoyable thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phone Booth is set in New York where Stu Shepard (Colin Farell) lives &amp; works as a celebrity publicist, Stu calls a girl named Pamela (Katie Holmes) who he is stringing along from the last public phone booth in New York on the north side of West 53rd Street between Broadway &amp; 8th Avenue. When done he puts the phone down but it starts to ring as he is about to leave the booth, curious Stu picks it up only to discover some real psycho on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland) who has a high powered sniper rifle aimed right at him &amp; will kill him or an innocent bystander unless he does exactly what he wants...Directed by Joel Schumacher I have to admit that against all expectations I thought Phone Booth was a great thriller. It's Larry Cohen's smart fast moving &amp; original feeling script which is the films main strength, set almost entirely in one location the premise which revolves around a guy stuck in a phone booth doesn't initially sound that promising but the script is really absorbing &amp; pulls you into the intense situation Farell's character finds himself in which plays out during the film in real time like the TV series 24 (2001). It manages to have a swipe at the media &amp; the police while it makes you question just who is the bad guy, I mean Sutherland's character is obviously doing wrong but he's doing it with good intentions. At less than 80 minutes in length the time flies by, it never lets up for a second &amp; once it has you hooked on the interesting premise it doesn't let you go right until the very end &amp; even then you'll still be thinking about the ending as the end credits roll. The character's are very well written, the situation is maybe a little silly &amp; one could debate that it would be virtually impossible to emulate in reality. A much better film than I had expected &amp; a really smart little thriller that'll pass 80 odd minutes like they were 80 odd seconds.Director Schumacher goes for sped up scenes, split screen techniques so more than one person can be seen on screen at once &amp; goes for a bleached look as the film has a blue washed out tint throughout. There's also a really cool opening &amp; closing sequence which show's what you can do with CGI computer effects if they are done properly. Apparently the film was shot pretty much in sequence &amp; took a meagre 12 days to shoot overall. According the IMDb's 'Trivia Section' the sniper was originally played by Ron Eldrad but was replaced by Sutherland in re-shoots.With a modest sounding $10,000,000 budget (it made something like 15 million on it's opening weekend) this is well made essentially in the same location, shot on location in New York &amp; in Los Angeles. The likes of Will Smith, Mel Gibson &amp; Jim Carrey were all attached to Phone Booth at one point or another but I think it works well with a relatively low key unknown cast.Phone Booth is a really cool fast paced thriller that I enjoyed immensely, it's short, smart, gripping &amp; original. I was impressed, very impressed.</fullReview>

It isn't really long, but I found it so boring that I hoped it ended soon (I didn't stop watching it because it lasts less than 80 minutes, but how long they were for me!). The plot is simple, which isn't necessary bad, but in this movie it is. At first I thought it'd be interesting to know how everything gets resolved, but I soon realized it wasn't really interesting - it was so unreal! The actors (well, mainly just one actor) didn't strike me either. But the ending is clearly the worst part: the bad guy gets to escape from a highly-controlled-by-the-police hotel and he visits the 'hero' and talks to him and nobody notices it, and finally the bad guy escapes! As you can see the end is absolutely stupid, but I can't say I did really expect something better since the full movie was awful and boring. This film isn't entertaining nor interesting, and it's definitely the worst movie I've seen in months (or maybe years). You'd better spend your spare time doing something that worths the effort.</fullReview>

However, there is no room for escapism when the whole film takes place in a kiosk in a busy street. It's only saving grace is Colin Farrell's game performance, while the rest of the cast look like extras from a bad episode of Kojak, including the most cliched police captain ever.

		<fullReview>You're walking down a busy street. You pass a phone booth. The phone starts to ring. Do you pick it up? It must be part of the human psyche, but it seems that there is just something that makes us want to pick up that phone. We do.The same thing happens to New York City publicist Stuart Shephard, when he thinks nothing of picking up a phone on a Downtown street. On the other end is an unnerving voice that tells Stu not to hang up the phone. Stu soon realizes that the man--whoever he is and wherever he is--has a rifle. A sniper rifle.The Caller (Kiefer Sutherland) tells Stu that his lack of honesty and inhumanity has made him the target for this extortionist plot. If Stu hangs up the phone, he is dead. If Stu tells anyone who is on the other end of the phone, he is dead. The Caller wants Stu to confess his sins, which includes telling his wife why he uses a payphone every day instead of his cell phone.The reason is because Stu has been having a fling with a wannabe actress. The actress has no idea Stu's married. But when the Caller forces Stu to tell his wife the truth on television, everyone knows. But the Caller still won't let Stu go. He's never going to. Stu will be killed before the day is over.If the cops surrounding the place don't do something about it very soon."Phone Booth" is brought to us by Joel Schumacher, a man many hate yet many adore. He is the man responsible for the previous two "Batman" installments. Many claim him of ruining a series, when, in fact, the series was ruined by the first sequel. Joel Schumacher is too heavy on the darks in his "Batman" films, and his directorial efforts can be very bad. But he also brought us the wonderful character breakdown story "Falling Down," a film I have been quoted as saying is one of the best films of 1993. He also brought us the Brat Pack film "St. Elmo's Fire," the other Kiefer Sutherland film "The Lost Boys," and, among others, the tragic "Bad Company" and "8MM." But "Phone Booth" has some of the attributes of all those films. It has some "Falling Down" in it, some "Bad Company" in it (shudder), some "Lost Boys" in it, and yes, even some "Batman &amp; Robin" in it. But it's on the same level as "Falling Down," i.e. it's a very watchable, if somewhat repetitive thriller.My first impression upon seeing previews for "Phone Booth" was that I thought it had some real potential. Given the right dialogue and director, a boring situation can be turned into an intense one. Take, for instance, the scene where Stu is being commanded by the Caller to take a hidden handgun from the phone booth and wave it at the cops. We don't know how he's going to get out of it. But then when he does, we think to ourselves, "Why didn't I think of that?" I like thrillers that make a situation seem inevitible, then suddenly solve the problem. Colin Farrell sports a good New York City accent, and Kiefer Sutherland sports a good Willem Dafoe voice. He's creepy, strange, and thanks to the film's technique of Hitchcockian suspense, we don't see him. At least for most of the film.(Spoilers ahead)The ending is a two-bit surprise. It's not just one twist, it's two. When the first twist was revealed, I thought it was the solution to the film, and it fit together more than a film like "Red Dragon" where you know the killer's going to come back. But then there's another twist. It's amazing, chilling, and eerie. And when the credits started rolling, my heart was still pounding. And even though some people will think this movie is tremendous and others will think it is ridiculous, it kept me on the edge of my seat and rarely let me down. Give it a chance.And next time you walk down a street, think twice before picking up that ringing phone.**** out of ***** (four out of five stars)John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it was clever, yes it was well done and yes it got boring. The movie was not a bad movie, but there was not really anything brilliant about it. It was fairly easy to predict what was going to happen and there was not all that much suspense, action or uniqueness (if that is a word) to it for me to rate it higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller ? la MTV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It begins like to many of the rock videos you have seen, there the audience is expected to feel bored, if the camera stands still for more than half a second. But here that's all right. You get into a nervous mood, which will soon be mirrored in the situation of the main character, well acted by Colin Farrell.This is not just a thriller however. The main character gets into a situation where he has to question his slightly immoral life. He is not a big crook, only a small one, but there is moralism here considering all kinds of lies. This is a very ethic thriller.Good script by Larry Cohen. Very well directed by Joel Schumacher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very stylish thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what else Colin Farrell has been in, but I can honestly say that this is his breakthrough performance, very strong, very intense, and very convincing. He was throwing everything into this character, and he did one hell of a job. As for the story, very unique, not the most relate able or typical situation, which makes it all the more exciting. Very stylized with its cinematography, music, and dialogue.The story consists of New York publicist Stu Shepard, (Colin Farrell) making a phone call in a phone booth in time square to call the girl he's admiring, (whom he's hiding from his wife). Afterwards, he gets a call from a stranger who states facts abut Stu's life, which really concerns him. His cocky attitude eventually fades when the stranger says he has a sniper rifle pointed at Stu, threatening to shoot if he hangs up or tries to escape. The police get involved when a person is shot by the sniper, and Stu is the supposed killer.The film immediately gets in the story after a couple minutes of putting you in the New York environment, people using cellphones and payphones for their business. When the call with the stranger starts, I immediately noticed his voice wasn't as if hearing from the phone, but in a studio narrating the situation like Morgan Freeman. I liked this because it kept his presence away from the outside world, letting you know he wasn't really nearby. Colin Farrell is good at playing a cocky douche, because he pawns it off as some loser, and tries to offer him money and fame to leave him alone, then slowly throughout the film, as he's more and more scared, he becomes a helpless weakling.The style of the film really focused on the lighting of the city and cinematography, showing how a normal city immediately twists and turns for a man when he's threatened. A lot of thrillers and horror films nowadays use this style, with the speeding up/slowing down, as well as several shaky cam shots. The stranger is awesome because he acts like a normal person, he doesn't really act like a bad guy, he toys with Stu, and just has fun with it, making him say weird stuff to the cops. Though he is obsessed with exposing Stu as a fraud, not only to the cameras, but mostly his wife. The motive of the killer doesn't make too much sense, he picks out a selfish person, waits for him to use a payphone, then messes with him, like get a life bro, but whatever.Forest Whitaker as the captain tries to work with Stu, and gets very confused with Stu's reaction, as Stu isn't allowed to inform him of anything, which made me want to just jump in there and tell them all. I felt like I was in Colin's situation. Several cops pointing guns at him, one false move and he's dead, whether by the cops, or the killer. The frustrated Colin pulls it off incredibly well though.The whole film kept me on edge from beginning to end. The killer always had something to say to make it more interesting. The conversations between him and Colin are fun as hell. Colin has nothing to do but respond to the killer. I'm always wondering whether or not he's going to kill Colin, because a lot of times Colin pulls stunts where I can't believe the killer didn't kill him. But I guess that's just how much fun he was having with it.I enjoyed this quite a bit. It pulls off everything just right, the performance by Farrell and Whitaker, the style, the fast paced editing, etc. It just all clicked together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth tries to be some sort of psychological thriller, but in the end all it achieves is mild boredom and general apathy toward the story and the characters. The story and the characters have the depth of a puddle. Stu is annoying, but we do understand from the very first sequences he's just a deluded prick... to be honest nobody an actual serial killer would bother stalking. The killer himself... who is he? His messiah complex isn't explored oor explained, so it's hard getting into the story when the two main characters are so lifeless and forgettable. The rest is kinda there just to make it to the end... The troubled detective, about whom we found out nothing at all. Stu's wife and mistress, who are little more than filler.There isn't a single aspect of the story that is vaguely intriguing. And the ending screams "cop out" at the top of its lungs.Take SAW and strip it of the gore, of the plot-twists and of the ironic and twisted tortures.Take Criminal Minds and strip it of the characters' interaction and of the investigation itselfThen you have Phone Booth...An uninspiring and shallow movie about a prick talking on the phone for the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't like this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Phone Booth I thought that it sounded like a good idea, a indie thriller set in one place. However when it came to watching the film I didn't like it.The basic plot of the film is Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a publicist who lives a very amoral life. He is married to one woman (Radha Mitchell) and having an affair with another (Katie Holmes). He makes his phone calls from the last phone booth in New York. From this a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) who has been watching Stu for a while decides to get attack Stu using mind-games and tricks and if he got out the booth the sniper would kill him. Because of the actions of Stu the media and the police become involved.There are a few reasons why I don't like this film. Firstly I didn't think that this film's script was well written and I didn't believe in it. Secondly there was a likable character in the film so you end up not caring about them. Thirdly this was the start of Colin Farrell becoming a lazy actor and it was not a particular good performance in this film. Finally I just thought that film was boring.It just best to avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is extremely well-crafted (beginning with the perfect foreshadowing of Colin Farrell's way of answering his calls), extremely well-acted (Farrell's performance is indelible, and probably overlooked by the Academy), and relentless in its harrowing irony of inhuman killer as avenging angel. Or is it guardian angel...has Farrell's character been given a second chance, for some reason? Stuart at least proves himself worthy of that second chance, in chancing with his life, finally offering it, for others. Roger Ebert called it a morality play; perhaps it is, one on steroids--Judgment Day, midweek, Manhattan. The movie is a minefield, leaving nothing, and everything, to the imagination.</fullReview>

It's like all action/suspense movies put together: good looking guy, psycho-killer, and unbeatable odds. But Collin F. is hot!! And he is a decent actor (along with Forrest W. and Katie H.) I even liker Keifer S. in the right role(let's be honest he has played this role too many times). I also feel that the plot was pointless. Who cares if he wants to cheat. Just about everyone wants to cheat. It doesn't mean we do or get the chance to. Go pick on someone who really deserves it (murder, child molester). Someone bad!!! Not the average man (I mean man as in male. Not that women don't think about cheating, but come on). Yeah, I really didn't like it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I have to admit this may be the worst movie I have seen in years. Fortunately I think it clocked in at about 75 minutes best I could tell, so the pain didn't last forever. Other questionable things: - OK, the lead character wasn't a saint, but did he really do anything to deserve this? Couldn't the shooter have selected someone at least a more morally corrupt? Best I could tell he was deceptive and was thinking about fooling around on his wife (but never did) - he gets the daylights knocked out of him by the pimp, but amazingly there are no marks on his face when he is done! - The voice over for the sniper - sounds like he is speaking through a stereo, not on a pay phone - The pizza guy as a killer? He slashes his own throat?I could go on and on. Go for a walk. Go golfing. Don't watch this movie</fullReview>

I am a huge Kiefer Sutherland fan (24 is an amazing show), and even that couldn't save this one. Honestly, I am saddened by the unreasonably high rating this movie was given.

		<fullReview>Warning: The following contains spoilers: Skip this movie if you haven't seen it already. Why didn't the plot follow up on the sniper's ability to prevent the phone call from being tapped? Was he an electronics expert -- should that have tied into why he was angry with Stu? Who was this sniper, anyways? Are we supposed to accept that flimsy vigilante reasoning for why he chose Stu? Shouldn't it be obvious to us that the pizza delivery guy had been murdered before the standoff began (the sniper had no conversation with anyone other than Stu during that hour). The script went nowhere with no development of who this sniper was even though he was the antagonist in the film. Worst of all, that was the most dissatisfying ending I have ever seen. Talk about anti-climatic. It seems Larry Cohen and Joel Schumacher just wanted to torture audiences for an hour and twenty minutes.</fullReview>

What could have been an engrossing movie, suffers from an unsympathetic hero and an insufferably dull and verbose villain. Enormous plot holes, profanity-laden script and a pointless, seemingly endless, run-in with hookers and an even more pointless, unexplained, conflict between two police officers, undermine any attempt at infusing the film with tension.

		<fullReview>(Comment originally posted 12 July 2003) Why Seinfeld, you say? Because, um, was there a point to the movie? Actually, that's as much negativity as I can conjure up about it now, though. After reading Shiva-11's comments (with that great summary line, dang it, wish I had been so clever!) I had the wind taken out of my cynical sails. And Colin did do a great job. His emotions were very convincing, and unlike your typical Bruce Willis or Keanu Reeves showdown-with-the-bad-guy-on-the-phone flicks, Colin didn't suddenly invoke super-perception, heroic strength, and/or cowboy witticisms. Colin stayed realistic.So okay, I can just complain about one other thing -- Kelly, would you stay in the #$%&amp;%$&amp;$@ car??? Stupid girl, you're going to give blondes a bad name!

		<shortDescription>A strong, tense and gripping thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleazy, smarmy and arrogant New York City publicist Stu Shepard (a bracing and bravura performance by Colin Farrell) finds himself trapped in a phone booth by a cunning sniper (splendidly voiced to skin-crawling sinister perfection by Kiefer Sutherland) who wants Stu to come clean and confess to his indiscretions. Joel Schumacher's sharp, stylish, agile direction maintains a snappy pace throughout and wrings a lot of sweat-inducing suspense from Larry Cohen's clever, concise and witty script. Farrell effortlessly carries the picture with his remarkably brave and dynamic portrayal of a shady and amoral hustler par excellence; he does an especially impressive job of making the initially unappealing Stu more likable as the story unfolds. The uniformly bang-up acting from a fine cast qualifies as a major asset: Forest Whitacker as rational, sympathetic Captain Ed Ramey, Radha Mitchell as Stu's loyal, loving wife Kelly, Katie Holmes as sweet aspiring actress Pamela, Keith Nobbs as naive eager beaver protg Adam, John Enos III as hostile pimp Leon, and Pamela Jai Parker, Arian Waring Ash and Tia Texada as a trio of sassy hookers. Matthew Libatique's slick cinematography works wonders with a single confined setting, astutely capturing a palpable sense of claustrophobic tension and using split screen with genuinely dazzling results. Harry Gregson-Williams' shivery, rousing score, the often wickedly funny dialogue ("TV brings out the worst in people; you will be fine"), the pleasingly tight'n'trim 81 minute running time, and the gritty, flavorful Big Apple atmosphere are all sound and on the money as well. A very solid and satisfying thriller winner.</fullReview>

Anyway I saw PhoneBooth as 'second' movie and thought right away "O no, here we go again!". You must be a clever and brilliant movie maker to make something as boring as "a guy in a phonebooth standing there for more than one hour" really exiting! The movie maker isn't that brilliant. I couldn't care less what would happen to arrogant Colin Farrell. So the reasons behind it all "would be a sausage to me (dutch joke)".Also the famous voice on the phone told me right away "that's mister Kiefer Sutherland". So no surprise for me that the wrong guy was shot, that guy did not look a tad bit like Kiefer.Leave the suspense thrillers to the old master "Alfred Hitchcock".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of the movie is way to plain. When I read what the movie was about, it told me this, 'guy trapped in phone booth' after watching the trailer, 'guy trapped in phone booth because of sniper'. Now what kind of storyline is that? That was the whole movie, there is no action whatsoever, whole --&gt;1&lt;-- hour (really, a cartoon is longer than that.) movie based on a (1) guy that is pinned down by a sniper. same location, for 80 minutes. it wasn't thrilling, it was BORING. ya, the only thing that was good about the movie is the some-what boring conversation. (all the movie is about.) there was no more point to watching it after you see it for 20 minutes, you will KNOW what it will be still. all the police that was there was standing around looking like idiots, i mean common, at least one guy should point out, "maybe it is because he is trapped there" well after 79.9 minutes of total conversation, the sniper is finally kicked out of the building by SWAT. AT LEAST THERE SHOULD BE SOME ACTION THERE??? really avoid this movie, you have better movies to watch with 5$.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - one of those ones that leads to resentment due to having paid for the ticket. Had I known what Phone Booth would actually be like, I would have required payment to attend the movie. Phone Booth's plot is simplistic and involves unnecessary and boring violence and cruelty. It is clear throughout that those who created the movie thought that its ideas were very interesting and thoughtful - really this is an example of indulgence of the worst kind, akin to Matrix II and III (dare I say it) - fun for movie-makers but painful for audiences. None of the characters are endearing and there is no subtlety or anything remotely attractive or memorable. The voice of the "baddy" is that "scary person" voice used in so many American movies (such as Scream etc) - very tacky. I strongly discourage people from watching this movie - 0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Phone Booth' was awful. Let's just get that out of the way immediately. This review contains many spoilers, but to spare those of you from losing 80 minutes of your life, I will share as follows: When the sniper shared that he had wired his phone call so that it couldn't be traced and he's bugged the booth, why didn't the plot follow up on that? The sniper appeared to know a lot about electronics. What was the deal with that? The plot explained nothing. The pizza delivery guy's throat was not slashed as the police were heading to the sniper so it should be apparent that he'd been murdered before the hostage taking had started. (Kiefer Sutherland's character's attention was uninterrupted during the standoff). It would be obvious that the pizza delivery guy didn't slash his own throat by the angle of the blade. These two observations can't be overlooked during a time when people are conscious of `CSI", which is topping the tv ratings. Who was this sniper? Why was he taking this guy hostage? The plot did not evolve to reveal any information about him. He explained that he'd been watching Collin Farrell, but why did he choose him? A legitimate reason was shared only to be trashed within minutes of the captivity. I'm refering, of course, to him being an out of work actor, which he claimed in the initial minutes. It seems that Joel Schumacher, who honored us with `Batman Forever' and Batman and Robin,' wanted to try and experiment. He wanted to make a film in ten days -- forget the gaping plot holes. The plot of this film seemed to be, let's taunt and torture someone for an hour and that will be entertaining. There wasn't even a decent resolution at the conclusion of this piece of crap. The sniper walks away, only to say he'll be watching to be sure Farrell stays honest -- WHY?</fullReview>

So, if you liked this movie, you might like some of the others on my list: "Wild, Wild West," "Leprechaun in the Hood," "Glitter," "Sandlot 2," "Kazaam," and anything with Jennifer "I have no talent but a big butt" Lopez.
