		<shortDescription>Once every so often...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once every so often a film comes along that will change your perception of things. In one way or another it will give you elements to better yourself. "Precious" is such a film. Lee Daniels, the director, takes things to extremes, so much so that this could easily be an opera. When you think that things couldn't be worse, you discover that they have been worse already for a long time. Precious is played by a sort of miracle. Her name is Gubarey Sidibe and I don't even know how to pronounce it but I will certainly take her in my mind from now on, always. When she stands listening to the rantings of her mother, I surprised myself by feeling tears running down my face. The mother, a standout, once in a lifetime performance by Mo'Nique, is also a character we've never seen before. Brutal, unsentimental and truthful to the core. I saw the film over three weeks ago and I can't shake it out of my system, if that in itself is not a sign of greatness I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning performances but emotionally inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start out by emphasizing that I disagree with much of the criticism the film has been receiving. A common disparagement condemns the movie as "emotionally manipulative" and "superficially inspirational", much like other films that fall into the category of the "inspirational dramas" depicting stories of individuals overcoming obstacles and hardships that many people seem to hate. Well, I personally found that the film portrays a reality far too bleak and dismal and brutal for it to possibly be considered "inspirational"; in addition, while the film ends on somewhat of a high note, even that is laced with misery and becomes the lesser of two evils for the protagonist. Another criticism of the film ? and of the book it is based on ? is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and blames the film for portraying TOO bleak a situation to the point of exploitation. I personally found the scenario portrayed in the film to be strikingly realistic, and I think that people who are too ignorant to realize that such a grim existence can feasibly be led in 21st century America need a serious wake-up call.One aspect of the film that deserves all the praise in the world is its cast, specifically the performances of its lead actresses and the surprising and unexpected quality of these performances considering the particular thespians involved. First and foremost, we have the breakout role of Gabourey "Gabby" Sidibe, portraying the overweight, twice-pregnant and illiterate protagonist, Precious. The performance is a revelation both because of how convincingly Sidibe reacts to and interacts with her brutal day-to-day existence, but also because of how completely removed it is from the first-time actresses' actual life. It's always impressive to see a performer convincingly convey difficult and profound emotions that they probably would never feel themselves in their real lives, but for a first-time actress to convey these emotions is particularly incredible. Precious' life is populated by three prominent adult characters; two of which see past her daunting exterior and genuinely want to help her, and one who does the exact opposite. Mariah Carey plays a social worker who takes a personal interest in Precious' case and, in the film's most dramatically gut-wrenching scene, makes a genuine attempt to bridge the gap between the teenager and her monstrous mother. Carey has only ever acted in two or three other films, including the atrocious vanity project "Glitter", but in this role, she de-glams, puts on a convincing and raspy accent and actually manages to deliver a surprisingly well rounded and convincing performance. Paula Patton plays another alternate mother figure in Precious' life, her teacher at her alternate school who takes a particularly personal interest in Precious, to the point of letter her stay at her home when she has nowhere else to go. Unlike Mariah Carey, Patton never did anything to totally remove my confidence in her acting abilities, but then again, she's never actually given what can really be considered a "good" performance, which is what makes her tender and genuine turn in this film most impressive. But the scene-stealer is without a doubt Mo'Nique, probably one of my LEAST favorite "comedic" performers who totally redeems herself and manages to deliver a frighteningly convincing performance, incredibly transforming herself into Precious' villainous, sadistic and purely evil mother. It is an incredible and difficult and extremely brave performance, and is even more impressive considering that it's coming from the star of "Phat Girlz".The performances are rich and incredible enough to hold up dramatic scenes, but not the narrative as a whole, which, as I mentioned before, suffers from a series of bad directorial choices made by director Lee Daniels. The film's biggest flow is emotional inconsistency: in an attempt to portray Precious' inner feelings, Daniels injects strangely conceived fantasy sequences at key dramatic moments in which Precious imagines herself as a glamorous and famous personality. While the intention of these sequences is clear, their abruptness just totally jolts the audience out of the emotional flow of the film, and they just seem out of place. For a similar reason, Daniels chooses to set grim and dramatic scenes to oddly inappropriate songs and musical cues, which once again just feel forced and out of place, and interrupt the emotional resonance of the scenes. Other than that, the film just seems poorly done at times, or simply unfinished: the cinematography is inconsistent and often features zooms and loss of focus that don't feel like stylistic choices but rather just like mistakes. In addition, the editing is quite disjointed at times, and many cuts interrupt musical cues in the middle or otherwise are just so sudden and jumbled that they completely ruin the dramatic flow. Finally, I just felt that while many separate scenes work wonderfully and are emotional and genuinely gut-wrenching, they are just too loosely connected for the film to actually carry a consistent dramatic arc throughout, as it jumps between Precious' brutal home life to her newfound support in her classroom to her day-to-day activities to her inner fantasies. For example, a major dramatic reveal near the end of the film end sup completely ignored and thus irrelevant to the dramatic arc. As I mentioned earlier, the performances are absolutely spectacular, but the inconsistencies in the film's tone and its jumbled and odd editing take away from what otherwise could have been a genuinely affective film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabourey Sibide looks and sounds a lot like the late Hattie McDaniel; if a biopic about McDaniel is ever made, Sibide should star. Starting from this superficiality, it is clear that the character Sibide plays, an abused, obese late- 20th-century Harlem teenager three or four generations down the line from the McDaniels era, seems to embody a sadly ironic regression in the status of black women in America. Precious's very existence and her debased environment speak to a grave social disease that continues to poison our civilization ? the creation and perpetuation of a dependent underclass. At one point Precious compares her self image to "black grease that needs to be wiped away." The horror of it all is that as dreadful as Precious's situation is, she is actually better off than many others in similar straits. She is, despite obesity, strong and healthy, drug free and has a beautiful smile. There are plenty of underclass females much closer to an early grave and utter hopelessness than she.The story takes us on the journey of this monstrously mistreated young female from near destruction at the hands of her violent, hyper-narcissistic mother (Mo'Nique) and her rapist father (who has impregnated her twice by age 16) to a rescue with the help of a frayed but still somewhat viable network of dedicated social workers who help her gain literacy and independence from her wicked elders.Interspersed with the depressing realities of ghetto life is the constant flow of Precious's glamorous daydreams, the little fires generated by her undying spark of life, her only opening toward beauty and light, imagining herself wrapped in beautiful gowns, doted on by handsome men, cheered by adoring crowds on the red carpet; wealth, fame, as she knows them from the pop culture that is her only mental nourishment. For her mother and for herself, life is an endless round of TV?food?arguments-TV?food-arguments. In their dark and dingy apartment, practically the only illumination is from the TV screen.Mo'Nique's performance is revelatory on multiple levels, down to the bone of the human condition and certainly up to the highest screen standards. It is bravura work. Sibide's performance is technically masterful but much of her effectiveness comes from her imposing physical presence; this is not meant to detract one iota from her acting skills ? it is just a fact. The excellent supporting performances include a pleasing turn from singer Mariah Carey as a down-to-earth social worker with a playful personality; it's an inventive characterization. But the whole cast excels and they should be honored for great ensemble work, especially the young ladies in the special education classroom. Flaws? The pacing seems to slow down unnecessarily toward the end and Precious's educational progression seems a bit confused and not completely fleshed out, but this is minor stuff. This is a very inspired work of art by someone with a fresh vision. It is not preaching morals or slogans, just revealing truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully emotive story filled with hope and optimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not surprised that Push won both the Grand Jury and Audience Award at Sundance this year. Director Lee Daniels (Shadowboxer) has created a very powerful film that manages to entertain while evoking a broad spectrum of emotions, from anger and heartbreaking pity to optimism, joy and hope.Clareece "Precious" Jones (Gabby Sidibe) is a fat 16-year-old illiterate black girl that lives in Harlem with her welfare-dependent, abusive mother (Mo'Nique). She has one autistic daughter (who lives with her grandmother) and is pregnant with another child, both from her mother's boyfriend, who is also Clareece's father. Her mother repeatedly tells her how stupid and worthless she is while other kids taunt her for her obesity. She has become hardened and heartless, lacking education and social skills. She spends her time cooking for her mother and fantasizing unrealistically about a glamorous life. She would be easy to dismiss. Based on a novel by Sapphire, this is some pretty bleak stuff.But good things can happen in this world and Precious is blessed with an indomitable spirit that refuses to accept the negative reinforcement that bombards her. Through her efforts, and despite resistance from her mother, she finds an alternative school. It is staffed by Miss Rains, a caring teacher (Paula Patton) and classmates who, although anything but perfect, possess enough compassion to become supportive friends. It turn out that the world can be a pretty good place.First-time actress Gabby Sidibe gives a powerful, emotive performance. Equally good is talented actresses Mo'Nique, who is almost frightening as Precious' mother, and Patton as the compassionate teacher. Lenny Kravitz and Mariah Carey also have minor roles, giving the film a little star power.Daniels conveys a Harlem existence that is profane, hard-edged and brutal, but with rays of humanity and compassion that leave room for hope. It is at once both a message to the poor in spirit not to despair, and to the rest of us make the time and effort to reach out where we can. Push is an inspiring message that will fill you with optimism and joy.Sundance Moment: When asked about her getting the role, Sidibe said that she had some acting experience--like a non-speaking role in a college production. Pretty funny! She said her friends encouraged her to audition because she "fit the profile." She also said she relied heavily on "Mr. Daniels" for direction. Daniels said there were parts of making the movie that were hard on him emotionally--like directing Precious to eat, or instructing her peers to bully her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking and Riveting, Precious Will Win Your Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Precious at the New York Film Festival yesterday. As you may know, Precious is the only film to ever win the Audience Award at both the Sundance and Toronto International Film Festivals. The film has been highly hyped since January and I was afraid I would be underwhelmed. Well, I sure wasn't! Precious is a powerhouse piece of cinema that will rip your heart to shreds. The acting is pitch perfect from everybody and the film-making is unusual. Precious is about Claireece 'Precious' Jones, an overweight girl who has already had a child with Down's Syndrome from when she was raped by her father. Her mother constantly abuses her and she's already pregnant with her second baby. When she gets kicked out of school and is forced to go to an alternative school to help her get her GED, she realizes that there may actually be hope for her. The acting is easily the most important and best thing during Precious. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe will absolutely be famous and definitely deserves the Best Actress Oscar. Her performance was so real and searing that you're just forced to sympathize with her. Other cast includes Lenny Kravitz, Mariah Carey, and Mo'Nique who are all unfamiliar to the genre, but still perform very well. Mo'Nique gives a really great performance as the abusive mother Mary and should definitely win an Oscar as well. Mariah Carey's performance is a bit dry, but her character is not very major. Paula Patton, the actress who plays Blu Rain, Precious' teacher, gives a believable and loving performance as well. Also, the girls in Precious' class are all great. I actually was sitting behind them at the screening and got the them to sign my Playbill. They were all very excited. The crowd seemed to love the movie. At Toronto, people laughed at serious parts, but the New York audience ate it up. People clapped for Precious, cried at the right parts, and even gasped at the screen over some of the violence. The violence is often so abrupt that it feels as if you too could have just been hit over the head with a pan. Everybody was so engaged in watching it even Gabourey Sidibe herself who had already seen it three times. Even she had trouble watching some parts. At the end of the movie, everyone in the audience stood up and gave Lee Daniels and his cast about a ten minute standing ovation. Everybody loved the film. Precious is definitely one of the best movies of the year and will definitely at least be nominated for Best Picture if not win it. It may be a bit bleak, but Precious gives me and everybody else hope. Lee Daniels wrote a quotation at the end of the movie that said "For precious girls everywhere". This is what really put the icing on the cake. Precious is a magnificent and disturbing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Stereotypical Movie Ever (spoilers ahead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost I want to say that I am not disrespecting the people that organized this film or the actors. They are doing what they gotta do I guess. I do believe some people in this movie have talent, but it's not being expressed.It seem like black cinema has reached an all time low. This is the most stereotypical movie to come out since "Birth Of A Nation" but yet it's embraced by the black community for one and Hollywood seems to be OK with it. Why? Is it because it represents every stereotype out there about black people. My aunt enjoyed this movie while my father and I were the only ones who realized how offensive this was.This movie is about a young, fat, extra dark, illiterate, welfare, woman who loves chicken,is getting molested by her father,and has two kids. Is this all black filmmakers can do today? We come off as monolithic because we're always falling into the bag every time. I can watch the news every day and see these representations of black people. And this is suppose to be inspirational? Anyone could of made this movie. The script literally seemed like the whole movie was improvised. If the girl precious drops a crumb on the floor her mother literally goes into 100% ghetto mode. "You ain't sh*t you fat b****. That's why nobody wants your fat, black a**.You fat ugly b**** you ain't never gonna be nothing in life". I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not. We've got to get beyond promoting ignorance. And it wouldn't be as bad if we saw a balance in black cinema, but this is all we're seeing.But on the other hand the black audience embraced it. But when a positive movie like "The Great Debaters" or "The Miracle at St. Anna" come out we don't support it. Let's wake up and see a wider view of what black people are capable of and stop supporting everything that's a stereotype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incredibly powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at Sundance, and it was truly amazing. I confess I did not read the book (I will now), but I suspect that Daniels really took it to the next level. The story of Precious and her world was deeply moving and supremely well acted. I was particularly surprised at my own ability to laugh, along with the story, at the worst humanity can throw at us. After the film, Daniels, the producers, and the entire cast came forward to many standing ovations. Gabby was indeed charming, and I was particularly riveted by Mo'Nique's discussion of how she was able to become Mary, Precious' mother. Daniels fielded many questions from the audience, mostly directed at the task of realizing this story. I hope to see his work again. This is a heavy film, but I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh, honest and emotionally punchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine film. An American urban working class drama, it manages to steer clear of almost every possible idiomatic pothole created by predecessors charging blithely down the same street. It seems real - only the controlled framing tells you that it's not a documentary to begin with - it's often funny, and has wonderfully placed surreal day-dream sequences (I wasn't a fan of these per se, but I liked how they were used). The Dangerous Minds/Freedom Writers school of contrived classroom turnaround is completely avoided (with one notable exception). The final set piece is one of the most raw, emotionally bruising and uplifting things I've seen in a cinema for a very long time; everyone was crying.At the centre is (worthy Oscar tip) Gabby Sidibe as the eponymous Clareece Precious Jones. The fact that her middle name is not some sort of irony lever is a testament not only to Lee Daniels but also to her iron performance. It's also impressive that the satellite cast act with the character she is digging out (yes, even Mariah Carey, an amazing metamorphosis). It would be so simple and safe for everyone to treat Clareece as the fat girl whose acts garner pity and pathos. That is not this film, not by a very long way.The film achieves so much. It's relentlessly warm and human - a middle- class audience, such as the one I was in at the 53rd London Film Festival, doesn't need to nod sagely and side with the protagonists as abstract figures representing a life of alternative fortune. There's too much to enjoy and synchronise with. Consequently, when the bad things happen they are spasm-in-the-auditorium shocking. Brilliant. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and Painful to Sit Though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I can see that this movie gets the attention that it does is the amazing acting and the pure shock value of poor inner city life. Story wise though Precious seems to be one long cliché. It's great to examine poor inner city life, but it can be done better than this.Take for example how the parents are painted as pure evil, while poor Precious is angelic, how can we not forgive her for not knowing what's appropriate? Teachers, social workers and so on are also inexplicably perfect as well as thin and/or white. Why do we have to have to have evil black archetypes and purely selfless saviors? It's unrealistic and a bit racist.Things just go from bad to worse to even worse, well that's quite sad but you can't cry the whole time you're watching this thing, so what's the point? Take away that and it's yet another Hollywood cliché of the unappreciated student and/or class that is reached by a special teacher. Where have we NOT seen that one before? OK the girl is fat, an important detail . OK her parents are horrible to her, every children's movie or fairy tale starts that way. She leads a rich fantasy life to escape daily trauma, again with the children's film parodies? OK she finally finds someone that understands and helps her fulfill her true potential despite parental influence. What is this a grimmer version of Roald Dahl's Matilda? A plot line that is meant for an 8 year old? I just don't get it.Skip this "Little Matchstick Girl" meets "Sister Act 2" tearjerker and go see a movie that tells a unique story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerhouse Performances Tower Over a Harrowing Yet Enthralling Tale of Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To my surprise, this soul-baring 2009 drama is neither as painful nor depressing as the subject matter would imply. In fact, director Lee Daniels' treatment alternates so fluently between gritty realism, social uplift, and fanciful episodes of fantasy that the end result is as much enthralling as it is emotionally draining. First-time screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher does a solid job adapting the 1996 source novel by Sapphire, "Push", but the strength and honesty of the cast is what sears in the memory. Daniels could have been otherwise charged with stunt casting had he not drawn out such powerhouse work from the out-of-left-field likes of comedienne Mo'Nique and pop diva Mariah Carey. Granted Daniels in his second directorial effort is not the most subtle of filmmakers (his first film was the strangely exotic "Shadowboxer"), but he does bring a level of florid passion that the subject desperately needs to alleviate the unrelenting bleakness of the title character's existence.Set in Harlem in 1987, the story centers on sixteen-year-old Claireece "Precious" Jones, a morbidly obese girl so void of self-worth that she refers to herself without irony as "ugly black grease to be washed from the street". Nearly illiterate, she finds herself pregnant for the second time by her father, and the school principal arranges to enroll Precious at an "alternative" institution. She recognizes this as an opportunity to better herself, but her mother Mary discourages it and forces Precious to apply for welfare. The unenviable mother-daughter relationship is the crux of the film, and it is here the film gives an unblinking account of monstrous physical and psychological abuse that explains the sharp contrast between Precious' inner and outer lives. On the outside, she is a forlorn yet formidable presence with a face so full that she can't express emotion without a great deal of effort. On the inside, she is loved and admired unconditionally. The two slowly come together at Precious' new school where she finds acceptance and redemption through a dedicated teacher (improbably named Blu Rain), who must get through to a classroom full of girls all disadvantaged in their own ways.The birth of Precious' son, along with the bonding she feels at school, signals a harrowing showdown between mother and daughter and ultimately a confrontation between Mary and Mrs. Weiss, the no-nonsense social worker who seeks the truth behind Precious' home life. In the title role, Gabourey Sidibe is ideally cast given the film's semi-documentary approach. An untrained actress, she is able to elicit empathy by giving herself completely to the inchoate character, and when Precious breaks down from the weight of yet another seemingly insurmountable development, Sidibe gives the scene a halting honesty. Paula Patton ("Swing Vote") gets to play the Sidney Poitier role of the elegantly transformative teacher as Ms. Rain, but she gives the too-good-to-be-true character a palpable sense of passion. As Mrs. Weiss, a role originally slated for Helen Mirren (who co-starred in Daniels' "Shadowboxer"), Mariah Carey, bereft of her glistening make-up and diva mannerisms, brings an audacious toughness to her smallish but pivotal role.However, it is Mo'Nique ("Phat Girlz") that gives the film's most shattering performance. I don't know what emotional reservoir she is tapping into, but she nails Mary with a fury so startling and realistic that it's impossible to trivialize the source of her villainy. She never compromises the hardness in her character, and her self-justifying monologue is an impressive piece of work. There is also solid work from a couple of other unusually cast performers, comedienne Sherri Shepherd (of the morning TV talkfest "The View") as a tough school administrator aptly named Cornrows and Lenny Kravitz as a sympathetic male nurse, and a scene-stealing turn from Xosha Roquemore as the ebullient Joann ("My favorite color is florescent beige"). Not all of Daniels' left-turn devices work, for instance, using Sophia Loren's "Two Women" as the basis of one of Precious' fantasies seems contrived given only a die-hard cineaste would understand the connection. Regardless, it's no wonder that Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry put their stamp of approval on the film as executive producers since Precious ultimately finds a personal triumph despite the hard life has dealt her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would think that the stereotypical African American welfare story has been done to bits, but, alas, Oprah Winfrey, and one of the producers of Monster's Ball have struck again.Precious, which is based on a controversial fictional 1996 book called Push, regards a poor, highly illiterate teenage mother living in Harlem, combating poverty, drug addicted father, who has impregnated her twice, and a highly abusive mother, who abuses her both physically, and mentally for "stealing her man" I found the stereotypes in this film to be highly offensive, and I think that this film will reinforce what most Americans feel about poor African Americans, even after our historical election last fall of the first African American president in history.My objection to this film once again lies with the stereotypical African American living in the ghetto. While it's admirable that the lead character is facing unsurmountable odds, it's also highly offensive to re-enforce negative stereotypes.All in all, I found this film to be overrated, offensive, and at times slow. This was like watching a Lifetime movie of the week mixed with harsh language and child abuse thrown in. I feel this movie is simply racist and stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been avoiding this movie because I just don't usually like having my emotions manipulated. However, there came a point when I had watched everything else available, so I gave it a shot. I do not want to spoil the movie, so I will tread lightly here. The whole movie, as expected, seems contrived to make you cry. They take a pitiful character, make terrible, terrible things happen to her, and then use that to explain away her bad behavior. Typical.With all the heavy hitters involved in production, mixed with the cameos, and the social commentary, taking into consideration the time of year that it was released, I would say it was purposed to win awards. In the end, as I already mentioned, is takes overly dramatic circumstances and throws them at you, and forces you to cry. The social commentary is awful. It pretty much says: excuse the awful acts committed by inner-city youths, they are a product of their environment. I gave it a one because I think we need to accept responsibility for our actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't try to deny my slight bias while I was watching this movie. To be in a theater among many movie enthusiasts, and most importantly the director of the film (Lee Daniels) and the author of the novel (Sapphire) will most certainly have an effect on your movie going experience. But not enough of a bias to effect whether or not the film is any good.Precious is the name of the protagonist, (played by Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe), a teenage girl who is one of the most harsh conditions upon our first meeting with her. She's pregnant for the second time to her own father's child, her mother (Monique) is an unstable and dangerously abusive woman, and she is unable to read and write. This is a terrible situation to be in, but Precious manages to live through it through her dreams, blocking out harsh memories with hopes of becoming a fashion model or a movie star. The story kicks off when Precious is invited to a special learning school, where the classroom is small and where she will be able to learn in a better environment.From this description of the plot, the film sounds tried. I was concerned for a brief moment while watching that this would be another "Stand and Deliver" or "Freedom Writers". We've all heard and seen these "problem stories" of inter-city kids who go to the top. For one, although the film briefly uses these classroom dynamic scenes, enough of the film is so unrelated we realize that comparing this film to those isn't fair. Precious is about a girl, not about a student or a classroom.Let me tell you up front: Precious isn't a problem movie (the kind of movie where things just get worse and worse, and then finally some solution is made). Despite how many obstacles are thrown at Precious, and believe me a whole lot are, the film is still entirely about who Precious is, and mostly, how she can raise her head high and keep going in all these loathsome situations. Director Lee Daniels (here I go with my bias of seeing it with the director) actually encouraged the audience to laugh, because there are a lot of humorous scenes, intertwined with some incredibly jarring ones. Unlike "Requiem for a Dream", which is such a depressing movie you are left with a bad taste in your mouth, Precious is actually a very positive film about how to stand through these trials of life. You will see scenes in this film that will irk you, but enough of the film is good-spirited and, dare I say, light, that leaving the film you will feel good about yourself, and with a positive outlook on your own life. It also makes one grateful for the fortunate situations we're all in, because I don't think anyone has it rougher than Precious in this film.This isn't a Slumdog Millionaire rags-to-riches story. Because the film only deals with about a year of her life, we don't see Precious win the million dollars or get into college. Any of that would just be cheesy. Instead, we see her trying to learn to write, being a single parent, and getting out of potentially dangerous situations. It adds for a fuller and richer film that feels more heartfelt.The directing is not some of the best ever, but it is of a high enough caliber that Lee Daniels deserves some praise this awards season. I think he will not have too much trouble getting a nomination. As for a win, I am not so sure (especially with my personal pick Kathryn Bigelow). My only complaint is some jerky hand-held for one or two scenes, but that's not enough to defer from the great things he does. The acting and the screenplay of this film are exactly the type of Oscar-winning pieces you can name. Monique as an abusive mother is downright scary for a long time, but soon she actually makes us empathetic toward such a monster. I have no doubt in her chances of getting a nomination, and as of now she is my pick for the win. As for Gabby Sidibe: she's very good, but it all depends on who the competition is.The screenplay is brilliant, never feeling slow or rushed. The pacing of this film is steady enough that we're engrossed the entire time. Watch out for smaller roles by Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz, both of whom appear briefly (without any make-up or nice clothing). So far, Precious is sweeping the festivals and is looking like it's on a road to Oscar glory, and well deserved. The film opens in NY and LA on November 6th, and will be in theaters everywhere by November 20th. Be sure to make a point of seeing this film.My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly moving, patiently directed American movie the likes of which we rarely get treated to anymore. The word 'Precious' certainly does take on it's original meaning after seeing this story unfold. Just when I think 'the movies' have lost their last bit of integrity, a movie like this comes along as though to say 'don't worry, it's still an art form'. As for Mo'Nique... well... I wonder what she'll say in her acceptance speeches? Brava, brava, brava. And Mariah's performance is outstanding and deeply surprising as well.I can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Brutal, Emotionally Wrenching Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, thank God that this doesn't claim to be "based on" or "inspired by" a true story. That would be too much to take, because this is truly the most brutal movie I have ever seen - brutal not in quality but in content. As Precious deals with her mother's ongoing and relentless abuse (both physical and verbal) you find yourself almost in tears. As she has flashbacks to the sexual abuse she endured at the hands of her father you just need to turn your head away for a while and catch your breath. It's brutal. It doesn't claim to be based on a true story. You hope it's an exaggeration. You wish it doesn't happen. And, somehow, somewhere, deep within you know there are young kids enduring this type of abuse on a daily basis. So, the movie definitely gets an emotional reaction from the viewer, and deserves credit for that. But let's think about the content.As brutal and emotionally draining as it is, the story is at times lacking. Perhaps the flashbacks and fantasies are a bit too much, so that you're not always sure of the reality of what you're watching. You have to like Gabourey Sidibe's performance as Precious. Her absolutely unfeeling reactions to her mother struck me as the sort of reaction an abused child would have. For an inexperienced newcomer, her performance was great. An Oscar nomination? I'm not sure to be honest. One of the biggest problems I had with her was that I often had trouble understanding what she was saying. Maybe it was the character - Precious being uneducated and abused, so she mumbled a lot as if she really didn't want to be heard. Perhaps there's some reality to that, but it's frustrating from the perspective of watching the movie and wanting to hear the dialogue. I thought the confrontation with her mother in the social worker's office was well done. It seemed the logical climax to the movie as the mother is confronted with the evils that happened to Precious at her hands and at the hands of her boyfriend. I loved the fact that Precious walked away and left her behind. I was also a little confused, though. She walked away with 2 kids - one with Down's Syndrome? As she said herself, she's still only reading at a junior high school level. Sure. "Then high school. Then college." She has dreams. That's great. But she's not living in the "then" - she's living in the "now." How is she going to care for two kids? As the movie ended, I was worried about them.It really is a brutal, emotionally wrenching movie. It's not a movie I would watch twice. It's full of horrendous abuse and some of the most sustained and foulest language I've ever heard in a movie. It deserves a lot of credit. But it's also not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Gollem died for his "precious" by falling into the fire he was dying for a scam. This Precious is a scam too, money and fame thrown at this movie and it still looks like it was made by my 12yr old with her $100 camera. The plot looks like something my 9yr old made by turning pages of a encyclopaedia and coming up with every bad thing that can happen to a child and adult and making a movie. Oprah loves a good child abuse movie and this one must remind her of her very own show pony the colour purple. Yeah we all know Oprah was abused and so was I- the difference between us is that I'm living in the real world now and I'm not obese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very curious about this movie since it was praised a lot. I was expecting a performance that is so great and a story that is so emotional. May be I expected too much or my emotions are not strong enough to understand this movie but I didn't find it good. Actually, I found it bad to be more precise. There was certainly nothing special about the acting, the story is boring and disturbing, the message is totally unclear and directing is just OK. If I had seen this on TV, I would change the channel in two minutes but I watched it till the end to see whether something will happen. It ended as it started, pointless and boring. I was really surprised by the Oscar awards this year. I had seen all the movies expect this one but this is even worse than the rest of the garbage. Save yourself, don't watch it. If you are forced to watch it, may the patience be with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched the trailer for this movie I was enticed. After watching it, I feel as though it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I don't have a lot of technical knowledge of how a movie is created so I'm not sure who would be to blame...perhaps the screenplay creator? The acting and directing was good but the movie itself was more like a short story that left me feeling worse for having watched it. If I compared it to Titanic, the movie would have started with hitting the iceberg and ended with Jack drowning. Sad, miserable, depressing, no hope or inspiration whatsoever. If I compared it to Hurricane, he would still be in jail and all the scenes would be of his ordeal in jail. No matter how horrible the topic is, a good movie must take you through a range of emotions because that is how life works. This movie did none of that.I liked the characters of the students and teacher and was waiting for some spark of greatness - or anything! I hated the shaky camera (don't directors understand how difficult it is to watch a movie like this?) One director does it, so now they all have to do it. If I was in a theatre I would have asked to get my money back, this movie was that bad. I wish I had never seen it.</fullReview>

And then I thought ,"It's a not a movie! It's one of them TV Shows about who was the father of a child with DNA results in the end. I didn't know at the time that Oprah Winfrey had something to do with producing. It says it all. Good acting? Give me a break! The girl's mother was the only who did any acting.

		<shortDescription>A vicious cautionary tale. Deeply depressing but oh so realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just seeing the trailer for this movie, I was blown away by the striking realism of lead actress Gabourey Sidibe's performance. The entire trailer radiated PAIN. I thought this movie was going to be heavy, dramatic, and depressing - but it took it all so much further than I could have expected. First of all, I would recommend this movie to just about anyone - but only if you can handle and take something from movies that are utterly disturbing in their depiction of a realistic CRAP LIFE. This is one of those movies that just does not let up. We've seen this a lot with dark comedies this decade - from directors like the Coen Brothers, but through those movies we are mostly laughing at the unfortunate events - this time around, we wish we could help but for people in these kind of dark holes, there is nothing we can do to help without damaging ourselves in our attempt to be saint-like.Mo'Nique shows a new side of herself in her performance as the most disgustingly terrible mother you'd never want as your own. I hope Mo'Nique gets offered more serious roles in dramatic movies after this because god damn she deserves it. She was THE WORST PERSON... EVER!!!! I HATE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!! How dare you treat PRECIOUS LIKE THAT!!!! WE HATE YOU!!!!I've never seen PIGS FEET used so effectively in a movie! So disgusting!!!There are no weak cast members - everyone portrays an entertaining, realistic, and believable character in this 80's NYC setting. Even Mariah Carey shows up as the welfare counseler and for once she puts on a worthy performance. Alternative school teacher Ms. Blu Rain (what an awesome name) - also ends up being a very memorable and lovable character, seen almost as the angelic being in the end.While I was thoroughly entertained throughout, I did feel like there were certain segments that were a little dragged out. Lots of shots of Precious walking around in slow motion for basically no reason. Whatever. I enjoy segments like this personally so it didn't bother me. Nice to create places to squeeze good music into your film. This was perhaps the only flaw of the film in general though. The movie was lengthy because of the drawn out scenes but it was a worthy ride.This one's definitely gonna be making my top 10 list this year. A surprise gem out of nowhere. I've never even thought about giant black girls raised into terrible life situations wishing they were a skinny blonde white woman. Now I know there's got to be a lot of them out there... Aside from that, mothers like hers belong in prison or dead. PRECIOUS is just a reminder... a warning... an effective cautionary tale... PRECIOUS deserves better. Precious deserves on Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is hard. Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that might make some people a little uneasy. It deals with family abuse in the form of rape, physical and verbal violence. The one character it follows is Precious, an overweight illiterate teenage girl who is pregnant with her second child from her biological father. She is kicked out of her school because of her pregnancy and is enrolled in another educational institution called each one teach one. She wants to do better things, but doesn't have the will or motivation because of the constant abuse at the hands of her mother. She day dreams about being a big star and getting out of the hellish life she lives.The film is raw with the material and doesn't really hold any punches. Lee Daniels second feature film shows vast improvement over the messy Shadowboxer starring Cuba good Jr. His grasp of the material and dedication to have the story be told is evident in his attention to translate the novel to screen. Daniels has put together a cast that care about the subject matter and the story as much as he does and is surrounded by the talent that is needed to pull it off. Gabourey Sidibe is Precious, the troubled teen wanting more out of life. She shines in her first starring role and it's no walk in the park for her. The role demanded talent and Sidibe delivers what is needed. Of course the one who stands out the most is Mo'Nique earning herself a much deserved Oscar for her role as the abusive and sloth ridden mother. Her confrontation with her daughter after the birth of the second child is intense and will have you holding your breath in fear for the safety of the child. Precious is a film that is driven by a strong story and an emotional cast that cares about the work they are doing. It's a glimmer of hope that keeps the story moving in a world that is hard edged and usually leads nowhere. It's not a relatively long film, but I did find myself checking my watch every now and then and some bits in the film happen without much clarification. Where did that one white boy come from in her Each One Teach One class? In any event, the final product is a good film with a message about hope and Tyler Perry finally has his name attached to something good in his career (Star Trek not included).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was attracted to this movie by the rave reviews and Oscar nominations it has got. A true touching story of a section of society in America which is realizing its potential.The movie starts with Claireece "Precious" Jones the lead character, in the school where she has been suspended as she is pregnant with her second child at the age of 16. Precious lives in a world of her own though she is living in a dreadful condition. She forgets her misery by disguising it with her dreams of having a charming boyfriend and living a celebrity life. The movie depicts her struggle to deliver the second child, the realization of the purpose of life and living it on her own terms.The summary of the movie is "Life is what we define it to be and not what we are made to live".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The life of an abused and poor teen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than a few items glanced at in the newspaper, I had no idea the intricate details of this movie, and went in hoping for something different. Alas, the first hour was not much of anything at all. And I wonder if the movie would have done so well if not for the purse strings and names of 2 of its executive producers. That aside, the story revolves around a 16-year-old living in Harlem in the 1970s. She is pregnant, for the 2nd time, by her father. Her mother is one in a long line of selfish, self-absorbed ignorant people, and played, by the way perfectly, by Mo'Nique. The last scene with Mo'Nique makes sitting through this boring film worth it. And yes, it was boring. But what frustrated me the most is that when actors are mumbling, as more and more are doing in movies, there is too much background noise (music in this movie), so it's difficult to understand what the character is saying. This was a major problem for me with this film. I would have so loved to hear what Precious was saying, in her own way, but she mumbled, talked street while also mumbling, and a lot of it was just drowned out. Just the same, I was ready to turn the movie off, but decided to stick it out. After the 1st hour it began to move as something was actually happening, and get more interesting until the somewhat climax at the end in the social worker's office (played okay by Carey). Yes, people lived like this, and still do. Children are abused, and in so many ways. The system can only do so much. And there are people who try to cheat the system, as the mother kept trying to do. Not as much drama as hyped, and some of the acting seemed forced. Did I miss something?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to go into a long, drawn out synopsis of the film. Many reviewers have done that already.I will say that I am shocked at the leaping reviews - touting this film as "amazing".Quite frankly, it isn't.After the film credits roll, you are left feeling uneasy, depressed, alone, and sad. To what end was the purpose? If you remember watching "Requiem For a Dream", perhaps one of the most depressing films ever, you are left with a stomach wrenching uneasiness that sticks with you for days. The thing is, the visceral emotions that you felt after seeing Requiem are overshadowed by complex story, AMAZING film-making, and such a unique take on the destruction of the 4 character's lives. Precious elicits much of the same emotions, but has NONE of the payoff. The audience is meant to feel sad, the story couldn't be more straightforward, sure there were a few moments of attempted humor - but when the majority of the crowd starts scoffing at what are suppose to be some of the most "intense" serious moments - you know something went wrong. Does this film bring anything new to light? No. Is it an original, shocking social commentary? Hardly. The filmmakers want you to cry, for the sake of crying - that is all.There will be thousands of people who disregard this review for the sole purpose of the backing that this film has received (Oprah + Tyler Perry) and I am sure hoards of "great" reviews will follow just has they have preceded this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire' is a film typical of this time of year; award season.Unfortunately, that's the only reason Lee Daniels made this picture; to scoop sympathetic awards from the Oscar and Golden Globe panels.'Precious' is a shallow, cold-hearted film that basically a two-hour advert for child abuse, it's a sick way to guilt-trip Western audiences into donating money to charities and other money-squeezing organizations.They even had the cheek to get Oprah Winfrey to present the film which tells the audience only one thing; we want your money.It's a disgusting picture that deserves no awards and no praise. It's utter self-obsessed rubbish that made me angry to watch, it makes the audience feel responsible for Precious' appalling lifestyle.Admittedly, it's very well performed, Mo'Nique is quite extraordinary but she doesn't deserve the Oscar, that should go to Anna Kendrick for 'Up in the Air', but sadly that won't happen.And what's up all this stuff about it being uplifting and heart-warming? Have you actually watched the film? She's obese, illiterate, a victim of incest rape, pregnant, beaten, and she gets AIDS? Yeah, mega uplifting. It's hardly believable too.All in all, I really don't get why people are raving this film so much, it's long-winded, dire, depressing and frustrating.The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the performances.Just diabolical.</fullReview>

All the while, being at a "diet school", she was wondering why she kept gaining weight! LOL! Her mother, Mary, is played by Mo'Nique, who really plays the role to a T. Being her usual witty self, she fills the role with sometimes dry and sometimes "in your face" jokes and verbal sleight-of-hand. Mo'Nique just being Mo'Nique, I guess!

Gabourey Sidibe gives such a strong performance and makes you want to hold her tight and rock her in your arms. Mo'Nique's performance is so visceral that it stays with you long after the film ends. It's hard to write a review for this film without going into specifics about the plot (don't worry, no spoilers coming...) because the story is so raw that it evokes so many emotions. It is not a story for everyone as a result as it is too confronting for everyone. I thought it tackled the issues directly and Lee Daniels is a brave man indeed for creating a film that didn't allow us to turn away. Highly recommended but be warned, it will linger in your minds for a long time following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We were bowled over reading the original novel, "Push" by Sapphire, when it was first published. The story of Precious, a sexually abused young woman, from her own father, an individual that must have been a monster to even think of what he was doing to an innocent child, that went on for years, is nothing short of inhuman. That Precious was also the object of physical and verbal abuse from her own mother, was a double whammy. The fact that Precious father had the HIV virus and infected his own daughter is a despicable crime that no human being should ever have to face.We were impressed the first time we saw the film, when it was released commercially, but did not comment on it. On second viewing, the film is just as powerful as it was then. This account of sexual abuse and cruelty to a young woman, deserves to be seen by a wider audience. There is no doubt in our minds there are plenty of other cases of this nature that do not come to the surface as often as it should. It is, after all, a serious matter that many are not willing to deal with it because of its repulsive nature.Lee Daniels, the director, working with the Geoffrey Fletcher's adaptation, made a realistic account of this human disgrace that is hard to sit through, at times. Yet, Precious is not a defeated woman. It is to her credit that she gets over and beyond the life she had with her mother, and is a better individual when all is said and done. Nothing seems to get this resolute girl into defeat. Gaboury Sibide, who plays Precious, is a new face for us. Her take on the character shows an understanding of the girl with hopes and aspirations that are taken away from her since childhood. Yet, Precious is a graceful young woman without the bitterness of her own experience. The revelation of this film was the casting of Mo'Nique, as the cruel Mary, a mother from hell, no child ever deserves. Mo'Nique merited all the awards she got because her appearance in this film was something that seldom is seen in films.The ensemble cast is good. Mariah Carey, the popular singer, was another asset for the movie. Gone was the glamour and glitter, normally associated with the singing star as she gets into her Mrs. Weiss with relish. Paula Patton, who appeared as Ms. Rain, showed how patience and kindness could work wonders in motivating troubled teens into aspiring to do much better.</fullReview>

This movie is not for the weak hearted who are bothered by reality checks that so so many children are in abusive families like this. Lee Daniels offers a brutal yet realistic look into young Precious's life which as i said earlier is not a very nice life . A lot of reviews i have read on this film state that its over the top violent and unnecessary, why is it un necessary that people will may e see this film and then go back to their jobs within child services in some of the projects and pick up their game, or politicians for that matter?

I was quite pleasantly surprised that I immediately found myself so emotionally wrapped up in this film that I found the fantasy breaks a respite from the overflow of feelings; obviously that's what Precious was feeling at the moments she broke into fantastic reveries during some of the most spiritually crushing moments.I can't say I know it's "easy" to portray a pained, abused teenager with no way out, but I also was not surprised at the authenticity of Sidibe's performance. Even her picture on the cover of the DVD case speaks volumes about the facade she must keep up in order to make it, to survive, to keep her children alive; to be a woman. It's ineffable.However, the most outstanding aspect of this entire movie, for me, was Mo'Nique's portrayal. I am speechless. I can't stand her on stage. I think her talk show is ridiculous and smacks of pure buffoonery. Her performance in "Precious", however, was amazing. The climactic scene is really at the end where we finally get a glimpse into her psychosis and understand it's heredity and the root of its perpetuation. Despite the horrific nature of everything single thing she did, you had to find yourself in her shoes, asking the very same questions she asked herself. It was brilliant and masterful and, quite frankly, I didn't think Mo'Nique had it in her.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - especially Nurse John :). Well done, Lee Daniels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing and reading so many reviews about this film, I was actually looking forward to seeing it. It appeared to offer an insight into the lives led by that class of person marginalised through discrimination and poverty. Did the film deliver on that promise? I'm afraid not. There were too many stereotypes and poorly worked themes that the whole was a mere parody of the subject matter. The selection of Gabourey Sidibe in the lead role was inspired - or perhaps lucky (for the Director) as she conveys most believably the schizoid and much put upon Precious Jones. The other characters had a tendency to appear two-dimensional and mere caricatures of far more complex individuals. I had difficulty understanding the slang and truly wished there'd been subtitles - after all the title was subtitled in slang! why not allow us to understand everything? A good instructional film for social work and counsellor trainees, not entertainment for a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies that push it and show the dark side and psychology in human interaction without sugarcoating it. Precious has some really interesting premises for sure but as the story behind the main character unfolds it just gets more and more until its just too much and feels like a cartoon.We are talking about a grotesquely obese illiterate black teen growing up in the worst conditions. She is pregnant with her second child which she got from her own father who repeatedly raped her. Her mother is abusive, keeps depriving her of self worth and makes her eat. Could be a psychological study but they just keep layering everything until you wonder if this is a joke. Her mother seems to sexually abuse her too, she treats her first child like an animal because the girl has down syndrome. It goes on like that, spices everything up with her father dying and her finding out he was HIV positive right when she is trying to turn her life around with her second child and her learning progressing in a new school. Come on... subtlety is really lost on this movie and honestly I thing a lot of things just don't add up in the behavior of her mother who is depicted like the devil himself until a final breakdown.Precious sure is not a bad movie but if you touch on subjects like this and go about it like you are trying to top of the previous SAW movies with new sick inventions it just hurts the premise. Its a totally average movie and it gets down to this when you see how people her either call it "best of all time" or "worst movie ever".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The longest journey begins with a single step". This Lao-tzu quote seems to provide the framework for the theme of this Sundance Grand Jury prize and Audience Award winning film about a young woman in an impossible situation and her determination to push through it all, breaking free from the stereotypes that plague her, the past that haunts her and her mother's abusive control over her. Only two of the 18 feature-length films that I viewed at Sundance received a standing ovation, and this was one of them. With a breakout, award-winning performance by Mo'Nique and an outstanding performance by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe, this film is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching this movie overall. It's often interesting watching or learning about traumatized people around the world. It's a part of the world a danish girl like me don't know much about. Unfortunately as I got along into this movie, it just became too much. It's just the worst of the worst family she's from and it's so typical for American movies. It's like they have to portrait the worst of all cases to show that some people live hard lives. Maybe her mother didn't beat her up and only her father abused her. she'd still be traumatized. just by living in that neighborhood, being poor, would be traumatizing. but they just HAVE to go all the way.The lines between good and evil are, as usual in many psychological American movies, way too sharp. This person is good, this person is bad, this person was bad, but saw her mistakes. Its just too unsubtle and unsophisticated for me. It's unrealistic.I'm not saying the facts are wrong, that nobody goes through this out there. because there are. but her way of showing this is too superficial. I don't know if it's the script or the acting. Probably just a little bit of it all. To me she far from acts like somebody who's been beaten up and raped almost her whole life. If that was what had really been done to her she would be much more marked by it. Social heritage is much harder to break than this. But I guess some movie-makers just can't accept that you can't portray a girl moving on from this, in 2 hours of movie. American directors should watch some European movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that is about being vulgar, hateful, and worthless. It in no way is an inspiration to anyone. There are people out there that live this way, but why promote it as a way of life? There needs to be more family friendly movies instead of this kind of garbage that actually perpetuates damaged families and their lack of importance to each other. Some families are broken as shown in this movie, but unfortunately, those same families will walk away from watching this movie feeling vindicated in living this lifestyle rather than seeing this as an embarrassment to their lifestyle. I have known people like this in my lifetime, and they would completely take this as, "...yep, this is my life and there's nothing wrong with it; they even made a movie about it." I HATED this movie. I want to bring good values to my family and friends. I don't want to validate this stuff. I don't want to ignore it and pretend that it doesn't exist, but it's better to help people who are like this than to make a glorified movie about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has redeemed Mr. Daniels in my eyes. He has created a great story that is well executed. Almost all the pieces fall together. As a Sundance festival-goer I overheard said, "It's an awesome film, but not perfect"The good: 1. Story! Wow. This is filmaking with heart 2. The filmmaker figured out how to use violence and sex as part of the story and make it work in a way that is consistent with the film (unlike his last effort, shadowboxer) 3. Performances. Holy cow, who knew Mariah and Monique could ACT! Also the star, Gabby, an unknown actor found in Harlem, is PERFECT. Someone in the audience asked Monique what she was going to wear to the Oscars, this was not unwarranted.The bad: 1. The teacher, played by Paula Patton is atrocious and almost ruins the film. She is just too excited and not believable. Bad casting and terrible acting. I'm sure lee did the best he could with her. 2. Quirky fantasy world sequences feel out of place at times. I actually like most of them and think they work in concept, its just they aren't used consistently throughout the film. I think this can still be fixed with some editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't decide.I will say this: Precious' mom isn't unique to Harlem or the black community. as someone with a significantly different background, I found myself nodding and shuddering at turns.some will say that it is too much bad to happen to one person. but it's the vulnerable ones who are most open to this sort of abuse.I read around the internet such opinions as, "the inner cities are beyond repair, there is no hope for them, for the people who live there". this is some sort of political statement I imagine. but I would assert Precious' experience is a quintessentially American one; the America I know, after all, the America of enormous racial and economic inequality. Hollywood doesn't like to focus on this aspect of our society considering it not very interesting or likely to induce guilt in the upper-middle class folk most likely to buy movie tickets. but watching precious helped me feel vindicated: "here, at last," I said to myself, "is someone telling my story".what *is* inaccurate is the portrayal of social workers as generally helpful or even moderately well-meaning people. this is blatantly false. the role of the social worker is that of an auditor; my experience with them is that they have nothing but contempt for the people who they are hired to help.of course precious was right in the end. what could the nice lady do for her? but at least her heart was in the right place.the problem with America isn't the inner cities but an utter lack of love, compassion, understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like "Precious..." but I didn't. There aren't that many movies about the dysfunctional life of a teenage African American girl living in poverty, so I was ready to like the movie. However, I didn't like the movie primarily because I never took to the main character. She just wasn't that likable. Sure, the movie had realism; there are probably thousands of young black girls like Precious all across the country. But what is real isn't necessarily enjoyable cinema. I wouldn't want to watch a movie about a real open heart surgery either. The actress portraying Precious was very good but the script was too depressing. I found myself staring at my watch after the first hour wondering how much longer the movie would run. Not a good sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right, let's boil the whole sorry story down into one sentence: monstrously obese, poor and illiterate black girl with a schizophrenic mother and an abusive father, contemplates her sorry lot for two hours, is made pregnant by her father and is diagnosed HIV-positive. The End.I must admit that I didn't like "Precious" ? it felt forced, belabored and sanctimonious; right down to the fiddles (which are employed to signal that a scene is extra-dramatic, in case you wouldn't notice it in time). It made me think about messages and social-issues that the producers of "Precious" seemed to be intent to cram down our throats, like one would force-feed a Christmas duck.It made me think about other shows and movies dealing with African-American issues and stories, such as "Roots" or "Boyz n the Hood", thinking that if that's how far it had come, all the way to "Precious", then we deal with a lost cause. I was thinking about a movie with similar issues, though not concentrating on one ethnicity alone, namely Larry Clarks "Kids" and how much more neutral (hence without patronizing the viewer) Clark had produced his movie.It made me think about dignity, wondering where it had gone, and the answer wasn't pretty: right down to the "Jerry Springer"- and "Oprah"-Shows, that's where it has gone.At the end, I felt embarrassed, even insulted. What had I just watched? The celebration of a freak-show or the modern answer to a traveling carnival, where the spectator can feel both revulsion and pity for the "Elephant Man"? What had the producers intended me to feel? There's a fine line between feeling sorry, pity and disgust; like one where a homeless person starts to cling on your leg and pity turns into disgust.However, there was a very pivotal, central scene that, in my opinion, summoned the whole concept and predicament of "Precious". There comes a moment where the protagonist self-reflects, wondering whether and why people may watch something more worthwhile. It is this scene where Precious asks her teacher: "Do you ever watch 'Oprah'?" Yes, people watch shows like "Oprah" and movies like "Precious", feeling that they did something else but to waste 'precious' time. Yes, people eat sugared garbage at fast-food-joints and mistake it for good food. Listen to crap music and think of it as fine art. Etc.At least that is the message that "Precious" had in my mind ? and still cannot bring myself to say that it was a "good" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow-moving, disturbingly depressing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this film a few days ago, seeing as most of my friends raved about it. i was eager to see what i was expecting to be a heart-wrenching, powerful, life changing story that flowed with a strong story line and well thought out characters...I was horribly disappointed.This film moved incredibly slow. There was an array of irrelevant scenes that could have easily been cut. I was 30 minutes in and i already wanted to shut it off. I felt as though i had wasted 30 minutes of my life watching Gabourey Sidibe get out of bed, make breakfast, go to school, walk home, eat, bed etc etc. There is the occasional narration by Precious, basically pointing out the blatantly obvious in every scene. It has no flow, no captivating moments, just blah.The reason i am giving it a 5/10 is for the acting. Mo'Nique who plays Mary, Precious' painfully abusing mother was the star of the show. This transformation was incredible as she was convincing and wickedly good. Gabouret Sidibe did a wonderful job as the 'down-and-out' abused teen. She was believable and carried most of the film well on her own.I may seem harsh but this film really irked me. It is definitely an acquired taste. If you like to watch depressing, dismally discouraging movies than Precious is the one for you. I however, prefer to walk away from a film, not feeling as though life is hopeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire" (which owes its unwieldy name to marketing) is the story of an obese, illiterate Harlem teenager who's pregnant with her second child (by her father, no less). However, when an arrangement is made for her to enroll in an alternative school she begins to see at least a faint glimmer of hope in her life.The title character, Claireece Precious Jones, is played by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe. However, she shows no signs of inexperience as she ably handles this multi-faceted role. Although supporting actress Mo'Nique was the one who walked home with an Oscar (a not undeserved Oscar, I'd say) I think that Sidibe's performance was actually the better of the two. Besides these two, the cast is capable and authentic, with Paula Patton faring the best of the rest.Lee Daniels' past credits are mostly in production but he shows a deft touch with his direction here. His stylistic choices breathe life into a story that could have grown monotonous with a more pedestrian approach. The soundtrack is also appealing, even to a non-urban individual like myself.In the end, "Precious" succeeds mainly due to the pair of highly acclaimed performances at the centre of the picture. The story balances its harsher elements with an inspirational vibe, though I wouldn't exactly call it a feel good movie. Add to that the attractive visuals and you've got a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective But Strangely Abstract Representation of Hell on Earth for Some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself strangely unmoved by "Precious," director Lee Daniels' breakout film about a young black woman with just about every conceivable card stacked against her who nevertheless finds the reserves within herself to go about forging a better life. I think my reaction has largely to do with the fact that I found Precious's life and the everyday horrors it contains -- horrors that include a physically, verbally and emotionally abusive mother; rape by her father resulting in two pregnancies; and by the time the film is over a diagnosis of HIV in a time when AIDS wasn't as successfully treated as it is now -- so momentous that they remained largely abstract. All of these horrors exist in the world, and I'm sure there are people who must deal with all of them at once, but the film presents them as a kind of pile-up derby of every bad thing that can happen to someone, and they all happen to our protagonist.It doesn't help that virtually every other character represents more of an idea than an actual person. Mo'Nique delivers a one-note performance as the mother from hell -- effective? Sure. But completely believable? Not so much. And the characters who are good to Precious suffer from some of the same problems. I believed in them in context of the film, but less so when I stepped back and started to think of them afterwards.Which is a testament more than anything to the power of the performances. There's not a bad one to be found, and if characters sometimes stretch the boundaries of credibility, it's because they're written and directed to, not because the actors make missteps in portraying them. Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique received all of the acclaim, but Paula Patton, as a teacher who sees Precious's potential, and Mariah Carey (who knew?) in a small but powerful role as a social worker, stood out for me.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious may be one of the hardest movies ever to watch but it is one of the most realistic, gritty, down-to-earth dramas I have ever encountered. Set in 1987 in Harlem lives a girl whose name is Claireece 'Precious' Jones who is a sixteen-year-old born and living a life which could only be imaginable in your worst nightmares. She's pregnant for the second time by her father who has vanished off the face of the earth and her mother, who is an evil woman, abuses her mentally and physically and makes Precious wait on her hand and foot. She is offered a place in an 'alternative' school called Each One/Teach One. Precious doesn't know what this means but she feels that it's the moment she's been waiting for. In the classroom taught by Ms. Blu Rain and students who quickly befriends Precious, she starts to travel down the road from hopelessness and pain to love, friendship and self-confidence.Phenomenal movie. Some people may not be able to watch some scenes because it is a little disturbing. The story is just so real and powerful and sends a message of hope and light at the end of the tunnel. The plot was superb and the acting had absolutely no faults, Mo'Nique who played the evil mother and Gabourney Sidibe as Precious should both receive so many awards for their performances as they were so convincing as their characters. You really cared for Precious and you gave your heart out to her after witnessing her pain, troubles and woes through her life. The cast and crew really should give themselves a pat on the back for this sensational movie.I loved every second of this movie and really enjoyed watching it as I got engrossed in the movie and hoped that Precious would get the life she deserved. I think everyone should watch this.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is an edgy,inner city drama,set in the late 1980's in Harlem, New York. The story concerns Claireece 'Precious' Jones (played by relative new comer,Gabourey 'Gaby'Sidibe),a 17 year old girl,for whom life is just one never ending dumping ground (she is morbidly obese,she can barely read,and is constantly abused by her harsh,foul mouthed mother,played by pop singer,Mo'Nique,as well as by her step father,who sexually abuses her on a regular basis,and has already had one Down's Syndrome baby with &amp; his pregnant with her second child). To make matter worse,she's been kicked out of the middle school she is attending. Precious gets the open window of opportunity to attend an alternative school to try &amp; make something of herself. Precious seems to live in a fantasy world,all her own (obviously to temporarily escape the Hell on Earth that is life,itself). While in her new school, she is assigned to a teacher,Ms. Rain (played by Paula Patton) who seems to believe in Precious (as Precious has nothing but the lowest in self esteem). Will Precious pull herself out of the dark void of despair &amp; make good for herself? Lee Daniels directs from a very well written screenplay by Geoffrey Fletcher,from the novel by Sapphire (who has a cameo in the film). The rest of the cast is rounded out by the likes of Mariah Carey,as Mrs.Weiss,a social worker at the Welfare Office,who seems to have risen from the smoldering wreckage of her previous attempts in film (does anybody really want to remember 'Sparkle'?),and rocker, Lenny Kravitz,as Nurse John,who Precious seems to take a fancy to. The rest of the cast,relative unknowns,turn in real fine performances. What I admired about this film was the cinematography of Andrew Dunn, who's hand held camera work reminded me of some of the Dogme films from a few years ago (what ever did happen to the Dogme series?). This is a grim,gritty &amp; somewhat depressing,albeit powerful film that goes for the heart strings,as well as the jugular vein,alternatively. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains unpleasant child abuse,strong sexual content (including statutory rape references),pervasive strong language,smoking &amp; other material that is not recommended for young viewers.</fullReview>

Mary, her mother in the movie played by Mo'Nique, should be up for an Oscar for a strong performance.Look out Halle Berry, Paula Patton is on the screen. She may from now on strongly compete for your jobs. Solid actress and smoking hot. Even Mariah Carey does an excellent job in the movie as Precious' case worker.This is definitely a movie too see.

		<shortDescription>The Insider's Perspective Conceived by Outsiders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have two focal points in this review (more like a commentary)- realism and the message.Realism.In my opinion, it's not real nor powerful enough. Even for an outsider like me, it becomes apparent that the story is too contrived to provide a truly accurate view into inner-city life. It's as if the writers wanted to jam every headline issue with the inner-city into the lives of a few characters: welfare fraud, incest, drugs, rape, delinquency, juvenile crime, obesity, illiteracy, behavioral issues in the public school system, single mother parenting, inept social workers, homosexuality, the AIDS epidemic, etc. Because it is so overwhelming, it becomes immediately apparent that everything was carefully crafted to illustrate each issue in living color. Precious bears under ALL of this with superhuman resolve, only to plaintively cry near the end "I'm so tired!" So, rather than seeing the life of a real, plausible girl, we're seeing talking points, an agenda acted out on the screen, like a power-point presentation filled with bullet points, slide after slide, example after example.The casting makes this even more apparent. Why Monique? Why Mariah Carey? Why Lenny Kravitz? Sure, they're unrecognizable during the movie. But if you didn't know then, you will afterward and it will make you think. And you'll see that the director chose these people BECAUSE they were not from the hood. In fact, they are from the completely opposite spectrum. It's as if to say to the audience ever so subtly if not during the movie then afterward, "don't freak out, these people are actors, these are NOT real people!" You'll see interviews of these cast members about how they "transformed" themselves and had to strip away many layers of their identity to perform their roles, only to read that after making the movie, they ran as fast as they could back to their glitzy lives, like a diver desperately coming up for air. So not even do the actors, who made this movie to champion the cause of the inner-city, want to have anything to do with the inner-city. It borders on hypocritical.The Message.The message is simple. Inner-city girls have potential to be strong and shed the social issues that seek to victimize them. It just takes a caring individual to awaken and develop that potential. Stop throwing money at the problem or thinking that broad-based measures are the ultimate solution. The change happens one-on-one. It takes a life to save a life. The message is one that rings true to me, but it is hardly new and has been done better in other movies.But, annoyingly, there are other messages that coddle stereotypes and even undermine the thrust of the movie. The "good guys" in the movie are fair-skinned, slender, and beautiful. The ones needing salvation or redemption are obese, dark-skinned, and generally, ugly. The good guys speak perfect or near perfect English, without any accent.The characters themselves have no real articulated hopes. Precious's defense mechanism of flashing to visions of enjoying a vaunted celebrity lifestyle during times of duress is obviously not a picture of her true aspirations, it's just a regurgitation of what's been fed to her through the media. She wants a boyfriend, but what teenage girl doesn't? The movie insists, she wants to learn to read and write. But, why? Literacy is good, but it is by no means a panacea. So, Precious is really a very shallow teen. OK, nothing new here. So, what does the movie really want for Precious?The movie never really tells us. Nor does it give us any plausible clues as to how this girl, now made a representative of the worst of the inner-city, can better her situation. It doesn't give us any indication as to why Precious would want anything other than to be just another single mother living in Harlem, albeit one that is not as bad as her mother and who can read to her children.At the highest level, I feel like the movie advances a black agenda at its foundation that says, blacks are a strong, intelligent people and we can help ourselves. But, ultimately, what is the endpoint of literacy and education in general if not to get into college and to become employed in a market system that is mostly white-dominated? What is the point of trying to get black kids to read if the resistance to education by the poor black community is rooted in the lack of trust in a white- dominated market society, and the belief that it wouldn't matter anyway because they'd be discriminated against? The movie rails against welfare dependence, yet it doesn't address the realities of making it in a white-dominated society where blacks have to play by their rules and must work with them on the race issues. By the time the movie ends, you're wondering, "that's it?" There's no real resolution, no payoff. And by implication, the many real-world issues that the movie painstakingly depicts are given no real resolution or payoff, either. You feel stuck in the 1980's, as if you've even gone backwards.Overall, the movie tries hard to do something to educate the viewer and to bring some sense of hope and vindication. To perhaps the most out- of-touch white suburbanite soccer mom who thinks all inner-city blacks are hopeless crack heads, this movie might be a revelation, but, to this viewer who is more open minded, in the end it feels shallow and the lack of profundity opens the door to even more despair.I give this movie a 10 for effort but a 0 for added perspective. So, I give it a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this movie 's won two Oscars must come as no surprise ,or the feeling that some dark and sinister forces had been conspiring in the name of equality in order to show the present status of the Harlem underprivileged , is completely misplaced ,as this film is simply one of the most brutal-gritty ?non horror horror things done in decades , maybe ever! It is in the same league as Once Were Warriors, Happiness , Requiem for a Dream etc. ,where black and white fairy tales for the adults ?equality, freedom , love- simply do not exist , CANNOT exist. This veritable celluloid Dante's inferno must at once become the must-study material at the medical universities , as you won't find another example of such a bestial relationship between mother and her daughter ,where, simply, the worst is the norm ?physical and sexual abuses , raping ,poverty , you can even smell the urine ,the human dirt,the myriads of modern forgotten slaves , slowly rotting in projects ,where TV is a universal drug ,where hopelessness prevails, where black and Latino men are just HIV infected boars ,looking for a piece of dope and a woman to quickly indulge their only impulse they have ?sexual voraciousness . And children left on shoulders of under-aged mothers ,with no hope anywhere. And the performances of the main actors are just amazingly stratospheric, you 've got the unpleasant feeling that secret cameras 'd been installed and the snippets of life minutely recorded ,and real people are there , not actors ! And that two of these are no other than Ms.M. Carey and Mr. L. Kravitz ,who act as if they had been first tier actors with decades of experience !! Incredible achievement,truly shocking, definitely only for those with strong stomachs .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you turn away from the worst parts of the world? Do you want to ignore the truth and hide under your covers? Precious is a movie that truly defies the odds. It goes beyond where most are comfortable going. It challenges viewers to not turn a blind eye and simply accept what is happening everyday in the worst parts of America.Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire is an amazing film. Precious is about Claireece "Precious" Jones, who struggles with an abusive mother and the memory of her father. At the same time she is trying to push herself to get her GED. Because she is expelled from her high school for becoming pregnant with her father's second child, she is directed to a special school for dropouts trying to receive their GEDs. The wonderful Gabourey Sidibe, who plays Precious, makes her a realistic and inspiring character. Mo'Nique plays Mary Jones, Precious' abusive mother. She is absolutely phenomenal in the role. Being primarily a comedian and a late night show host, viewers are astonished by her powerful, dramatic performance. Paula Patton is wonderful in her role as the teacher at the special school and Mariah Carey holds the end of the movie together as a fantastic supporting actress. The cast as a whole is outstanding and the actors bring the characters to life.Marshall Mathers, or more familiarly known as Eminem, once said that, "I am not afraid to say what others and I are thinking." Although Eminem's songs are not about a teen struggling with abusive parents, (but are about Eminem's past growing up with a drug addicted mother and no father) what Eminem said defines the courageousness and leadership of director Lee Daniels and writer Geoffrey Fletcher.Precious is set in Harlem, and has a very realistic feel to it. Being a low budget film and just not that kind of movie, there are no special effects, but Precious is filmed with grace. Holding the film together is the music, an absolutely perfect accompanying soundtrack. As you can see from all of these points Precious is a remarkable movie. So, do not stay hidden behind a wall of denial. Face what happens everyday in America, whether you like it or not, whether you want it or not, it happens so don't hide from it. Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire deserves 10 precious stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Necessarily violent and ugly? Maybe. Powerful and moving beyond a doubt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious (2009)A depressing, vivid experience. And you are made to absolutely feel for the title character, who is both victim and a regular person trying to survive and rise above. It's so sad, I found it frankly hard to watch, even though what I was watching was so obviously well done, in particular the acting. The story is more familiar that you'd want to believe, though the details get slightly extreme and unsettling. But it's how the facts are played out that matters. I mean, an abused child's journey through some harrowing times to an opening of some small hope is as old as Oliver Twist, but to see it in the hands of Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) and her really troubled mom (Mo'Nique) is to get whiplashed and then some.Director Lee Daniels pulls things together with a combination of cinema-verite style everyday moments (mostly of anger or isolation) and a few editing tricks that help accelerate the plot (speeded up scenes, using a couple of different techniques). And he gets, or allows, his actors to really pour it out, so that whether or not you believe in welfare or whether or not you can stand the horrors of the events in front of you, you end up sympathetic and crying by that last, famous scene, where Precious's mom tells what happened. As a movie, the end result is what it is. What it isn't is especially original or artful or beautiful. But maybe it didn't want to be or try to be. One exception is during the mental escapes where Precious imagines herself a star while she's being abused, and though they jump out in isolation to the whole, they are a relief, and some sugar in this sour experience. There were times when the sourness, the bitter, mean, angry, violent actions we are forced to watch, are just plain difficult, and though they set the scene, and create empathy for the victim, they also seem to loiter a little for the sake of ugliness. My empathy was in full steam long before the ends of those relentless scenes.Mo'Nique wins best supporting actress for this role? Absolutely. No surprise there. Amazing stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific film and you should rent it at once. The director does a great job of not taking sides and telling us what we should feel for any of the characters or the situations. He simply presents them, characters and situations, to us and let's us draw our own conclusions. The director also made Monster's Ball, not a movie of which I am as fond. I loved Mo Nique's performance, the scene in the social workers office may well win her an Oscar, and the young woman is also just great. Mr. Daniels, the director, creates a great deal of empathy for Precious thru the fantasy scenes, which are very clever, even funny, and we are completely in her corner.Lenny Kravitz also does a great job in a role which opens some characters eyes as to a 'male nurse' and a successful (and very handsome and appealing) person. Also, the young woman who plays the teacher in the alternative school is quite excellent, so supportive, challenging, and non judgemental (also very beautiful). And all the young people turn in terrific performances. Hats off to all of you. Yes, the story is not new, who cares, but it is handled so well, I just became totally involved. Another great thing is the ending, the director and writer don't take the easy way out and give us a 'happy ending', but one which seems totally believable given everyone's motivations. And it is hopeful, Precious seems to have found herself and is willing to take a chance on life and herself and her abilities. What I thought might be a difficult film to watch, with emotional subject matter, and no clear solution to the problems, was fascinating and totally enjoyable. Just sit back and take it as it comes and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotypical to the nth degree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many movies but this is easily one of the most stereotypical movies I've ever seen. The protagonist happens to be a morbidly obese dark skinned woman that loves stealing fried chicken (I kid you not). She's also illiterate and engages in an incestuous relationship with her father who ends up knocking her up with two kids, one of which has the Down Syndrome. Her mother is extremely abusive towards her (both mentally and physically) and her disabled child. All she cares about is her welfare check... go figure. Throughout the whole movie I felt like I was watching one of Tommy Sotomayor's Youtube videos (they usually address black stereotypes in the most satirical fashion). To top it all off the only "smart" characters were light skinned (the teacher and Dr. Weiss), all of the dark skinned characters were for lack of a better word one-dimensional and dull. I really don't know why so many people tend to think that this movie is "inspirational" or "empowering". As someone who's actually watched the movie I can assure you it's neither. The movie ends with the protagonist finding out that she contracted AIDS from her father. What an inspiration...On a personal side note I'd like to criticize the sloppy camera work at the end of the movie. During the entire last conversation with Dr. Weiss the camera was shaky (not to mention the completely random and uncalled for instances where the cameraman kept zooming in and out of the picture). If you're not used to it you might get motion sickness. The acting was top-notch but the story was rather weak/predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Precious is focused around characterization of a teenage girl and her many struggles. The central theme is the coming of age of developing character; Clarisse Precious Jones; played by Gabourey Sidibe. Precious; as she prefers to be called, is an obese, poor, black, girl. Illiterate at middle-school age, she lives with her abusive mother. The exposition reveals Precious is pregnant with her second child and being forced out of school. When the principle inquires about a home visit; it is then we are introduced to the violent and abusive relationship between Precious and her mother. The film portrays her mother Mary played by Mo'nique, as an angry, abusive woman living off welfare fraud. Mary compels Precious to stop going to school and go up to the welfare office. This is when Precious begins to be questioned by a social worker, Ms. Weiss played by Mariah Carey. Ms. Weiss inquires about her pregnancies and discovers that her mother is not only committing welfare fraud but has been a not-so-silent partner in her own daughters' sexual abuse by her boyfriend, Precious' dad. Mary not only allows Precious to be victimized from infancy by her boyfriend but also forces her daughter into sexual relations with herself.In one of the first scenes we are introduced to her vivid imagination as she seemingly day dreams in class. She is glamorous, adored and blissfully happy. As the film progresses, we see that she uses this as a coping mechanism throughout her many trials and tribulations, to say the least, somehow managing to keep a positive outlook. Encouraged to write by her teacher, her journal becomes almost symbolic as her transforming into a strong woman is recorded through her own words. Throughout the film multiple people are mean, degrading and outright cruel. She seems very tough and almost removed from the situation. As she was walking down the street, a group of boys began to mock her. One of the boys after taunting her without a reaction; violently shoves Precious causing her to lose balance and fall to the ground. She lays on the ground being ridiculed as she fades off into her fairytale, happy place. For a moment in time she can feel happiness. Only to be sometimes quite literally slapped back into reality; she continues and endures through the ciaos.The use of color in the film helps to emotionally guide the audience. Precious lives a pretty treacherous home life which is conveyed using dark colors and undertones. The gloomy feeling in her home was enhanced by their specific use of color. During a traumatic scene, she would drift off into her imagination, overtaken by vivid colors and smiling faces. The use of color intensified both scenes. The low-key lighting felt horribly depressing while the bright and vivid fairy tale brought us back to an optimistic hope of happiness. The film did this multiple times, conveying the true character of Clarisse Precious Jones. Even amidst the darkness; she chose to live in the light. When she had every reason to quit, she endured.The use of sound is also profound throughout the film. Mary seems to always be watching TV game shows and yelling over the sound. Typically the game show stars white characters, all the while Mary complains about white people as well as everything else. The noise of multiple people talking and laughing on the TV coupled with her mothers vulgar and violent outbursts; projected an anxious and somber tone in the home. The use of color and sound displayed the hate and tension Precious was surrounded with nearly at all times inside the home.This film reminded me of Gracie's Choice, which stars a young woman with a rocky upbringing, somewhat similar to Precious'. Gracie when faced with traumatic loss, remains optimistic and endures through what many people would allow to beat them down. As each movie progresses we begin to see a changes in the young females. Precious grows significantly as her dynamic personality and character develops; from an abused child into a brave and determined young mother. Plagued by a horrible and rocky upbringing, Precious is a bright and determined young woman.</fullReview>

And that is always a good thing. It is also a good thing to have plenty of films exploring weight, race, class and other divisive issues. Can someone control their race? Of course not. How about their class? To some extent, but not as a child. And their weight? This, too, may be beyond someone's control.I wish I could identify more with this film, and I do respect the work of Lee Daniels, but overall this was just not my cup of tea.

		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire (2009): Dir: Lee Daniels / Cast: Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carrey, Lenny Kravitz: An incredible film about the value of humanity. Sixteen year old Precious lives with her abusive mother and has just been suspended from school due to her second pregnancy from being raped by her mother's boyfriend. She tries again for education and along the way receives help. Directed by Lee Daniels in documentary fashion with excellent performances. Gabourey Sidibe stars as Precious who yearns to become more after being subdued by the harsh reality of abuse and neglect. Mo'Nique as her abusive lazy welfare mother steals scenes in her unpredictable vindictive manner. Her abuse knows no limits even in the presence of children. Paula Patton is superb as teacher Miss Rain whom takes a liking to Precious and encourages her to achieve beyond her background. She sets her up with a social worker, played by Mariah Carrey who steals scenes as she helps Precious face her past including a powerful face off with her mother. Lenny Kravitz plays a nurse who shows kindness and patience to Precious. It is a powerful must-see film about rising above tremendous odds and choosing to live life. In the case of Precious, she will allow her baby the opportunities she was denied. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

The way this layers on the grief is at times gut-wrenchingly painful meaning this should by rights be almost unbearable to watch, but it isn't, as by the end this is all about how it is possible not to give in even when everything, and I mean everything, is going against you. It would have been easy for this to turn into a TV movie, but thanks to the solid cast and good writing it's way too good for that. And any film that touches upon such upsetting concepts and yet still manages to be actually funny in places and overall enjoyable to watch is pulling off quite a rare trick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare look at the dark side of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such an unusual movie on so many scores. The source material is a novel by a black female writer ("Push" by Sapphire), the co-producer and director is black and gay (Lee Daniels), and the cast list includes hardly a white face and hardly a familiar face. The subject matter is dark - child abuse and teenage pregnancy - and there are many heartrending scenes, yet ultimately it is a uplifting work showing the power of education and care to rescue even the most brutalised and disadvantaged. And the central character, the eponymous 16 year old Claireece "Precious" Jones, played by the part African-American, part Senegalese Gabourey "Gabby" Sidibe in her first acting role, is a most unlikely protagonist: very young, morbidly obese, illiterate and mostly inarticulate (as are many of the other characters, making the dialogue hard to follow at times).Yet the film is an absolute triumph and has rightly won many awards. It received six nominations, including one for Best Picture, at the Academy Awards and Geoffrey Fletcher won for Best Adapted Screenplay while Mo'Nique took the award for Best Supporting Actress in the unsympathetic role of Precious's abusive mother. A concluding sequence, where Precious and her mother appear before the girl's social worker (acted by Mariah Carey), is the most powerful of a series of moving scenes which live in the memory long after the viewing. This is the dark side of the American dream that we rarely see on the big screen.</fullReview>

The development of the the story didn't give room for any mood change, considering there's only a few scenes shot outdoor.

Marvelously acted, very interesting story and genuine characters that hooked me up from the start. Clarice, the depressing woman of only 16 gave me the chills when i first saw her and she really was unlikable but honestly i had some sympathy regarding her character and i liked her right after 5 minutes. She is an amazing person, silent, caring and baring. She wanted to do the stupid lies for the welfare checks and she bore her insane mother ( I will get back to her later on) but the way she played the role was the part that got me most. Gabourey Sidibe is of the rare actresses that make a movie look like a documentary speaking in terms of playing the character in a make believe way... she is amazing. I liked the combination of Paula Patton, Monique and Mariah Carry, the trio made the character livelier. Patton's sad face made the whole movie depressing which it was and she put us through the misery Precious was going through by only staring at her... Mariah Carry amazed me whit her performance too as a social worker, her voice specifically felt great! Monique, won the Oscar for her role and I was going to be really disappointed if she did not! I Googled and found out she did, her play was impressive! The movie holds the sad parts of the States's worse places that people live, neglected, ignored and very poor. Things happen there that no one thinks of, inhuman and soulless! Watch the movie you will not regret!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific but full of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lee Daniels' film 'Precious' is a harrowing account of growing up in an impoverished, abusive family in Harlem, New York. The film also explores what good, and bad, the state can do in such situations: the lead character's awful mother lives a dreadful life only enabled by welfare (although it's not clear she'd have any ability to sort herself out if that welfare was removed); equally, it's actually the state, primarily in the form of an alternative school and a brilliant teacher, which actually save her, although it takes a terrible event to force them to do so. Not that her life becomes easy at that point; but it does become a life with a modicum of hope. This is a story of America not so often told in the movies (though it's not a uniquely American story); but it's a lively an engaging film in spite of the darkness of it's theme and the absence (in spite of the fact that Opera Winfrey was involved in the production) of simplistic uplifting platitudes.</fullReview>

Then there is the voice-over from Precious which is used a lot and at times also interferes with scenes that need to unfold by themselves.'Precious' is supposed to take place in the late '80s, but I could hardly tell by the looks of it. And the altogether look of the film wasn't very appealing to me either, somehow. The biggest strongpoint of the film is the acting, where mostly Sidibe and Mo'Nique do the bulk of the work. They really save the film.I could get into whether or not the story is too stereotypical, but if simply the acting can draw me into a story, I'm not going to complain about that anymore than I just did.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

She has been raped by her father resulting in two pregnancies. She suffers long-term physical and mental abuse from her unemployed mother. The family survives on welfare. Her first child has Down syndrome and is being cared for by Precious' grandmother. Following the discovery of Precious' second pregnancy, she is taken out of school. Her high school principal arranges to have her attend an alternative school, which she hopes can help Precious change her life's direction. Precious finds a way out of her traumatic daily existence through imagination and fantasy. In her mind, there is another world where she is loved and appreciated. This movie show the society issues, such as injustice getting welfare, a physically challenged person prejudice, racial prejudice. And it explains the importance of education. The literacy and numeracy give many life's direction by thinking widely, and broaden own horizons. At first, she does not understand why she must study writing and reading. Her mother tells her it has no meaning. But at the end, she understands that she becomes wiser and she makes a wise decision by helping her classmates, the teacher and the therapist. By getting knowledge, precious put ideas into action and act on her own initiative. When people have specific aim in life, and making every effort to accomplish it, their attempts will be rewarded in the long run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then Hollywood manages to forget about it's only goal, to produce mindless drivel for the maximum profit, and surprises even itself." Precious" is a simple, horrifying, almost documentary slice of a nightmare of life. Illiterate 16-year old girl, impregnated for the second time by her father, abused on daily basis by her monstrous mother, desperately trying to find her way. To call this movie heartbreaking would be an understatement. Such a horrific topic could so easily slip into melodrama. Fortunately the deft hand of the director Lee Daniels avoids all the traps and draws marvelous performances. The first time actress Gabourey Sidibe plays perfectly this difficult role with an admirable subtlety. And what to say about Mo'Nique. Mary is one of the wickedest women ever portrayed in the movie. Mo'Nique goes all the way, with fierce abandon, to coldly dissect her own character in the end. Powerhouse acting and no vanity. Such a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong drama about different weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is rather off-putting, it is so full of unpleasant and/or nasty themes that it becomes hard to watch and follow. When the leading character seems somehow to get on track, another setbacks would occur. Until the very end. The movies depicts and raises a lot of painful questions about motherhood, family influence, role of education, meaning of social welfare, importance of looks in succeeding - among others. There are apparently too many of them not deserving to be parents or beneficiaries of social support without giving nothing back. And how to abandon the vicious circle when poverty causes poverty? The fastest measures are radical and usually not considered democratic or humane... The cast is evenly strong, particularly the 3 ladies most frequently appearing on screen: Gabourey Sidibe as Claireece Precious Jones (could have obtained more praise), Mo'Nique as Mary Lee Johnston (deserved her numerous awards) and Paula Patton as Ms. Blu Rain. In addition, there are 2 famous musicians performing small roles in a gifted manner: Mariah Carey as Ms. Weiss and Lenny Kravitz as Nurse John McFadden. As mentioned, the movie is strong, but I don't think I would watch it again - in the line of e.g. Leaving Las Vegas and Dead Man Walking. Too much misery and feeling of powerlessness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is the kind of film that can compel you to feel majorly contrasting attitudes towards people in general simultaneously, here specifically - disgust in the callous abuse that people are capable of realising upon others, even their own family - and faith - in the existence of the benign stranger that can show the exact opposite and care for your welfare. This paradox of emotions invest-able in human beings shines through in this film via patient, unpretentious direction, solidly measured casting and performances, and a hard-hitting, relevant theme. The depiction of Precious' world (overweight, illiterate, pregnant with her father's child for second time, object of bullying) intentionally follows the maxim at the beginning that 'Every life is a gift from the universe', which becomes more and more unbelievable as Precious is hit, pushed over, pulled apart and stuck to the ground. Even when reversed and it seems that Precious is capable of committing acts detrimental to others such as stealing or casual violence, we can forgive her immediately as we have been presented with her situation at home, where her mother is an integral part of the 'cycle of abuse', the cessation of which being one of the main attractions for the film's motivation. The 'way out' juncture presents itself through the chance to attend an 'alternative school', coupled with a classroom full of over-the-top characters and a sympathetic teacher.Scenes bravely wallow in the cesspit of Precious' sorrow, not wanting to cut away easily as this is something Precious cannot easily do herself. Apart from an initially sceptical optimism that the new school holds the key to a new life, the only way she can generate escapism is through the occasional use of wishful daydreaming, where her imagination takes her from signing autographs for her many fans, to performing on stage to her future beau. These scenes in particular, however, do not fit into the structure of the film as naturally as, say, a Dancer In The Dark, and can illicit humour instead of the presumed desire to portray a stark contrast to Precious' trappings in life. (It is nice, however, to see the girl smile during the bleakness of the main feature!)There are unfortunately some other notable negatives that can be identified after viewing. The tone of the film shifts through too many gears in too few scenes towards the end, with jubilation and uncharacteristic wise-cracking from the main character intersecting with further grief and tragedy in a way that makes you feel you blinked and missed a few scenes (usually the telltale sign of bad editing). The character of Nurse John (played by Lenny Kravitz) feels completely pointless and ends up appearing like some kind of stalker who has all his attention on Precious in an undefined way (I later discovered that this role was created just for the film because the director desperately wanted the rocker in the film - oh dear). Most criminally of all is the surprising under-use of the quite good de-make-up'd Carey who delivers rather well in a welfare officer role, but is given just TWO scenes, with an entire year passing by in between. Instead most focus is put on Ms. Rain, a slightly boring and ineffective teacher who's only interesting reveal is that she's a lesbian. I would have certainly switched the screen time on these two characters if it were up to me.Despite these minor faults, I believe Precious to be a triumph. I was relieved when it seemed that it was simply going to drift comfortably into Dangerous Minds-mimicking territory midway through, only for the film to strongly re-assert its own tone almost immediately and for the remainder of the run time. The performances of all the major cast are excellent, especially Mo'Nique as Precious' bitter mother, and Gabriel Sidibe herself is extraordinary, given a difficult role requiring a lot of energy and sensitivity. I'm a sucker for describing films via mash-ups, and for this I would say its The Color Purple by way of Dangerous Minds. Take from that what you will, but I certainly suggest you take a look at Precious. Not necessarily one to watch over and over, but definitely not one to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious lesson indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way great movies portray the lives of people make them truly a unique genre of their own. In Precious, we can see a tremendous depiction of all the wrong kind of abuses on a child, who managed to crawl her way out to life with the help of people around her. Certain parts of the story seems bland and sometimes misplaced, but the dark parts of the story are very heart-wrenching.Mo'Nique is fantastic, playing a misguided mother so capable of making her audience hate her to the maximum, but has some surprises of her own. I can see a winner as a supporting actress in here. Surprised to realized that Mariah Carey acted in the show because I could barely recognize her. She was superb in her role too.Overall, this is a good heartfelt movie with facts close enough to reality to make us realise that there are people out there in the same situation.The author commented: "People ask me: is it a story about obesity, abuse or race? Actually, what it's really about is the transformative power of literacy. At the end of the film, Precious is still black, still poor and still fat but what's changed is that she can read and write and has begun to re-invent herself. She has left her abusive home environment, and has gone from feeling stupid and worthless to embracing a positive vision of her future." She smiles. "And of course, that's my story, too. An abused person empowering herself through language and literature and writing. I did the same. Thirteen years ago I planted a seed, and now this big tree comes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get that they added Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz to put butts in theater seats, it wasn't really necessary; Kravitz seems to be the better actor, and Mariah appears as though she's well aware that everyone in the audience will turn to each other and whisper: "look, that's Mariah Carey without makeup". The little art-house special effects touches seem peculiarly derivative: the moving photographs, the ceiling breaking open, the fantasy celebrity sequences. It just seems a little cheap, that's all. I get that Precious yearns to be free of her monstrous mother, but this would have been better accomplished simply by allowing the actors to carry the story.The frustrating pace of the film is saved at the end by Monique's incredibly moving speech at the social worker's office: here is an actor at the top of her form, giving us a character layered with years of sadness, guilt, fury, and confusion, as she attempts to justify her deplorable treatment of her daughter. Even as she vocalizes Precious's tortured childhood, she finally realizes how awful it was; you can see all these feelings fighting with each other in Monique's face. It is heart-wrenching to watch, and a well-deserved Oscar for Monique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is defiantly no surprise to me, that this film was "Best picture of 2009". With an all star cast and a heart wrenching plot, "Precious" surpassed my expectations. Once you watch this movie, you begin to stop feeling sorrow for your own life. Nothing in your life could be worse than the main characters, Clareece Precious Jones. Not only is she pregnant with her second child, she also has the constant dread of knowing she will have to return home to her abusive mother. Precious displays an immense about of courage throughout the movie, which makes for a great film. Gabourey Sidibe picked a great role to play for her first lead role in a movie.

		<fullReview>I finally got the chance to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint. It was a very compelling drama of a 16 year old girl, Precious. Precious is illiterate and only has her fantasies to live through. Her life is hell. She is abused emotionally and physically by her lazy mom. The mom tells her how worthless she is and how she wished she was never born. She throws things at her. But worst of all is Precious has one child and another on the way by her own father. Her mother hates her because her man wanted Precious more than her. The mother uses this as an excuse to justify the sexual abuse. It was disgusting.Precious gets a break when a teacher at school sends her to an alternative school in hopes of getting a GED. We see how far Precious has slipped through the cracks when she doesn't even know the word AT. She seems to be doing better only to learn a horrible truth about her father and what else he gave her.FINAL VERDICT: well written, emotional, a real life situation. It's a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tearjerker, that's for sure. One scene in particular almost had me in tears. I was watering up, I can admit that. I'm a real man totally in touch with my emotions. Other parts may be hard to take in for some people as the sensitive types (females) could cringe in certain scenes involving the title character and her mom.I've read the idiotic, racist comments from people who think some of the stuff that happens in the movie is unbelievable. They don't understand black culture or inner city life so they think a lot of it is fake and just made-up. Like people don't really experience that in their lives. Think again. Then there are the people who don't think a fat black chick can be a good lead in such a movie and it still be successful. I'm here to tell you that, although there are fantasy scenes in the movie which are totally justifiable, I believed everything I saw. Now, you've heard all this and that about Mo'Nique's performance in this movie. I can say with absolute conviction that she gave one of the most powerful performances of anyone I've ever seen in any movie. She killed it! From the instant she's on screen, you hate her. If you've ever heard or seen her stand up comedy, you know that she has a mouth that can rival almost any man. She brings that raw delivery to this movie. It's almost like the director just let her have free reign to say whatever she wanted to. The stuff that comes out of her mouth is totally relevant though. It's not out of context in the movie at all. It directly relates. She's spiteful, evil, hurtful, violent, condescending, insulting, insensitive, sick, twisted...all the things you love to hate in any movie antagonist. Most people were offended by her words and actions and it was obvious by the mumbles and silence whenever she spoke.I thought it was hilarious, man! I even laughed out loud with a couple of other people while everyone else was dead silent. Couldn't help it. She killed that role, man, I'm not even kidding you. Excellent performance. Definitely Oscar worthy, if that means anything, because she made me feel her evil and hatred towards her daughter. Oh, there's stuff that I'm not mentioning because there's stuff that I don't wanna spoil. At the very least, see this movie for her performance. I had no idea she was capable of this type of acting. I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The grim and unpleasant life of Claireece "Precious" Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Sapphire, Precious was a movie that had the backing a number of prominence African-Americans, Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry acted as producers, producer Lee Daniels was also the director and university lecturer Geoffrey S. Flecther adapted the novel. And this team made a very hard hitting, grim yet stylised film.Claireece "Precious" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is a 16-year-old obese, illiterate girl stack in Junior High in Harlem in 1987. She is pregnant with her second child after being raped by her father and she suffers at the hand of her mother's (Mo'Nique) constant physical and emotional abuse. Precious is her personal chef, feds Precious crap and tells her off for being fat and constantly calls her stupid, leading to a horrible self-filling prophecy and permanent low self-esteem. Her school also transfer Precious to an alternative school, seemingly as a punishment but it turns out to be a blessing in disguise, meeting a good teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), helping her read and give her the confidence see needs.Even before watching the film you know it is going to be a tough watch because of the themes of rape, incest, child abuse and the harsh levels of poverty. If this was a British film it would have been a grim, kitchen sink drama, shot with a grey light and would have been depressing throughout. Lee Daniels instead went for a more stylised view, having Precious escape into fantasy, whether it was a dream sequence, or seeing a picture move. The colour pallet changes depending on the situation, from dark in the grim apartment she lives to being bright when she is the class room. Patton was almost given a heavenly glow. You really feel the abuse Precious suffers even though does not show many actual scenes of violence and only shows her face and fantasy when she is being raped.Daniels does some real risky casting choices and it pays off. Casting an unknown makes sense for the main character because the character is young and a big name would have been a distraction. But he cast a comedian for the most horrid, evil roles, Mariah Carrey as a unattractive social worker (a woman who never been that good at acting) and Lenny Kravitz, a singer who has never acted before. The cast was great, even the minor plays. Mo'Nique deserve her Oscar, she was a horrible evil character who had a different face to officials and at home some one who bullies. She was not redeemable, a selfish character who only though of herself. A spiteful person who only craves power. Sidibe had a very difficult role and she pulled it off as Precious starts off as a character with no confidence, hiding from the world and just wants to cruise in life because that is all she knows and what people expect from her. She is a character who suffers every way imaginable and needs help to let her reach her full potential. Patton is also a strong performer, a teacher with a quiet authority and able to handle some of the troublesome students a teacher could ever have.Armond White, the famous internet troll, complain that Precious undermines the idea of Black America as much as Birth of a Nation: his destroys his own argument by saying that Wayans brothers films have strong black themes. To me Precious is not a racist film, it is simply a film that shows the horrid nature of abuse within a family and the result would have been the same if the characters were written to be white. This was a film that was a criticism of the way the American state operates, how people fall into a welfare trap where they are forced to stay on it to live, how some people would exploit the system to get more and avoid work, how school classrooms are overloaded, teachers unable to attention to students and disciple is non-existent and social workers do not seem to care or pay attention. This is a film that praises the idea of someone getting a decent education so they could land a good job or at least be able raise up the ranks. Also this a film that shows people need to be able to stand for themselves, even though there are a lot of issues involving abuse.Precious is a very hard hitting film that is worth your time. A dark tale that allows a character to grow and acts as a criticism of an ill-effective state that needs to be improved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope can be Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is a very emotional and powerful film. The film is primarily about a teen-aged girl (Claurece Precious Jones played by Gabourey Sidibe) growing up with many hardships in Harlem. Her mother (Mary played by Mo'Nique) is very demanding and abusive to Precious. Mary constantly tells Precious what to do, degrades her, and even physically abuses her. As if this is not enough of a struggle for Precious to deal with, her mother is extremely poor, and it is often that Precious does not have any food. She experiences the same abuse at school that she experiences at home: both physical and mental abuse. After being kicked out of her school, she attends an alternative school where her teacher (Mrs. Weiss played by Mariah Carey) really makes her push herself to become something better. Also, her own father rapes her causing her to have two children from incest. Even though her mother treated her poorly and did nothing to stop her father, Precious decides she is going to be a good mother to her children. Also, she keeps going to school to improve herself to be not only a better person, but also a better mother. Just when it seems like things could not get any worse, Precious finds out that she has aids from her father raping her. Precious has been through a lot, but she still strives toward being the best she can. She is a very strong willed person that has had to endure a lot of abuse and torment, yet she keeps on going.The main theme of this film is hope. Precious experiences a lot of abuse (mental, physical, and even sexual), but she never loses hope. When she is experiencing abuse, we her be fantasize of some place better and happier. She uses this as a remedy to avoid the abuse. We see her use this when she is being raped by her father and she goes off into a dream where she is a celebrity. Also, she goes off into a fantasy when a boy pushes her down from behind. Throughout the entire film, we constantly see glimpses of hope for Precious, from going to the alternative school, her meeting other students that become friends, and her deciding she was going "to be one of the good students that sit in the front of the class and pay attention." Precious never stops having hope for something better, and as a viewer, I never stopped hoping something better would happen for her. The film Finding Nemo, while a cartoon, displayed a lot of the same style of hope. While Nemo's father constantly hoped to find a way to get to his son to protect him from everything, Precious hoped to find a way to protect her children. Precious hopes to be the best mom possible for her children. She had to find her way to becoming a better person in her society.A technique that really worked in this film was the lighting. Her mother's apartment was very run down and dark. The lighting worked here to show the dark memories that Precious had to endure. Also, there was never a happy time in this place; it was always a place where Precious was physically, mentally, and sexually abused. When Precious would drift off, we would always see bright colors with a lot of light. The lighting was bright and cheery, which gave a false sense of happiness and excitement.Another technique utilized in the film was angle. At one point we see Precious standing at the top of the stairs while Mary was yelling at her as usual. The camera was shown at the level of Mary, and therefore symbolizing how Precious is above her mother. She is a better person, and even though she is not very educated she is already above her mother.Precious was put through many hardships, but she simply refused to give up hope. If anything I would say that hope is what kept her going. She was constantly hoping to be a better person and a better mother. Not only does she serve as hope for herself, we see her give a red scarf to a girl whose mother seems to be much like her own. If someone is able to keep hope and never let it go, anything is possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Precious starring Mo'Nique as Mary Jones and Gabourey "Gabby" Sidibe as Precious Jones tells the story of a girl and her struggle in life. Being a 16 year old girl pregnant again by an abusive, but absent father and having to endure both physical and mental abuse from her mother, the young girl's life seems absolutely hopeless.After being kicked out of school and give the option to attend an alternative school, Precious finds that there are people in the world that care and the "keep pushing yourself" attitude is instilled in the young girl, which represents the theme of the movie. With Precious also using her dreams to cope with the abuse and through the help of a teacher Ms. Rain and a social worker Ms. White, the overweight, illiterate girl begins to turn her life around and make a difference for herself and her newly born son. Even with all the abuse and lack of help throughout her life, the movie shows that hard-work and dedication pay off. This movie helps encourage those that may feel as if the world will never change and there is no hope in their life to keep pushing and better things will come their way. While this movie is unlike any other one I have seen, the theme of the movie is similar to that of Chariots of Fire. Both main characters from both movies were determined to reach their goals, and their hard work helped them accomplish those goals in the end.Motif and lighting throughout the movie contribute to the theme. For example, the dim lighting in the apartment Mary and Precious live in contribute to the feeling of dread, fear, and the overall darkness of even being there. On the other hand, the bright lighting in the classroom and other places show the hope and better environment. The brightly lighted areas are also places where Precious is safe from the abuse endured by her mother and/or father. While enduring the abuse Precious escapes the situation mentally by dreaming of dancing, being at a photo shoot or in church singing in the choir which shows or gives her the idea that when she is away from her parents, there is hope and happiness.This must-see movie's outstanding performances by both Mo'Nique and Gabourey "Gabby" Sidibe, a viewer filled with emotion. From hate to happiness, this movie beautifully fills the viewers with these emotions from one extreme to the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Some) great acting, predictable, exploitative story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give credit where credit is due; Mo'Nique deserves best actress of this decade for her performance and I didn't recognize Mariah Carey as the the social worker until her second scene (definite 'Glitter' redemption). But people yammering on and on about Gabby Sidibe (Precious') performance might need to re-watch the movie because I didn't really see her do much. She did a great job of standing still while her mother was abusing her and she did a fantastic job of looking blank and disconnected throughout the rest of the film. I know it takes talent to be a good actress, but how much talent does it take to be silent and withdraw yourself? I haven't really put much thought into how she could have improved the performance, but I certainly don't think it's worthy of the 10-star hurrah it's being given. I think the direction she was given really sold her short. The storyline is exploitative and upsetting to anyone who's had a traumatic childhood. The only people who are moved to a 10-star ranking are those who are naive to the fact that this kind of stuff really does happen in real-life. Unfortunately, children are abused and neglected every day and this type of thing (and many variants of it) are not too uncommon. If we wrote movies about every girl who gets raped by her father or every kid who gets beat up by her mother or every young kid who has to raise their siblings because their parents are absent, you'd never see anything else. I wouldn't be surprised if the author got the idea for this story by reading it in the paper or following a project kid around for a week (no accusations or assumptions implied). It is not an 'unbelievable, uplifting story of chance and heartache,' it is real life, and in case you haven't been able to tell thus far, the exploiting of it really, really bothers me. All the people who are torn to pieces over this girl's life...go do something about it. Go be a foster parent. Go volunteer at an elementary school. Go donate to a food bank. You won't, because you don't think it's real. The editing is terrible. I am no movie buff by any means. I don't own a television. I watch old sitcoms on Netflix. But my boyfriend has a select queue of films he has wanted to watch for awhile and this was in it and I agreed to watch it. Having said that, a novice such as myself should not be able to pick out continuity issues in a film, however I did just that. Three of them! The fantasy cut-scenes were weird and after the movie ended just seem irrelevant. I kept waiting for them to tie into the film. Does she become famous at the end? Is this her way of promising herself she'll get out of this situation? But it isn't, and Precious' withdrawn, detached, absent projection of herself completely contradicts what the cut-scenes portray.My 6/10 stars are for the unbelievable acting from Mo'Nique. I am sure with better direction I would have felt better about Sidibe's acting, as well, as she does appear to be a good actress, but her performance for me was blank. 0/10 stars for the storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious (2009) - Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire! (This Review is Dedicated to Precious Girls Everywhere!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Precious" tells the dramatic adaptation of Sapphire's heartbreaking novel, where a young overweight teen girl named Precious, who lives a torturous life, being abused by her mother, raped by her father, and has two kids. Then, when Precious gets sent to an alternative school, her life starts to change when she learns how to push herself in life to get to the happy part of her life. This movie can only be explained perfectly in two words: 'heartbreaking' and 'heartwarming'. The first half is dramatic, filled with sadness, despair, and torture. The second half contains a lot of heart, and is filled with so much love, care, and fantasy. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey, comedy master Tyler Perry, screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher, and director Lee Daniels brought their hearts to this movie, bringing a movie that must lift the heart and spirits of people, although of it's dramatic storyline. Fletcher brings a unique and heartwarming script that's totally uplifting, and Daniels directs masterfully with a lot smart charm. The casting ensemble is one of the most perfect I have seen this year. With groundbreaking show-stealing performances from Monique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, Sherri Shepard, and let's not forget the heartbreaking performance provided by the princess and guardian angle of the screen, Gabourey Sidibe portraying the helpless, but mostly lucky Precious Jones. This movie had so many moments of drama, heart, tragedy, heartbreak, care, and dream. This movie, I think it's something that can relate to other teenage girls, even overweight teenage girls, and even if they are either white or black. This movie is a work of art that lives to a high potential, and it's really a must-see if you are in the mood for inspirational dramas that break your heart. "Precious", in my review, "an inspirational tale of courage, and a tragical portrait of the heart".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Cain Hunm246-f2ff Assignment 5-4 July 26, 2011The movie Precious is a powerful impacting movie that presses your tolerance, patience and views. One of the themes of this movie is about a young black overweight girl Precious Jones (played by Gabourey Sidibe) who lives in Harlem with her extremely mean mother Mary (played by Mo'Nique). The family is very poor and on welfare, and lives in a drug-infested neighborhood. Precious is has to deal with verbal and physical abuse by her mother, and sexual abuse by both of her parents. She has two children that are the result of incest, due to being raped by her father. Precious's dealing with her mother were hard to swallow or imagine a mother being so mean and unloving to their child. Her mother's insult and degrades are of the utmost. There is no limit to her barrage; she even puts blame on Precious for being raped and ridicules her for going to school. Her mother Mary (played by Mo'Nique) plays a very strong and dramatic part she is absolutely epic in her performance. As stated earlier, there is another theme in this movie that I feel is important. The way Mary is two-faced about precious and her daughter which has Down's syndrome. When the social worker (played By Mariah Carey) comes for a visit Mary pretends to love and care about the baby and is very nice and kind to the social worker. She lies about the child living with her and as soon as the social worker leaves she is back to her abusive self. Mary is very narcissistic and probably has issues in her past that are traumatic. In scenes with her father Precious is being sexually abused by her father and makes comments of her being better in bed than her mother. Mary knows of the acts that are taking place and does nothing to interfere. I feel that there were clever techniques used in this film to lighten the harsh cruel things that take place in Precious' life. For instance after a confrontation with her mother Precious feels hurt by it, but instead she revert to her faith in God and says "that why God makes new days" . Right after that the day lightens. During the moments when Precious fantasizes about positive things or of things that are opposite to the moment; it is bright and flawless.As I thing of this movies in its whole content this a movie that makes you want to go and comfort Precious; tell her it will get better. At the same time, you want to slap the hell out of Mary, beat the crap out of her father and all the mean spirited people she encountered. She will forever be traumatized from all the she has gone through; the scars will heal but the will always be evident. However Precious is a strong woman and resilient as they come. She has gone through the ringer and in her eyes she is wrinkles free. I personally route for her success and her well being just because of or should I say in spite of those who thought she was less than what she is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I start a review about this amazing movie? what wasn't perfect about this? There is a lot of reasons to see this movie,if you haven't done that yet. Starting by the acting. Mo'nique totally deserves the Oscar. she did such an amazing performance and also the girl who plays the role of precious. this is a very touching movie, after you watch this you are gonna start to love your problems so bad, as I do now. It looks so real that you believe that somebody is really passing throw all this. When I saw the trailer, I told myself I got to see this movie, after I watched it I was totally convinced that it wasn't a bad choice. The movie catched me every minute and now it became one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is 16 going on 60, a single mother to a handicapped child, the product of rape by her father, like the second child she now carries. Complicit in this abuse is her mother Mary, who vents her misanthropy at a life that has past by bulldozing her daughter's self-esteem. A referral to an alternative school opens up a glimmer of hope for Precious.Rarely do script, casting, performances and direction gel so sublimely. Brutal and unrelenting, this film somehow fashions a sort of triumph from the most unlikely of circumstances. The performances by Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique are now the stuff of legend. Mo'Nique, especially, is terrifyingly convincing as the wildly emotional mother. These two performances monopolised so much attention that the deft casting of Mariah Carey as a feisty social worker, and Lenny Kravitz as a cool but caring nurse, startling in their audacity and success, passes almost unnoticed. Indeed, Carey is damn near unrecognizable from her everyday singing superstar persona.Lee Daniels (Director) and Geoffrey Fletcher (Screenwriter) deserve every prize and praise this film has brought their way. Tough viewing and unmissable all at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>life is... Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is about Claireece 'Precious' Jones. She is a fat, illiterate, poor girl growing up in Harlem. Growing up, she is physically and psychologically abused by her mother and sexually abused by her father. She has never felt loved and has no self esteem whatsoever. When she is pregnant of her second child, she is sent to an alternative school, where she meets Ms. Rain. Ms. Rain sees Precious' potentials and tries her best to make Precious believe she is worth something in this world.We thought it was a pretty good film, as it was rather striking and had an impact on us. The acting was very realistic, especially by Gabourney Sidibe (Precious). Although she mostly had a dull, daft look on her face, this combined perfectly with what was happening to her. The emotion was very clear and looked incredibly real during the tough, abusive scenes. It almost looked as if she was truly touched when Paula Patton (Ms. Rain) decides to help her and lets her into her life. Although at first it seems as if this is just another film on abuse and happy endings, 'Precious' proves to be more than that. Sidibe takes you by the hand and helps you step into the world of teen pregnancy, abuse and generally problematic life.The scenes where Precious' mother (played by Mo'Nique) abuses her, throwing things at her and calling her stupid and worthless were impressive. Whereas in the beginning of the film, the abuse is pretty straightforward, for instance in scenes as the one in the first half of the film where Precious is raped by her father. She takes both herself and the viewer to another world, a fantasy world where she is loved, popular, rich and famous. Going away to this fantasy world is her way of shutting it out and therefore dealing with the abuse in her life.In the second part of the film, Precious tries to put an end to the abuse by running away from it. All other characters, besides the mother, attempt to help her leave her past behind. This is the first time she feels people love her for who she is. A slight change in her expression can be noticed, and also the way of filming changes. Suddenly there is more light in the shots, as Precious' life literally lights up. This creates a whole different feel to the film.Although the film was impressive and certainly no waste of time, it was rather predictable. Read any book on this subject and you will know what to expect. Despite this, we thought it to be pretty convincing. The acting was more important and convincing than the plot itself, which made up for the lack of originality. All in all we would recommend this film to others, if only for the immaculate acting. We rate this film 7 out of 10, which could've been more if the plot had been more profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while, a show that changes your perceptions of everything comes along. Those kinds of movies make you sit back, look at everything around you, and go 'Well. Now what.' Those kinds of movies give you a whole new outlook on life and opens your eyes to everything. Precious is one example. You really don't see movies like this very often now, especially with shows like The Social Network, Inception, Avatar, etc etc. They don't show the very real and down-to-earth side of society. Set in the late 80s in Harlem, Precious is a tale of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and how opportunities are available for everyone. I am honestly not a fan of these kinds of movies, because I'd just sit there and be thoroughly depressed by the sequence of events. However, this movie captivated me from start to finish. The acting honestly impressed me. This girl, who's so full of potential, born into a life no one would want. I felt so much for Precious. I felt every blow she felt and flinched at every insult thrown at her. It was an extremely depressing storyline, so thank heavens for a couple of comic relief characters present to lighten the mood. Otherwise, I would probably have gone to bed with a nagging feeling of unhappiness. One line which I'll be taking home this time: The longest journey starts with a single step.I'm actually very thankful that I sat through this movie, considering Hollywood just keeps churning out honey-coated gibberish all the time. Although it's not a movie I'd watch over and over again, it's definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Precious" little gem that is not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2009's "Precious" (full title: "Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire") is a most "precious" little gem of a film, but it's not for everyone.This is a very graphic film, both in its content and language. It's also quite disturbing and frightening, yet this isn't a horror film (or could be about the everyday "horrors" of life in the inner-city). Despite this, there is a sense of hope pervading throughout the film that only really begins to show itself at the very end of the film. This is not really a spoiler (at least, I don't think it is), considering that the way the movie is marketed, we're given the impression that what we are being sold here is indeed a "feel-good" movie.Let me just say that "Precious" is a well-acted film that was worth the near-universal praise it received, despite its grim subject matter. But let me also say again that this movie is not for everyone and for anyone who is sensitive to graphic scenes of child abuse, incest, neglect, poverty and every other horrid misfortune that life has to offer a poor inner-city teenager, just skip to the next feel-good movie. The movie is about its lead character, the titular Claireece "Precious" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe, who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her debut performance in this film), who is 16, overweight, illiterate, and pregnant with her second child.To have so much burdened upon her at such an early age is incredible. That all of this is made abundantly clear to the audience within its first 10 minutes and in quick-step tempo is an indication of how unrelentingly bleak this film is going to be, and wondering if you made the right choice to make the time to watch this movie. (But these hellish circumstances that are 109 minutes of our time are facets of Precious's everyday existence.) But I think that the presence of well-known black celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry as the film's producers is enough to tell the viewer how this story will most likely end.Precious is a victim, yes. She's a victim of not only her circumstances - growing up black, uneducated and impoverished in Harlem in 1987, but the film is not an open indictment of "The Man" and/or "The System" - but of her father (who has sexually abused her since the age of three and is also the father of her two children) and her wicked, abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique, who deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in this film). Mary has to be one of the most loathsome characters ever brought to life on screen, and what is equally incredible (other than the fact that such monsters do exist in real life) is that a well-established comedienne like Mo'Nique is able to make such a character believable and real. We're not supposed to sympathize with Mary in any way and that's the point; what I think we're supposed to do, ultimately, is pity her, even though I do think the movie does make a pointlessly half-hearted attempt in her Big Scene to try to explain her evil ways.When Precious's second pregnancy is revealed early on in the film, she is suspended from her old school and enrolled in an alternative school with six other teenage girls who also have horrid back-stories of their own. Her dedicated teacher Ms. Blu Rain (Paula Patton) immediately sees potential in her and tries to steer her in the right direction, and that is when the floodgates open for Precious to try to reach for a better life. Others who eventually come to her aid are Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey), a social worker, and Nurse John (Lenny Kravitz), who delivers Precious's second child.Geoffrey Fletcher won an Oscar for adapting Sapphire's 1996 novel "Push," from which Lee Daniels directed. "Precious" is a film with first-rate performances. Daniels may not have a firm grip on the material, but he is able to grab a hold on the viewer and get commanding performances out of the film's two leads, who are definitely worth the widespread praise they received. Despite its widespread acclaim, this is still a difficult film to watch and will most likely not inspire good feelings in anyone who watches it. (In fact, there's a strong possibility that anyone who watches "Precious" is only likely to watch the film only once, yet still clearly remember everything happens in it.)One aspect about this film I noticed was the alternation of light and dark settings. When Precious is at home, the feeling there is of darkness, loneliness, helplessness, isolation, and every other negative feeling you can associate with a rotten home life that might as well as be the seventh circle of Hell. When she is at school, however, there's light, and a sense of hope and that life outside her mother's home is much better and less suffocating and bleak. Cinematographer Andrew Dunn did an outstanding job of photographing this movie and also should have received an Oscar nod from the Academy.I thought "Precious" was an outstanding film worthy of all the praise it received. But I feel that its grim subject matter may limit its potential to really go about finding a mass audience. I'm sure I'll probably watch it again, but it will probably be a while before I do so.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gritty, powerful and poignant--with ferociously committed actors,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty minutes into this film, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at all. It was setting itself up as the "teacher helps an inner city kid" type of film, which has been overdone. I was very wrong. This is a film about a young girl with big dreams, and little else, as well as the ability to find and help yourself.Gabourey "Gabbie" Sidibe portrays Claireece "Precious" Jones, a teenager growing up in Harlem with an abusive mother, no father, learning disabilities, one child of her own, and one on the way. The viewer learns early on that this is NOT the feel-good movie of the year.Siddons is more than adequate in her role, but this movie, acting-wise, belongs to Monique. Her portrayal of Precious' mother invokes a wide range of emotions from the audience, and she was arguably the most memorable part of this movie. Gritty yet realistic, 'Precious' is a film that I think could be enjoyed by most adults. Despite its unnecessarily long title, I believe this movie has begun to find its audience, and I hope that it continues to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't very often that a film so brutal yet touching comes along. Set in Harlem, Precious tells the story of a young girl who leads a very troubled and dark life. I won't spoil it for you, but trust me, it's brutal and heartbreaking. The acting is superb, and without wishing to sound condescending, surprisingly (for me) Mariah Carey also gives a sterling performance. The two main characters (Precious, played by Gabourey Sidibeare and Mo'Nique as her mother) are the real stars, with performances so believable you will want to cry for one, and seriously injure the other. A real triumph. Thank goodness this is not based on a true story. Sadly, there will be many actual events like this taking place right now. Tragic. Fortunately there is light within this film and it ultimately shines through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally-Gripping, Heart Breaking, and Eye-Opening - The Not-So-Average Tale of a Teen-aged Heroine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're anything like me, you want to see an unpredictably predictable film that stimulates your thinking.... but not beyond what is deserved on a casual afternoon or evening. Well if that is what you desire, I politely recommend you choose another movie.Precious, based on the moving novel Push, will leave you thinking far beyond when the movie is finished. It is a captivating tale about a female teenager who withstands multiple forms of abuse, wrestles with the pressure of poverty, and "wins" against the trials of teenage pregnancy. This film grips and paralyzes the viewer, transporting them to a land of enlightening darkness. After the opening credits, the audience is granted a one-way ticket from denial to reality, never to return to the comfort of "looking the other way" or being ignorant about the topics that haunt our society today.In addition to being packed with heavy-weighted issues, the movie is packed with a heavy-hitting cast. I completely agree with several other reviews, and reiterate the comments praising the superb performance from the all-star line-up, which was critical in pulling off a movie of this nature. Oftentimes, because of the seemingly effortless execution and portrayal of character delivered, it was easy to forget that you were watching a film! The desaturated color and granular appearance on screen produced a gritty viewing experience, similar to that of watching a documentary, contributing to the disturbing suspicion that this film could be a reality for many. Glamour queens Mo'Nique, Mariah Carey, and Paula Patton took a backseat to glitz, with bare make-up to match the consistent theme of "raw" ? raw talent in the cast, raw beauty in costume, a raw lens for the screen, and raw truth in the content.It's no wonder the film soared from the globally renowned independent film showcase event, The Sundance Film Festival, to the dominating screens of Hollywood, landing in the homes of film watchers, and lodging itself gently yet forcefully into the hearts of people worldwide. It leaves aware audiences connected, unaware audiences unhinged, and all viewers uneasy; for these reasons and more, Precious ranks more than memorable, but unforgettable too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good strong drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very strong but unpleasant film, felt strongly about Precious, oh what her parents and society had failed her. Precious went to Junior High, but still could not even read short words like "day" and "at" or recite the alphabet, even though she had no learning disabilities, learned later to read like a 13 year old after she has come to a alternative school, however, think it strange that she says in the film that she had "A" in English at his old school, she got it because she was quiet in class, or she just lied? Recently saw a BBC documentary called "Can not read Can not Wright" that confirmed how schools in England can ignore and fail to teach someone to read despite the fact that the person has no learning problems and toke the tests. Had some problems myself when I was in elementary school, but luckily I got help in the form of a personal assistant, speech therapist and a smaller class, and now I reading a masters degree in psychology in college, lucky that I live in Sweden there School focuses on students who need help.The film portrays a psychopathic personality (the mother) very well, the mother thought she was the victim when Precious was raped by her father, how little empathy she showed, accused Precious for taking her man and later for that he left he; how physically violent and threatening, she was against his daughter (threatened to kill her and tried to hit her with a television set from the 5th floor), how she looked Precious as a household slave and punching bag.The actor who played Precious was very good, made me realize how wrong she had come in life but how she still struggled to get out of it. Thought the actress who played the mother also was good, especially in the final scenes in which she was totally unconcerned about how Precious been treated and then started crying and saying that she was the victim when her husband left her, her whole appearance was so unpleasant physical, she felt like a fat leech trying to suck the life out of one.If you like this movie so can I recommend Il Capitano, Monster, the Elephant Man, an Murders Anatomy, Festen ...Thought of giving the film a seven or a eight, so it got to be an seven, it is recommended to see when you want to see a drama a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took that long for Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, to make it to our shores, despite its winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and a slew of nominations at this year's Oscars where it won for Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. I suppose distributors here sometimes get the jitters whether the local audience will take to certain films, even award winning ones, because of subject matter and content, and if you'd remember, Frost/Nixon didn't get a theatrical release here, while Good Night and Good Luck also had its release not made it in time before the Oscar results. Well, better late than never.Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) is an illiterate, obese teenage girl in Harlem pregnant with her second child. As if these burdens aren't enough, how about being subjected to mental torture, sexual and physical abuse every waking minute when she's at home with her mom Mary (Mo'Nique) and her unseen dad who cannot get his dirty hands off her? Watching this film is like careening down a railway track at night with the destination station not in sight, where everything that Precious encounters, is something so negative that it demeans her, and will just about break down every iota of strong will left.So who can blame her if her only escape is to lapse into her daydreams, where she fantasizes about being popular, rich, wanted, beautiful, thin, white, and sometimes, one or more of what has been mentioned. That's her only break from her mundane miserable existence, that unless you have a heart of stone, you're surely going to feel for Precious, and wonder just when her breaking point will be reached before she walks out on her mother, played by Mo'Nique in very, very fine bitchy form. She well deserves her win at the Oscars, and I hope she isn't anything like that in real life! Just listening to her curse in rapid fire mode is enough to send some chilling jitters down your spine, and imagine that if someone (mom!) does exactly what Mary does in the film in dishing out a barrage of verbal garbage.And speaking of those who do not resemble what they look like in real life, see if you can spot Lenny Kravitz as Nurse John, or better yet, Mariah Carey! Seriously Carey here as Mrs Weiss, the benefactor of sorts and teacher at the alternative school that Precious enrolled to, is something to sit up and take notice, as her acting's really top notch, and we see how makeup and costuming plays down her diva persona, and makes her quite the likable, inspirational school teacher amongst a rowdy class of women/girls who need plenty of help, both in their education as well as emotional stability.Gabourey Sidibe too deserves a shout out as she tackled such a heavy, emotionally draining role as a rookie, and came through convincingly. The plus sized actress showed a vast emotional range as she had to display all the ups and downs (mostly downs though) that Precious experiences in life, and how through education and encouragement, slowly stand up for all the wrong that's done against her in a build up of inner strength. Living on welfare isn't easy, since you'd have to begin with telling a stranger all your woes before being able to live on the dole, and it is through these opening up sessions, plus a glimpse of a normal life while staying with Mrs Weiss, shows Precious other alternatives in life should she stand up and not be bullied, even when and especially worse coming from family.Sometimes you wonder whether the writer Sapphire and director Lee Daniels are sadistic, in having craft a character whose constantly being abused, with no light at the end of the tunnel to get her out of her plight, which seems to get worst each time and every positive step made encounters a setback. While acknowledging that education still holds the golden key to escape from poverty and opens the doors of opportunity for gainful employment, it is not easy as waking up and deciding that something must be done. There must be resolve, determination, and sometimes a lot of nudging from external parties before inertia to improve one's life can be overcome.Despite its relatively dark and heavy narrative, ultimately this film tells us that there is no difficulty too much to overcome, and there's always that glimmer of hope if we were to look out for it, and seek the right assistance to get there. No man, or woman, is an island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniels' film has a raw vibe to it; the tone of the film is frank but not sincere enough to be emotionally satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere down in the streets of Harlem, a black teenager earns our sympathy. Her name is Precious. She is illiterate and has a really huge belly. Is she obese? Or is she pregnant? Actually, she is both. She comes from a troubled family. Maybe "troubled" seems too light a word to describe her family. You see, her father rapes her, and her mother abuses her verbally and physically. Occasionally, her grandmother would come to visit, but I think the old lady always leaves with guilt and regret.Precious, based on the novel Push by Sapphire, is an independent American film made by a black filmmaker about a black family residing in a predominantly black neighbourhood as they live in poverty and on welfare. The main plot sees Precious expelled from a public school because of her pregnancy. However, her principal makes the effort to find her an alternative school where she could learn with "like-minded" students.The film's title character is played by Gabourey Sidibe, whose debut performance is so exceptional that the Academy had to reward her with an acting nomination. Her mother is played by Mo'Nique, who matches Sidibe's strong display in a vociferous and vulgar supporting role, winning her the Oscar. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey round up the cast, playing a teacher-mentor to Precious, and a welfare social worker respectively.Powerful performances aside, Precious has a conventional storyline but is told in a surprisingly creative way. Daniels inserts sequences dreamt up by Precious whenever she suffers abuse from her parents or when a bad situation happens. This would take her mind away from reality, albeit only temporarily. In her dream, she is a pop star. She would take center stage as spotlights shine on her, and basking in the adulation showered upon her by her fans. Only to find herself waking up into a nightmare.Daniels' film has a raw vibe to it; the tone of the film is frank but not sincere enough to be emotionally satisfying. I could feel for the characters, but not entirely so. Precious is marketed as an inspirational film, but I am reluctant to second that claim. It is a grim and depressing experience occasionally lightened up by the quite possible hope that Precious could one day make it in life, free from all the poverty and abuse, and raising a family out of pure love. Watch it, however, for the strength of the performances.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch piece of work that has greatness spelt all over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one kind of story which will milk those tears of yours, it would be the story of a poor girl who has been abused all her life ? physically and emotionally. You know how most girls yearn to be pretty princesses, wishing for the day to be swept off her feet by a Prince Charming on a dashing white stallion. So when a tale which is as gritty as this film comes along, you feel for the protagonist's traumatic experiences and ponder how harsh life can really get. With a plot like that, it is also very convenient for filmmakers to indulge the protagonist's self pity to churn out a predictable but sellable tear jerking melodrama.We went into the theatre expecting that, but to our pleasant surprise, we stepped out feeling triumphant for our heroine, Precious.You see, this 16 year old girl has been living a life full of hardships. She has an abusive mother who hurls unkind words at her all the time. On top of that, she throws things at her. As if that is not enough, the poor girl's father raped and impregnated her ? twice. So we have Claireece "Precious" Jones, who grows up poor, frustrated and illiterate. To make things worse, the unloved teenager is obese and black. How will someone survive this journey in life? Director Lee Daniels knows better than to paint a picture of a young girl who has absolutely nothing to look forward in her life than to continue being abused. He serves up a platter of somewhat amusing emotions which will make you sit up and watch. There are sequences where Precious goes into moments of self fantasy before being snapped back into reality. This approach adds a nice touch to a film that gives the preconceived notion of a tale that will make you break down and weep. These rather quirky scenes are heartfelt, if not ironically heartbreaking to begin with.The filmmakers also do not fall into the trap of painting a picture of false hope for the audiences. True, the film ends on a positive note, but it also incorporates a realistically poignant element to it. This is where the film's screenplay scores, earning it an Oscar in the category of "Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published" at the Academy Awards earlier this year. Writer Geoffrey Fletcher based his screenplay on American author Sapphire's 1996 debut novel "Push".You may also have heard rave reviews about the cast's performances (no thanks to Singapore's eight month delay after the film's general release in USA ? but you know what they say, it's better late than never), and we assure you that you have to see the film to experience the cast's raw but powerful portrayal of the characters. First we have Gabourey Sidibe, who takes on the role of Precious. She gives an arresting performance who is abused mentally, physically and sexually, bringing out the prevalent social themes which haunt certain parts of the world. Also watch out for Mariah Carey's rumpled characterization of a social worker may be her best big screen performance yet. Of course, you must have heard so much about Mo'Nique, whose abusive mother character is in a word ? chilling. The 42 year old is a Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards.The tremendously engaging acting aside, the film gives you a glimpse of hope that life may not be down in the dumps, even when things are constantly going against you. And this is what keeps us going on in this hustle and bustle of the city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like I've seen this before, it's done well and the material's pretty solid developing a confronting story of triumph over a horribly bleak existence, nothing really new, but the performance of Mo'Nique is truly amazing and really what makes this film stand out.She is captivating, grabbing and wrenching at every scene she's in until just at the sight of her you can only stare in disgust, unable to look away. It really becomes evident when she transforms herself and puts on an act in front of the visiting care-worker to continue getting welfare, while showing such subtle undertones of that underlying menace and volatility that left me in awe and revolted at the same time, eventually leading up to the totally chilling last scene, where her evil, hate-filled mind tries to somehow justify in an entirely unbelievable way more to herself than anyone else the horrors she's let happen right under her nose over the years. She's brilliant to watch.A decent film made awesome by one of the best, most compelling performances I've seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Depressingly Bleak Fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is a depressingly bleak fairytale story that will make viewers appreciate the little things they have. The acting is simply outstanding, and the direction Precious was taken is an intelligent one. Lee Daniels's directing style creates a more realistic Harlem and adds more emotion to the terrific acting. Gabourey Sidibe (Precious), Paula Patton, and, surprisingly, Mariah Carey give great performances, but the real Oscar-worthy performance is by Precious's mother, played by Mo'Nique. Mo'Nique simply steals the show throughout the movie, especially in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. This movie isn't a perfect drama though, the subject-matter at hand was not taken as seriously as it should have been many times during the movie. A couple of chuckles were given when they shouldn't have been. Another flaw is how the movie ended. While I absolutely loved the ending, it was a bit rushed. For a movie that took it's sweet time in the first seventy minutes, I thought the last thirty minutes were quite rushed. Precious is moving fairytale story that is a highlight for 2009 dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually felt physically sick and repulsed when I watched this movie. Nothing was papered over here. For a Hollywod production, it was extremely gritty and heavy. It is definitely worth the watch though, really shines a light upon urban poverty in the U.S. No prom queens and moonlight kisses here. This is unfortunately reality for all too many people. Seriously impacting stuff. Deals with so many taboo issues. The acting is incredible by the two leading actresses. I tried to watch it for a second time but, although its a great movie, I just couldn't stomach again. One particular scene involving insinuated intrafamilar sexual abuse particularly traumatized me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The land of fast cars, happy suburbs and of course the place where "american dream" come true. For sure not for Precious.Someone could say that there's too much of disasters, that this black 17 year old girl, is touched by. But hey, all of them are natural implications of misfortune that happened to her when she was a little child. Her story is really tragic but you can't say that's unreal. Remember "s**t happens".What about acting? I have only one word to describe it- SUPERB. The very first time on screen- Gabourey Sidibe is great in a leading role, but to be honest Mo'Nique stole her the show. As a demonic mother who hates her own child (and probably herself), she is the best villain in non-superhero movie since Dennis Hopper has played Frank Booth in "Blue Velvet".Overall I give "Precious" 8 out of 10 stars. I would like to recommend this title to everyone who like tough social dramas with a little ray of hope for a better life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PRECIOUS: miraculously moves from despair to hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of PRECIOUS couldn't be more depressing. Precious, (Gabourey "Gabby" Sidibe) an obese thirteen year old, is pregnant for the second time with her father's child. Her mother (Mo'Nique) treats her as less than a servant, beating her and constantly reminding her that she is nothing. We get a glimpse of the girl's spirit as Precious escapes into her dreams of being a glamorous star. At school Precious is pretty much invisible aside from being teased for her weight. But there is one teacher who recognizes her potential in math. When Precious is kicked out of school, he recommends that she be placed in a alternative school. Her new teacher (Paula Patton) asks Precious how she felt about introducing herself to the class and Precious says she feels, "Here." The teacher assigns her a journal where she expresses herself for the first time. Precious finds the strength to get an education and keep her baby even as the abuse intensifies at home.It is a minor miracle and a credit to director Lee Daniels, screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher, and actress Gabby Sidibe that you leave the theater actually feeling hopeful. The film demonstrates the transforming power of having one person - in this case a teacher - who believes in you. Precious illustrates the strength of the human spirit to survive extreme abuse and find hope.Movie blessings! Jana Segal, Reel Inspiration</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting kicked out of school, a pregnant teen in Harlem enrolls in an alternative school in hopes of turning around her miserable life. The script lays it on a bit thick by saddling the teen with one misfortune after another, but the acting is good. Mo'nique gives a lively performance, but her character is so purely evil that it seems more like a caricature than a real person. It is hard to believe that she would not have a single redeeming quality and that she would not feel the least bit of love for her child. Sidibe looks the part, but her performance is one-note. Patton is terrific as a passionate teacher, and Carey is surprisingly good as a counselor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to watch at times, realistic story of an abused girl in Harlem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author of the book "Push" was a teacher in NYC during the 1980s and early 1990s. While the story, presented here as the movie "Precious", is fictional, the characters are composites drawn from real people she met and taught.In her breakout performance Gabourey Sidibe is Precious, only 16, very dark and very overweight, and now pregnant with her second child. Much of her young life she has been told that she is stupid and worthless, but in fact she is bright, with a special aptitude for mathematics. Still, because of difficulties in her life she is expelled from school and an "alternative" school is suggested for her.As good as Sidibe is in her role, the real star is Mo'Nique as her mother Mary. So good that she won the Oscar for best supporting actress. She was the abusive mother who did nothing every day, collected welfare checks, watched TV, and made life miserable for Precious.Paula Patton was good as the teacher at the alternative school, Ms. Blue Rain. Also good in a very non-glamorous role was Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss, the social worker who finally was able to unravel the whole story. Singer Lenny Kravitz was in the role of Nurse John.Excellent movie, but hard to watch at times.MAJOR SPOILERS: What we learn quickly was that Precious had children only because she was raped. Her first had Down's because it was conceived by her own father. The second, a boy, appeared normal. The abuse had begun when Precious was only 3, and her mother did nothing to stop it, but was always jealous that her daughter was taking away her man. And that is why she was always mistreating her own daughter. To be sure, she was mentally ill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fantastic smack of realism for me. Quentin Tarentino with fat people. And no sunshine.Can't ignore it. What I remember is the wonderful Gabourey Sidibe. To say she had presence would be to underestimate her worth by several stone, yet her unflickering, unsmiling stoicism was wonderful to behold. She seemed on another planet. How strange, how delightful to encounter.How harrowing.OK. I give in. This film really worked for me in a really unexpected way. And that's why I like the cinema. Keep it up.As a postscript, I was never quite sure why this had to be 1987, and all credit to Maria Carey. No hint of Divadom. But there again. No hint of stairs.Ron(Viewed 2Feb10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I add to so many wonderful reviews?? My English is quite inadequate but even so I watched this movie without subtitles (because they were awful), and the straining to understand everything was extreme, since the actors used so much slang and slurred their dialogs from beginning to end, which is alright for an American audience but for a foreigner can be hell!! It was really painful to watch this obese girl to move on the screen with so much effort and on top of that, crushed by life practically since she was born. To me her mother is the star of this movie. Most of her monologues are so good that they are jaw dropping. From now on, whenever I'll think life is too hard to keep going, I'll think about Precious life and instantly will feel better. Have you thought AFTER the movie ends, what this girl's destiny will be? Better not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much drama for my taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, tells the story of an overweight, illiterate teen who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction. Its a tear dropping, heart-breaking drama with a interesting story, a very well developed plot and extraordinary performances. But to tell you the truth it was way too much drama for my taste. Almost two hours of this girl trying to make her life worthy is a bit too depressing for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the movie is bad in fact it is one of the greatest movies of '09. The cast is quite good, Gabourey Sidibe as Precious delivers and excellent performance definitely Oscar worthy as well as Mo'Nique as Precious mother,she is so flawless that you end hating her in this role, Lenny Kravitz whit a very small participation convince me with his acting, thing that I can't say about Mariah Carey, my god she is just awful, she must reconsider continuing his singer career because as an actress she'll starved to death. Then in conclusion, Precious is a movie you will like because of its message of never give up to your dreams and to become a better person in life</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gut-wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the opposite of a feel-good movie. It is one of the darkest, most disturbing movies you'll ever see. There is no happy ending--only a semi-okay one. There is no fluff and there is very little comedy. You will not leave this movie with a smile on your face. You will leave with much introspection and maybe a sad or confused look on your face. Sad because of the death sentence the main character ultimately received, confused because you didn't expect a movie to be so realistically glum. "Where is the happy ending?" you'll ask yourself.This movie is all about characterization. The characters are its strength. Sidibe does well in her role and the supporting cast does an acceptable job in their respective roles, but Monique owns the film. Her character is the one that will stay with you long past the ending credits. Part of the success of her (much-deserved Oscar) role is how the story was written, in that virtually the entire journey of the main character is rooted in her interaction with the mother character played by Monique. However, a script can only take a movie so far. It's Monique's ownership and presentation of the role that provides most of the impact. This movie is effective because Monique's character made it so. I don't think that's an exaggeration.This is not a perfect movie though. The story almost tries to reach too far, to the point that it's almost unbelievable. And it's clear that the author of the book and director of the film are edge-pushers, believing that every single aspect of the story must have some kind of shock, that every character has to be abnormal or edgy. (Enter the teacher who happens to be gay.) It's a little much for one sitting and at some point, you tire of the contrived extremism. But even this annoying aspect of the story doesn't take away from the overall quality of the movie.It's a good movie. Not the best you'll ever see. But definitely one that will touch you in some way.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by SapphireI've always thought the reason that Hollywood producers turned novels into motion pictures was so that people wouldn't have to read anything. And while its title is exhausting, the actual story is twice as grueling.Born into a physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household in Harlem, 16-year-old Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) faces further adversity when she's suspended from junior high school, then learns that she's pregnant with her second child.Invited to enroll in an alternative school that will help change her life, Precious accepts, despite her domineering mother's (Mo'Nique) objections.Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire, Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire combines the worst things that could ever happen to a person, and bestows them on a teenager. A harsh look at reality, Precious may not be hopeful, but it is powerful.As for attending an alternative school, I'd be open to attending any alternative to school. (Green Light)</fullReview>

I think it is a wonderful story about a girl who is like many girls in this world. It may seem far fetched to those of you who haven't met anyone like precious but I have met people in my job as a social worker that are extremely similar to Precious. And enough about the comments of being racist etc because this happens in white families too and just because they used a family who was black doesn't mean they are being racist. I think this movie was extremely well written to explain the difficulties many individuals have to deal with in their life and the way it affects them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama inspiring hope and optimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not easy to deal with a terrible drama of family violence, on the background of a devastating cultural and moral void, with such "light depth": in this case the director managed to do this successfully. Precious' story is so brutal as to get unbearable, and no discounts are given to the viewer on the brutality of her life. But, at the same time, we immediately enter Precious' inner world, into her fantasies, with a light, but obviously never superficial, touch. Terrbile accounts of violence are counterbalanced by the fantasy of a strong girl who follows the way of self-determination with fierce dignity, with no piteous attitudes, with a strong sense of reality, but strength. What remains is a sense of hope, besides all brutality, hope that life can head in a new direction, thanks to caring people, capable of looking besides appearances and desperation, capable of giving a hand to others. Gabourey Sidibe as Precious has an impressive physical appearance, but carried with such naturalness that we really no longer notice it, in the end we are only overwhelmed by optimism and faith. Good and heartfelt interpretation is also offered also by Mo'nique as Precious' mother. A movie which justly deserved many prizes and I would recommend as truly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty tale told with a lot of affection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was highly praised at both the Oscars and the BAFTAs earlier this year, so I thought I'd take a look. It tells the story of a 450 pound girl and how a move to a special school turned her life around. Here's a brief summary.Precious is an illiterate sixteen year old schoolgirl who is pregnant with her second child. The child's father is her own dad, who raped her. She has an abusive mother, Mary, who puts her down both verbally and physically at every opportunity. It seems nobody cares for Precious until the principle at her school signs her up for the 'Each One, Teach One' project. Precious goes to the class and meets Ms. Rain, the teacher who will change her life. She is put in a class with other kids who, for one reason or another, haven't done as well at school as they might. One day, after more abuse and pressure from her mother, Precious goes to sign up for welfare. She is interviewed by Mrs. Weiss who gets her to tell her all about her life at home. A short time later she has her baby, a boy, and is befriended by a male nurse at the hospital called John. When Precious takes her baby home there is a fight and she has to flee. Not knowing where to go she ends up at the school where Ms. Rain ends up taking care of her. From here on, life gets better for Precious, but there will be a couple more bumps in the road yet.This is a really well made film with some really great performances. I love the way that when Precious is being abused, she goes off into this fantasy world where she's famous and glamorous, it really fitted in neatly. Great work from all the leading cast, especially Gabourey Sidibe as Precious and Mo'Nique as Mary. Both put in stellar performances. I should also give honourable mentions to Paula Patton as Ms. Rain, Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss, Sherri Shepherd as Cornrows and Lenny Kravitz as Nurse John.A very gritty tale told with a lot of affection. I found it quite engrossing to watch and it was very easy to identify with the characters. Over all, a very good film, but with some very strong themes. Well worth a viewing.

		<fullReview>This means simply that, no matter how hard one tries to delve into the inner workings of another person's mind, it will ultimately prove itself to be a naively valiant but futile effort. In this movie, a girl who has all the makings of a borderline personality or DID patient, in her odd little oblivion, retreats on occasion to a fantasy land, where she can be a singer, loved by everyone surrounding her, and yet has the ego strength to persevere. This is certainly admirable in its own way. Precious's mother can very easily be vilified, and in the end may have evoked sympathy from some people; I can say that the nice little bow they wrapped around her story to explain why she turned into such a feral creature is only the tip of the sunken ship. Trying to understand it simply from that perspective, I would say that yes, there are Oedipal undertones, there was a defended regression and a concretization of symbolic struggles the mother was clearly facing; in attacking her daughter she was attacking vulnerability, devaluing her was her way of not only identifying with whatever nameless aggressor she had in the past, but it was also a way of self-injury by identifying with the vulnerable, frail individual her daughter represented. Not much to say about the disdain shown to the mentally challenged child Precious bred, nor about Mariah Carey's inevitably stereotyped role as a bleeding heart who eventually swallowed the mother's primitive push towards becoming another rejecting external object. Ugh? I think they wanted people to empathize with how this girl overcame the odds to push forth with her life, despite all these horrid adversities facing her. That works too, but we can't understand her world any better than we can the mother's, and it says something of the viewers' ability to withstand realities that go against their own moral code without bringing out projections of their own. It's hard to swallow such egregiously vicious personalities without responding with an equal dose of aggression. But movies are interpretation, and mine is just one more amongst 6 billion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is a film that will give you many emotions throughout the movie, and let me warn you a lot of it is really tough to get through, especially Monique's portrayal of Precious's mother and the treatment she gives her. I know that was the point to get you sympathy for Precious, but that doesn't change the fact that it was incredibly hard to witness the torture that Precious was going through and I gotta be honest, it turned me off the movie sometimes, because it was too much. It helps though that they have blended in a few likable characters to help the torture that Precious went through. My favorite relationship had to be between Precious and her teacher later in the movie Mr.s Rain|Paula Patton| because it felt real and at last somebody wasn't trying to make her feel stupid. My favorite scene had to be when Precious is hungry so she goes to get some Chicken but bolts with it without paying, it was funny and quite cute in my opinion.Performances. Gabourey Sidibe is a revelation here. She is definitely Oscar worthy and I completely felt for the girl and the torture she was going through. Mo'Nique plays one of the most terrible characters I have ever seen in a movie. She has no likable qualities and I felt no sympathy for her, I was glad when she got what she deserved. Paula Patton is very pretty and does great as Mrs Rain. Her kindness helped sooth the movie for me. Mariah Carey is surprisingly terrific in her role. She displayed likability and charisma.Bottom line. It's grueling to watch, it's not always consistent, but in the end it had me thinking when it was over. The performances are one for the ages, and if you have the strength to get through this movie, I highly recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

You will never see any performances, or any movie, like this. A wonderful film like this one doesn't come around that often. Precious may be a fantastic film,and as Precious as it may be in the memory, the occurrings throughout the film,are not. Sidebe stars as Precious Jones, an overweight teenager who is being constantly abused by her insane mother(played by Oscar winner Monique who does the best job in this film). Precious probably has the worst life in the world.She has been pregnated twice(by her father),she is abused by her mother, and is constantly made fun of. But she is tough. Tough enough to fight her mother, and escape from their house. Eventually, she is taken in by a nice lesbian teacher(played by Paula Patton).There are a few cameoes also.One from Mariah Carrey, one from Lenny Kravitz(?)and I think somebody else too. Precious is occasionally very funny.But yes it's disturbing and not appropriate at all.At all.This is a film that won't interest some.More people probably would've went for The Blind side at the Oscars(not critics obviously cause most of the time they know what they're talking about).I agree that Monique deserved the award for best supporting actress. But Gabourey Sidebe definitely deserved the Oscar over Sandra Bullock. Bullock was good,but Sidebe was much better. Precious is one of the top three films of 2009.

		<shortDescription>Deserves Your Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hype is often undeserved, especially when it comes to films. Add to the fact that PRECIOUS had Oprah attached to it and you might back off even further. But there's no need. This film, for all intents and purposes, is a phenomenon that deserves your attention.Garnering two Academy Award wins and multiple, smaller award show prizes, Precious is ...well ...precious. The story could've gotten dark and downright depressing. I mean, we're talking about an abused, overweight teenager who's now into her second pregnancy (incestuous pregnancy, I might add), and one can see where you could surmise this to be a gloom-and-doom movie. It isn't. It's hopeful and surprisingly upbeat. And it's well-acted by a veritable group of unknowns.In the prime role of Precious we have Gabby Sidibe, a first time wannabe actress who serendipitously found the casting location and locked in the role. She was the perfect choice, and gave off a sense of foreboding and hope throughout the film's length. Her flattened emotional state at home, where she's abused by her mother, contrasts perfectly with her life outside where she's trying to better herself against tremendous odds.But if Gabby was perfect, the woman who played Mary (her Mother) was ...beyond perfection. Mo'Nique (BEERFEST) pulls in the performance of a lifetime. Uneducated, uninspired, confused, and ill-equipped to deal with just about anything, Mo'Nique played the part so beastfully that it was sometimes hard to watch what she might do next. She was the perfect manipulator.Direct Lee Daniels is one of those people who aren't afraid to steer directly into the path of controversy, and does so here with an able hand. You may have heard of his other successes; things like MONSTER'S BALL and THE WOODSMAN. No? Then I highly recommend you check them out if you enjoyed Precious.I would warn parents, though, that Precious has a very appropriate R rating attached. The scenes of incest (although short-lived) are vivid, and there's liberal use of violence against infants and teens, as well as language that'd make a porn-star blush. But all of it is done in an appropriate context, never for shock value.Precious deserves your attention. Not because it won an award, or because Oprah's attached to it. It deserves to be watched because there are too many kids out there going through this very same ordeal in social silence. Shame, despair, and anger eat at these kids. It's a miracle any of them come out the other side in a functional manner. Which is why Precious will inspire you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming but Still Superior to Most Hollywood Dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes question why I am usually really entertained by films focusing on depressing subjects. I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that I like films that portray realistic events such as Schindler's List, Das Boot, and Munich, which all focus on historical, yet depressing topics. I think another reason why I tend to like dark-themed films such as Se7en, Zodiac, and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is because depressing films are often shocking and succeed in putting the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. However, as much as I seem to like films covering depressing topics, it only works when the story has either a powerful message, is a realistic account of a historical event or is thrilling. Precious is at times shocking over how terrible a young, teenage African-American girl (Precious) is treated, yet I wish it focused more on how Precious is able to overcome the odds instead of concentrating on how the many hardships she must endure. By the end I simply felt sorry for Precious, instead of feeling like she overcame her horrific upbringing.The film Precious is based on the book Push by Sapphire. From what I know about the book, the film follows it almost down to the last word. From the moment she was born, Precious was given almost no chance to succeed in life. Her father began sexually abusing her when she was just a young girl and by age twelve Precious was pregnant with her first child (her father's). Her mother does not have a job and spends her time sitting at home awaiting her welfare check. Even when Precious has an opportunity to attend a good school, her mother simply wants her to stay at home and cook. Despite all these setbacks, Precious eventually finds a mentor at an alternative school named Ms. Rain. With the help of her new teacher, Precious gains the courage to stand up to her abusive mother and takes control of her own life. Now even though Precious learns something about herself, there are certain points within the story that prevented me from believing that Precious was going to be okay in the long term. In short, I didn't feel hopeful for her future.Overall, Precious is a powerful story about a young girl who learns that the only person she needs to listen to is herself. Unfortunately, I often felt the film tried to hard to push the personal difficulties that Precious had to go through. Still it succeeds at showing the life of a broken home in Harlem during the 1980s and how one mentor can affect the life of young adolescents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerhouse performances in an uncompromising film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Harlem in 1987, "Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' By Sapphire" takes us to a world that most of us will be fortunate enough never to have to experience first hand - one where troubled adults produce even more troubled offspring, where individuals, ignored and abandoned by the society at large, struggle to survive in a self-perpetuating cycle of hopelessness and despair. Just by the mere act of taking us to this world, the movie at least forces us to acknowledge its existence. Whether or not we choose to do something about it is a whole other matter.This harrowing drama, adapted by Geoffrey S. Fletcher, focuses on Claireese 'Precious' Jones, an introverted, inarticulate and overweight 16-year-old victim of incest who is already pregnant with her second child from the father who regularly rapes her. Though filled with dreams of a better life, Precious is caught in a vortex of misery from which there appears to be no escape: grinding poverty, a mother who abuses her (physically, sexually, psychologically), a school system that is failing her, and peers who harass and torment her on a regular basis (though she is certainly streetwise and physically imposing enough to give back as good as she gets). Small wonder, then, that the youngster has no friends and zero sense of self-worth. Only in voice-over recitation is Precious able to articulate her innermost thoughts and feelings and, even then, those reflections are strictly limited to the vocabulary and reference-points familiar to her from the harshly circumscribed environment in which she lives. Yet, those reflections are no less heartfelt and sincere for that. Even the dreams she has for her own life - of becoming a world-famous singer and dancer - are fueled by the clichés of the pop culture world that surrounds her and, hence, are in no way realistic or achievable for a girl in her situation.The small glimmers of realistic hope that do find their way into Precious' life come in the form of a remedial reading program she enrolls in after her pregnancy forces her to leave her current school, and the caring and compassionate teacher who is the first to unlock some of the potential trapped deep inside the young girl's damaged psyche. Precious is convinced that no one loves her - worse, that, since every form of love that has come her way up to this point in her life has been hurtful and damaging, that love itself must, by definition, be hurtful and damaging as well.Directed with unhurried restraint by Lee Daniels, "Precious" is a showcase for some amazing female performers who, in the short time we spend with them, make an indelible mark on our spirits and hearts. Paula Patton is very good as the attractive lesbian teacher who reaches out a hand of friendship to the troubled girl, as is a de-glamorized Mariah Carey playing Precious' social worker, Ms. Weiss. But it is Gabourey Sidibe, in her film debut as Precious, and comedienne Mo'Nique (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this role), as the monstrous mother from hell, who create unforgettable portraits - the first, of a girl who holds everything she feels inside herself almost to the point of emotional implosion, and the second, of a woman who can't react to the world around her except through an uncontrollable paroxysm of anger and rage.The movie occasionally interrupts the grim narrative with fantasy sequences that reflect Precious' desires to escape from reality - including, most bizarrely, one in which she imagines herself as a character in the Sophia Loren movie "Two Women," of all things. Random but definitely interesting.Uncompromising in its realism, yet still daring to hope, "Precious" the movie perfectly reflects Precious the person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a emotional powerhouse, with excellent and a well written scrip. When I first saw the trailer, I had no interest in watching it. But the only reason I did go see it is cause of Paula Patton, and she played a very important role in the film. I was surprised to see that Mariah Carey also played a important role in this film and also played a important role, plus I really couldn't recognize her without makeup. Lenny Kravitz has a brief role and he loses all his glamor as well. Precious might be ugly on the outside, but you can't help but sympathize with her. It's about a obese black girl named Precious that goes through a very difficult and harsh times and while this is going on her escape is to fantasize about her being a star. But things just get worse and worse for the girl to the point she is in total agony. Despite all the hardships that is shown in the film, it leaves a light at the end of how to stand through difficult obstacle in life.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely worth the unsettling drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that "Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire" is a tough film. The harrowing story of an overweight illiterate 16-year-old girl pregnant by her father for the second time and living with her abusive mother is not the fare most of us go to the theaters for. But sometimes we need a more eye-opening film experience to jar us from the comforts of eye candy action/adventures and Jello pudding romantic comedies. "Precious" is one of those films worthy of enduring. Director Lee Daniels, in his second effort from behind the camera, is privy to the troubling nature of his film and he adds a subtle layer of beauty and comedy that lifts "Precious" above other social issue dramas that bury themselves in conflict and strife. It makes the story of Clareeice "Precious" Jones seem undeniably like non-fiction when it in fact is not.A teenager with all the problems mentioned above, Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) lives in Harlem in 1987 and has been suspended from school because of her second pregnancy. The principal recommends an alternative school that will teach her to read and get her GED. She hesitates because after all, her mother (TV comedienne Mo'Nique) tells her she's useless, should've been aborted and that there's no sense in anyone teaching anything to a girl too dumb to learn.Precious believes all these things about herself and to make herself feel better, whenever she doesn't want to confront her issues, she fantasizes about being a movie star or a famous singer with a light-skinned boyfriend. Geoffrey Fletcher's excellent script gives us all these fantasies and daydreams (like Precious seeing her and her mother getting along in the Italian movie they watch on TV) along with all the flashbacks to traumatic events as well. These scenes are where Daniels gets to use his artistic flair to lighten up the film and show us more abstract ways to think about this difficult story.The film follows Precious' growth as her new class, classmates and teacher (Paula Patton) help her find a meaningful relationships and sense of family and community as well as give her the valuable skills of reading and writing that she can use to carve out her own life.Everything you've heard about Mo'Nique's performance as the mother is true. Her character is a wrecking ball and her performance swings that ball in an emotionally devastating manner. The way she treats her daughter while all she does is watch "$100,000 Pyramid" and collect welfare checks that she obtains deceitfully is enough to make anyone's blood curdle. But playing a horrible person alone doesn't make you Oscar-worthy. I don't know how on earth she's able to take this monster and squeeze a confession out of her that's so strikingly real and nearly pitiable, but she does. Her psychology of Mary is so complete that although you won't forgive her, you certainly understand."Precious" is worth the more unsettling film experience. It's not a story with a happy ending, but it shows that no one is a prisoner of her own circumstances. That anyone, as long as they seek out some form of help, can take that first step toward changing her life or at least feel comfortable if not proud of who they are. At first, Precious sees a pretty white girl when she looks in the mirror. By the end, she sees who she is meant to be. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Precious" the kind of film studios should be making more often nowadays. It's boldly confronts a real-world issue that people typically turn away from, and it tells its story brilliantly."Precious" centers on the plight(s) of young Precious Jones (Gabourney Sidibe, and good), an overweight and impoverished black teenager. Precious is pregnant with her second child (by her own father), and she's forced to live in constant fear of and service to her monstrous mother, Mary (Mo'nique). The film sees new potential opportunities appear for Precious, but it doesn't shy away from the immense obstacles that tower above her.Some critics have complained that "Precious" is too tough to watch. I don't see that. The film shows scenes of brutal domestic violence and heartbreaking discussions, but it also has a heart. The film's texture is rich, due mainly to the superb supporting cast. Mo'nique is chilling as Mary, especially in her final scene. Paula Patton is inspiring as a teacher who strives to do what is right for Precious. Most surprisingly of all, Mariah Carey is pitch-perfect as a social worker who wants to help, but can't quite connect."Precious" features great performances, a bold script, and iconic visuals. Aside from Precious' dream sequences, which were better realized in the novel, the film works extraordinarily well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a teacher, who has worked in some disadvantaged high schools, I know what it is like to have worked with children in tough situations. Children who don't come to school with any food, children who don't have clean clothes, children who don't have any ambition or hope in life.This film speaks to all those students out there who have no hope, yet still strive to make things better for themselves. I know what it is like to talk to a student, and ask them what they want out of life. What I have heard in return would rip peoples' hearts to shreds. It is not much that many people want out of life...yet to many, it is taken so much for granted.So for all those people who think they have it tough...this is the film for you. The acting shines as a beacon of hope for anyone who is struggling in life. No matter the obstacle, no matter the hardship, there is still hope if you believe in yourself, and believe in a better future.Precious is the soul of anyone who hopes for a better tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to watch "Precious" I was expecting another Hollywood "rags to riches" story or something similar. What I found was something almost completely opposite. Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe plays a quite profound character - Precious - that lives in a broken home with a mother (Mo'Nique) who seemingly can't stand the sight of her. Also illiterate, obese, and very poor, Precious doesn't give up but keeps moving on.There are two strong performances in this movie, one by Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe which I've already mentioned, the other by Mo'Nique. Mo'Nique takes on her role as a jealous and abusive mother perfectly. She delivers her dialog so well that you wouldn't believe she was acting. You'll be able to understand her character and believe in her character with complete validity. I would be happy to see her win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars this year. The movie also features some other cast members you've probably heard of including Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz. The other performances aren't the greatest but they are taken on well enough."Precious" is a story that is both heartbreaking and inspirational. Some fault the movie by saying it contains too much pain to seem believable, but that really is the movie's lesson. It doesn't matter how bad life is there is always hope. The movie also shows the stubbornness and folly of the human mind, and how we can be blind to things right in front of us. Overall it is one of this year's best and is sure to get some nominations at the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I watched Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire for the fact actress Sidibe most likely will win best actress. In addition, Mo'Nique was getting a lot of praise. The biggest surprise and another reason I needed to see Precious, was the words: Mariah Carey and good acting were in the same sentence. That alone is the price of a ticket for the surprise of the century.Truth is, they all deserve it. The movie itself was good, or very good, though hard to watch at times. If you can put up with almost two hours of physical, emotional and sexual abuse, you might be able to see the very fine performances of the ladies I just mentioned. Also, you will see the truism and excellent transitions of the characters. For example, any time away Precious (Sidibe) has away from her very abusive mother, whether one day, one week or several, you will honestly see the sun rise from behind the horizon. She's typically shy, quiet, angry, depressed ? all typical of those who spent years abused and ridiculed, but with free time, or mother-less freedom, she opens, ever so slightly. This is why I liked the movie, and Sidibe's awesome performance.The heartbreaking story is of a heavy weight 16-year-old girl who gets kicked out of school for her second pregnancy in the late 1980s. She's obviously closed in, angry, depressed, withdrawn. (By the way, this doesn't come natural for real life Sidibe, but you can't tell in the film. True acting.) Her only release, it seems, is when something really bad happens, she begins a daydream of fame/fortune ? her way of dealing with the lemons she has been dealt.It turns out, her mother is an enormously abusive, racist, possessive alcoholic and drug addict. Beyond belief. There's obvious layers (to be revealed later) on why she is so mean and condescending and due to the depth, I think Mo'Nique also deserves a nod. She's also successful in bringing her daughter, Precious, to absolute lows that Precious does put up with it, albeit with a little abuse thrown back.Thankfully, being expelled from school is the best thing for her. She gets thrown into an "alternative" school where a "Lifetime TV" teacher grants her new life as does the pending baby she eventually gives birth.The best reason to see this movie is the so-underlining grants of hope, as previously mentioned with Precious's time away from home and the performances, so demanding. The only problems I had was a little of the pacing and the aforementioned "Lifetime TV" teacher, while good, was a bit clichéd.It's a tearjerker, it's heavy on drama and extremely hard to take with the racism, abuse and sexual assaults, but if you see the world through the eyes of someone who really had to live this type of life and attempts at making it all better, it's worth a viewing. And a high recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see film about sensitive subjects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen a lot of good movies during December and January, my one conclusion is that our 'Precious' from this movie ought to meet Big Mike from 'Blind Side' and then we might get a touchdown and then a real good American film might be in the offing.Well done Lee Daniels for restricting the story to a year in the life of Precious and not more because the positive message got across sufficiently. We were little, if anything, of Precious' Father and the Mother was one of the most foul mouthed characters ever released on the big screen, well acted.Nonchalent strangely defensive role played by 'councillor' mariah carey as Miss Weiss.Not an Oscar film for me, it is a very entertaining film but not enough punch in the film to be up there for major awards. More of a documentary than a movie, though nothing can discredit the quality of the acting by Precious and her Mother.There was one scene which puzzled me. On my DVD version, nurse John was walking up to the reception of the school with Precious and the film suddenly cut to conversation between Precious and the teacher.There were many inconsistencies in the film but they can be glossed over. I am thankful for them because this was the kind of film not to be perfect but to show adversity and how someone can be determined to deal with their personal nightmare situation.it also shows the failing of social welfare in western countries, perhaps another message Lee Daniels wanted to get across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the most powerful film of 2009, with some equally powerful acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every single year, there is always one movie that seems to come out of nowhere and somehow gains enough critical acclaim for it to be nominated for best picture. While most people may argue that some other films this year deserve that title, i strongly disagree, considering that all the films that are nominated, spent even a short while in main stream theaters........all except this one. So needless to say, this could very well be the underdog story of the year. Only one word can describe this movie........Powerful. This film hits you right in the gut with its story. Not since "Revolutionary Road" has a movie really grabbed my emotions quiet like this film did. It is extremely sad and depressing, and does a phenomenal job of capturing the life of a over weight, poor, black 16 year old girl who is pregnant with her second child after her father has raped her. Needless to say, the movie is filled with a lot of emotional sequences. And the other thing that i really appreciate is how they didn't beg for your emotions.......they really work on bringing it out of you. They don't take the obvious route by having the main character crying her eyes out in every scene. She starts out being very strong and silent........but little by little, she places these horrible events of her life on display, and they are enough to damn near break your heart. I don't know anything about living in the slums or the ghetto.......but i do the see the product of those environments everyday, and the way they portray each of the characters in this movie is done so very well. Since we are on the topic of characters........this movie probably had one of the best female performances i have ever seen on film. Who would have known that Monique could act in such a powerful fashion. There were certain sequences where i literally could not move. And this is how you know when someone has done a fantastic job of creating a character........example..........you see one of the characters do something wrong, like say they break a expensive vase......before the other character even speaks, you silently say to yourself "Oh No"......because you already know whats coming.......they did such a great job of convincing you that they are this other person. Monique literally made my jaw drop at how well she did. Sure everyone in this movie did incredible, but it is easy to say that Monique stole the show. Of all the categories this year, she is the one i will be rooting for to win. Absolutely amazing performance. Bottom Line.......simply astonishing and powerful film. This movie will bring out every emotion you have in your body. It certainly is one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.......but do i think its the best?.....no i don't.......however...........if it is nominated, i wouldn't mind, nor would i mind if it did win.......it certainly does deserve it. So if you want to see a major surprise that im betting you will be hearing a lot about in couple of weeks, then you should certainly go and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like a tunnel-- dark but there's that light at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is a heart-gripping drama about an obese, illiterate and pregnant girl who lives with her abusive invalid mother in Harlem. Upon the birth of her second baby, which was sown in by her father, Precious decides to change her fortune by applying for an alternative school while battling the unknown and the harsh.The moment I first saw Precious' trailer, I knew this was a film to watch for. And I have to say I do not regret spending two hours in front of a computer monitor just to watch this superb film.Gabourey Sibide gave an outstanding performance as Precious. The way she acts seemed to reflect that numbness one gets from constant abuse, and you could really see her struggle to improve her fortune. The heart-melting scene where she finds out that she has HIV had me tearing up a bit, which is a sign that her acting is no less than effective and efficient. She might not be as well-known as her other costars but her efficacy levels them. I smell an Oscar for her, and they can never go wrong with her.Comedienne Monique meanwhile, gives such a monstrous yet memorable performance as the abusive mother. Monique holds nothing back--throwing pans and glass objects to her costar and even physically inflicting pain on her, and there even was this scene where she just threw a child down to a sofa! As much as she shone as an abusive mother and as efficient as her performance is in soliciting gasps of horror, the scene where she tries to reclaim Precious back was another proof that she could succeed Penelope Cruz. Her sob monologue was a bit cringing, translating all that suppressed hate and abuse to an expression of extreme apology. Like Penelope Cruz last year, I am betting my aces on Monique. Her portrayal of a hateful mother devoid of maternal compassion is haunting as it is awesome.Mariah Carey is never to be forgotten, so is Paula Patton. Carey shone as a social worker who refuses to be attached, but in one scene it showed that even in such a solid facade, she could not escape the penetration of extreme emotions. Paula Patton too, gives an endearing character of a teacher such a humanistic flair.In terms of story, Precious does not go bush rounding. It is as straight to the point as all the cuss words there and shows a fusion of realism and naturalism, with the best backdrop for such color-- Harlem, New York. The stark realism presents itself too on the sharply contrasted speech patterns among the different characters.All in all, the film can be compared to a tunnel. Lee Daniels directed it in such a way that you enter it knowing it will be dark, but as you progress to the end, you can see the light and the unknown yet lighted path that follows. It's something quite juvenile but nonetheless the execution was superb.Final verdict? Taking over Toronto and Sundance, Precious can never ever go wrong. Such socially and morally-conscious film with a beautiful layering of human emotion and spirit cannot be ignored. Just like Slumdog Millionaire, Precious captures the heart of the viewer, and with actresses preferring to go dirty over glamorous, the stark realism of the film will both haunt and inspire you. Not as apocalyptic as 2012, but it says one thing-- there is still hope.The Oscars can't so go wrong with this. Expect awards or nods, the least for Sibide, Monique, and hopefully Carey and Paton. And like the film, it will defy odds and hopefully win Best Adapted Screenplay, Director and Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very moving story. Some of the previews and trailers do it no justice though, they make it out to be a fairy tale movie, when there's little fantasy about it. Yes she (precious, the lead) wants to be someone else, but she gradually learns life isn't like that and she's stuck with who she is. For those thinking it's a clever piece of a large coloured girl pretending to be white as some trailers may suggest, that plays VERY little in the movie. The trailers should have focused not on her day dreams, but on the 'days'.This is a fantastic story of a girl, doomed from the very beginning, struggling like no other... and takes it, but slowly starts to think for herself and her actions change as she learns. Very clever writing and acting to perceive this, after all, it's slow moving, as is the rate she educates herself... but on this occasion the speed of the storyline is actually totally relevant to the movie. I don't want to spoil the story but trust me, this is a film which centres around a remarkably challenged individual in every facet of life and shows how she copes. The acting is first rate and totally believable for the situation, which I again stress is totally and utterly an up-hill battle.To anyone that enjoys proper drama...WATCH THIS MOVIE. Please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Can People Rationalize Actions Like That?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You're a dummy, b**ch. You will never know sh*t. Don't nobody want you, don't nobody need you." Good jeebus - imagine being told that every day you come back from work or school, but not before getting things thrown at you. Your mom runs up the stairs to beat you, and rapes you the next day. You think about when your dad sexually molested you and raped you since you were 3. You think about what life would be like as a movie star, a glorious dancer wearing beautiful shimmering gowns with lights shining for you.Scenes like this one were painted right from the start, to set the tone of the movie. If reading about it is hard to stomach, this movie leaves a stone in the pit of your intestines throughout it.I enjoyed the performance of Precious (played by 'Gabby' Sidibe). There were moments that the tone of her voice didn't match the scene too well, but the tone of the movie was all over the place. She plays a refreshingly real teen who has internalized all of the physical and sexual abuse in her character to the point that you could tell when her demeanor changed into hopelessness, every time she walked into her apartment.I've seen Paula Patton in Idlewild and am not satisfied with her acting chops. She seems too smug a character to make any real impact on Precious. But Mariah Carey... whew! What a change! Sober and on point, she fell into the roll of the social worker the instant she hit the screen.Monique's performance warrants a separate paragraph. During her final monologue, she rationalizes and excuses herself of physically and sexually abusing Precious. She played herself to be the victim so convincingly, I felt sorry for her and disgusted with her at the same time. I couldn't help but be convinced by her minute non-verbal ticks and her self-pitying attitude - that she was a real person. Is it just me, or is the true test of villainy the ability to completely convince yourself that your actions were fair, and dare I say it, right and just? The tone of the movie was all over the place. There were extreme dark moments mixed in with glamorous high points, smoothed over by hip hop and gospel. It left me all icky inside. The only two story arcs that were pleasant and not tainted by the darkness were the scenes after Precious gave birth and the last scene in the movie.So if I had to take a shot every time the word "b**ch" was used in the film, I wouldn't have been able to write this review. This is a great, fresh movie that deals with many psycho-social issues and its relationships in the ghetto. It was hard to take my eyes off the screen, even while I was eating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To call the film harrowing would be an understatement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is director Lee Daniels' adaptation of author Sapphire's novel Push, the story of an obese, illiterate teen mother (Gabourey Sidibe), pregnant with her second child by her father, who lives in a tenement with her disturbed, abusive mother (Mo'Nique). After being thrown out of junior high, the film follows her, sullen and basically non-verbal, as she is brought out of her shell by an alternative school teacher (Paula Patton) and a welfare case worker (Mariah Carey) and encouraged to tell her own story.To call the film harrowing would be an understatement. No punches are pulled ? Precious is subjected to every depravity a life of abuse and poverty can visit upon her. She is forced to steal chicken to eat, eats ten pieces and then vomits. She escapes periodically into fantasies of being on the cover of magazines, of being in "B.E.T. videos" with her "light-skinned boyfriend". Ultimately Precious is able, thanks almost entirely to the performances of Sidibe, Patton and Carey, to pull some sense of self-worth out of the absolute ruin that is her life and make some kind of peace with what pain her small world has afforded her from birth.The film played at Sundance and Cannes this year without distribution, and has built up a train-load of hype. After winning the Grand Jury prize at Sundance, director/producer/mogul Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey announced that they were coming on board to try and get the film distributed, which it eventually was, through Lion's Gate. It killed at TIFF, and with good reason: there is a lot to love about the film. Sidibe as Precious is fantastic, and an utterly atypical heroine; Carey's performance is muted and so stripped of glamour and make-up that she seems like a different person. Mo'Nique as Precious' mother is legitimately terrifying, as menacing and full of violent potential as Deniro's LaMotta. The story is the kind of story that never gets told outside of sad, obituarial news stories about children dead of horrifying abuse, as it's a story of such ruin that it's unrecoverable-from, for its characters. The only happy ending for a story like the one in Precious is one that is bargained for, dented and scuffed and compromised.Is it a great film? Ultimately, no. While the performances are stellar and the story original and the filmmakers bold for telling it, the film sags and gets loose too often. This is arguably a result or the result of trying to be faithful to the idea of using a barely-literate teen girls autobiographical writing as the propelling force behind the story, but the films (few, and small) problems are to do with what was seemingly left out of the film. It feels like scenes are missing, and relationships between characters (Precious and her welfare worker Mrs. Weiss, for example) are too often described in exposition (well-written as it is) instead of built organically. There's jerks and stops as Precious begins her journey to some kind of recovery, and there are as many unanswered questions as there are resolutions. Still, that those few flaws are the result of fidelity to the narrative thrust of an impeccably molded, original and fully-realized character like Precious is hardly more than nitpicking. Enough, maybe, to keep the film from being great, leaving it just very good. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with powerful performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best drama of 2009 so far, for me.The performances in this movie are very, very good; Sidibe and Mo'Nique are unforgettable. Precious' classmates are also exceptional in their supporting roles. One role I felt was weak was Paula Patton as the teacher "Blu Rain"; she seemed a bit miscast, and her character was not consistent.I think the reason that this movie worked for me is that is was NOT a sentimental, teary-eyed rendering of Precious' abusive situation - it could easily have gone down that path. The interesting thing about the movie to me was that every player (with the possible exception of the father, whose character was never developed) was a complex personality capable of evil and good.I was surprised at the reasoning behind the poor reviews that some have given this movie. One complaint was that this film exploits blacks and their situation, as a "stereotypical African American welfare story". At no time in the movie did I really think much about the fact that they were black - to me that simply the setting for the real story. Sure, the setting is a black ghetto, and Precious is a young black teenager, but the central theme is about sexual and physical abuse and the destruction that it causes. Unfortunately that scenario plays out in many places, it is far from being isolated to black ghettos. So I am sorely puzzled by that criticism. I have seen my fair share of exploitation films - and this isn't one of them.Another criticism was that there was no clear purpose to the film. This is even more confusing; the clear purpose of the film is to illustrate the horrific nature of abuse, and to draw the viewer into the a deeper understanding of both the victim and the abuser.Even though this is not easy material, I would recommend this movie to any adult. If you are looking for something light-hearted or superficial, this might not be the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie made an absolutely horrible situation, watchable. i have met many people in my life who have been through very similar situations, it is hard to hear the details, i cant imagine making a movie about it. the director did a great job of telling a story, that for the most part, had not been told , because there was no nice way to do it. polite society does not talk about issues like this, but we lost our manners a long time ago. i think the time is right to tell this story, because now society can handle it. i am also very sad that it took so long for a movie like precious to be made. things like this happen all the time. it is rear to hear news stories about situations like this, but we're starting to hear about then now. this issue needs to be brought to the forefront so that we do more to save children from this nightmare, they call life. precious does a great job of putting this topic in the spot light. well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful but depressing film! Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came home from the theater saw "Precious" what a film" so real so honest so true to life..Powerful stuff that unfortunately "white America doesn't know much about".... I was so moved I cried... several times What performances esp. by Gabourey Sidibe as "Precious", and Mo'Nique as her mom..They should be Oscar nominated this year But the entire cast was wonderful ..couldn't believe that was Mariah Carey as Mr. Weiss excellent too as was Lenny Kravitz and all. I was a teacher in an "alternative school" in Newark NJ and couldn't believe the nightmare stories I heard there in my 6 years at that school... Also heard similar stories in my previous 27 years in a non alternative school A Junior High School also in Newark..These kids had problems and we had to be compassionate but we also wanted to teach..and guess what? most of these inner city students really wanted to learn but the problems they faced at home etc..well, caused problems and at times interrupted and conflicted with the educational process. I taught students who were formerly incarcerated from everything to robbing cars, to attempted murder!! I had young girls, Like Precious who were raped by a family member (father,uncle cousin) etc... Very common in black society but also in most cultures as well. I pushed on to teach them some science I would reward them with every positive attempt and effort... and help them in any way I could without overstepping my bounds.. If I suspected something ,unlike Ms. Rain ,Id have to refer suspected problems to the nurse or guidance staff...they handled the truly personal problems But it was a rewarding experience...and this film is so well done so accurate BRAVO to the entire cast crew ,director, producers and all ! ITS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FILMS EVER MADE!!! I rated a 9 instead of a 10 because it did depress me quite a bit &amp; bought back some horrible stories about my students in Newark NJ who really deserve better and shouldn't be receiving the negative "raps" that they are from late night comics like Lettermen &amp; now Leno. Newark,NJ where I was born is a city that is truly making great strides to improve itself..The mayor, Corey Booker has his hands full but he's well qualified and equipped...Thanks for listening!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look for the light through the darkness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I have not read the book (yet!), but this is not your average everyday story. In a nutshell, this movie is about Clarice "Precious" Jones, who is abused in no ordinary manner. Not that abuse is at all ordinary but what she goes through is nothing short of madness. Raped by her father, beaten up by her mother, illiterate and struggling to improve her life, director Lee Daniels takes us through her journey. Mo'Nique who plays Precious' mother is by far the strongest part of this film. She took on a very difficult character and brought it to life in a grand way. We cannot but be hate her and feel sorry for her all at the same time. Newcomer Gabourey Sidibe does a good job as Precious. She gives a heartfelt performance as a girl who, through the tough times, still dreams of a better and bigger life. She does not let go of her dreams and that is, in my opinion, the main message of the movie: " Look for the light in the darkness".Notable performances by Mariah Carey (almost unrecognizable - almost!) as a social worker and Paula Patton as the kind hearted teacher who sets out to help Precious write and deal with her issues. Overall, a well made film. Not outstanding but still worth watching.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope, it just got ridiculous - very quickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regard myself as a pretty sensitive person. I was deeply moved by films such as Schindler's List, Click, I Am Sam and Kramer vs Kramer. I have no problem getting emotional about films if they are powerful enough. I don't even have a problem shedding tears if the film gets to me sufficiently. However, Precious didn't to this to me at all. In fact, it was exactly what I feared: ridiculously cruel to the protagonist for an hour and 45. I don't know what the book is like, because I haven't read it and I'm not going to after seeing this film, but it really does seem like the typical ultra-traumatic piece of literature. "Let's take every imaginable misfortune and PILE it on top of this hapless girl. Let's see, what have we ... Oh yeah, let's ... - Make her extremely obese - Have her father sexually abuse her - Have her mother be a total slut - Have her mother beat her and throw stuff at her constantly - Make her school mates bully her - Have her come from a broken home - Have the street punks hit her and push her down onto the pavement - Force her to eat deep fried junk food every single day - Make her moneyless - Make her first child handicapped - Make her pregnant with a second child which will get her kicked out of school ... Oh yeah, and the icing on the cake: let's give her AIDS!It just got SO ridiculous in a hurry. No person alive has ever been so unfortunate and after 15 minutes, I was just completely unmoved by it. And sure enough, it turns out that the book took the misfortunes of several people and combined them into one, but many people insists on seeing this as "the truth" for a lot of black women in Harlem - please!And Sidibe ... honestly, I must agree with Howard Stern about this: she is NOT a fabulous actress at all. 95% of the time, she just sits there without batting an eyebrow and she's so obese she can barely speak properly. Making out the syllables exiting her mouth is more or less impossible and I was not impressed at all with this girl. I'm not saying she is horrible but a nominee for best actress? Come on! Her extreme obesity was the only reason she was nominated for anything.I'm glad it was Mo'Nique who got the Oscar. She is really, really good and one of very few reasons why this film gets 5 instead of 3 from me. Her and Paula Patton, who is always very charismatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Virtual Culture Shock Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard about "Precious" because of the awards buzz that swirls around it these days. But the characters and story seemed so depressing, frankly, I was not really excited to watch it. However, when I learned that its newcomer director Lee Daniels was nominated by his peers for the Directors' Guild prize, I felt I needed to see how good it really was.Viewing this film is not easy. It is a virtual culture shock experience. It is very intense. Any scene of Precious (Gabourney Sidibe in her screen debut) and her sadistic mother Mary (played to the hilt by comedian Mo'Nique) were very difficult to watch for its violence and emotional manipulation. They did not look like actresses playing roles in a movie. They looked like an actual obese illiterate black 16-year old girl and her monstrously abusive mother in a stark documentary film. Does this "mother from hell" character really exist?! Unbelievable! After hearing the very PROFANE language (caps on purpose) and witnessing the various forms of abuse (sexual, physical, verbal, emotional, mental) throughout the film, you do get sucked and immersed into Precious' sad world. You can smell the stench of their sorry little apartment and feel the creeping dread every time her mother calls her. Director Lee Daniels succeeds in elevating this material from what could have been just another turgid, schmaltzy, heavy-handed drama. There is heart in there somewhere in Precious' messy life, as well as a hopeful redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This will be in my top 3 favorite films of the year by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious: Based On The Book By Sapphire is not only one of the 3 best films of the year, but probably one of the best films of the decade. The film features an amazing first performance from Gabourey Sidibe as Clarice "Precious" Jones, a morbidly obese teenage who lives with her abusive mother, Mary (Monique, in not only a powerful performance that screams Oscar but in what is probably the best performance of the past 25 years.) Precious is also raped by her father, and is pregnant with her second child that she got by her father raping her. One day, she goes to an alternative school where she meets her new teacher, Ms. Rain (Paula Patton, another great performance in this film.) While I'm mentioning all these great performances, two other great performances are Lenny Kravitz as Nurse John, and an unrecognizable Mariah Carey as Clarice's well-fare agent, Mrs. Weiss. The film is expertly directed by Lee Daniels, and never loses its powerful touch. While it's a constantly powerful film, it is also filled with great humor and a lot of nice touches and great surprises. I suggest you go see Precious right away, because I guarantee if you have a heart and soul, you will love and be moved the same way I was by this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Color Purple" of the 21st Century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting that Oprah's debut was "The Color Purple" and that her announcement that her show will be ending, is adorned by this film "Precious". A young woman (girl, actually) is brutally abused and deprived. Her humbled courage and patience is tested over and over again. There is her vengeful and sadistic mother who masturbates her level of comfort through the shambles of her horrible pitiful life.There is also her robot like, seemingly indifferent cardboard kind of a grandmother and the cruel senseless garbage quality of her environment. All of it cannot crash down on her to squash her spirit. And, if all of that was not enough, she is handed an almost certain death sentence which infects the viewer with sadness, guilt and ....yes, optimism. A miracle!The film presents almost nothing cinematographically new. It has the "cookie cutter" "cold cuts" of miserable/deprived/crude/ungrateful bunch of inner city kids and a kind, loving, do-good teacher. Mind you, she is a lesbian, therefore goodness gracious etc. What else is new? "Precious", that's what. The heavy gold persona of this huge/little girl (her mother is of lead) makes all the difference. We do love her. We sympathize, empathize, resonate with her misery, defiance, resistance and applaud her resilience and the steadiness of her soul. I can't recommend this film - it makes you sad and upset, but I don't regret seeing it and, as I write it, I cry for yet another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is a movie that stays with you long after the movie has ended and the lights have come on. I went to see this last night (11-18-09) with a friend and from the opening to the credits its a movie that affects you, it hits you in the gut and my eyes welled up many times. "My name is Clareece Precious Jones, I want a light skinned boyfriend but first, I want to be in one of those BET videos" is the opening line. Precious is 16, illiterate and pregnant with her second child by her biological father. She can't read or write and her mother, played almost too real by Monique, is abusive both physically and emotionally. Mariah Carey plays social worker Ms. Wiess and Lenny Kravitz plays a nurse who along with Sherri Shepard round out the star studded cast as almost unrecognizable as they have been stripped of the glam and made to look all to real. what saves the movie, and yourself, from jumping off a cliff or going into a downward spiral is Precious herself who somehow, remains positive even though the odds are stacked against her. after you see precious, i doubt you will see life the same way again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is a film not for the faint of heart. It is just not a film, but rather a cinematic experience! The strongest aspect of this film are its performances, anchored brilliantly by Mo'Nique and Gabby Sidide. What is amazing about is the film's ability to shock you in ways that most others don't . As Mary, Mo'Nique conjures up a character so horrible and evil, that you almost feel as if you are experiencing a contemporary Medusa! Mo'Nique's brilliant portrayal of the abusive and mentally-ill mother steals every scene, which unabashedly makes her this year's Joker. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a strong mind to endure this incredibly shocking story. The final monologue by Mary is so amazingly portrayed by Mo'Nique! Overall, the film is bleak, brilliant and brutally honest! It is not to missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as its hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the movie was all I expected it to be, after all the hype I've read. That's a good thing. It's a gritty story about Precious, an obese, poor, illiterate, black teenager with an abusive mother and who's been impregnated by her father the second time. Doesn't get grittier than that. Yet in spite of all that, it's not a movie that shoves her problems on you so much as show you how simply living life can be challenging for many unfortunate people. And it's not all doom and gloom. It's punctuated by fantasy sequences into which Precious escapes when real life proves impossible to face at the moment, and at least there are some good people who come into her life.It was a tough watch but well worth it, especially since the actresses were great. It's hard to believe that Precious is Gabourey Sidibe's first role when she manages to convey a gamut of emotions from hope to naiveté to utter despair that would break a lesser actress. And Mo'Nique. Whoah. Despite the fact it's been proved that comedians can be good dramatic actors (see Whoopi Goldberg in The Color Purple), it was still startling to watch her performance. Even though as Precious's mother she physically and verbally abuses her and essentially blames her for "seducing her husband," Mo'Nique's big breakdown scene is powerful enough that she can evoke pity and the understanding of her motivations.And Mariah Carey, well, I have to give her some props. She isn't an amazing actress but she managed to get over her being Mariah Carey to turn in a decent performance. And now she's Mariah Carey, Screen Actors Guild Award winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's good about this film is that it is real to life, it does something different that other films like it don't do and that is incorporate comedy within the serious issues it touches, not in a way that is poking fun at the issues raised but in a smart way that actually entertains; drawing the audience to the story and at the same time raising their awareness of things such as abuse. This is a brave way to approach the issues but i think it works really well as life is funny, amusing things happen in life all the time entwined with serious things. The actresses that play the young girls are fantastic characters it makes you believe that its actually bunch of young girls talking and learning as the directing and acting is so real. Precious is a good character but the characters that amazed me most were Monique and Mariah Carey's characters. Usually Monique is associated with fun loving characters who you can laugh at and with, so when you see her in this role it is a surprising difference as she plays someone you as an audience member despise, she embrace's this role very well and plays it very convincingly. Mariah Carey is far from her usual glamorous self as a dowdy welfare worker, she also does a wonderful job portraying the role, I don't think anyone would have expected it of her as it's not the biggest of role's and the central plot is not anything to do with her character but she is very effective in it. Overall a very dramatic film definitely one to watch even just for some of then amazing performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost didn't want to see this film, because the trailers to this movie,show'ed how depressing and unpleasant this movie was gonna be. But after hearing so many good reviews, I decided to give this movie a look.Set in 1987, a teenager named Precious(Gabby Sidibe) is having the kind of life, you would not wish on anybody. She is pregnant with her second child by her own father.(Yes she has another kid by her own father, no what mean I by unpleasant). She's smart but can't read too well. And life at home ain't much better, her mother(the impressive Mo'Nique) constantly belittles and physically abuses her. Life seems to be pretty grim. But then Precious is invited to a school to help get her GED, And she feels things could start to look up. But the question is Will It?Not an easy movie to sit through,but I guess that was intended. Co-stars don't disappoint, like Mariah Carey, Paula Patton, and Lenny Gravitz. But the two performances I hope won't be missed by the Oscars are Gabby Sidibe, who is really good, and brings you too tears in one scene. And Mo'Nique who really surprised me in such a monstrous role. Also it makes time for humor and fantasy, It was great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Devastating Indictment of Parental Abuse and Power of the Human Spirit to Overcome Adversity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shadowboxer" director Lee Daniels deserves every award and honor that Hollywood and critics around the world can bestow on him for his electrifying African-American social problem film "Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire" that casts newcomer Gabourey Sidibe as the troubled heroine. This R-rated, 110-minute urban nightmare probably could not have been made without the help of both Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry. You can just imagine what derisive comments greeted this venture when the filmmakers pitched their idea about a theatrical release chronicling a year in the life of an abused obese soul sister. Who would want to suffer through a thoroughly depressing, often offensive movie about a big fat loser trapped in the ghetto? Indeed, when you watch the trailer for this film, you want to suppress a laugh because everything is so hideously horrifying about this poor girl's hopeless existence. She puts up with an incredibly monstrous mother who treats her as if she were own personal slave. Nevertheless, despite its uncompromising subject matter, "Precious" qualifies as an inspiring film that doesn't rely on sugar-coating and a happy ending. Sapphire wrote her 1996 novel "Push" in first-person and adopted a rough, stylized dialect to enhance its verisimilitude. Reportedly, "Push" was Sapphire's homage to "The Color Purple." Ostensibly, Lionsgate?the company that is distributing the Daniels film changed the title from "Push" to "Precious" to avoid any confusion between this powerful film and the lackluster Chris Evans &amp; Dakota Fanning science fiction epic "Push" (2009)."Precious" depicts in semi-documentary fashion the plight of an illiterate, grotesquely overweight 16-year old Harlem girl poised to give birth to her second child. Ironically, Claireece 'Precious' Jones (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) has never had a boyfriend. Incidentally, her first child is a four-year-old girl afflicted with Down's syndrome, and her tyrannical, potty-mouthed mother Mary (Mo'Nique of "Soul Plane") despises the adolescent and forces her mother to keep her. At school, Precious' classmates ridicule her Buddha-like physique, but she maintains a stoic imperturbability and ignores their insults. Meanwhile, Mary lets her incestuous boyfriend (Rodney Bear Jackson) rape her daughter while she stands in the background and observes this act of child abuse. No, there is no nudity in these harrowing scenes, but the content may be disturbing enough to alienate some audiences. In fact, Mary has allowed her out-of-control boyfriend to take advantage of Precious since the girl was three years old and mother and daughter shared the same bed with him. As the film unspools, Precious finds herself expelled from her high school because she is pregnant. The conscientious school principal arranges for Precious to attend an alternative school called Each One Teach One where drop-outs go to earn their GED. Precious learns to read and write under the tutelage of her instructor Blu Rain (Paula Patton of "Hitch"), a dedicated but kind teacher who inspires Precious to keep a journal about her life. Meantime, Mary never misses an opportunity to insult, torment, and batter her obsequious daughter. Precious takes everything that her wicked mother can dish out until she comes home with her infant son Abdul. Mary knocks Abdul out of her arms and begins to batter her daughter. Precious fights back, seizes her baby and flees. Precious is in such a hurry that she loses her footing and topples down the stairs. Meanwhile, mom lugs her portable TV outside and hurls it at her daughter. The television barely misses Precious and crashes into a million pieces. Eventually, after Precious has her son, she decides to left her impossible mother and goes to stay with Ms. Patton. If all this drama weren't enough, Precious learns from her mother that her father had contracted the AIDS virus. A brave social worker Mrs. Weiss (pop singer Mariah Carey deglamorized without make-up) helps Precious escape the abuse that her villainous mother doles out with a vengeance. Sure, this sounds as depressing as you can imagine because there is nothing far-fetched about it."Precious" ranks as a compelling as well as gripping cinematic experience with kitchen-sink realism about intolerance. What takes "Precious" to another level of celluloid sophistication is that Daniels takes us into the head of his protagonist, and we see everything from Precious' perspective in terms of her dreams and aspirations. She yearns to have a light-skinned boyfriend, beautiful clothes, and fame. Daniels delivers some incredibly surreal moments. We see Precious' thoughts turned into a movie that she is watching on television, Vittorio De Sica's "Two Women," about Italian refugees during World War II that adds another dimension to her wretched predicament. Apparently, Mary forced Precious to eat food even when she was not hungry. This abuse is alluded to in the movie as Precious sees it from her warped perspective. Another extraordinary scene occurs in Precious' bedroom as she is applying her make-up. The image reflected in the mirror is of a blond poster girl that occupies space on her wall. This ironic poster captures the escapist fantasies that fuel Precious's life and she falls back on to evade the constant harassment of her mother and her ugly physical environment. Musician Lenny Kravitz has a supporting role as Nurse John who takes care of Precious while she is in the hospital. Movies about social workers and the victims of parental abuse will never be the same after "Precious." Who would have thought that such an unrelentingly dire story with a first-time would have the sledgehammer impact that it delivers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping film! One of the year's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was worried that precious would be a melodramatic, over-blown film, but it touched a lot of marks. It had it's fair amount of melodrama, but it was all written, directed, and acted to the highest level. The film had surprisingly lots of funny moments, and lots of funny dialogue. The central plot about a girl named 'Precious' is very sad, and it rings true of real life situations like this. Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe was the perfect part, very inspirational, but very flawed character as well. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey shine for the first time in performances that should get them more recognized in the acting business. The whole cast was great, but the real stand-out was none other than Mo'Nique. She gives a powerhouse performance of the highest caliber. She steals her scenes, and she creates probably the most unlikeable mother to ever hit the screen. Her performance creates a character that is very disturbing and frightening to watch. She deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress no doubt. The screenplay did a great job of adding dream sequences, and the editing worked very well. I was surprised at how much different music and flashy styles the film had, but it all made the film stay out of the cheesy melodrama stage. Congratulations to this inspiring film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is hard. Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Harlem in 1987, PRECIOUS is the story of Claireece "Precious" Jones, a sixteen-year-old African-American girl born into a life no one would want. She's pregnant for the second time by her absent father; at home, she must wait hand and foot on her mother, a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically. School is a place of chaos. Threatened with expulsion, Precious is offered the chance to transfer to an alternative school. In the literacy workshop taught by Ms. Rain, Precious begins a journey that will lead her from darkness, pain and powerlessness to light, love and self-determination.By the looks of PRECIOUS, it may seem like a dark and depressing film to go through. With alternative and more entertaining films to choose from in the ticket booth, why in the world would you pick this film? I'll tell you why: PRECIOUS is an amazing film that seeks the light when it's surrounded in darkness. Yes, the film is not for everyone and it's not an easy film to sit through, especially through some uncomfortable scenes. Despite all of that, the film is uplifting and filled with hope.There are four main actresses in here that are just excellent: Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe is making her debut playing Precious. She brings a lot of light through the screen, playing a quite frank character. Paula Patton and Mariah Carey play two characters who try their hardest to help Precious get a better life. I think the former gives a fantastic performance, playing a poignant character. By now, you should know that Mariah Carey looks completely unrecognizable in her role, without all that makeup of her's as a singer. I think it adds a lot of realism to her character as a social worker.And last but not least, the comedian Mo'Nique plays the "villain" in this film. However, the film gives her more character than what you'd expect for a villain. She plays with such conviction and performs so well that it would be surprising if she didn't get an Academy nomination for her role. I also need to give a shout out to Sherri Shepherd. When you put the cast on paper, it sounds like a disaster: You have comedians and singers. Rarely do those type of people bode well in such a dramatic movie as this but they all seem to accomplish and overcome their typecasts with the help of director Lee Daniels. It's really amazing.Daniels plays the film in such a way that it's not preachy yet not subtle. Harrowing, grim, and optimistic, PRECIOUS is a powerful film with a beautiful message of the human capacity to overcome obstacles in life. It starts off dark but somehow finds a way to uplift and inspire you but not in a hokey nor manipulating way, something especially hard to pull off. Carried mostly by the shoulders of rising star Gabourey Sidibe, PRECIOUS is one of the best films of this year. Although hard to endure, you'll feel great, and almost changed, by the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Precious Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, this wasn't a film I thought I'd care to see. Like some, I'm tired of films and books recycling pain. And I certainly couldn't imagine how I would be able to appreciate Monique, for as much as I love her, knowing in advance what her role would be.Well let me clarify? Monique, interestingly enough the ONE reason I ultimately decided to go on and see the film, aside from Mariah who I love just as much, was PHENOMENAL!!! No over the top acting? as in over the top to exploit a bad situation, but rather this was a powerful performance given by Monique, and a supporting cast who all delivered raw, real, tremendous pitches, putting the polish on Precious' shine. *And Mongo I loved most! I give her a Standing Ovation!*The editing too, particularly the filtering of Precious' dreams through the movie, was a unique element that tastefully removed the cinematic feature to depict what real dreams are made from. This film deserved to win as many awards as it has? and I hope in the future will have to its credit.My only peeve, if there is to be a peeve, was the message I took from the ending. But since I don't like spoilers, I won't elaborate. Beautiful Film! Well told story. Way to Go Daniels &amp; Crew!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressed with Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this is my first review so there is the possibility that it might include spoilers! Clareece Precious Jones played by Gabourey Sidibe in the movie Precious is a black sixteen year old female who is overweight to the point of obesity. She lives in the New York city of Harlem with her mother (Mo'Nique) and has many hardships in her life. Some of the hardships she endured are an abusive mother and father, incest, being taunted and teased at school, pregnancy and child birth at a young age. I had watched the Oscar awards and seen the many things it had been nominated for which gave me an original interest in watching the film. Granted this type of movie is not one that I would normally watch, but nonetheless I was interested in seeing it.Unfortunately, this movie fell way short for me. The first time I watched the movie it was almost painfully boring. There are so many scenes where it is just a dead scene or filler material that could have been used in a better way. For example the seemingly endless stairwell, the ten foot hallway that seems to take her five minutes to go down. On top of the wasted time, the music didn't always seem to fit the situation. There would be happy music where there needed to be sad.With such a poor experience the first time I wondered if I hadn't just judged it harshly because I had certain expectations before seeing it. Not wanting to walk away from the movie with such a bad attitude towards it that could be false, I watched it a second time. The second time through was not as bad as the first but it really wasn't much better. I still got very bored during the long endless stairway and hallway scenes. However, the second time through I started looking harder for more positive things about the movie. The actors portray what would seem a very genuine and believable representation of their characters. The lighting seemed to be used in appropriate places. For example it would have a dark and desperate feeling when Precious was at home but whenever she was at school the lighting would be very bright and inviting. Still feeling I had missed something I watched it a THIRD time! I was still unimpressed with the movie, and the third time around was almost as bad as the first. I gave this movie more chances then I give most but it only let me down. I would not recommend this movie to any of my friends if only to save them time and the few dollars it takes to rent the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year there comes a moving, shocking and ultimately life-affirming drama that dominates the Oscar season and carves its way into cinematic history; this year, that film is Lee Daniels' latest feat "Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire". I am writing this fresh off the movie theaters and I feel as if all my concepts on life, love and the struggle for emotional freedom have been rocked. I feel as if I've witnessed something important, an eye-opening portrait of TRUE life in the suburbs of Harlem that question the meaning of happiness I've gained from the easy, comfortable life I've led so far. "Precious" is the kind of film that makes you want to embrace its main character, and look down on yourself and on how easy you've had it so far.Clarisse 'Precious' Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is a sixteen-year old African-American girl, extremely overweight, illiterate and expecting her second child from her own father, who raped her. She lives with her mother (Mo'Nique), a chain-smoking lazy bum who lives off welfare and who spends her every waking second alternating between watching TV and degrading her daughter. She's angry at Precious for 'stealing her man' and for having given him more children than she was capable of, and Precious- who's been subjected to a lifetime of conditioning to the fact that she's dumb, useless and hideously fat- accepts her mother's remarks and goes about her day listless, unmotivated and heavily depressed. She frequently imagines herself as a glamorous celebrity, loved by everyone and important to many, and she retreats into her daydreams every time something bad happens to her...which is every day.The film revolves around Precious and how she enrolls in a special-ed class (prompted by her school principal) to become literate, and she does this as a last resort to escape the foreboding meaninglessness of her life. Her teacher there (Paula Patton) and a social worker in charge of her case (Mariah Carey) constantly meet with her in the attempt of channeling her out of the dark depression she's been living in and shepherd her to a new, fulfilling way of life. This is a story about overcoming the deepest and most disturbing obstacles, about leaving the past behind and creating a future for yourself.Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique steal the show. Sidibe's an unknown actress, making her film debut with a complicated character to portray. There are so many faces and layers to Precious, so many subtleties and emotions to be handled under the rough shell she's built around herself, that the most veteran of actresses would have trouble portraying. And what's amazing is the fact that, in real life, Sidibe is quite the contrary to the Precious character: in an interview with Roger Ebert, we see the TRUE Sidibe as a fun, outgoing and intelligent girl who has everything going for herself. "I know this girl," she says of Precious, and it's amazing to see how this charming young actress has managed to delve into her role so perfectly to the point that you believe there hasn't been a better actress all year. And Mo'Nique (who I never considered to be a serious actress) plays the main villain so impressively and with such depth that you are literally left awe-struck at the work these two women have done. I can't find words to describe how good they are! I saw another Lee Daniels film before watching "Precious"; it was "Shadowboxer", and I saw it as a form of research before watching this film. It's amazing how Daniels takes the characters in his films and wraps around them infinite layers which we systematically pull off, little by little discovering a bit of their astounding personalities. Both films do as much, but what "Shadowboxer" lacked in plot, "Precious" makes up double. The film lasts a bit over two hours and it isn't a second too boring. It's a dialogue-driven story too, featuring long scenes where characters simply talk (or scream, or cuss) at each other; but the dialogue is so powerful and the emotions are so poignant that you're instantly absorbed into the mood and you let it transform you.The film doesn't even try to be ambitious- it's just telling you a story. But you feel as if the hard lessons Precious is learning are being imprinted on you too, and each blow she's been dealt stings you to the quick and makes you cry in disgust at the bleak world we live in...but it also makes your spirit soar to see how such an abused girl can overcome her traumas and find the hope to keep on living each day. This is no easy feat, and the film accomplishes it effortlessly.Before I began watching this, I had stereotyped the film as 'the year's drama that will try to make me cry, gasp in astonishment and fight (in vain) to move me.' How wrong can a guy be? I look back upon it now and I'm thoroughly impressed, moved indeed, and quite certain this is one of the best films of the year. See it at all costs! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter how many fat chicks you show me, this is boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, though not a popular "film" (I'll use that word very lightly considering it's shot on video tape) has quite a big reputation among gore hounds and fans of the horror genre. Since this movie apparently wants to be seen on a similar level as some of the horror classics, I will not hold back on comparing this movie to other, far superior, movies.One thing a lot of people are probably wondering is if the movie is as violent and over-the-top as its reputation has lead people to believe. The answer is yes. This is a very violent movie that goes pretty damn far, but the problem is that the movie is actually just boring. It is 77 minutes of people screaming back and forth. Yes, I understand it is suppose to have the pseudo-documentary feel to it, but that does not excuse the poor execution in which this movie is done. Why was it dragged out to 77 minutes anyway? So it is seen as a more legit movie? For something that seems to not have had a script, director, or paid actors, I think the running time should have been the last of their worries. The movie would probably have been much more entertaining if narrowed down to a good 40 minutes. In fact, there's a movie that does close to the same thing as this movie, and does it better in only 40 minutes. It is called The Devil's Experiment.The Devil's Experiment is superior in one very big way. That is that none of the characters talk. In Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, we are treated to the cast of characters just spewing swear words back and forth to fill in the long 77 minutes. Never once is there a sense that you are watching fat chicks on camera. You feel like you are just watching a group of people willing to do disgusting things for free. No matter how loud you yell, how many times you swear, or how many times you whip your dick out, that is NOT acting. Some may argue that the "real" people give a "real" feeling to the movie, which is true, but that is not an excuse. Since it is known that this is a produced movie with a budget, the viewer can already disregard any idea of any of this movie being "real." Real actors could have really helped this movie. They would not have to be famous actors, just people that actually know what they are doing. Take The Blair Witch Project for example. The actors in The Blair Witch were not famous at all, but since they actually had some talent the movie gave you a sense of isolation. Look at Cannibal Holocaust. The cast of Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire really should have taken a look at the cast in Cannibal Holocaust and taken notes. The first few times I viewed Cannibal Holocaust I had the feeling I was watching real footage. I know after watching the "making of" how the entire thing was made, but still have a hard time believing it was not real. Never once is there that feeling in Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire.Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire gives me the sense that they are trying to play this movie off as some sort of amoral art flick. This is not an art movie in any sense. It is hardly even a movie. You may think that just because you use a digital camera and show disgusting or disturbing imagery that you are Takashi Miike, but Miike has an understanding for how to truly shock people (and I'll give you a hint, it isn't by showing scene after scene of disgusting or "shocking" images).Whenever I see movies like this I just want to talk to the creators and tell them how they messed up. That is because this movie has some odd qualities to it, and does succeed on some levels. The problem is the major holes in it. If you want to make a truly shocking movie, give us a plot that we (the audience) can believe and characters that we can believe. You will find that movies that actually have these can be far more shocking when they deliver that shocking moment (Requiem For A Dream, Audition, Oldboy, etc).The shocking moments in Precious can be quite shocking, and I must say that some of the special effects are very good. Unfortunately, you can see practically everything that you see in this movie on the internet. In fact, there are far more shocking things on the internet than there are in Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire.I give this movie a three for having some very good special effects at times, but it was an effortless movie that does not even try to entertain an audience. The movie was shocking, but none of it will stick with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's as Precious as I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since John Singleton blazed on to the screen with his urban-crime epic drama Boyz N the Hood has a film been so honest, raw, and genuine in its delivery. Lee Daniels, who has had more success on his producing credit (The Woodsman, Monster's Ball) rather than his directing (Shadowboxer), has achieved a cinematic experience of epic proportions with his film Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire. Daniels' artistic liberties taken here are some of the finest seen in quite some time.The film is filled with tension, high strung drama, and painfully stricken images. The film tells the story of Clairece 'Precious' Jones, a sixteen-year old young black girl from Harlem who is still in Junior High School and is pregnant with her second child. Her abusive lifestyle has taken a toll on her life leaving an ignorant young woman with no sense of self-worth. When she is forced to attend an alternative school for underachievers, her outlook of life starts to change.Gabourey Sidibe, who plays 'Precious' gives the most outstanding breakthrough performance seen this year so far. Sidibe is completely committed to the agony and anguish that is worn all over Precious. Her role requires more responses with silence but don't let that fool you, that is the brilliance of the performance. Long stares at her mother destroying any remains of self-esteem she had in the first place, or speaking with her social worker speak about life with her mother and father. What I have witnessed with Sidibe should place front and center with Oscar this season. She's so accessible to your heart and capturing it from moment one on the screen.The ensemble cast particularly Mariah Carey, finally showing some admirable acting chops, Xosha Roquemore, who takes the charismatic student with an edge to a new level, and Paula Patton, who looks like Alicia Keys but giving more of a Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds take on a teacher-student relationship. But by now, you've all heard about the revelation that comes from comedian turned dramatic superstar Mo'Nique. Mo'Nique plays Mary, Precious' vicious and ruthless mother, who takes her disciplinary role one hundred steps too far. Who would ever think Mo'Nique had it in her? Stamping fear into the audience throughout the picture, her words punch their way through the screen and demand the viewer's undivided attention. She has locked herself into the Best Supporting Actress race with an almost assured win come March 2010.Geoffrey Fletcher's infusive script comes into serious question of being possibly one of the best adaptations in the past ten years. The narrative here is so strong and so well told that there are no blank spots to lose your thoughts. Some may argue that things come off over-dramatic rather than a natural crisis, I myself find it necessary and innate to get the point across effectively. Daniels' direction is also in need of praise and could find himself as the second African-American director nominated in Academy history. His choices here are artistically luminous and will be a benchmark for all future aspiring directors.The hype for Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire has been huge the past months and it succeeded all the expectations I had for it. I admit the expectations weren't high at all, I never believe any high hype from out in January. It was all worth it. This is the best film of the year.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 minutes into this beautifully done film, the tears began to fall. The acting is Oscar worthy from every angle, and the story can bring anyone to the ambition of becoming an anti child abuse activist. The pain of the lead character is not shown on screen, but felt in the hearts and minds of the viewers. I can still visualize the scenes of the film, with tears forming in my eyes. It is painful to feel the reality that many young women today are living the lives of the main character, even though the story is based on a novel. The reality is, child abuse is alive and ongoing within many urban households. Oprah's perception on the screen has made the issue hit home with this film. It is a must see by all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic depiction of a black teenage girl's horrific ghetto life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Precious' is treacherous ground for audiences and movie reviewers. How can you be critical of a 300-pound sexually abused, illiterate 16-year-old black Harlem teenager who betters herself? Moreover the film has the warm endorsement of Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry. Oprah says "it split me open," "I've never seen anything like it. The moment I saw (it) I knew I wanted to do whatever I could to encourage other people to see this movie." The film also comes with the mixed blessing of double prizes at Sundance and the audience prize at Toronto. The Weinstein brothers fought with Lionsgate for distribution rights; Lionsgate won. It almost makes you want to hate it, and there are things to criticize, but ultimately the movie is so bold, striking, eye-opening and thought-provoking that it inspires respect. The director Lee Daniels, a black man, has done respectably as a producer of 'Monster's Ball and 'The Woodsman;' as director he gets slicker and louder, with colorful visuals and a host of vivid performances. It's still hard to be tough on the subject matter. But is this a great movie? I don't think so.Clareece "Precious" Jones (excellent newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) is pregnant with her second child fathered by her own father. She is put down and ordered around by her lazy welfare mother Mary (the explosive and frightening Mo'Nique), who does absolutely nothing but smoke cigarettes and watch TV and expect Precious to cook for her and wait on her. It is the scenes between Precious and her mother that give the film its shock value. There are even brief flashbacks of her father having sex with her. Daniels says this film would "have been X-rated" if he had not introduced colorful brief fantasy sequences that come when Precious wants to escape from her life and imagines herself as a star greeting fans, dancing, escorted and adored by handsome young black men in tuxedos. Precious' voice-over, which is sharp, articulate, and somewhat detached at times, also provides a necessary distancing effect with materials that otherwise would be too harsh and Dickensian to bear -- or perhaps to believe, or take seriously. But the fantasies, in which Sidibe (who in real life is a smart college girl more like Precious' dreams than her reality) excels, also add to the slick artificiality that makes Precious feel too much like Darren Arronofsky's manipulative, over-stylized morality play, 'Requiem for a Dream.'Clareece/Precious is big, and sometimes violent, and after she hits somebody in math class who taunts her, she's sent to the principal's office. (She is relatively good at math, or thinks she is, and imagines the white male teacher likes, even loves her.) As a result of this encounter with authority she is transferred to an "alternative" G.E.D.-preparation school called "Each One Teach One," and here her fellow students, an assortment like a female ghetto equivalent of a 40's movie bomb squad, and their beautiful light-skinned black lesbian teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), become a second, better, family for Precious. Under Ms. Rain's patient tutelage she also begins to learn to read and write and speak correctly.While Precious is reading one of her journal entries, a "fantasy," she goes into labor. The baby is normal and a boy; she names him Abdu. Her previous child is retarded (or autistic?) and she calls her "Mongol" or "Mongo." The class and Ms. Rain rally round her in the hospital, and she meets a kind male nurse, John, played by Lenny Kravitz. Another piece of successful celebrity casting is singer Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss, Precious' welfare counselor.Precious has a horrible clash with her mother that causes her to take Abdu, break into Each One Teach One, and throw herself upon Ms. Rain's mercy. Ms. Rain finds a halfway house where Precious can be safe with her child, but Mary contacts Mrs. Weiss and demands that she be allowed to see the baby and meet with Precious in Mrs. Weiss' office. The film's most appalling moment among many comes when Mary tells Mrs. Weiss about the father's sexual abuse, and what she did, or didn't, do. The movie has Precous say nothing except to tell her mother she never wants to see her again and walk out with her baby. Later she learns she has AIDS, but the baby doesn't. The movie is set in 1986 when this was a terrible fact, but still Precous expects to finish high school and go on to college, and Ms. Rain is encouraging her to give up the baby for adoption so she can pursue an education.The film is more focused on depicting the girl's horrific situation than on presenting a rounded picture of Harlem life. Precious is larger than life in every sense. Emphatic closeups combine with the voice-over and the DayGlo daydreams to undercut realism further. Saying that this is "the truth" is to say it's a truth that we'd rather overlook, or that perhaps middle class African Americans might rather not think about, or white Americans might prefer not to know. But it's hard to claim as some do that Precious has "utter authenticity." Its "authenticity" is relative and highly cinematic. Lee Daniels has worked well with his well chosen cast and not gotten in the way of what they could do with the explosive material, and consequently, whether this needed another film festival boost or not, Precious seems likely to do better and get a wider audience than the director's previous films. It does so much to keep you from observing its over-simplifications and artistic shortcuts that you'd be hard put to do so, even if the subject matter did not scream at you to shut up.Shown at the New York Film Festival in October 2009. Also presented at Cannes, Toronto, San Sebastian, Tokyo, and London festivals. The be released by Lionsgate (limited) in early November 2009.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was very surprised to see some negative comments about this movie. I am not too sure if the persons leaving those comments are in any way filmmakers themselves! I highly recommend this movie. It is a very strong story, and Lee Daniels is the best person to tell it in a motion picture. The acting is superb. It is worth mentioning that, in my opinion, the most difficult cross over for an actor is to play a dramatic role where he/she has a comedic image. Robin Williams may be one of a handful of such actors who perfected this task without a hitch. Mo'Nique in her performance proves to be an outstanding actor who can cross over with a tremendous amount of talent and power. The story is brave and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have tried watching this movie many times but always decided not to because I wasn't in the 'deep drama movie' mood. I eventually watched it this afternoon because I had nothing to do. So, I started watching with, not exactly high expectations, just not low ones. I thought it'd be a really deep emotional inspirational touching story. It wasn't - at least for me. To describe this movie with one word, I'd say disgusting. There were just too many sick disgusting scenes, I don't care what point the writer or whoever was trying to make by putting in those parts, they were just down right disgusting. I mean, I wouldn't mind a scene or two, but this, the whole movie, just too much. I don't want to mention specific parts as it might be regarded as spoilers, but if you have watched this movie you'll know what I mean. I really found it very hard to watch because of all this, the sickening repulsive vileness is contained. I actually found myself on the verge of throwing up and many times have I looked at the play bar thingy to check how many more minutes left till the end. Besides the yuckiness in this movie, the script was just bad. I felt that the scenes weren't properly connected and the whole movie just didn't have that smooth flow. It lacked a sense of continuity, if you know what I mean. It was as if there were parts missing or something. It seemed incomplete, especially the dialogue and the main flow of the story. Overall, I think the movie is over-rated and frankly I was shocked by the amount of people rating it a 10. 10? Anyhow, the actual story was very typical and stereotypical too. There was nothing new or interesting, the only reason I continued watching the movie was because I though it was a pity I wasted an hour or so doing that, so I better just finish it you know xD. I didn't find the movie inspiring or anything, I didn't like the story and the plot but the acting wasn't bad at all. It was the actual content of the film that made me dislike it to this extent. I'm not even sure a 5 is honest enough.=)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing appealing about these characters and Claireece "Precious" Jones is anything but precious.Watching a story of sloth, poverty, obesity, welfare, incestuous rape, parental abuse, retardation, bastard children and AIDS does not make for entertainment.Nor does this horrible movie provide an object lesson - at least not the way it's handled here.There is absolutely NOTHING uplifting or inspiring about this lousy flick. It is a depressing and pointless waste of time about unappealing and miserable people.The shock card is in play and the sympathy vote is solicited. These individuals made themselves what they are.It is simply a vehicle to exploit emotions and make more money for the billionaire executive producer OPRAH - don't waste your money and time seeing it. For the viewer, there is nothing to be gained from watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check out "Precious"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw "Precious" at an advanced screening last night. Pretty impressive film. The lead, Gabby , gives a fantastic, honest performance of a societal reject who's esteem and self worth has been eradicated by her loathsome mother and the people around her. Paula Patton(where did she come from?) has an amazing presence as Precious' caring and concerned teacher (Best scene in the film is when she commands Precious to write despite recent adversity). Also, Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz can act. Damn. Powerful, strong cinematography and honest direction.The only problem I had with the film which is unfortunately a major one, is with Precious' mother, Mary. Let me say Mo'Nique plays the hell out of the role and god bless her for that but the director Lee Daniels (fine work otherwise) has given us way too much of a one-leveled, evil, tyrant witch who's reality comes across as false in an otherwise very real world. When she moves towards an attempt at redemption we almost see a glimpse of an honest human character but she doesn't quite get there.Sorry to make it a big deal but the relationship between Precious and her mother is so important in this story that it had to be addressed. Otherwise, a very powerful film that should definitely be checked out. *** out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most disgusting movies I have ever watched to date. Although I will admit that the acting was superb I can not bring myself to give this movie a 10 because the story was so disgusting. Sidibe was molested by her father as a baby while her mother watched. She was also molested by her mother. Sidibe would later go on to be impregnated with her daughter/sister by her father. Sidibe was also beaten on a regular basis, lived in squalor and stole Fried Chicken from a local hole in the wall. When she was running down the street eating fried chicken, I died with laughter. I give high accolades for the acting to Kravitz, Cary, Paula and Monique. Avoid this movie at all cost. Also I'm beyond sick of all this political correctness surrounding weight. If you're fat as hell; then it is NOT healthy, end of story. If you are OBESE like Sidibe; then you probably have problems breathing, walking and digesting food not to mention the high chance of having heart problems, bad knees and diabetes. Fat is Wack and I don't care what Sports Illustrated Says. As our country becomes Fatter of course the movies, magazines, clothing companies and etcetera need to adhere to what is in demand and for who is demanding a product.Oh yeah, Sidibe's first child by her father had Down Syndrome. Great Story....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1987 Harlem. Sixteen year old overweight Claireece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) gets pregnant with her 2nd child by her absentee biological father. She lives with her abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique) who uses every trick to get social assistance. She gets placed in a special class taught by Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) who discovers her illiteracy. Her daughter Mongo has Down Syndrome and lives with her grandmother. She often daydreams to get away from her horrible life. Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey) is her social worker.There are some dark performances. I would probably like less of the dream sequences and stay with this dark world. The dream world gets too extended and only serves to draw me out of the movie. The performances are powerful and stay within the characters. The visual style keeps this from looking real. Sometimes it feels more like a dream or a nightmare. It's an inner-city fable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the DVD of Precious, and not knowing a lot about the film prior to watching it, I didn't have high expectations. There were no big name actors in this and it was about an obese young woman. Usually I wouldn't watch a film like this, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film and the acting.Precious is the main character and she is an obese black teenager from Harlem who we find has learning difficulties. We are then introduced to her home life with her mother and we find that she has been brought up in very difficult circumstances. Not a lot is going favourably for Precious but she has a break by being introduced to a alternative teaching scheme and from there things start slowly to change for her. The film is about her breaking free from the hole that she finds herself in at the beginning.I really like this film because the two main actresses were so good that they brought a quite bleak story to life. The dynamic between Precious and her mother was unforgettable. There personalities shone through in two incredible performances. There is a lot of swearing and violence but I never thought it was gratuitous. In fact it was this relationship that I thought was the best part of the film. I never expected anything as brutal and engrossing as that, and as a viewer you get sucked into the plight of such a hopeless situation.Outside of her home, Precious finds a chance of a new life through her class teacher and class mates. Again the acting was really good and we see Precious having some fun in class and some welcome humour in that situation. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that takes the viewer on a difficult journey and confronts issues around domestic violence, child abuse and poverty. 'Precious' tells the story of a young woman's struggle with life and an attempt to better it for herself and her children. The film is produced brilliantly, with the viewer feeling a huge amount of empathy and anguish for the main character 'Precious'. Many of the issues included in the film are difficult ones to do justice, but 'Precious' does it brilliantly. Some moments in the film are exceptionally powerful, with a clear storyline keeping a good pace throughout. Many of the best moments in this film are ones that involve beautifully crafted conversations between characters. Overall this film is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grim tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''Precious'' is a dark and sad movie about a girl named Precious, who is not doing good in life. In fact, her life is a living nightmare, most people would commit suicide in a situation like that. Her mom has enslaved her, abusing her every day, she is 16 years old, but still don't know how to write or read and already has 2 children (one of them has down syndrome), both of them from her biological father, who had been raping her since she was 3 years old, plus she finds out that she is HIV positive, of course she is poor too, extremely obese and the list goes on and on.In my opinion, although the movie was realistic, Precious's conditions were just too unimaginably harsh, all of that is just a little too much to cope with, hence making it look very emotionally unreliable. I highly doubt a person with these problems would be so calm and just put up with everything life throws at her, your father raping you all your life and getting you pregnant isn't just like - yeah, i got pregnant from my father 2 times, going to go and learn to read or whatever.The movie was up there emotionally, making you feel sad for Precious, but the plot is just over saturated with all kinds of different problems for her making it seem like a sadistic and sick attempt to make the worst living conditions possible for someone and make it into a movie.Nonetheless, Gaborey Sidibe(Precious) was awesome, can't believe it was her first movie. It kind of ends on a high note for her, which would seem to most a complete disaster of a life, but even that is better than what she had to experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some beautiful, tear reaching moments. It played out so invitingly. By this I mean that the story places us in Precious' head and we begin to see her dreams and hallucinations. She has this inner spark which makes her keep fighting. A lot of the time i was frustrated at her mother but felt sorry for her at the same. The stair case scene, where the mother is hurling abuse at Precious, is a viscous scene to sit through. The words the mother spoke were like sharp swords that pierced hearts. It made me feel sick. Mariah Carey's character was beautifully played. It gave me a glimpse of her acting potential. The teacher and the class seemed to be the source of Precious' metamorphosis into a confident woman that could stand up for her children and against her mother. Overall this movie seemed to be building up to something powerful, and although it was touching and heart throbbing, with beautifully played characters, i still believe that the climax, if any, was either to short, or to close to the end.So close to getting an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious...You Brave Woman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow...I just saw this film and I am gobsmacked. It really, really hurt me to see how Precious was raised in such an environment where she was exposed to all forms of vice. Precious is a film set in a poor area of the US (Harlem), and the protagonist is an obese African-American woman who dreams for the best, but ends up in the worst. Born to a welfare-hunting mother, and a dead-beat, drug abusing father that rapes her, Precious has somehow defied all odds at school and is intellectual.After falling pregnant for the 2nd time (both times her father being the culprit), she is kicked out of school to join a special needs school, where she meets her inspirational teacher and some peers that she actually shares some good times with.In the end, Precious manages to escape her mother's clutches, only to be told that her father has died of AIDS and she is HIV positive, although her son has not contracted the virus.The acting was amazing in this film, especially Precious whom keeps her character well throughout the film. The directing and cinematography is great too.The reason this film got an 8, is because it is way to bleak. I understand it is trying to depict a harsh reality, but Precious could never catch a break, and all it needed was one person to step forward and inspire. This film hurt me because, it makes me hope that people are not oblivious or ignorant to someone who is in so much pain. Put it this way, if I ever met Precious, I'd just want to give her a long, re-assuring hug, but feel I would end up crying and she would end up reassuring me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't help crying while I watched it. Precious is a main girl's name. She was abused by her mother and expected an undesired baby. she was poor and hated around her however she was good at solving a math. Her's school principal suggested to her to go an alternative school called EOTO. There were many type of students like her. The only common is most them couldn't read or write. At first Precious couldn't get acquainted with classmate but she talked a truth of herself, they were getting along with more and more. She felt a value of alive,she decided to put her mother and live with her babies. This film was very serious story. What is the family, what is to live...I realized we are very happy to do ordinary things. To give an education,study,eat,live. I am living normal life until today, I was really shocked however it is good opportunity to know many type of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I get that this movie was painful to watch, but let's face the facts, this is reality to a lot of people out here. I think we as a whole should see that we all go through all types of obstacles in life. To me this movie isn't about painting a awful picture of black people because this is reality for some black girls out here ex: low self esteem, unhealthy eating, teen pregnancies, abuse, an illiteracy. Maybe other races can look at some blacks on another level if its broadcast the reality for some people an maybe there wouldn't be so much judgment.WHat I like the most about this movie was that precious has so much hope for her future an her son's future. this is the only way out the ghetto for some, when they truly believe that this isn't it. you can reach for the stars, if you have the ambition to achieve it all.I think that the acting was excellent! the acting was so great that at one point in the movie, I forgot I was watching an actual movie an was just looking at the life of precious behind the scenes.great movie! I'm now inspire to wanting to help young women out here that need the encouragement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hope the characters portrayed do not exist in reality, but I fear they do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Requiem for a dream" (2000) described the trough of human condition. "Precious" manages to take the artistic representation of this trough a lot lower. I spent most of the film hoping that the characters portrayed do not exist in reality, but fearing they do exist outside the movie-going world (yes, I believe in the power art has to make us want to be better human beings). What the script throws at Claireece is so vile, I felt like turning it off a couple of times. And yet, in the unrelenting torrent of life, the character finds the power to keep going.I realize the film is supposed to end on an optimistic note, but not for me. Nothing humane can justify what Claireece "Precious" suffers. Much like "Requiem", it's not a film I can say I "liked" and tell friends to watch. It is a very dark film, but whose technical representation I appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Film about Working Class Squalor, for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice Movie Review for the Excellent, at least Eye-opening, and educational Film, Precious, of 2010, if Depressing Gabourry Sidibe stars in this eye-opening film about African-Americans on welfare, abusive African ?American mothers (and especially fathers; but parents, too), and helpful, inspirational, informative, African American Teachers who Help to make a difference. The thing which strikes me about this film is its color scheme; it appears like it's all in tear-stained blacks and blues, like a crying girl's mascara streaking down her face. Truth be told, it is a tear-jerker, even though "Precious," who is played by 21-year-old Gabourrey, is a fifteen-year-old mess, who is in a lot of trouble, at the hands of her parents, and circumstances/societal woes. Unfortunately, being fat in her 'hood means getting picked on and teased and bullied; but the shocking thing is that she is raped and impregnated by her own father, who later on in the film leaves the picture and no longer stays with her mother, played by Mo'Nique. The father has a bit part, and his face barely even appears in the film, as far as I can tell. I didn't cry though: would you like to know why? It is because I may have missed some parts, and indeed, had to look away at the scene of her incestuous fornication with her father; terrible scene, one must admit, but, the rest of Precious, from the novel, Push, by Sapphire, isn't much better. Her mother abuses her, emotionally, physically, and, indeed, verbally, but that doesn't get Precious down, no. Precious is a master-mind at lifting herself up, because she has to. Precious, even when her mother gets to be so ferocious that she throws her TV at her, and nearly misses her, down the stairs, doesn't get daunted; she seeks help. With friends from people like Nurse John, played by Lenny Kravitz, Precious, or Gabourrey Sidibe, doesn't stay disheartened for long. There are times when it looks as though she's suicidal, but the movie doesn't dwell on those scenes, there is a lot of facial change, indeed, and, indeed, also the plot is thick and rich and she has a lot happen to her in the movie. This film, which features both Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, Paula Patton, who plays Miss Rain, and others as stars, showcases the helpful nature of some of the boroughs of New York, like Harlem, where Precious lives. Everyone comes together to help those in need, and, indeed, Precious is a low-down, dirty film, where help is most sorely needed. It takes place in Harlem, where, apparently, a thriving population of Jamaicans exists, and, people like her class-mate, played by Chyna Layne, a Jamaican-Phillipina sensation, enthusiastically state that what her favorite color is: her favorite color is, "fluorescent beige," as a, Jamaican, and very outspoken and proud of it, I might add. In addition, Paula Patton is a ray of sunshine in her life, as is Nurse John, an almost laughable creation of a character, but, touching, in many ways, as it is he who delivers her two malignant children. John is her ideal, because, as Sidibe states early on in her sharing of her fantasies in the film, she wants to be famous, on the cover of magazines, and, indeed, wants a light-skinned, much skinnier than herself, boyfriend, like Lenny is. Chyna Layne, Xosha Roquemore, who plays Rhonda, as well as Sherri Shepherd, also star, in this intriguing film, set in Harlem, one of the New York boroughs, in 1987. It is a good film, focusing on the hardships faced by certain teens in Harlem like Precious; it shows her boiling pig's feet for her demanding mother, at one point, who, seems not to hate her entirely, since she complies at least somewhat with taking Precious to the welfare agency to get help from the aide-worker, played by Mariah Carey, or, Miss Weiss, the aide-worker. There are also other characters played by others, who have names like, "Tom Cruise" in the movie, and who serve either as her class-mates in the film, or as her peers whom she sees in daily life, in the movie, on the street, perhaps. Anjelica Zambrana plays, "Consuelo," is Anduje Almodovar is the star who plays Rita. Mrs. Lichtenstein is played by Leanna Gordon, presumably Precious' old principal, teacher, or one of the aide-workers, but nobody outdoes Precious, in the film. Then there is Aunt Dot who plays Toosie. Amina Robinson plays Jermaine. Miss Rain is Paula P., and Mary is played, ironically, since that is such an innocent-sounding name, by MO'NIQUE. The movie does get downright gross, at time, giving us insight into how some of the "other half live" in squalid conditions, but, these are survivors whom we are viewing, none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My instant favourite for the fast approaching award season has to be this little gem. Relentless and constantly surprising, this is a film full of darkness for forever headed towards hope. The biggest surprise of the film has to be the cast. Gabourey Sidibe stuns in her restrained but ferocious debut performance. Even two musical stars (Kravitz and Carey) show up and give very good performances. Both are unrecognisable. The real star of this show though is Mo'Nique. An 'actress' that has, in the past, irritated me. Even her stand-up is too vulgar/crass and unfunny for my taste. Here, she excels on every level. It's hard to gain sympathy and understanding towards a character that is so unlikable and has ignored the sexual abuse of her child for years. Incredibly, Mo'Nique does it, keeping her distance from the audience before the films final moments. Lee Daniels directs well, mixing the real and fantasy without going overboard. He knows when to use fancy camera work, and when it's time for his actors to take charge. This film is difficult but riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bleak and minimalistic and that's its greatest power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't always need a big budget, or an over-sentimental story to turn a movie into a good drama, as this movie shows.I don't necessarily see this movie a particularly powerful or emotional movie, since I didn't felt all that involved and the movie also progressed in a somewhat predictable manner but I simply do see it as a well put together movie and drama.It picks a minimalistic approach, in an attempt to add to its realism. And yes, it works though I still also had some problems with its style and approach. Thing that annoyed was that it was trying too hard to be an independent flick at times, with some very typical things in it, such as shaky cam and sudden zooms, which is something I got tired off years ago already, since it all feels far too forced and works as mostly distracting.Another thing was the lack of music. Now, the movie probably didn't wanted to have any distractions from its story and characters in it but some sequences could had really used a musical score, that could had emphasized and strengthened some of the movie its drama at times.But those are all my complaints really. Other than that, this is simply a fine movie to watch, whether you can relate to any of the situations or characters, or not. I think that one of the powers of its story and characters also are that we all know that stuff like this is going on and everything that got depicted in this movie could really be going on somewhere, at this very moment. In that regard this movie is also being perhaps a somewhat important one, that helps to create more awareness, by putting certain things, that aren't easily and much talked about, into the spotlight.The movie is also simply just worth watching for its acting alone. Again, the movie was aiming for a realistic approach with its acting, which must had been the foremost reason why they cast mostly unknowns and inexperienced persons. The big names that are in this movie are big names because they are big in a totally different field. Singers Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz appear in this movie for instance, in some rather big and important roles as well.But it of course mostly is Gabourey Sidibe that carries this movie. And for a débutant she is doing surprisingly well and really fitted the role. But Mo'Nique still gives the perhaps most talked about performance in this movie. And yes, she was absolutely great, though I also should admit that I couldn't help keep imagining her character appearing in a comedic movie as well. I don't know, something about it strikes me as funny, probably because I just can't imaging a character like her being real, though of course in fact there sadly are plenty of people in real life who are just like that. Really all criticism aside, this is a great and still effective, minimalistic drama!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally moving and avoids the easy sentiment and polish of similar films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen this story a lot of times before; poor children with no future get moved into a class or get a new teacher who offers them a better world through education ? a chance to better themselves and maybe get out of wherever they are and into something better. We've seen it from the teacher's perspective, from the pupil's and we've seen it end badly and end well ? in short the basic story here is nothing that hasn't been done loads of times before. This not a criticism though but rather it is to point out that this makes the job harder for the film because it is a well known area and narrative arch, so to take something that lends itself naturally to falling into genre lines and to make it stand out and be impacting is difficult. But that is what Precious manages to do.It does this several ways but mostly it does it by not being a sentimental film where the lack of heart is covered by Hallmark-channel style music coming up to tell the viewer that we are supposed to be sad/inspired/happy during this scene. The film needs no such guiding hand because generally it is hard not to feel during the story ? if anything it is hard not to pretty much feel sad, horrified or sickened during the majority of it. It is a brutal watch and the escape of both Precious and the viewer into frequent fantasy doesn't really escape it because we know why we are there. The story engages because it is so very raw and lacking in easy sentiment or answers; once or twice there are specific lines that seem a bit pat but they still work because they are the tiny minority ? the rest feels real and is harder for it. Daniels' direction is assured and he lets the film live in the dingy home, the sterile and basic classroom and he uses the locations well.The real impact from the film though is the acting because this is a film where everyone is on point and somehow Daniels seems to have gotten everyone to deliver good work. Sidibe is great and well-cast because there is no glamour here and she is convincing in her performance to make you believe that she is pushed down and trapped character. Even better though is Mo'Nique, a comedienne who delivers a terrifying woman who is cruel, violent and completely broken inside; I was further impressed that she was able to do this but also still find the person behind that character so that it felt realer than just antics in any specific scene. Patton is the closest to a genre character (the beautiful light-skinned middle-class teacher who offers a better world) but she mostly avoids this and again is quite believable. Carey is good here but I think most of the praise for her are rather backward compliments since she is notable for looking normal and not letting her ego destroy all around her. Kravitz is cool in a small role while the classroom has good natural turns from Layne, Roquemore, Robinson and others.Precious could have been yet another "education lifts you up" film that we have seen many times before but what makes it different is that it lacks glamour and easy sentiment and is instead brutally raw in both the content and the performances. It isn't a fun night in but it is challenging, moving and rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational Acting in a Harrowing Story of Abuse and Despair...and Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRECIOUS is probably the most sensational film I've seen since BOYS DON'T CRY, another film in which the actors immerse themselves so deeply inside the characters that the viewer is carried into their world and becomes a part of it, not merely watching what is happening to them, but experiencing it. MONSTER'S BALL and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are also echoed here.Clareece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe in an astonishing debut), known to all as Precious, is a fat, illiterate young black woman who at sixteen has already had one child by her father and as the film begins is pregnant with her second, also by her father. When we first see her, we see a girl with no affect; life has completely shut her down; the only times she comes to life are in fantasy scenes where she is either a singer or a movie star, usually with an attractive man at her side.We soon find out why. Precious lives with (or more accurately, is trapped in a Harlem apartment with) her mother Mary (Mo'Nique in the biggest breakthrough since Oprah Winfrey in THE COLOR PURPLE), a woman whom life has left bitter and angry. Refusing to work, she sits around the house chain-smoking and only tears her attention away from the television to yell at Precious or throw something at her, or beat her when she feels like it. Precious's life is a nightmare, until a blessing in disguise comes when she is expelled from public school for being pregnant. The school's principal shows up at Precious's building. Mom will not allow her up, but she manages to tell Precious through the intercom about an alternative school called "Each One Teach One" where the girl can finish the work necessary to get her GED.When the woman leaves, Mary throws her first major fit. Mo'Nique is a revelation; the beautiful and smiling talk-show diva disappears under a layer of angry bitterness so vivid and forceful that she is like a ravening lion and her daughter her prey.Precious is desperate, but not quite hopeless yet. So she makes her way to the alternative school and there she meets the first of two champions: Ms Rain (Paula Patton), a dedicated and no-nonsense teacher who underneath an offhand manner hides a core of rock-solid determination to help her students make good.Precious is at first non-responsive to Ms Rain's remarks and questions, but the woman is not so easily put off; letting it go for the moment, she has the entire class, all girls, introduce themselves. At first Precious, too terrified to speak, says nothing, but at the end she does take her first halting steps out of her prison by participating in the class, perhaps for the first time in years.The other champion Precious encounters is Ms Weiss, a social worker at ACS, played, to my utter astonishment, by Mariah Carey! And Carey is not the only surprise in the supporting cast; when Precious finally has her baby, she is befriended by a male nurse, played here by Lenny Kravitz. A cheerful sort, he brings the girl that much farther out of her shell simply by paying attention to her. And of course when the girls from school come to visit they tease her mercilessly about the nurse, and for the first time we see Precious smile and even laugh.To tell more about the plot would be to give away more than I think is wise. But something needs to be said about the casting: it is easily the most astonishing casting I have seen in years.Sidibe and Mo'Nique are pitch-perfect; Mo'Nique won a richly deserved Oscar for her work here. She is terrifying, a force of nature at once so pathetic and so threatening that it's a miracle her daughter has made it to sixteen.The rest of the cast is equally great. Paula Patton is wonderful as the teacher we all wish we had had. And casting Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz as the social worker and the nurse may look at first glance like stunt casting, but it isn't: director Lee Daniels makes them ACT, finding character notes to play. No one coasts in this film. Carey in particular astonished me; I did not recognize her until the credits rolled.This movie is all about the process: great acting, a great script (which also won an Oscar), great cinematography (especially in the fantasy shots), and a story that will leave you breathless at the final curtain.This is one that I would give more than ten stars if I could. Movies like this do not come along often enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Precious is a great film with realistic events and emotion filled scenes throughout the movie. Precious is a movie about a teenage high school girl named Claireece Precious Jones, played by Gabourey Sidibe, who has one child that has Down-syndrome named Mongo, who lives with her grandmother, and one more on the way. The sad part is that the father of both children is her father. Not only is she sexually abused by her father, but she is physically and mentally abused by her mother. Her mother Mary, played by Monique, is constantly hitting and telling her that she will never be nothing or amount to anything. Although Precious has hopes and dreams the abuse and the fact that her family is poor and on section 8 leaves her with only dreams to get her through her day and the bad times. Her mother constantly blames her for sleeping with her man, and treats her and her kids like they are the dirt that she walks on. Once Precious's school finds out that she is pregnant with her second child they suspend her and gives the option of going to an alternative school. Although, at first Precious doesn't know what an alternative school is, she soon realizes that it is one of the best things that will happen in her life. The alternative school and Precious teacher Ms. Blu, played by Paula Patton, teaches her to open up about her situation, and helps her to see that love is possible even when it is not coming from the people who should love you. Her meetings with her social worker Mrs. Weiss, played by Mariah Carey, revels the pain and abuse that Precious has been dealing with her whole life. The government eventually takes their assistance away from her mother who in turns put the blame on Precious. When Precious returns home after having her second baby, Abdul, she gets in a scuffle with her mother, after her mother deliberately drops her new born baby. This time the abuse is almost deadly, but, Precious and the baby manages to escape. Near the end her mom shows up at the alternative school to tell her that her father has died of Aids. Soon after, Precious finds out that she is HIV positive, but her baby is not. At the end of the movie Precious realize all she has is herself and her children and that this is enough to keep her living and fighting for her dreams. The theme of this movie is simple and displayed throughout the whole movie. The theme is hope. No matter what life threw at Precious or what abuse she was going through hope helped her to get through it all and helped her to keep living. During the abuse she would close her eyes and travel to the life that she hoped she had until the abuse was over. She was going through so many bad situations, but her hope and strength helped her to keep pressing on to a better life for her and her children. I think that Precious classmates and her teacher at the alternative school gave her that extra burst of hope to help her to get through her trouble and get out of the situation she thought held her in bondage. In the movie Precious, the director included many different elements in order to produce the effect and feeling that he wanted the audience to feel. One element that he used in order for the audience to see Precious hope through her eyes was the editing of cutaways. According to the free-dictionary "a cutaway is a brief shot that interrupts the main action of a film, often to depict related matter or supposedly concurrent action," (2011). Whenever Precious was enduring pain whether it be sexual, physical, or mental abuse the director would allow her character to fade or cutaway out of the event that was happening at the time and fade into her life, the way she would have hoped it would be. Her hope is what gave her the strength to get through what she was going through at the time. Another element that the director used in order to entice the theme was lightning. The director used different forms of lightning to create the mood that flowed with the theme. Two different forms were low key lightning and high key lightning. The director used low key lightning in Precious house, mainly during the scenes that contained the abuse in order to help set the mood. The director used as little light as possible to depict that when Precious is in that part of her life its gloomy, scary, and really no place you would want to be. During these dark parts of the movie Precious is always sad, and it seems that she is present in body, but not in mind. Like there is always somewhere else she would want to be. The director then uses high key lightning during the more happy and comfortable times of Precious life. An example of this is when Precious is at the alternative school. The lightning in these scenes are so bright like her future if she continues to be here. These are just some examples of elements that are used throughout the film. During the film Precious the theme "hope" is displayed through the whole movie. No matter what abuse Precious was experiencing at the time she was able to close her eyes and imagine her life as she had hoped it to be. This is what helped her make it through whatever she was going through at the time. Life as Precious knows it is hard, but as long as she can hang on to the love that she does have from her children and friends she will be able to keep living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for all, I for one found it very powerful and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe it took me so long to see Precious. If I had to think of a reason as to why it did, I actually cannot think of a satisfactory enough one. While it is not a movie for everybody, I can understand why people may find it emotionally inconsistent, predictable and exploitative, I for one found it powerful and moving. I personally agree the story in a way is predictable, not so much if at all the emotional inconsistencies or the exploits. My only real complaints of Precious really are some scenes that drag, other than that I was so impressed by what I saw. The cinematography and editing are excellent, and Lee Daniels' direction while taking some scenes to very extreme levels is thoughtful. The script and story start harrowing and very dramatic, yet the last half contains heart and is more hopeful, I thought that was very handled very well. The acting I can't fault, Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique are both outstanding, as is Paula Patten, and Mariah Carey and Oprah Winfrey also make an impression. All in all, a powerful and moving film if not to everybody's tastes. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is a film that doesn't mess around. The passion of director Lee Daniels and company resonates throughout the picture. There is no better example of casting. Geoffrey Fletcher and Mo'Nique couldn't be more deserving of their Oscars. The writing and acting make for an altogether captivating experience. Paula Patton's great as Ms. Rain. I've respected Mariah Carey's ability to crossover into acting since WiseGirls. Gabourey Sidibe is heaven-sent as Precious.I find it difficult to watch in parts, given how physically repellent Precious and her mother are. Be that as it may, it is a compelling story of a girl finding strength and purpose in an abjectly miserable life. For those who may think her troubles are laid on too thick, life is as bad and worse for some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film hits at a deeply emotional level. Pure Brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are 3 words that I would use to describe "Precious", the 2009 film adaptation of the novel Push, and those are: Emotional, Humbling and Pure. The story follows an obese illiterate African-American teenager, who has suffered sexual and physical abuse from both her parents, and who has had a child with downs syndrome by her father and has another one on the way. We journey with Claireece Precious Jones through her struggle to break free from her mother, her life in which she seems stuck and past her own low self-esteem after years of mistreatment.As we begin to see the world through Precious' eyes, we begin to feel her experiences as if they are our own, with vivid examples of desperate escapism directed elegantly by Lee Daniels and beautifully brought to life by cinematography co-coordinators Andrew Dunn and Darren Lew. These glamour scenes juxtaposed against the gritty and almost dirty scenes between Precious and her mother provide brilliant blend, and give the film brilliant depth and pace. The genuine tone that permeates all of Gabourey Sidibe's (Precious) dialogue is felt at the deepest level, and emotions flow both strongly and readily when watching this talented young actress. Mo'Nique as Mary lee Johnston, Precious' mother, deserved winner of both an academy award and golden globe for best supporting actress in this film, provides an easy character to despise throughout, with every line delivered to perfection. Her obvious commitment to the role shines with every word, and we feel the hate leaving the screen and filling the room around us, as if we are stood there in that grotty apartment.Paula Patton as Ms. Blu Rain and Mariah Carey as Mrs. Weiss provide warm, emotive heroines that give us hope and we find ourselves joined with them in willing Precious to help herself and break free; and to show herself that she is good at something and can move past the life that her childhood and upbringing seems determined to force on her. They provide believable, and authentic characters that provide the typical story of "inspirational people/teachers helping a deprived child fulfil their potential" storyline, but in a new, more accessible and ultimately more moving way. The friends that Precious finds at her new school, in the class taught by Ms. Blu Rain, provide well balanced comic relief for a film that is otherwise incredibly deep; yet another credit to Lee Daniels. A scene with these other "misfits" in is welcome amongst the often tough to digest and powerful main scenes.Whilst this film is not for the emotionally over sensitive, it's raw and blunt delivery of the issues is necessary to achieve the bond with the audience that draws you so willingly along with the story. It will no doubt leave you feeling deeply humble and appreciative of the life you have, and most definitely with tears in your eyes and a love for all things precious.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious - painfully sad, but brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch the trailer for "Precious," you get the impression that you are walking into an uplifting movie about a girl who goes through hell only to emerge on top. But there is nothing happy about this movie. This film tears out your heart because it is so hard to watch Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), this enormous girl who holds on tightly to your heart strings, suffer. Precious is a 16 year old who has been raped many times by her father (her mother's boyfriend) and has two children by him. The mother Mary (Monique Imes), who should have called the police and sent her boyfriend to jail, despises Precious because in her confused mind "she stole my man." So throughout this film, the mother subjects Precious to all kinds of cruelty. She tells her daughter (who has done nothing wrong) that she is stupid and will never amount to anything and should sign up for welfare. At one point, Mary throws a television at her and the baby. There are some nice scenes where the teacher Mary (Paula Patton) teaches Precious to read and gives her a home when her mother throws her out. But those scenes are few and far between.I would not be able to watch this movie again because it is so unpleasant and depressing. But "Precious" is undeniably a brilliant film. Gabourey Sidibe plays the title role so well that you are tempted to think that either she went through all those experiences herself or knew someone who was in that position. Mary, the mother, is also played brilliantly by Monique Imes. She is probably the most unpleasant character in this entire movie (I would have chosen the father, except he appears only briefly in flashbacks) and yet Monique makes it possible for the audience to understand this hateful, angry, lonely woman at some level. But it is impossible to excuse her for how she treated Precious or sympathize with her. The Ms. Rain character is one of those roles that will probably work in the hands of any talented actor. Rain is inspiring, compassionate and has tremendous inner strength. She knows how bad life can be, but she stays positive and makes sure that the students who depend on her for inspiration stay positive as well. This is a wonderful character to play. Paula Patton, being a very talented actress, plays Ms. Rain very well in this movie and is a delight to watch. Thumbs way up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious, about a pregnant, illiterate teen who's long been the victim of unspeakable abuse by her parents, is neither as hopelessly bleak nor as affirmative as you might expect. It's a bold, highly evocative movie helped in no small part by two towering performances, by Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique.I might well be the last person in the world to see this film ? at least among those who intended to see it in the first place. It's not a pleasant movie, despite its underdog-against-all-odds story. In fact, so much of the subject matter is terrifying to watch, so starkly realistic is its portrayal.So if you've been thinking you might get around to this movie ? maybe after it did so well at the Oscars ? you should know right away that this won't be a movie that's enjoyable to watch. It's very, very dark, even if its issues are expertly handled.Precious (Sidibe) is 16 years old and pregnant with her second child. She's illiterate, although she does like math class. She's physically and emotionally abused by her welfare mother Mary (Mo'Nique). But because she's pregnant ? oh, and did I mention her dad's the father? ? she's been suspended from school, forced to try an alternative place called Each One, Teach One. There, Precious does find her own measure of redemption.But this really isn't just a simple movie of the week, or even a Lifetime movie: although Precious does find an outlet for her pain and suffering and a way out of her mess, it is not a perfect solution ? for anyone. The movie doesn't end with Precious walking into the sunset with a rainbow appearing over her head and birds chirping.This is a movie heavily steeped in realism, drawing attention to the plight of not only children in inner-city slums but also to those suffering from malicious, bitter parents who deeply resent the potential success their child represents. Mary, a constant cauldron of seething rage, treats Precious as little more than a slave and desperately wishes to prevent even a fleeting moment of self-esteem and courage.The cause of Mary's rancor isn't really clear until the very end ? in a satisfying, but open-ended, denouement ? but all we need to know is how savagely intense her hatred is. But no matter how intense the hatred gets, Mary ? thanks to Mo'Nique's earthy portrayal ? never seems wholly over the top. In fact, she seems so real you wind up cringing from her in the safety of your living room.As Precious, Sidibe is both vulnerable and strong. You can't help but feel terrible for her, naturally, but Sidibe manages to make us feel happy for her chances as well. It'd be too easy for her to be simply a victim who perseveres against the odds; it's harder for her to show that she has some amount of tenacity that in turn allows her to feel good about herself for a change. Sidibe's debut performance (!!!) is exquisite and unnerving.Also worthy of note is ? of all people ? Mariah Carey, as a social worker. She's almost unrecognizable, both physically and in terms of her performance. Who knew that Mariah Carey could act at all, let alone flourish in such a demanding role? Precious is a stunning, gripping movie, although its tragic situations ? and horrifying revelations ? might turn off some viewers. It's bleak, but not relentlessly so; it's hopeful, but not inauthentically so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a difficult time pulling together watching this film cause it was so sad. And the fact that its fact based is even sadder. The acting is so amazing that the convincing characters make the movie emotional and intense in every scene. Beginning actress Gabourey Sidibe gives a phenomenal performance in her first role, along side Monique's Oscar winning performance.The story is set in Barlem, 1987, where a black, overweight teen, (Gabourey Sidibe) becomes pregnant with her second child, and is suspended from school. She gets transfered to a alternate school course in the hopes to take her life in the other direction, while having to deal with her abusive, and emotionally disturbed mom, (Monique). From the beginning, I wanted to cry so hard. Its so sad to what the teen went through and what she has to deal with. film goes through so well as we see scenes with her school work, as well as her homework, if ya know what I mean.Gabourey's performance is so convincing that you want to just pick her up right on the street and make her more welcome than your wife. Monique's character is so brutal and violent that you just want to smack her in the face with a scorching hot frying pan, or cut her cheek with a super sharp butcher knife. Her performance is flawless, given how much you hate her.The story itself is truly inspiring, and quite depressing as well. But it shows how no matter how bad you feel, it will all be resolved. The film also has key happy scenes as well.Altogether, the film is excellent, but very, very, very depressing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious is an obese teenager, with two children, who is trying to make the best of an abusive home life by moving to a progressive school.Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is an extremely brave movie. It shines light on a character that almost no one would have the guts to put as the main character of a major motion picture.Also, the character Precious doesn't just sit around the whole movie thinking: "poor, pitiful me." Precious tries to make the best of her situation and imagine she is living a better life. These fantasies that Precious has are probably the most original and inventive technique of Lee Daniels' direction, but not the only commendable one. The acting is above average as well, and Gabourey Sidibe deserved the Oscar about a million times more than Sandra Bullock did.The only real gripe I have is that the story treads the line of too much drama and at times it can be over the top. Not that these things don't happen everyday, but you don't have to cram every bad thing you can think of into the main character's life. You can "blow a drama gasket" so to speak and lose the meaning of everything if the audience feels like this events are put in just for drama's sake.The only other "problem" to me with Precious is that it is such a difficult viewing experience. I realize this is part of the point; to shock you and get you thinking, but I have to include it in my analysis. It is a very good movie, but I can't really see myself actually watching it again because of how truly depressing it is.So, Precious is definitely a very quality picture but watch at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking Work of High Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I have reviewed The Blind Side I cannot ignore this other Oscar-garnering film from 2009: here, all the sugar-coated realities of the Blind Side's populist pap come in one whopping, bitter, and hugely important pill. Kudos to everyone involved in this groundbreaking film of the decade. I believe it is long overdue love medicine for African Americans, and pure catharsis for anyone touched by the violence begat by violence. And the violence here - even toned down from that of the book - was difficult for me to watch, but I'm so glad that I did because I would otherwise have missed witnessing something truly special and brilliant. It pains me to know that anyone associated with this film had to share the same red carpet with the makers of the Blind Side! Unlike that other, purportedly "feel-good" crap, Precious really did inspire me and even - unlike the B.S. - made me laugh. Rarely do films with important social messages come in packages of high art, but here Precious blows away the competition in both style and content. The acting performances are all breathtakingly good: Gabourey Sibide richly deserved the Oscar that instead went to Sandra Bullock. I was stunned to later discover that Ms. Sibide is not actually this quiet, slow, mumbling and scowling hulk, but rather a bubbly, fast-talking actress who sounds just like many other young women her age. What a performance! Equally deserving was Mo'Nique's raw and terrifying portrayal of Precious's mother (thank you, Academy, for getting this one right). Even Mariah Carey's performance - maligned by some here - impressed me. And who are these talented women playing Precious's classmates at Each One Teach One?! Their performances all helped to drive this film - some scenes were so fresh that they reminded me of the film Entres Les Murs (which was a work of fiction made entirely with actual students and even the actual teacher). In a year when two films full of black stereotypes go to the Oscars, it's patently clear that there's a dearth of stories with average black American protagonists. But the message here - that violence and incest are a problem that can no longer be swept under the carpet or prayed away - lends value and purpose to what some might view as contrived extremities. It is precisely these extremities, masterfully portrayed, and Precious's bittersweet triumph over them, that have made the film enter my world to evoke a new consciousness about the humanity underlying the stereotype. This is a message with far-reaching consequences that has, thankfully, obliterated - in all its weighty, fleshy, in-your-face fury - the wan and watered down "message" of The Blind Side. For me, and "for girls everywhere," thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) is a dreamer. She wants to be a media superstar, have a great looking boyfriend, and all that. It's a good thing that she has such a vivid imagination, because her real life is a living hell. This is her story.Precious is sixteen and still in junior high school. She is illiterate and morbidly obese. Making matters infinitely worse is the fact that her mother Mary (Mo'Nique) terrorizes her on a daily basis. When it's discovered that she is pregnant with her second child (via being raped by her father), she is transferred to an alternative school. Thus begins her journey out of her misery.This is an amazingly powerful movie. I've never been in a movie that brought me to tears (as an adult), but this one got me near there. Much of that has to do with its brilliant performances. Gabby Sidibe is nothing short of miraculous in the role. It doesn't take long before we're rooting for her. No matter how bad life gets, she always keeps her head up, and that's what makes her so special. On the flip side, Mo'Nique is unbelievable. The feisty comedian turns in a jaw-dropping performance as a vicious, but still deeply human, abuser. Her Oscar was richly deserved (Gabby's nomination was a given, considering her performance, but a win couldn't have hurt things). While Sidibe and Mo'Nique justly get praise for their work, Paula Patton gets almost none. That's a shame, because Patton is amazing. She's the light shining through all of this pain, and the lovely Patton is perfect for the role. Kind, gentle and encouraging, she is the guide for Precious. Yet Patton never lets Ms. Rain become a cliché. She's tough, and doesn't take any crap from anyone, even Precious. But Patton is an incredible choice for the character. Surprisingly, Mariah Carey acquits herself quite well as the social worker, Mrs. Weiss. The former pop star is unrecognizable as the "tough love" social worker. And for someone who got blasted for her "performance" in her crossover film "Glitter," she gives a good performance.Director Lee Daniels uses light and shadow to portray the gritty darkness that is Precious's life. It's not a happy place by any means, but it is what it is. Unfortunately, the narrative is a little jumpy at times, and that's what keeps this film from getting a 10. Still, he gets amazing performances from his actors, and he has made an amazing film.This is not always an easy film to watch. But it is very rewarding.</fullReview>

As this movie goes along,set in Harlem 1987, you will witness life from her tortured eyes. You witness a tale of tragedy, betrayal, and constant hope. Mo'Nique plays claireeces mom, and does a Grammy winning performance. This movie is very enjoyable and will have u at the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. this movie is based of the novel by lee Daniels "push by sapphire". the director does a great job in interpreting the story from novel to film .this film is for those that like drama and for those who are struggling in their lives as well.precious is a great movie.</fullReview>

Lenny Kravitz is a nice surprise in his role), but beautifully shot (Cinematography itself is much better than in Avatar which took an Oscar for it) and edited.You have to know that some parts of the film are hard to watch, even for and adult (see the reason for its R-rating. that's why.) but it was needed, like it or not, for the effect of the movie.As the story goes, maybe it's not incredibly original, maybe not that original at all, some may say, but works well with such brilliant film-making.The movie is incredibly powerful, as nothing I've seen in some time, amazingly acted and beautifully shot.Very, VERY good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uplifting and emotionally compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing worse than child abuse of any kind - physical, psychological and sexual. The title character of the recent indie hit Precious has experienced it all. Set in Harlem in the late 1980s Precious centers on the overweight 16-year-old teenager regularly abused by her monstrous mother and raped by her father with whom she's going to have the second child. The movie is grim as well as relentless, yet immensely powerful due to director Lee Daniels finding hope in this overall dark material. While he never shies away from showing all the abominations Precious has to face, his approach is always genuine and never contrived. He uses some pop-up fantasy footage and unexpected doses of humor to make the movie lighter. Given that, Daniels steers clear of traditional uplifting drama formula in favor of startling authenticity. His message about making the most of life and self-esteem is even more sound in this way. There is also a considerable acting talent at full display here. Gabourey "Gabbie" Sidibe in the leading role truly sinks in her role providing both compassionate and totally convincing performance, so shockingly good because ii's her first. Comedian Mo'Nique transforms into the most horrible mother imagined and she's equally amazing as Sidibe in a far more showy part. Paula Patton and Mariah Carrey deliver competent supporting performances as well. Overall, Precious happens to be uplifting and emotionally compelling. It's undoubtedly one of the most important movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly powerful stuff, as well as relentlessly bleak and depressing. I am glad I didn't see it at the theater, because I needed to rewind on numerous occasions, I had a hard time understanding Gabourey Sibide. Her annunciation needs a lot of work, It's hard to rate a performance as exceptional when you mumble with an accent. Mo'Nique however is quite brilliant and a real change of pace performance. The film is well made, very well written. The cinematography is appropriately gritty and very effective. Mariah Carey was a pleasant surprise, she is very convincing and does a great job. It's not a film that is easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful look at the darker side of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly a little tale as related to me by a friend about an experience she had when she went to see this film at our local cinema (The Curzon, Clevedon, UK) In front of her was a row of about 20 women, all of whom looked like they were part of a line-dancing group. As the BBFC (British Board of Film Classifaction) went up the women in front of her suddenly went "oh dear, this is not 'A Single Man', what is 'Precious'". This quickly went down the row, and a whispered chorus of "Precious, what is all this about then?" could be heard for the first few minutes. As the film started - and as anyone who has seen it is has quite a start! - the first woman could be heard to be whispering "I am so sorry..." With each subsequent shocking revelation, bit of bad language, and horrific detail her cries of "I am so sorry" become more and more mournful - by the end she was almost apoplectic with guilt, and so red-faced she could barely look the others in the eye! The moral of this story - make sure you are going to see the right film before you hand over your money! Right, to the film itself. Yes the film is very powerful, it has moments that will make you almost cry, and some people may find it too shocking and depressing to cope with, but I personally found it a film of hope. Precious - an amazing performance from Gabourey Sidibe - takes all the crap that life throws at her, yet, when presented with a chance to escape into a new life grabs it with both hands and begins to turn her world around. This leaves her mother - another performance that has to be seen to be truly appreciated by Mo'Nique, and one finally worthy of the Oscar - to begin to face the truth of her own life. As the film progresses we see her blame Precious for everything and anything bad that has happened to her - which is just about all of her adult life - but this facade slowly crumbles, and the final scene in the benefits office brings about revelations that are so shocking that, even now, I feel quite sick about when I think about them. Here Mo'Nique truly shines - if that is the right word - and those few minutes must rank amongst the most powerful every committed to film.This makes it sounds like the film is a "two hander", but this would be unfair to the rest of the cast, including a wonderful performance from Mariah Carey as the teacher that shows Precious a glimpse of a better life. In the background as well is the Grandmother who, as a character, is ineffectual and hopeless - she has lost her own daughter to anger and despair - and the other pupils in the "special" school that Precious goes to, all of whom have their own troubles and problems.The film ends with the aforementioned mother scene, then Precious stepping into the big, wide world with her two children, to face a brighter future, whilst the mother is left to face her own demons and a life on her own. You feel that if you were to revisit these character again in 10 years time the mother would be on the streets drinking from a brown paper bag, whilst Precious and her children would be surviving quite nicely - a beam of light for all who have suffered crap in their lives to cling to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Precious: Based On The Novel Push By Sapphire' is an outstanding adaptation of an highly-acclaimed Novel. Lee Daniels's direction is high-class and he truly deserves all the nominations he has received. 'Precious' is an important film, it's a film that dares to as real as it can get. It's a depressing tale of a overweight 17-year old who's been destroyed by her own parents, she's a mother of 2 kids and is humiliated within. 'Precious' is so so real, that you might feel irritated at the goings-on, it's a like happening near you... and the tragedy is that you can't help the innocent &amp; troubled child. The screenplay by Geoffrey S. Fletcher is true to it's meaning, and Daniel's direction is, as mentioned, simply superb and awe-inspiring. In the acting department, Mo'Nique steals the show with an Incredible performance. She's causes terror/hatred in you, that stunning her portrayal is as a frustrated mother &amp; wife. Gabourey Sidibe is fabulous as Precious. She stands out. Paula Patton does her job exceedingly well, she's lovable. Mariah Carey, seen in a serious role, is perfect. Sherri Shepherd is good. Others do well in their respective parts.'Precious: Based On The Novel By Saaphire' is a winner all the way... it's a legend! Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie shows the best and worst in people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was quite disturbing, and it is not the movie to see if one is seeking something light-hearted or fun. That being said, it was a movie that successfully tugged at a full range of emotions, and I really appreciate a film that can do so. I do believe this movie will cause very differing responses in people, depending on one's history, culture, mood, environment, etc. I even found myself laughing in places that were downright uncomfortably tragic (and perhaps that was why). But throughout there were many moments of anger, loathing, pain, and sadness...but also of happiness, hope, and joy. I thought Mo'Nique did a great job, and I found myself hating her character, although you learn to pity her later (and for connotation purposes, I believe "pity" to be an insulting way to look at someone--it isn't compassion or sympathy by any means). There was one scene where Precious fights back, and I wouldn't have been bothered in the least if Precious had killed the woman.One thing I haven't noticed a lot on other comments are the positives in this movie. Yes, it was full of stereotypes. However, these situations do exist, and I found that the movie gave those stereotypes a face...and I really felt it gave the audience a reality check. People forget there are human beings behind the "fat girl" they make fun of; they forget that there are reasons why a young girl gets pregnant; there are reasons why they quit caring about life and themselves; and they forget that some people are strong and honestly want to change their life-and that eliminating their opportunities isn't right.Honestly, I found this movie oddly heartening. So many things go against Precious, the core causes being due to her physically, mentally, and sexually abusive parents--the very people who are supposed to love her and keep her safe. Yet Precious takes the steps to impact change in her life--she goes to the alternative school, she writes every day, she talks to others, she fights for her baby, she fights back, etc. Overall, this character has a strength that I find beautiful. I don't think most people would have the strength Precious did to keep trying every day; she fought for herself and for her kids in ways that no one had for her.The fact that Precious found people who did love her and were able to show her what love and trust should be about was great, too. For me, the movie reminded me how important it is to have those people in one's life: how important an opportunity can be and how having someone to fight for you and to believe in you can change everything. This movie shows the very worst in people, but it also shows the very best. Some characters give up so easily, yet some never stop fighting. While the subject matter was not so enjoyable, the movie itself was a great experience emotionally and mentally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film plays against almost all of our expectations. It isn't an inspirational story about an underdog with potential who eventually rises to the top. The sixteen-year old protagonist in Precious has been so brutalized by life that she barely speaks. She can hardly read or write and it is rare for her to look people in the eyes. This character (named Precious) is played intuitively by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe. This is not the kind of woman we are accustomed to seeing in films.The film charts the hardships of a poor, overweight girl living in the ghettos of Harlem in the late 1980s. She is viciously abused on a daily basis by her mother (played by Mo'Nique). Precious has one child, and is pregnant with another when the movie begins. Both children are the products of rape, and both of the rapes were committed by her father. As the story progresses, she begins to fight against the forces that have turned her young life into chaos. A teacher (Paula Patton) and a social worker (Mariah Carey) are the only people she has on her side.Director Lee Daniels is uncompromising in his portrayal of domestic abuse, and this film is a frequently upsetting experience. It imbeds us in its environment, and its sincerity keeps us engaged. Although the landscape of this picture is grim and desperate, it is infused with genuine hope. It manages to avoid falling into too many traps, and it is as moving as it should be.The performances here are outstanding. Sidibe is a brave, instinctive actor who leaves an impression as Precious. Mo'Nique is frighteningly convincing as her torturous mother, and all the supporting players are equally strong.This is an emotionally arresting film, and one of 2009's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For All Those Precious Men and Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Precious with my mother after hearing many good reviews for it.The film revolves around a young high school girl, Precious, who is pregnant with her second child. She is very overweight, African-American, illiterate, and lives in an abusive household, so she faces much adversity living her normal day to day lifestyle. Precious' heart and drive is very inspirational as she becomes more and more aware that her children deserve a much better life than this. Precious finds that the few true role models that you get in the tough times, are the ones that change lives.The overall mood of the film is very interesting as there are several parallels between real life and day-dreams, I found this to be an effective technique that helped the audience walk in the character's shoes. Also, the cinematography was excellent and kept me interested throughout.Finally, the acting...All around great performances throughout. The lead role of Precious, played by first time actress Gabourey 'Gabby' Sidibe, was beautifully played, very strong performance on her part. Also, many other great supporting roles were played, with parts by Lenny Kravitz, and a pretty critical role by Mariah Carry. And the one that will have many people talking, is the role of Precious' mother played by Mo'Nique. She plays an abusive mother who strives off of welfare and is emotionally disturbing the household. I am hoping that she gets nominated for best supporting role as her performance is both aggressively real and incredibly emotionally at the same time.Overall, very moving and inspirational movie that is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise somewhat dull year for movies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond my endurance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a very good numerical vote on IMDb and yet I left before it ended. The film is phenomenally powerful and there are no words to iterate its superb acting quality and yet it was, to me, SO upsetting that I could not continue to watch after the first hour. I may rent it again to watch the final scenes. I could not psychologically endure not only the extreme violence to the 16 year old morbidly obese girl Precious by her own seemingly demon-possessed mother and others around her, but I could not take the violence to the young girl's soul. I was shaking inside, I was angry, I was scared, and most of all I was sad that this life is often -- much TOO often -- a reality for so many.I, simply, as a human being who has valued academics so enthusiastically all of my life could not endure a scenario which I am loath to admit exists. It was hard for me not only to relate to a woman who by age sixteen could read ONLY the letter "A" and who could barely speak a complete sentence, but it was hard for me to auditorily understand the linguistics, so often inordinately profane, of it as well. I can never remember a time in my life when I could not read, when I did not appreciate academics, when I did not wish to be more academically superior than I am. I had to step out of myself -- WAY out -- to try to understand the the lowest depths of depravity to which her environment sank and shudder as to the enduring effects in had on her.I will certainly never understand how human beings perpetrate such unspeakable cruelty. Before seeing Precious I had just viewed 14 episodes of "The Wire" about the drug ghetto culture in the city of Baltimore. The milieu in "The Wire" seemed like the Hamptons in comparison to household of Precious. This film was infinitely difficult for me to watch. I literally had a panic attack in the middle as it frightened me to my core and I had to walk out.We cannot, though, feel self righteous as many who read this probably have never experienced this kind of brutality but, in truth, it exists everywhere in different forms. It is perpetrated not only by a single family and environment but exists on the battle fields world wide as well. It literally stops the heart and forces so much of our humanity to fade into the nothingness of the death we inflict upon each other all too often.The final question to me is what can WE do? What is the solution to the grinding poverty, illegal drug saturated and violent world in which we live? Whether it is the slums of Mumbai reflected in the film "Slum Dog Millionaire," the drug mayhem in the city of Baltimore shown in HBO series "The Wire," the bestiality of war in the world at large or the abominable cruelty Precious singularly suffered, it leaves me wanting to throw up my hands and think these problems, for me at my age, are out of my control.I will not say not to see this film. I will say see it but beware it is overwhelming to the senses of anyone who has a shred of decency and compassion left. I wish the next generation and all the succeeding generations good luck in ameliorating these intractable problems. They surely are going to need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest and Proclaiming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of story that more movie- makers should be interested in filming, seeing that it presents social and more intimate issues that are happening around us and who knows?, maybe are happening to us, just like the indication text line in the credits which dedicates the movie to all "precious girls out there'. The film utilizes the starring character's experience to show how low humans can fall as victims of marginality and the mechanisms that society can use to prevent or heal these twisted expressions of family relations.Precious is an abused adolescent who doesn't know about other types of relationships outside those known at home through her mother's frustration and her father's sexual violations; getting to the limit of creating an imaginary world that she confuses with her daily reality of ignorance and media exposure through the television. The constant reprimands from her crack- addict mother and violence from her surroundings, an induced obesity, the fact that she has given birth to a mentally disabled infant from her own father and going forward issues have turned her personality into a gray, sad and hopeless girl at a very young stage of her life.The film brutally reveals each one of these tragedies as we are immersed in a tight atmosphere accomplished by the great execution of Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique, with other less impacting performances that as whole, works perfect for the type of visual language that director Lee Daniels delivers from a wonderful adapted screenplay that gives origin to this movie. Despite all, there are still some unnecessary parts ?like that from nurse character played by rock singer Lenny Kravitz or the lesbian relation Mrs. Rain keeps- which don't really help in the story's construction and are there for some other external reasons.For the importance of movies like Precious rests in the artistic social proclamation, which is masterly achieved in the course of each one of the dim scenes where the American-way-of-living is denoted with realistic crudeness and far from that glamorous propaganda that consumerism systems conceal for the benefit of the establishment. Indeed a great film, carefully made and honestly played by the production whereas the acting and technical contributions represented a significant value to its overall outcome. No wonder why of its 6 nominations that could actually have been rewarded more than the two statuettes given, I would at least have added Best Motion Picture or Best Performance by an Actress in a leading Role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the reviews on the IMDb database and was shocked to find that many US reviewers found this racist and stereotypical. As an Australian, it never occurred to me that the depiction was stereotypical or that it was degrading to African-Americans.Instead, I found it depicted an individual's story - she could have been portrayed as a poor Hispanic, Irish, Italian etc.The movie is flawed - but unlike other films in this genre, it actually ends on a positive note.The story centres on Clarice - better known as 'Precious'. Her name of course being a slap you over the head with irony name. Precious has been the subject of sexual abuse by her father since she was 3 - the film does not shy away from this - and physical and mental abuse from her mother.When we first meet Precious, she is pregnant with her second child to her father and is promptly suspended from school (though it was never clearly explained why). She ends up at a school for illiterate children where she meets an assorted group of teenagers in similar situations to her. After giving birth to her second child, Precious returns from the hospital only for her mother to physically abuse her child and Precious. Precious leaves with her child and later discovers that she is HIV positive.However, Precious is portrayed with dignity and this is where the movie really comes into it's own. Mariah Carey as the councellor is particularly good. She's quietly empathetic as is Miss Rain - Precious' teacher. Neither play the sympathy card or wallow in excess grief at Precious' story. Instead they actively encourage Precious to take what little action she can.Overall, the performances were excellent. Mariah Carey was excellent and Monique was outstanding. The last scene, with Precious walking down the street with her two children will perhaps be regarded as one of the most powerful endings in film history.This is not a film for the fainthearted - it is challenging, but it's worth the effort. Is it worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture - probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to run you through the plot, its been done too many times already.What I want to say is that I cannot believe this movie came out of America. American movies invariably set out to make the American audience feel good and avoid taxing the viewers intellect or emotions too much.This movie does all the above, the intellect and emotions are taxed; the raw underside of society is exposed, you realize that this is likely the truth understated and thank God one's own beginnings weren't this bad. You realize that this is the result of generations of poverty, welfare dependence, selfishness and hopelessness caused by deteriorating "norms" passed between generations. You wonder if you yourself would have the strength to climb out of a situation like this. You wonder where and what are the real answers to alleviate situations like this.The movie is a wake up call to society. Things we would rather not think about are thrust upon us. It sickens us to our stomachs, compels us to think about society, prejudices and real life.I don't like Opra Winfrey, but after seeing this movie she has gone up considerably in my estimation.This is a unique movie out of America. Designed to make Americans AND the world think.Congratulations to the actors, directors, camera staff, screen writers and producers. This movie is not going to make box office records but you have had the guts to try and make America and the world think!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious...Against All Odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the title of the movie and having seen some interesting clips and heard so much about it, I was convinced to watch 'Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire'. Subtly set in a dark claustrophobic atmosphere, Lee Daniels introduces the viewer to Precious's tragic world that is primarily dominated by a hateful abusive mother while everyone else is ignorant or oblivious to her tragic circumstance. Precious herself does a good job of hiding it until she opens up to Ms. Rain and the psychologist. Daniels doesn't dwell on a particular subplot. Pretty much most of the film is shown to us is from Precious's point of view and those are the parts I mostly liked. But at the same time, a lot of the sequences are overdone (for example when the mother throws the television set on her daughter) and some are left unexplained (why didn't Ms. Rain or the psychologist report Precious's rape to the police?). The film moves at a fast pace but none of it feels rushed. The sequences and emotional scenes are handled sensibly. None of it looks over the top. Paula Patton does a fine job as the down-to-earth Ms. Rain. Mariah Carey was a huge surprise. At first I didn't recognize her at all but the voice sounded familiar. Then it suddenly hit me that this was the pop-singer (whose songs I find irritating to say the least). She does quite a competent job, showing improvement as an actress. Mo'Nique is remarkable as the extremely hateful, foul-mouthed, abusive, self-centred, narcissistic, venomous and dangerous mother. And finally, young actress Gabourey Sidibe, in her very first movie, is spellbinding in the inspiring title role. Her performance is subtle, nuanced, moving and brave for a newcomer. 'Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire' is in the end a story of hope. Even after going through the worst of what life had to offer her and an impending doom that awaits her, she finally sees hope as she chooses to get her life back together. I just wish Daniels had toned down some of the events and used a more subtle or suggestive approach rather than show a mother throw a TV set at her daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep Character Study of an Unlikely Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's heavy as we explore Precious, the individual born into the lowest rung of American society, without THIS society's favorable genetic gifts, a character seemingly without hope even in the land of opportunity. And this character's heart and soul pours into our own as we delve deeper into her life.It is a remarkably, deep, soul-searching character study with an unlikely protagonist. This type of character has not exactly been the most prevalent thing in film and that's part of what makes it interesting.One successful way we get into precious's soul is through her voice over narrative. Voice over narratives are frequently criticized as amateurish easy way outs, cheesy or superfluous after-all, "why can't you tell the story with out it or it is not for film but for novels", but, the voice-over narrative is the clearest window into a character's psyche. It works in this movie as it does in others such as Goodfellas, where the voice over narration opens up the character's mind and allows us to see their light and air and step out of ourselves and into them.Whether if realistic or perhaps a little overly dramatized and over the top, we nonetheless become immersed into the grittiness and ugliness of Precious's life. The acting is raw and some of the character's are tough. At times depressing since you really feel and care for her, you eventually admire her and witness character change and growth. As you watch, the minor issues in your life seem to melt away.</fullReview>

We need to make sure we are asking the right questions and we need to listen. There are so many scenes in this movie that ring true. For people who have been touched by the lives of others in a similar situation but who are not named "Precious", this movie is very deep and touching and telling and real. The acting was really remarkable. It is well worth seeing this movie. I would certainly caution people from bringing young people to this movie, although the scenes are shot so not to be so revealing, the subject matter is very intense, Perhaps some of the movie critics are looking for something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Draining....but honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had an interesting experience today. I went to the theater to watch "Hurt Locker" and after a break for lunch, then went to see "Precious". I am very glad I did this, as it allowed me to compare and contrast the two great films.Both films are terrific and it's sad that only one of these ("Hurt Locker") got the Best Picture nomination. There are some years when I wish no film got the award and others I wish two or even three could get it. It's just tough to say that one film is best when they are both so good for such completely different reasons. As for "Hurt Locker", it was great in creating a tense mood and the way the characters AVOIDED dealing with their feelings was a great thing about the film. With "Precious", this was no action film and the important part, especially towards the end, was the catharsis, or the emotional outpouring up pent-up feelings. It was interesting, however, looking at the audiences. With "Hurt Locker", the place was packed and the average age was about 70 and the audience was very white. In the same multiplex, "Precious" played in a theater half as large and the theater was half as full. The audience was mixed and the average age about 40. The reactions of the two audiences was also quite different. With "Hurt Locker", the audience left very quietly and said little during the film. With "Precious", there was clapping and crying at many points throughout the film--as if, in both cases, the audience was in tune with the characters' emotions.So what made "Precious" so, well...precious? Well, I love how the film avoided the cliché and formula. Too many times, the film could have taken the easy way out--making itself like another "Stand and Deliver" or "To Sir, With Love". But, unlike the typical Hollywood film, there is no perfect happy ending with this film. In fact, the ending is very mixed--with some signs of hope and signs of doom. I know a lot in the audiences will hate this as they want or demand a happy ending--but too often, this sort of by-the-books ending just doesn't ring true. Plus, decades ago, I was a social worker in the inner city--and rarely did cases ever end so perfectly! In addition, the acting, writing and characters were amazing. A lot has justifiably been said about Mo'Nique's acting, but I'll reiterate that she did a great job AND took a risk playing such an unlikable and awful person. It must have been hard to play someone so hateful and selfish--and she clearly had a performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. The lead, Gabourey Sidibe, did not win for Best Actress, but at least was nominated. During the first half of the film, I might have said this nomination wasn't deserved, but as the film progressed, she proved herself to be a brilliant young actress. Her tears and poignant portrayal were amazing. I am just worried, however, that Hollywood will ignore her in the future as she is not the "proper image". Well the heck with this skinny perfection, then! I want to see Sidibe again...and not just in tiny roles here and there--but in things with meat on them, so to speak. The final wonderful acting performance I'd like to mention is Mariah Carey's. When her film "Glitter" tanked, people took great pleasure in trashing her acting. I saw the film and disliked it--but only because the script was so bad. I remember writing in my review that I'd like to see Miss Carey act again--as I thought she had promise in this department. Here, she not only did a great job, but I really must applaud the lady for being willing to "ugly herself up" for the part. The glamorous image was gone--instead, a very de-glamorized Carey appeared on screen. Good for you! Overall, this is the sort of film we need to see more of in the future. Excellent acting, script and direction make this a great textbook example for how small films should be made. Let's hope this film spurs on other such projects that can both inspire and entertain.By the way, if you even care, late in the film when Precious and her mother are watching a movie on TV, it is "Two Women" which was directed by Vittorio DeSica and starred Sophia Loren. Not exactly a movie you'd expect the two to be watching, but definitely a classic.UPDATE: I saw the film again but this time with my youngest daughter who is 15. Despite the very adult language and situations, I felt comfortable letting her see this rated R movie with me. However, this is DEFINITELY a film to see with your teen--not one to let them see on their own, as this film definitely opens up a lot of questions and emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire is as it's title suggests is based upon a novel and takes place in Harlem, New York and focuses on a 16 year old African American girl in the late 1980's who has the nickname of Precious. Precious is overweight, illiterate, abused at home by her mother and is now expecting her second child. Precious has had a very hard and traumatic life and to escape from it, she will often fantasize about being famous, being loved and being someone who she is not. Things take a turn for Precious as she is accepted into a different type of smaller classroom and school and is mentored and becomes friends with the teacher, Ms. Rain as well as other people she meets along the way including a social worker named Mrs. Weiss. Through believing in herself and the help of others, Precious decides that it is time to make a change and focus on good, rather than bad, and put herself and her education as well as her children first and try to escape from her abusive home life with the help of Ms. Rain, Mrs. Weiss and others who come to her assistance. Precious is not the most easiest film to watch because of the scenes of child abuse, both violent, verbal and sexual at the helm of Precious's mother Mary and her father (who is only on screen a couple of times briefly). The film delves into the history of Precious's childhood and the relationship between her mother and father and the things that have led her to encounter all the problems that she is currently facing, with new ones on the way. It is hard to watch because of the intensity of the actors and subject matter which feels so real and authentic that you get quite disturbed watching it. I am sure there will be enough people who will be turned off of this movie for that reason and maybe have no desire in seeing it at all. While it is difficult to watch at times the film does offer moments of hope, love and a way out for Precious's character, so even at it's most bleakest moments, there are parts of it that leave you with a sense of wanting Precious to go on and succeed and when she starts to do so, you feel good for her inside. The film has a gritty and grainy look to really make the film look authentic of the poverty stricken area than the character's live in and what the environment around them is like. Precious works because of the great performances by the entire cast. Usually every year we have films with at least one or two really standout performances in them and also a lot that do not. This film is the rare exception, where every single person in the cast, no matter how big, or small their role is, they really do the best job they possibly can and they shine bright and deliver top notch and powerful performances. There is no doubt in my mind that Mo'Nique, who plays Mary will win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and Gabbourey Sidibe who plays Precious is also great in here as well as the supporting cast. Wow, a movie where everyone gives their all and does a great job. The filmmakers and behind the scenes crew are equally as good behind the camera, giving us a fascinating screenplay and gritty, realistic and powerful direction. This is a film that almost begs for the audience to talk about it after it's over and it will leave you with something to think about and ponder after you left the theatre, whether the film left an impression on you, or not. The real tragedy is that there are real girls like Precious and mothers like Mary, who these sort of circumstances happen to on a daily basis and we are truly blessed by counsellors, teachers and others who reach out their hands and their hearts for help and Precious is a movie that encourages both people in those type of situations and even those who aren't. It's a film about second chances, starting over and bettering yourself. It is also about love and where we have to look for it. This is a heavy film because of it's subject matter and message and it will be sure to leave you with an impact after watching it. Like, I said earlier, there are some who will never attempt to watch a film like this, but for others, I ask to please give it a chance and whether you end up liking it, or not, think about the message behind it and what it means to you. Because of it's darker subject matter, unfortunately it does not look like Precious will win the Best Picture Oscar, which is a big disappointment, but discover it on your own and see where this brave and powerful film takes you. One of the best films of 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are a number of qualities that make Precious compulsive viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is set in 1987, with an obese sixteen-year-old African American girl named Claireece 'Precious' Jones struggling in school. Claireece lives with her single mother Mary (Mo'Nique), a tyrant who verbally, and sometimes physically, abuses her daughter and forces to cook food for her while she smokes and watches television. At a young age Precious was abused and impregnated by her own father and when she discovers that she is pregnant again with his child, she is suspended from school. A glimmer of hope emerges in Precious' life when she is invited to the Each One Teach One remedial class. Ms. Rain (Paul Patton) is a kind-hearted teacher who educates Precious and the other misfit girls by encouraging them to read and write every day. Precious, who is initially illiterate, begins writing in her notebook and also finds further sympathy from both her teacher and a welfare councillor (Mariah Carey), who uncovers her family secrets.Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, was directed by Lee Daniels, with Oprah Winfrey as one of the films executive producers. Her interest in the project is personal because like Precious she was abused and impregnated as a child. With this emotional investment in the film, few comprises have been made with the subject matter. This is a grueling and sometimes ugly slice of life, certainly not the rags to riches story or the redemptive feel-good movie that cynics might be expecting. Despite its urban casting, this is a film that will speak to a much wider audience because the moral and human issues present, from obesity to child abuse and teenage parentage, are universal and timeless. Daniels has painted an ugly picture of America here, one that is light-years away from the 'greed is good' mentality of the 1980s. Filmed with grainy textures, the film does not shy from visualising this as the complete failure of the American Dream with rundown apartment blocks and graffiti stained slums. While Daniels' direction is gritty it should not be mistaken for being entirely nihilistic either. He contrasts the grim reality of Precious' life with her sometimes misguided imaginings of her mind. She envisions herself as a glamorous star and sees her pictures coming to life to tell her sweet things. In perhaps the most significant of these fantasies though, Precious sees a reflection of herself in the mirror as a beautiful white woman. These brief moments do not feel jarring because they provide, what would be an almost unbearably bleak film, with some light and suggest that Precious has a sometimes funny and imaginative mind, filled with hope for a better life, no matter how unrealistic it might seem to us. For much of the humour that is drawn from these fantasies and Precious' classmates though, the film could never be called sentimental. It remains crushing in its emotion because of the contrast between our hopes for Precious and the setbacks she faces.For Gabourey Sidibe this is an extraordinary debut as an actress and the film rests pivotally on her character to provide an emotional pull for the audience. She succeeds remarkably, not only because she physically possesses this character as few performers could, but also because the emotion she shows is true. The situations, like the domestic abuse she suffers at the hands of both her parents, are delivered with such a force, that we can understand her grief and her pain when it emerges externally. The use of the flashbacks and Precious' voice-over, also help us to understand her internally as well and we feel for her when her ambitions are broken once more. The only fault in her performance is that sometimes it is difficult to understand what she is saying because of her accent. For as good as Sidibe is though, Mo'nique, who has worked mostly in television and as a comedienne, is frighteningly powerful here, matching her co-star with an equally grand performance. While Mary might initially seem like a caricature, with an excessive use of four letter expletives, there is something significantly deeper in both her dialogue and her characterisation. There is a level of jealousy and contempt within her that unleashes onto her daughter because of the sexual abuse and the sexual attention that Precious endured from her father. Even more interestingly, Mary is virtually powerless in front of other adults and it becomes somewhat symbolic that she must don a wig and desperately try to act nice when a social worker comes to visit the apartment. In the final climax too, her desperation with her choked up voice makes her an almost pitiful monster. Mo'Nique is certainly deserving of her favouritism for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year. There are also smaller and quieter performances from Paul Patton, very sincere as Precious' teacher and Mariah Carey, surprisingly believable as a social worker.While for many this film might seem as though it is yet another grim and depressing picture, there are a number of qualities that make Precious compulsive viewing. This is a compelling and daring film because of its ambition to explore such tough and painful subject matter, with very few compromises. Those who are willing to brave the film and be challenged by its themes will be rewarded with an emotional experience because of the truthfulness of the performances and the touching nature of the narrative as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although normally up for most any "arthouse" film, I was reluctant to go to this one for some reason, and almost had to have my arm twisted to agree to going with my companion. I'm so glad I did! "Precious" offers a view into a subculture that the majority of Americans never get to witness or understand. It is powerful on so many levels, it would be tough to try and single each one out so as to write a meaningful review here. Visualize these - set in Harlem (New York City), rape, teen pregnancy, welfare mothers, illiteracy, an alternative school ... Get the idea?Get past any reservations you might have and go to see this film ~ you will be richly rewarded if you do!</fullReview>

She has an abusive mother, she gets poor grades at school and just got expelled for becoming pregnant for the second time."Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire" is a powerful and saddening film. The story is just too engaging and heartbreaking. Seeing Precious live in poverty, without love and without purpose is so sad. I don't know how she made it through in that household, and not have run away. Sadly, this kind of abuse is not just a film, as I am sure there are so many people out there having a live exactly like Precious.

		<fullReview>I personally loved the movie and I am only leaving a comment to respond to all the negative reviews that I have seen on here, because they all seem to say the same things. Because there are plenty of lengthy reviews all ready, I'll make this plain and simple.For those of you who saw no positive message in this movie. I say to you, "Realize your own demons that are keeping you in the darkness, find someone(anyone who is willing to hold your hand to get though it), and then work on it to rise above it. I say this to you because unlike Precious you seem to be educated and for the most part literate, so unlike Precious again the only thing stopping you from seeing the light is YOU".I saw hope and a chance for a better life in this movie, a life better than the one statistics would say she should lead as an adult. So, get over your issues, cause she sure did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A survival story unlike any other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sixteen year old girl who can hardly read and write is pregnant with her second child, is overweight, and her mother abuses her mentally and physically. What keeps her going?If ever there was a character that I wanted to reach out and help, it would be Precious. This is the situation for Precious in Lee Daniel's powerful film Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. The film takes place in Harlem in the mid 1980s. We follow this 16 year old girl (Gabourney 'Gabby' Sidibe) as she tries to survive at school and at home. She is presented with an opportunity to attend an alternative education program. Her mother, played by comedienne Mo'Nique, disapproves because she doesn't see the need for an education when Precious could just earn a welfare check.Precious attends the school where she is surrounded by girls under very similar circumstances. Some have children, others lack the basic skills necessary to survive in the real world. They all have one thing in common, and that is a desire to better themselves, although some are more willing than others. Their teacher, Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), gives them a notebook to right their thoughts in. Precious seizes this opportunity and improves with each lesson.I have sat through many gut-wrenching and powerful films, but few have left such an impact as Precious. Through the four main performances by Sibide, Mo'Nique, Patton, and even Mariah Carey gives a surprisingly good performance as the social worker trying to solve Precious' problems. These four actresses pour everything out onto the screen. Without even saying a word you know what they are feeling and thinking. I was especially surprised by Mo'Nique's performance. Her character is so twisted, confused, and conflicted. I had only seen bits and pieces of Mo'Nique's stand up and some small on screen roles, but I had no idea how powerful her screen presence could be.A lot of credit must go to Daniels for the production. He blends together the real world, Precious' dream world, and also his own creative touch with certain montages and intense scenes. The images are powerful, disturbing, and well executed. As tough as the subject is, he presents it in such a way that is engaging and very moving.I have not read Push: A Novel, by Sapphire for which this film is based on, but I can only assume that the images presented here are as vivid as they are in the text. The story is heartbreaking, terrifying, and uplifting. It's a survival story unlike any other I have seen or heard, and I encourage everyone to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few films that have me in tears from beginning to end; Precious is one of those films. If you're still complaining about the economy and not being able to go on that holiday vacation, try taking a walk in Precious Jones' shoes. Set in Harlem in the late-Eighties, the film explores the life of Precious Jones, an illiterate, pregnant teenager trying to survive. Physically and emotionally battered by her deadbeat mother, raped by her father, and still in junior high, the sixteen-year old finds solace in her daydreams and at the alternative school she gets reassigned to. Intense and difficult to watch for the first hour, the film shows the bight side of life for a girl living in her own Hell.Only his second film, Lee Daniels (Shadowboxer) is a marvel behind the camera. Not since Midnight Cowboy has anyone looked at desolation and dreams with such an unflinching eye and carry on a story that echoes the ominous passages of Hubert Selby Jr. One name that is sure to pop up during Oscar time is Gabourey Sidibe. A 26-year-old Psychology major with no experience behind the camera, Sidibe's raw and naked performance as Precious will leave you speechless. Take Joan Crawford, Ike Turner, and Frank Booth and roll it into one role and you have Mo'Nique giving a once-in-a-lifetime performance as Precious' psychotic mother. Mariah Carey not only can break the sound barrier, but give a stunning performance on screen as Precious' social worker. Finally, the blood of Glitter can be wiped clean off her hands! If I were to make a list of the best films of this year, Precious would definitely be up there. If you want to feel inspired and have hope, run (Don't Walk!) to Precious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW- What an Amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that separates "Precious" from other movies that insert physical abuse and incest on the screen is that it doesn't feel contrived or forced. These are real people we're watching, there is no unnecessary dramatic interludes of music, and it isn't a PG-13 rip-off so that twelve year-old white girls can go and feel they've "experienced" urban culture.It is a fast-paced, raw display of domestic abuse and finding your roots to 'push' yourself forward.Gabourey Sidibe delivers an earth-shattering performance as Precious, a sixteen year-old obese girl living in New York in the eighties who suffers from having a mother so abusive, she makes Ike Turner seem like Mr. Brady of "The Brady Bunch". She is pregnant with her father's second child, but acts indifferent and pretty normal in school- until she is transferred to a special learning center to help girls prepare for their GED by writing.The simplistic nature of the plot helps pave the way for moments of power and incredibly sad scenes. Mo'Nique (who right now is a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is flawless as Mary, the dominant, insufferable mother who makes it her duty to harm, torture and abuse Sidibe's character- yet Sidibe stands strong, isn't beating herself up every day, and actually wakes up every morning and keeps doing her thing. This makes me think of all the hopeless, lame people I know who have problems minuscule to this girl, yet drown in their sorrow every day wanting attention from anyone who will listen. Precious is a heroic figure in that she never drops her guard, and keeps on going even when news gets worse and worse for her.Mariah Carey also turns in a surprisingly honest and passive performance as a understanding Welfare officer who has sessions with Precious (and later Mary)and never feels fake or abstract in her approach. Its a nice turn, though an Oscar nomination may not quite be there...yet.The rest of the cast is also stellar, and you're never bored. Its an emotional experience (especially the final twenty minutes), so be prepared to see one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

I'm sorry but have you ever heard of the police. i think this got nominated and was successful because Oprah was apart of it. i don't even like Oprah so i should of saw it coming. its a very silly movie and shouldn't of been made. this is a silly movie that was not needed and i think it should win a razzie for worst picture. my recommendation. do not see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL 'PUSH' BY SAPPHIRE (2009) **** Gabourney 'Gabby' Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey, Sherri Shepherd, Lenny Kravitz, Stephanie Andujar, Chyna Layne, Amina Robinson, Xosha Roquemore. Harrowing yet ultimately inspiring and uplifting melodrama about an abused, near-illiterate teenage girl (portrayed with amazing skill by novice Sidibe in this jaw-dropping big-screen acting debut) whose incest-plagued homelife nearly poisons her to the point of self-destruction with only her welfare-dependent monstrous mother (incredibly enacted by comedienne Mo'Nique) whose love/hate relationship has taken its toll to the limit. Novice filmmaker Lee Daniels makes an indelible impression with his flair for fantasy and reality that blends and blurs the edges of a young woman who is at the precipice of despair. Oscar nominations should be in order for Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Patton ? as the sympathetic and inspirational teacher-figure and dare I even say, Carey as a de-glammed social worker whose empathy has its limits. Powerfully overwhelming with human emotion. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of getting to watch this movie at the Writers Guild Theatre with a Q&amp;A after with Gabby Sidibe and Paula Patton present. Maria Carey couldn't make the Q&amp;A because she got taken by Jay Leno that same day. I do agree that it is a very powerful adaptation of the life of an overweight low self-esteem girl who's family abused her throughout her life and father who sexually raped her, caused her to have a child who is born a mongoloid and has a second child from another rape from her father while her mother is looking the other way in another room. Although she seems to be well fed (chubby), she seems to be constantly hungry, poor, many times angry because she is being teased by other people surrounding her and when she gets home, she gets things thrown by her own mother and gets verbally abused. She even goes and steals a bucket of chicken from a fast food restaurant. Precious does go to her "happy place" fantasy world when her situation gets bad and maybe a way to protect her mental self. Powerful as it may seem as the crowd cries over my shoulder, I get this cold feeling somehow. Even though this is the kind of situation that happens with a very poor unwanted illiterate girl, I get many different mixed feeling about this movie. It's got some funny moments throughout the film, but at the same time coming out at the time when people are at their weak points in life, this may not give a positive role play. In fact, I believe that it is somewhat shockingly extreme that there are actually families that live their lives this way in the Ghetto. It's best to always look forward to positives things in life no matter how dim and desolate it may be for a person. This character finally gets out of her wretched family and turns to a teacher and counselor to try to turn her life around. Precious's mother would be an extreme person who only cares about getting welfare checks more than the welfare of her own daughter and shockingly doesn't seem to care one bit about the children that were born (you will be shocked at some of the segments of what the mother does to the babies). So how could this movie be a true heart movie? I really can't say because it's torn and split many peoples hearts before becoming recovered in the end. Again, I have to admit that the realism played by an actress (Gabby) who still doesn't think she is an actress played a role that would rival some of experienced actresses who's been doing it for years. My final conclusion is that it is still a worthy movie to be seen because it will definitely transport you to a world that you wish or glad not to live this life.Ferdy</fullReview>

The scenes are not interconnecting, again, no direction. The director/scriptwriter has a lot to learn. Precious could have been a GREAT movie if the script is better. They have much to learn from Iranian directors. Gabourey Sidibe's acting is pretentious to a certain extent. Like that scene where she beat her mother up, her mom threw a TV at her from a high floor, but she manages to miss it, but she act she so damn cool and calm. It's so cheesy and unrealistic.

		<fullReview>Without question there are far worse films on which one could spend their movie dollars. That said, "Precious" fell far short of the rave reviews that enticed me to go see it. In true Tyler Perry fashion, this movie was unflinching in its illustration of the depths of depravity of its primary antagonist, Mary, who was the mother of Clareece Precious Jones, the movie's main character. It also spared no punches in its depiction of the bleak reality that exists for some teen mothers. In this case an obese sixteen year old, whose incestuous and virtually unseen father, was also the father of her two children; and whose horrendously abusive mother used Precious and her Down's Syndrome stricken daughter to continually defraud the welfare system.The production of this movie, which was based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire, was excellent. The plot was well constructed, and there were several powerful acting performances, most notably Gabourney Sidibe as Precious; and comedienne Mo'Nique as her mother Mary. Even Mariah Carey was quite convincing as the family's welfare counselor. The plot however, was largely distasteful to this viewer. While I can in no way deny that the circumstances that Precious is forced to deal with, are likely similar to those of more teenage girls than many may care to acknowledge; I am constantly disturbed by the manner in which, with the exception of Spike Lee, African American filmmakers focus on the most negative and corrupt aspects of black life in America. While the story told in this movie is unique to most other African American movie productions, its portrayal of African American negligence, laziness, lawlessness and immorality is arguably more patently reprehensible than in most. Overall, while you could spend your money on worse films, it also shouldn't be difficult to find other movies that are much more worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My name is Clareece Precious Jones. I want to be on the cover of a magazine. I wish a had a light-skinned boyfriend with good hair. But first I want to be in one of those BET videos." Precious in the film of the same name is 16, black, overweight, a mother of 2 children by her father, lives in Harlem, and dreams of music videos and a white boyfriend. This powerful slice of poor life seems unremittingly real and when juxtaposed with reality TV, downright authentic.It's not difficult to see why this deeply affecting character study won top prizes from Sundance, Cannes, and Toronto: Its star is a new talent so immersed in her role that to think of her not being Precious is almost impossible, even for a cynic like me. Proficient with his second film, director Lee Daniels guides diva Mariah Carey into a role as an unforgettably underplayed social worker.For an educator such as I, the classroom scenes at an alternative school where Precious prepares for the G.E.D are inspiring glimpses of how small classrooms with a gifted, patient teacher (Paula Patton as Ms. Rain) can transform the lost causes into productive citizens. Those scenes and the ones in the hospital where Precious delivers her second child are but brief unreal dreams in their own way of the love that may wait for Precious later in life?not now because her abusive mom still appears and tortures Precious in different ways (skillfully acted by comedienne Mo'Nique).When Precious sees the endearing relationship her beloved teacher has with her partner, she exclaims, "They talk like people in TV shows that I don't watch." It's a brave, new world for her and a sobering joy for us to vicariously suffer and delight with a character whose weight might symbolize the heavy and complicated world that she may never be able completely to escape .</fullReview>

I'm not an insensitive person, but I had a hard time feeling sympathy for Precious. Her situation was indeed awful, Gabby Sidibe is not a bad actress by any stretch, and many girls and boys are forced to live with abuse like Precious. So what's the problem? The character just struck me as being sort of underdeveloped. Had Precious been given more of a personality, I would have been crying while watching this film. Precious, her Mother, and many of her classmates all struck me as stereotypical "ghetto chicks." Psychical and Mental abuse can happen to anyone, but seriously, Precious steels a giant bucket of fried chicken. Mo'nique's performance is very good. She plays the abusive mother well, but she fits the "Welfare Queen" stereotype perfectly. There are defiantly people who fit these stereotypes, but some of the characters were just stereotypes with no real development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt everything one ought to feel for the main character in the story in the sense of compassion. All the way I also felt all the rage one ought to feel against her mother. But come the climax, a very felt climax that goes to the core of our main protagonist's ordeal, does not go to the root of the monster that made the mother what she is, a monster that not even the psychiatrist wanted to touch, but that in her way, own right has a history that ought to examined just like that of Precious. Its easy to judge people simply on the lines that we/I would never do such acts but even the worst of acts can be justified according to one's ordeal. What I am trying to say hear is what is it that might have happened to Precious' mother in childhood to make her what she became, a great lack of opportunity maybe way less than that of Precious and we are not all strong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is NOT for children, unless you want to show your rebellious teenager what a REAL dysfunctional family is. This movie will not make you laugh or smile or feel better in any way. The previews have given most of the movie away...I will not give you the ending but I will comment.First the positives: Acting was Outstanding by everyone. Monique found a hard dark acting role and pounded it to make you forget she does comedy. Gabourey Sibide, Paula Patton had solid roles. They even gave serious drama work to Lenny Kravitz and Mariah Carey. Lee Daniels did a great job directing this movie, flow was good and it felt fresh. ART direction was stellar, Particularly liked the Gabourey dream sequences.Negatives: Well as I said this movie is rough on the soul, to me only could serve as negative reinforcement for mother daughter relationships. Got a very strong feeling the writer has a very pro lesbian with male hatred thing going on. Myself a father of 2 daughters did not appreciate the demonizing of males and glaringly obvious absence of a positive father figure anywhere in the movie. Ohh no wonder Oprah loved this movie...she gets all kinds of plugs in this movie.Personally I would rather recommend you watch The Blind Side, The Color Purple or Monsters Ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastating but unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not completely sure whether Precious is a brutal complaint on the failed North American social system or a reminder of the human baseness which is hidden behind the tricky face of the "civilization".It may be a combination of those things.But, more concretely, Precious is a devastating film experience which is not easy to put into a niche, but it is definitely difficult to forget.Till where I know, Precious is not based on a true story, but it feels much more authentic and credible than most of the Hollywood dramas, and part of that merit is on the extraordinary performances from Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique, who are both able to transmit emotions which even the the smallest gestures.Paula Patton and Mariah Carey also bring excellent performances, because they show a lot of precision and conviction on their roles.I also liked the discipline from the screenplay very much, because it never allows the characters to take easy way of the pity, or degrades them for the spectators' compassion.Of course it was devastating to see the sufferings from the main character, and even the twisted mentality from her mother, but screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher never shows the characters as passive martyrs worthy of pity, but as strong people who do not have the opportunity to escape from their unfortunate situation.The social and cultural commentaries this movie makes are are as important as the story, and even though I found them to be very appropriate, some people interpreted them as racist or degrading to black people.However, by my humble point of view, those opinions are wrong, because the problems the main character suffers are not determined by her race, but because by the prevailing condition on the most oppressed sectors from any country and any city, where the protection and the good intentions from politicians and educators do not save them from the cruelty and family vices which are difficult to extirpate.It is true the fact that Precious shows us the problems without creating any solutions; however that restriction could be due to the fact that Fletcher tried to avoid political tendencies which could play against the story.The only thing I could say against this movie is that there are a few elements of manipulation on the screenplay.However, that is not a very important fail, because that is compensated by many positive elements.Precious is a movie which is difficult to describe, because nothing compares to the experience of watching it.It is definitely a strong film, so I do not know if some people could stomach it; however, I enthusiastically recommend it to those who want to see an important film, which offers a level of substance which is not common to see in contemporary cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PRECIOUS is a Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, inner city life for a desperate teen is portrayed as a hopeless cycle of poverty, neglect, and despair. As envisioned by director Lee Daniels from the adaptation by Geoffrey Fletcher, life is hard and only redeemed by people who care and are willing to nurture the abused victim. This is a harrowing look at a dysfunctional family and one girl's hope for a better life, and it benefits from towering performances by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique who bring home this heartfelt, slice of life.The story opens with a pleasant, idyllic family setting with a teenager, Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), and the fantasy turns suddenly into a stark reality. It is 1987 Harlem where Precious lives as a cook, gofer, and almost as a slave to her domineering, abusive mother (Mo'Nique). Together, they are poor, always hungry and living on welfare. She hopes for a normal existence and is always beaten down verbally, physically and emotionally by her mom and the neighborhood gangs. She was pregnant at age 16 by her abusive, absentee father and already has a small, mentally challenged child by him. To escape her despair, she daydreams of a loving and supportive storybook world.Switched to an alternative school that specializes in troubled youth, she meets a disparate group of girls and a disciplined teacher, Miss Rain (Paula Patton). Precious learns to read and understand a world beyond the confines of her existence. She begins to trust her teacher, and her support group is this motley group of classmates. This support comes into play when she gives birth to her second child and when her mother attacks her.Her mother is so manipulative that she wants to stay on welfare, and she makes no secret of her distrust of white people. She even puts on a pretend act for a visiting social worker. At the welfare office, another social worker (Mariah Carey in no makeup) learns the horrible truth about Precious' home life. Before long, Precious receives bad news that rocks her world and sets up a confrontation with her manipulative, con-artist of a mom and determines an uncertain future for herself and her children.Daniels lends a very sure hand in directing this powerful story. Even as a novice director, he grabs his audience and keeps you involved in a very interesting tale based on truth. He offers a fresh perspective and after a success at producing (Monsters Ball, The Woodsman), is a talent to watch. The film is shot in almost a hand-held semi-documentary manner. The budget must have been modest which suits the setting and story. Its technique and exposition belie an independent film (Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are executive producers).Sidibe and Mo'Nique carry the show, but Patton and Carey are quite good as supportive characters. Singer Lenny Kravitz has a small but effective part as a male nurse who befriends Precious.The only real negative is that the film ends abruptly which may be just the point-that life does go on and it does so on Precious' own terms. This is no Hollywood ending, that's for sure. Also, repetitive use is made of Precious' daydream fantasies of a happier life. It almost veers to self parody although there is an excellent moment where she dresses in front of a mirror and sees a well dressed white woman; so much for visual statements about self image.So good are the portrayals of Precious and her mom that the other characters are given only marginal exposition. We want to learn more about her teacher and her classmates, but this is, after all, a story about Precious. For her first acting gig, Sidibe does a remarkable job, and Mo'Nique is so convincing as a maternal monster, that Oscar beckons. For a film based on real life experiences and truths, this one is hard to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain movies that have certain elements, that change the way one thinks - or the way one views someones way of life - this is one of those movies.This is a very difficult movie to sit through - with many difficult situations to witness.Its not very often that a movie explores the real true-to-life aspects of a difficult life.Similar to "Monster" and also "Monsters Ball" for the gruesome and depressing genre's in which they were illustrated - but both produced values of the human condition, that we all try to cast out or forget in our society.Let's be honest - this isn't a feel good movie. Not having read the book, its hard to compare and contrast - but you don't need to in order to understand the characters and screenplay.Mirah Carey did a good job - I can't tell you how impressed I was with what Gabourey Sidibe was able to accomplish.Chances are you won't see this film again once you see it - but seeing it once, is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concept Solid and Touching, Technical Aspects Just Acceptable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Start with the title of this highly touted film PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL "PUSH" BY SAPPHIRE. That seems a bit presumptuous. Then note that the film's Executive Producers are Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, and that the film includes Mariah Carey in the cast and the piece seems to have been directed toward notice by the Academy people. For this viewer this is a nice little story that is a very touching examination of the life of a girl with all odds against her who survives it all. Lee Daniels directs an interesting cast who bring off Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay with all of its street talk very well. But is the overall effect worth all the hoopla? Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) is an obese, abused 16 year old who has no friends and no support and is pregnant with her second child, the result of rape by her father. She lives with her worthless fat abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique in a truly brilliant performance) and the two dwell in a hovel as dark as Precious' future: Prescious' only salvation is in her dreams of being a glamorous singing and movie star and these sequences are well choreographed. There is a break though for Precious when she is placed in an Alternative School under the warmth and caring pedagogy by Blue Rain (Paula Patton) and she begins her journey to literacy and finding some sense of dignity. Along the way she is assisted by social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and a day care worker played by the novel's author, Sapphire. Precious is surrounded by a classroom of interesting struggling teens - all well portrayed.The standout performance in this film and the actress deserving of recognition is Mo'Nique. Gabourey Sidebe physically fills her part but she is given very little (except for a major final scene) to display talent. See the film out of curiosity and for the message it delivers.

		<fullReview>This is a good story that needed to be told in Hollywood and I believe a lot of people will leaving the theater relating to this story in one way or another.The Cast was really good and the directors vision and creativeness on how everything was presented was very different and refreshing. This movie has a little bit of everything, Laughs, Tears and just real life living. Now that i spoke on the good things i will speak on the cons.For one i felt there didn't travel to a lot of places story wise which isn't bad but limited..kinda like going to a play. They really took the time to stress certain things overly and I would have liked to use that time to lay more background story and explain more stones that weren't completely turned over. The movie ends in a place where you still have questions and left me looking for more to hold on to and for more of a finale. This movie is good but it leaves me wanting to read the book so i can understand more in perspective and explain everything to me. I felt like i had two strikes going against me for one, a damn young couple who bought their baby to the theater and the baby wouldn't shut up or get it together. Instead of getting up and packing it up like decent people they kept they baby in the theater...i was heated and that stopped me from getting into it .but i digress,..seconding I listened to people hype this movie up to the point my expectations were high to begin with and that's not a good thing, cause when it comes to movie's you find the most diverse opinions so go and see it for yourself with an open mind and get out of it what you will and what you leave behind, someone will take away the rest. I give it somewhere between a C+/B-. From recent movies i saw lately i would put it slightly below Blind Side in rankings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious horrific moments captured on film; We should all help these Precious children!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Precious: Based on the novel Push by Sapphire" is not for the weak hearted or the tear drencher, but it's a very commendable societal message film about one teenager's horrific conditions. That teen would be our protagonist Clarisse "Precious" Jones who lives in an abusive hellhole. Precious, who goes by her middle name, is pregnant for the second time due to her father's sexual abuse towards her. She is also constantly verbally &amp; physically abused by her self-centered and vengeful mother Mary. To add more abuse to the fire, she is constantly victimized by the physical &amp; verbal bullying from her school peers. Precious has a child with Down's Syndrome, also fathered by her abusive pop. As you can see, not exactly "Precious Moments" for Precious. Through all these demons she encounters, Precious still possesses imaginative visions &amp; fantasies of a dreamlike existence which becomes an integral factor of her resiliency. Precious' life takes a turn for the better when she enrolls in an alternative school and is consoled by the incredibly genuine teacher Ms. Rain. Rain does not exactly cause Precious life to be instantly sunny, but she provides immeasurable support &amp; guidance for her. Another wise woman who helps Precious is the caring social worker Ms. Weiss. Paula Patton as Ms. Rain, and Mariah Carey (yes that one) as Ms. Weiss provided the film proper thespian support with their excellent supporting acting performances. Lenny Kravitz (yes that one) also flies high and not away in the film's Supporting Acting with his charismatic performance as a Nurse's Aide. But the top thespian firepower in the film's supporting acting comes from Mo'Nique's haunting work as the black "Mommie Dearest mother from hell" Mary. Mo acclaim, including a shoe-in Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, are headed towards the Mo'nique Highway. Newcomer Gabby Sidibe will also share some of that Movie Award spotlight with Mo'Nique due to her extraordinary starring performance as Precious. I could gab more about Gabby's extraordinaire but I have to move on to some Daniel shots. Director Lee Daniels does push the Precious fantasy scenes much too often, but it does not discredit his otherwise brilliant orchestration of "Precious". Screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay was relevantly melodramatic even though at times he abused on the repetitive cursing way too many times, which become a nuisance instead of a narrative element. "Precious: Based on the novel Push by Sapphire" will not be my favorite film of 2009, but I sure give it a push to be the most influential film of 2009. So be precious and do good to others every day, you can make a difference in somebody's life! Simple message but yet so powerful! **** Good</fullReview>

The acting is good, undoubtedly...maybe Oscar worthy. But the movie pretty much doesn't teach you anything new...it's the "life sucks" drama...but they start from the bottom of the sea...and just show you a slow and painful uplifting towards higher meanings. Problem is the taste it leaves you with. It's just not enjoyable. And by far the whole movie is not Oscar worthy. And if it is...bad news everybody...'cause if this is how low we have to get just to feel good at the end of a movie...suicide rates and drug addiction rates well be off the charts...in a few years. Really sad unsatisfying movie. :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Precious (2009) **** (out of 4) Hard-hitting drama about 16-year-old Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) who has just been kicked out of school because she's become pregnant for the second time by her father. With her life going no where and living with an abusive mother (Mo'Nique), Precious finds support in a teacher (Paula Patton) who sees something in her. This certainly isn't the most cheerful movie in the world and there's no doubt that you'll leave in a state of depression so this here will be enough to keep people away from seeing this movie but they'll be missing out on something really special. What the film is is proof that you don't need big bucks to tell a good story. You also don't need big bucks to find great performances. This movie is one I respect very much because there were so many chances for this thing to go soft or pour some sugar on the subject matter but it never does that. The movie is smart enough to know that if you live in the ghetto, can hardly read and you're pregnant for the second time by your father then there's only so much you can hope for in life. What I found so endearing about this movie is that Precious might have dreams of being a model but she knows her life is a horrid one and that she's been delivered some ugly things. She doesn't hope for something super but instead just stuff most people take for granted. Sidibe turns in a marvelous performances and it's rather shocking to see she's a newcomer because it's doubtful many professional actors could have turned in a performance like this. The rawness of her performance makes you feel as if you're watching a real person going through these issues for real. I had to pinch myself several times while watching this thing just to remind myself that I was watching an actress and not a real person. Like many, I was skeptical of the musicians in their roles but Mo'Nique is downright brilliant and makes for one of the most memorable villains in film history. Where she dug down to pull the evilness of this character from is truly eye-opening. Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz have small roles and both do fine jobs as well. I think Patton deserves a lot more praise than she's getting as she's really a lot of the heart of the movie and she's terrific in her role of the teacher. The caring teacher is something we've seen countless times in movies but Patton really delivers a touching performance. The movie's subject matter is extremely dark and ugly but it's actually a lot uglier than what I've said because I want to avoid a couple spoilers. This isn't a movie that will make you feel good but it's certainly a powerful movie with some great performances and a winning story. Director Daniels does a terrific job at keeping the viewer in the movie and I loved his laid back approach. Several times he could have sugar coated things or started preaching but he never does that and instead just lets the film play out as it would in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few months back I saw the trailer for Precious and as scary as the trailer was, I was so curious about this movie. Then of course at the end of the trailer they mention how Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey are promoting this film and I just knew "Oh, boy, here we go with the 'Oprah loves it, it's gotta be good'". But still the story caught my interest and I was very interested in seeing this movie. So I just gotta say this: Mo'Nique blew me away! I saw her in Phat Girlz and I've seen her stand up, I love this woman. But when I saw Roscoe Jenkins with Matthew Lawrence, I wasn't so sure that anyone would take her seriously. She's absolutely amazing in this film, not like "oh, she got a break and did good" amazing, like phenomenally she should get an Oscar nomination amazing. She and new comer Gabourey Sidibe did a great job and made this film really work. This story is heart wrenching and one of the better films of 2009.In 1987, obese, illiterate, black 16-year-old Claireece "Precious" Jones lives in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem with her dysfunctional family; she has been raped and impregnated twice by her father, Carl, and suffers constant physical, mental and sexual abuse from her unemployed mother, Mary. The family resides in a tenement and subsists on welfare. Her first child, has Down Syndrome and is being cared for by Precious's grandmother. After Precious becomes pregnant for the second time, she is suspended from school. Her junior high school principal, Mrs. Lichtenstein arranges to have her attend an alternative school, which she hopes can help Precious change her life's direction. In Precious' mind there is another world, one in which, unlike her real one, she is loved and appreciated. Inspired by her new teacher Miss Rain, Precious begins learning to read. Precious meets sporadically with a social worker named Miss Weiss, who learns about incest in the household. She gives birth to her second child and names him Abdul. After Precious's mother deliberately drops three-day-old Abdul and hits Precious, Precious fights back long enough to get her son and flees her home permanently and eventually learns that she and her children are loved.Precious has captured America's heart and won't let go. While I feel like the ending falls a little flat, it's still a great story. I'm going to hate myself for this as I am a hater of Mariah Carey, but the girl can act? I didn't think it was possible after the disaster film that was Glitter but she and Lenny Kravitz really held their own in this film and did a good job. I'm not sure around Oscar time what kind of nominations this movie will receive but I'm hoping for Mo'Nique to get an Oscar nod for her incredible performance. Her speech at the end that I will not give away, but trust me it was beyond incredible and really moved me as well as the entire audience. But to see Precious, an overweight pregnant teenager, who does not feel like she belongs in this world go through life trying her best to just be invisible, going home to a monster mother to people reminding her she's loved and a great person was so beautiful. I do recommend Precious as it's an uplifting story, but like Slumdog Millionaire, you have to go through the good, the bad and the ugly to get the happy part of the story.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious should just be in Writing not for a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie was released on theaters, i was so excited to watch it because i thought it was something worth watching. I thought it was something different and makes my day right. There were many movies on the row, one of which is The Men Who Stares at Goats which i also believe to be something soul lifting- but i ended up crossing my leg for Precious.Though out the story, i remained optimistic and was able to hold myself to walk out of little disappointment and somehow ponder and hope to get something useful to give a little concern. The movie for me is not a masterpiece but an eye opener to those people who remain blind of the reality that is COMMON to our society even before. The story is simple and is sandwiched with flashes of day dreaming by a Harlem teenage girl who is fat, illiterate and ugly. She is raped and impregnated by her freak father and watched helplessly by her own mother.The theme of the story is common to most places where poverty is overwhelming. Crime become a passion to many of them where hopelessness numbs the minds and rather engage to something where self satisfaction is filled up to ease the painful reality. Lack of education, poverty and drug addiction may lead to crimes like robbery and rape. In Precious, incest happens- impregnated for two times and maltreatment is obvious. How could a mother allows her daughter being raped by her husband and watched without doing something? How could a mother stop her child from getting education and rather seat down, watch TV, eat, smoke and make a huge ass? Another issue in the story is the high number of people living in Welfare. Imagine the United States where people around the world look up and dream for holds high number of people living in Welfare- others on junk places. Welfare is a resort of the government to at least maintain a good image from the rest of world and house them to a place where they are hidden from shame when reality checks itself. Rather than allowing them to stay on streets and subways, they are hold in place where their visibility is controlled- Welfare.I think the reason why Precious receives some awards is because people who judge the movie are not exposed to cases like that and are carried away feeling overwhelmed and finally raises concerns among them. How could they not know its existence? Its common. For the movie itself, i don't find it interesting but as i say an eye opener. The casting is good but i feel a little doubtful with the character played by Mariah Carey as a social worker- an irony of her Diva looks.As a whole, Precious is a so so movie- the theme is there but for entertainment sake its four out of ten.</fullReview>

After having finally seen this it must be said that it is as excellent as "Slumdog Millionaire" but requires a stronger will to watch and will not leave the viewer with the same sense of triumph. Each actor achieves greatness in their roles but the standouts for me were: Monique - a shocking but sadly believable mother of intense violence and anger, Lenny Kravitz - quietly astounding as a male nurse, and finally the biggest surprise for me, Mariah Carey as a social worker, weary, almost dispassionate, and quite honestly more beautiful without makeup than she ever has been with. Yes, Gabourey Sidibe certainly deserves an Oscar consideration but seeing the aforementioned music stars in such gritty and unglamorous roles may result in many supporting Oscar nominations. This is a difficult movie to watch - not in that it lacks merit but in that it strains the limits of what a human can emotionally endure - but it is well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a disaster, but it's deftly controlled by director Lee Daniels and wonderfully performed by everyone involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tremendous. Yeah, it isn't anything super original or anything, but its picture of downtrodden people is intensely moving and tasteful (certainly not the cheap melodrama the trailer hints at - sorry Tyler Perry). It puts us into the mind and life of Precious, a 300 pound, African American, teenage mother of one (and expecting a second). Her life is Hell and she has little hope. She lives with her abusive mother (Mo'Nique in a career defining performance) who tells her school is worthless, and so is she until she gets on welfare. Precious' school puts her into an alternative education system, taught by a woman whose actual name is Blu Rain (Paula Patton), in order to turn her life around. Oh, and musicians Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz have small roles. Saying it all out loud definitely makes it sound like a disaster waiting to happen. And I won't say that it doesn't have some clichés, but the film always feels in control and never strays into cringe-worthy melodrama. A good part of the reason it is successful is director Lee Daniels. His work will probably largely go unrecognized, but that's because it's subtle. He does make a few mistakes along the way (the fantasy life that Precious leads is probably necessary, but he often relies too much on that and he definitely should have stepped back from it nearer the end of the movie), but he makes it all feel real. And he's surely responsible in part for uncovering real acting talent in Mo'Nique, Carey and Kravitz. The musicians should really have been a deal breaker, and I'm not really sure how they got involved, but they both do a fantastic job. And, of course, there's Gabby Sibide as Precious. She's the other major reason the film works. It's the cliché story of amateur casting, to be sure, and she'll probably vanish into the mist afterward, but, man, does she deliver. Her performance is deeply layered, and we get to witness the layers being pulled back. Precious is without a doubt one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It is pretty unusual that I would consider a movie a must-see and give it only a 7 rating. The reason to see this is for the knockout, terrifying performance of Mo'Nique. Her raging turn reminds me a bit of Peter Boyle in Monster's Ball - you just can't take your eyes off of her despite the feeling of totally disgust.The film itself is a bit uneven, though it does have some powerful moments. The best scenes are those with mother (Mo'Nique) and daughter (fabulous newcomer Gabby Sidibe). The syrupy, not so believable moments come in the Paula Patton's classroom and the office of Mariah Carey (though Ms. Carey is dowdied down with no make-up, stringy hair and a rough accent). Also Lenny Kravitz brings an attempt to lighten the mood as a male nurse.Certainly the subject matter of Sapphire's novel make for some gut-wrenching scenes and extremely volatile subject matter. Discussions after this could go on for days ... usually a sign of a top notch film. Again, let me say, that I see this one falling short as a great movie, but definitely recommend it for the performances ... especially the Oscar nomination bound Mo'Nique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over rated to the extreme!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hype (which I never care about) you would expect this movie to be good in some way. NOPE.I was expecting the actress who played Precious to be something impressive, but she failed also.THe movie just goes NOWHERE.You can't understand what Precious is saying half the time because its just mumbling.I was really, really bored after 50 minutes of watching, but stuck with it. There is no depth to Precious's character. We don't see her laugh or smile at all, not that I can remember.Lenny Kravitz and Maria Carey were just an utter waste of time in this movie. Pathetic.Monique on the other hand was the only one acting.What a totally over rated movie. The director zooms in and out in scenes making it really amateurish, serious scenes are cut and then we're bombarded with these pathetic dreams sequences.The movie failed to connect to me in any way.Just crap really. Could of been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just what the world needs: Another film directed by a business man who struck it rich at 21 and who now profits from telling stories that feed Americans the lie they call "The American Dream": Everything will work out, no matter where you started! Director Lee Daniels likely knows very little about the profound issues he attempts to deal with here, and even less about female characters; he has a gift for raunchy realism but none for reality. Strengths: Some of the diaglogue.This film earns 3 stars for its first half, 2 for the third quarter and none for the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong portrait of villainous mother offsets predictable tale of inner city victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most viewers who hated 'Precious', one of the primary objections was the film tended to reinforce stereotypes of African-Americans. If taken literally (as some have done), one can conclude that the negative, 'acting-out' behavior in lower class black neighborhoods is typical of almost ALL black people in such environments. If this was so, why would Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry promote such a film? The answer is that the film is not intended to represent the complex reality of life in the inner city. Rather, it is an intentional exaggeration for dramatic effect.Since the 19th century, melodrama has been the most commercially successful of all types of drama (think of films such as 'Gone With the Wind' or 'Titanic'). Basic Melodrama is tragedy reduced to a more simplistic level which the masses can more easily understand. Characters in melodrama are pretty much one-dimensional, with clearly defined heroes (or heroines) and villains. The audience of course identifies with the hero but it is the villain that they're truly interested in. A successful melodrama always features a maniacal and better yet, diabolical, villain.'Precious' wins points in serving up its own entry in the diabolical villain category, Mary, the mother from hell, played by Mo'Nique. When she's alone with Precious, she treats her own daughter as if she's her personal slave: there are physical beatings and constant psychological humiliation. Worse, she stands by as she allows Precious's father (her boyfriend) to rape and later impregnate her daughter twice. It's hinted that Precious's first daughter ends up with Down's Syndrome due to a beating received by the mother from hell while Precious is pregnant. Mary callously refers to the first child as "Mongo" (for 'Mongoloid') and sends her off to be raised by her own mother since she refuses to help raise the child herself. Mary is also a classic manipulator--when a social worker comes by to check on the family, she has her own mother bring over the mentally challenged child and pretend that she's been caring for the child all along (thus allowing herself to continue to receive public assistance benefits). During the film's climax, she begs Precious' social worker (well-played by a low-key Mariah Carey) to have Precious and her new child come back to her. Her pleas fall on deaf ears after she continues to blame Precious for the problems in the family (in Mary's warped mind, she's the victim since Precious 'stole' her boyfriend away from her after she did nothing to stop him from raping her).The joys of developing a well-thought out and clever villain, are usually tempered by a contrasting stock and predictable victim. There isn't much new under the sun when it comes to Precious, the overweight black girl who suffers from extreme low self-esteem. Once authorities at her regular school discover that Precious is once again pregnant, she's sent to an 'alternative school' for girls with behavior problems. There it's discovered that she's reading on the second grade level and gradually through the intervention of a tough but caring teacher, she eventually overcomes her illiteracy and is reading at the 7th and 8th grade levels by the end of the film. While the contrasting scenes with her mother are always fraught with dramatic tension, the energy is not as intense in all the 'classroom scenes' which feature characters which we've seen in many other countless movies before, about acting out adolescent girls.In addition to all the abuse she suffers at home as well as the taunting by other children and teenagers in the neighborhood, Precious must overcome one last overwhelming obstacle--the fact that she's been diagnosed as being HIV Positive. But even that won't stop the film's scenarist and producers from having Precious fade into the sunset with her head held high. Remember, this is a melodrama, and in melodrama you never tarnish your protagonist (the victim!). Sure, there are a few hints that Precious has her faults (she doesn't like the idea of working for her public assistance benefits for example) but it might have been a much more interesting film had the screenwriters grafted a few more ugly traits from the mother onto Precious' personality. Instead, despite all the low self-esteem, the deck is stacked so that Precious comes off almost like a saint. Precious is by no means a boring film. It moves along and has a series of neat, 'fantasy' sequences, highlighting Precious's rich fantasy life. As stated above, Precious is successful when it focuses on the very strong character of the villainous mother. Otherwise, the story of the heroine, who must rise from extreme adversity, is a story that we've seen many, many times before. For those who like their stories simple where the moral conflict is clear cut, Precious is for you. For those who want something a little more complex, Precious might just not be satisfying enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago, I read a review of Lee Daniels's "Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire". The review made it sound overdone. Well, now that I've seen the movie, I can say without a doubt that this is one of the best movies of the year.Gabourey Sidibe plays the title character, an illiterate, overweight teenage black girl in 1987 Harlem. She lives with her abusive mother (Mo'Nique) and already has one child and another on the way, both of which came from getting raped by her father. Their world is one of the grittiest ever brought to screen: aside from the scuzzy surroundings, everything's always about to explode in their apartment.When the bullied Precious gets expelled from her school, she gets reassigned to an alternative school. So begins a new adventure in her life. But not without some tough spots along the way.Some of the scenes here are really set up to shock you, and they do a great job with it. This is not a movie for the fainthearted at all. The fine performances carry every scene. I certainly hope that the Oscars at least pay some attention to this.In supporting roles are Lenny Kravitz as a health-minded male nurse and Mariah Carey as a social worker. Also starring are Paula Patton, Sherri Shepherd, Nealla Gordon, Stephanie Andujar, Chyna Layne, Amina Robinson, Xosha Roquemore, Angelic Zambrana, Grace Hightower, Kimberly Russell, Bill Sage and Sapphire (the author of the novel).Really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While the film may not be the best of the year, the performances are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a heavy teenager from the projects who is pregnant with her second child, abused by her mother and clever enough that her teacher gets her into a alternative school. It is a darkly hopeful tale of a young girl looking to turn turn her life around.I went into the film not sure what to expect. Many reviews were calling the film the front runner in this years Oscar race. It got good word in Sundance and at this years New York Film Festival. Everyone was talking the film up (helped no doubt by presenters Tyler Perry and Oprah). Granted there were a few nay sayers, but mostly the word on this was sterling.My reaction to the film is mixed. I do think the film is very good (even if it doesn't speak to me on the visceral level its speaks to many). I don't think it's one of the year's great films (though I do think its "Oscar Bait" as far as Best Picture). I do think that the film has some of the finest acting of the year. Ultimately though I don't know what I really feel about it.I'm sure that when I see this film down the road I'll have a different take. But right now the talk I've read about how great and wonderful the film is has made me think less of it. The problem for me is that as real as the film feels at times (the scenes between Precious and her mom, the social worker scenes, the girls just cutting loose) the film feels staged. If we do these things we will get this reaction. Watch how the color of the lighting changes depending upon where scenes are. Is it oppressive? Give it a certain color.Do we need to get the idea of learning across, use a well worn montage. Do we need to feel? Kick in the music? Its not bad but a film that is otherwise powerful doesn't need to fall back on tricks, or rather shouldn't make it clear that its falling back on tricks. I don't see this as a best film.The performances on the other hand are all Oscar caliber. They are so good that I fear that multiple nominations in the Best Supporting Actress Category will split the voting. The highly touted Mo'Nique is certain to get a nomination if not the award for playing Precious' unholy mother. She is not so much a force of evil, but as her final scenes show she is a broken and battered woman who is incredibly self centered and human. She is as good as they say. She's so good in fact that it maybe hard for her ever to get out of the shadow. Equally great is Mariah Carey as a social worker. I know people like this and she is dead on perfect so good in fact I suspect she too may get an Oscar nominations.Another wonderfully surprising turn is Lenny Kravitz as a nurse who befriends Precious when she is is the hospital. I couldn't believe it was him when I saw his name in the end credits.Yes its a good but dark film . yes you should see it. No I don't think its one of the best of the year , though the performances make it hard to see anyone or anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My female roommates picked this movie for our movie night. I didn't know about it and didn't care for it when they told me about it. I was not even aware that it was based on a true story but decided to watch it anyway.The acting was superb! I don't think there was a single moment of bad acting. Even Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz did a good job with their roles, which isn't exactly a compliment being that their roles were minor and required little to no emotion.The atmosphere was also well set. You do feel like you're in a crummy part of the world. The music, for the most part, fit the scenes nicely. The camera-work was good with some decent cut-scenes that enhanced the viewers psyche; eg, as Precious got raped, they cut to a scene of her dancing. This allowed the viewer to know what she thought about during that horrific event. They use this technique a few times in the movie and I feel it worked quite well.I felt a little angry at points but quite honestly, I didn't get too excited or anything during this movie. I was not moved. This is not to say that it's a bad movie. Perhaps I've watched too much news and read too many newspapers. I'm just numb to the brutality that we do to each other and this movie is just another example.I do recommend this movie to everybody that feels like they're in a crappy place in life. It might inspire you or at least make you feel better about your situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood-esquire and sad (in a bad way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No tears. Nothing in my hands at the start of the credits running at the end but the feeling that I'd been duped. Was this really the film that I'd heard so much good about? Clearly not. Oprah Winfrey is the executive producer of this mess, which says more than should be allowed, on the base of the synopsis: poor, abused, obese girl from the ghetto growing up in the mid-80s tries to live some sort of life with some kind of dignity amidst horrors and a family life in complete chaos. Voilá. The hype around this film enthralled me and I was genuinely looking forward to something interesting. To me, this film makes the English 1960s kitchen sink "genre" look even more grim than it otherwise does. While Precious is pinballed through society, hounded at home, her ways apathetic (possibly to abate/stand living) by all means, she finds school to be her oxygen. I found this very Oprah/Hollywood by all means, mainly because it's so dense; there is simply no air in the script, and little explanation. One is simply left to accept her fate and courses of action; the film doesn't question the viewer at all, doesn't even question Precious' actions, but serves a simple tale that makes many an epic tale seem fresh. In short, I found little more here than good cinematography ? loads of contrasts, which I liked ? and Mo'Nique's acting, which was great during the last scene. Otherwise there is very little to cling to.</fullReview>

I had to shut it off as the continual screaming &amp; yelling by Monique &amp; her constant use of the MF expression &amp; other filthy words was upsetting me.I fully realize modern day movies does use explicit language, BUT I do feel there is a limit. To watch a film where a major character is pure revulsion &amp; sickening,In fact, I am feeling nauseous typing this.Monique should stick to her cable TV talk show. I feel she did not deserve the Oscar mainly cause of foul mouth &amp; words utteredAnother new face plays Precious, the very overweight daughter,who is s viciously abused by this hateful mother. Gabourney Sibide does have talent, I hope any future roles are of a nicer nature.Since I saw only 20 or so minutes I cannot comment further, except to say I just do not know how so many liked this filth,Ratings: * (out of 4) 21 out of 100, IMDb 1 (out of 10)</fullReview>

I am so tired of movies getting critical acclaim and awards that the average person doesn't even like! This is the last time I listen to the critics and go see a movie they like. These people must only be nominated because they didn't wear makeup in the movie. The acting in the movie was done well but the movie itself isn't good at all, if I hadn't been in the theater with someone else I would have left and got my money back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious is Dear to Us ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabourey Sidibe in her acting debut received a well-deserved Oscar nomination as the tormented girl sexually abused by her father and mother, Mo'Nique, winner of the best supporting actress Oscar, for her acting as the unbearable mother in the film. Mo'Nique makes Mommie Dearest look like nursery school in comparison.With Harlem as the background, we see a life of utter despair by the Precious character, abused both sexually and verbally, extremely heavy, illiterate, and caught up in a troubled New York City school. (What's new regarding that?)She finds a new beginning when pregnant for the second time. She is sent to an alternative school with quite an assortment of girls for her classmates. There she meets Ms. Rain, an understanding teacher who tries to guide her through.Talking about a protagonist with girls of such little education seemed to be preposterous, but the film is an excellent one depicting deprivation, abuse, despair and willingness to hope for a better life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this film from all the hype made by Jonathan Ross and other such media coverage, so I was really looking forward to seeing this adaptation of the novel "Push" by Sapphire. Basically it is 1987, in the ghetto of Harlem, and there lives morbidly obese and illiterate seventeen year old Clarieece 'Precious' Jones (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Gabourey Sidibe) with her unemployed and abusive mother Mary Lee Johnston (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Mo'Nique). Precious has given birth to a little girl suffering Down's Syndrome after being impregnated by her father Carl, even though little 'Mongo' is looked after by Precious's grandmother Rhonda Patrice Johnston (Chyna Layne), Mary makes it out that she's living with them to get benefits. Precious is currently pregnant again after Carl raped her again, and she is expelled from school on this discovery and sent to an alternative school, where she can not only learn life skills but get away from thinking about her home life. She also gets away from her horrible life with her imagination of being a famous star of stage or screen, and she is inspired more by her new teacher Ms. Blu Rain (Paula Patton) who helps her to read and write. She also has a few meetings with social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey) who learns about her abusive life and the incest in the household, and not long later Precious gives birth to a little boy she names Abdul. After meeting kind male Nurse John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz) and leaving hospital, Mary purposely drops baby Abdul and strikes Precious who gains the courage to hit back and leave home for good. Precious gets help from the school with a baby living in a halfway house, but Mary comes back into her life after father Carl has died from AIDS, and worse she is HIV positive but baby Abdul isn't. In the end, Precious and Mary are brought together in front of Mrs. Weiss, and Mary confesses to why she started being abusive to her own daughter from age three, but Precious is brave enough to leave her mother and never go back. Also starring Sherri Shepherd as Cornrows, Stephanie Andujar as Rita, Amina Robinson as Jermaine Hicks and Xosha Roquemore as Joann. Mo'Nique thoroughly deserved the Academy Award for playing one of the most nasty and violent home-based characters I have ever seen, up there with Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, and Sidibe is also fantastic as the suffering daughter. Produced by Oprah Winfrey, it is a film with a heartfelt story, moments of humour in the daydream sequences, but ultimately it is quite difficult to watch sometimes being realistic and made brilliant by the two female leads, a great drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Director for Lee Daniels, Best Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!</fullReview>

I couldn't really relate to much in the movie, but maybe because I am of the wrong target audience.Nevertheless, the movie did provide good entertainment and the acting of most parts was good. The movie depicts some harsh situations and tough sides of life.I had heard that this movie was supposed to be a groundshaker of an emotional magnitude, but it wasn't for me. There were two major moments in the movie for my sake, when Precious told the teacher about her sickness and when she confronted her mom in the social worker's office.First time to see Mariah Carey in a movie actually. What is it with singers wanting to go into the movie business?Now I am sure this movie is appealing to a lot of people, it just failed to strike true to my heart or my situation. I am not saying the movie is bad, because it is not. I just think this particular kind of movie is not meant for all to appreciate. The good part, for me, was the take on real life events (although I could not relate to them), but they were very nicely portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PRECIOUS film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious is a powerful, audacious film. Although it has an affecting script and appears to have only one perspective, it is deep and insightful.It is the story about a girl who is black,fat,lived an unhappy childhood and doesn't possess what we call self esteem. It might seem stimulated in the beginning but the entire crew cohesively pull off a good, if not great, movie in arguably the most overtly obvious premise.Director Lee Daniels' style of direction might have been rather conventional, but what is really commendable is that he manages to hypnotize his cast thereby making them deliver outstanding performances. First timer Gabourey Sidibe might not have had to do much, taking into account her appearance which so perfectly suits her role, but she doesn't slack. A truly remarkable breakthrough performance is what she does give and will no doubt be recognized by The Academy. Comedian Mo'Nique as Precious' monstrous mother is terrifying and gives a solid performance which is far from subtle(or funny) as it should be. Yes,it will be nominated and is the front-runner in her category. Paula Patton on the other hand gives a warm ethereal performance as Precious' English teacher. In my opinion, this is the best and most difficult role of the three convincing performances which will bring about internal competition in the supporting actress category come awards season. The third one is from the pop star Mariah Carey who digs deep into her character as a social worker desperately trying to help Precious. Lee Daniels cast relatively unknown actors and has not only launched their acting careers, but with extravagance.Rating 8/10</fullReview>

I do suggest this movie if you have nothing else to do with your money and have seen the other films that are out. I suggest you rent this and watch it in your own home. There is no reason to share this sad ride with a room full of people. Its just not the place for it. I do see why it has received so much attention. Im sure there are or have been people out there like this, for they would have not made a film about it im sure. It shines a light on a dark part of life that nobody should have to experience.

		<fullReview>OK, Precious is well made movie, and actors are also brilliant. The plot brings nothing new though. Even if the story is fiction, it is - shockingly enough - everyday life. Have to say this is a realistic filmography. I don't like the issues movie is dealing with, or memories and stuff how it influences on broken hearted viewers with similar experiences with Precious. With those described people, movie is nothing but expressing bad and sad memories of ours.The movie does not contain enough hope, and the ending is just not happy enough. I sound like such a wussy, but this is the truth. Good acting and cinematography can't save this movie.Precious is a very very predictable movie, at least for us people who have been there. If you have your s*it together and life has always been smiling to you, I guess this is pretty good shock value drama movie for you. But for the rest of us its an insult and opening old wounds. If you think "thank god this is only a movie", think again, because as I said, things like this happen every day - just not for you.When it comes to own experiences, you already know the movie, so basically its just boring stuff and predictable humble-mumble, and only ONE of those lives destroyed, of those bad things and people that are in this world already too much.

		<shortDescription>Precious Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that this movie was hugely over-hyped about how good it was. But it really could have been a massively great movie it really could have been. What made this not be as great as it could have been was the editing. The editing should have been done better. They cut powerful scenes and inserted a scene where she was either famous or modeling. That broke the power of the scene. It ruin everything. They where almost no full scenes. But do not get me wrong the movie was good. No one i mean no one should ever have to endure what she had to endure. I wish that there would have been less voice overs and more of her. One thing they are right about is that the movie will make you cry but you don't cry because of the movie you cry because when you look at this as something that actually happens everyday you me and everyone who has never been hit should be very grateful for what we have. So when you think of that you do cry because we are the fortunate ones. There are only 2 powerful scenes in this movie. 1) is when Precious comes home with her baby Addul or whatever his name is. Precious and her mom get into a fight slamming each other against the wall throwing televisions and all that. No one should ever do that with their mom or anyone else for that matter. 2) is when she breaks down in class when Ms. Rain ask her to write. Precious breaks down and start yelling out how no one loves her and how she was raped and beaten by love. There could have been 2 more very powerful scenes but again the editing just didn't work. When her mother ask Precious to come take care of her in a sexual way and the last scene when Monique cries and tells how she wanted so much to be loved by her man that she let him abusive her child. So overall it is a good movie but could have been a great movie. Maria Carey is okay in this role nothing outstanding. Monique is good as well and so is the girl who's name i don't know and people will forget in a couple of months. It is sad that i had to say that but this is Hollywood and she because of her size would never be someone with a huge acting career unless she does what all other has been actors do really independent movies. Anyway this is by no means a must buy nor must rent.</fullReview>

It is very sad that this movie could actually be a true story, however, the incredible amount of bad luck the lead character endures is almost unbelievable. I didn't rate this movie based on my compassion, but rather the quality of the movie. I don't think this title deserves more than 5 stars. That doesn't mean I don't feel sorry for people who have to go through this sort of stuff. I just can't relate on so many levels and I doubt many people can. I can understand if people disagree with me. I just feel like I watched this movie and left depressed rather than inspired. I suggest you watch and form your own opinion. Great acting for the most part just too many hardships for one mind to cope with in a movie, and the ending leaves you with questions that should be answered. I hope anyone who has to go through a life like this wins the lottery or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oprah produced "Precious" (Based on as novel by Sapphire ), which isn't surprising at all because Lee Daniel's movie is just as good at exploiting other people's pain as the queen herself. This is a movie that finds every way imaginable to create an abyss of muck around the main character and at the end of the day, it's only point is that she's strong enough to survive it. She is Precious Jones (Gabby Sidibe), an illiterate, impoverished and obese 16-year-old who has been repeatedly raped and impregnated by her step-father (who seems to only come around for this very reason), and abused in every which way by her horrible welfare-collecting mother (Monique). The only way for her to escape all of these problems is through fantasy, where she imagines herself as a famous person with a hunky light-skinned boyfriend. Her most recent pregnancy gets her sent to an alternative school, where teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) becomes the only one to give her any real support and her classmates become her comic-relief best friends. More obstacles ensue for Precious and Daniels, Oprah, and co-producer Tyler Perry play it like an after-school special meant to inspire, but we soon realize this movie has nothing much to offer rather than these mounting "car-accidents." Daniel's criticizes and makes monsters out of easy targets while rooting for Precious to the point of making her some kind of heroic, saintly figure. There is no social criticism directed at her or a poor educational and political system that allows things like this to go on. Two very fine performances save it. Sidibe makes for a battered, wounded young woman with a strong will to survive, her weight an added obstacle. And Monique is lazy, vile, and in the last scene, heartbreakingly human. Mariah Carey also shows up as a social worker with a mustache, sans make-up. "Precious" might inspire many, but what it tries to inspire sure as hell isn't much thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS. Who hasn't heard about this movie; and don't forget it is based on the Novel PUSH by Sapphire. Now that the best-selling novel is on the big screen, will it equal or even meet the written notoriety. Those who don't know, Clareece "Precious" Jones(Gabourey Sidibe)is an obese, illiterate African-American teen from Harlem expecting her second child fathered by her mother's longstanding boyfriend. Precious' mother Mary(Mo'Nique)is self-centered and has no problem with physically and verbally abusing her daughter and blaming her for her misfortunes. Being unable to read or write, the young girl discovers there may be some hope for her as she is placed in an alternative school where she gets some sympathy and consideration from her teacher Blue Rain(Paula Patton)and a male nurse John(Lenny Kravitz). She begins to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel...there may actually be a chance for her after all. Harsh, brutal and depressing as it is inspirational.Sidibe and Mo'Nique seem engrossed with their roles and are outstanding. Also as impressive is the unadorned Mariah Cary who plays a social worker. Also in the cast: Stephanie Andujar, Chyna Lane, Xosha Roquemore and Sherri Shepherd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY! A Powerful and Emotinoal film for 2009....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I was browsing through everyone's comments and I see some people felt that this was a stereotype/racist film. The whole time I was watching this film I did not once think this was a stereotype or racist. If this was showing a white family or Asian family or Spanish family etc... I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't see this film as racist.This film to me was extremely powerful, and a wonderful emotional ride. The execution was outstanding, the acting was incredible, the story was fantastic. I truly hope that this film gets nominated for perhaps a best picture and acting award.I loved looking at Precious' fantasies in order to escape her real life hell. This film is a great example showing that no matter how hard you fall, it's always up to you to pick up the pieces and to find a way to survive and move on.All in all I say Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bittersweet character study with strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. This is a mouthful of a title, and it wasn't supposed to be it (originally just Push: Based on the novel by Sapphire), but having it that is just fine. There's something about it that actually reminds me of the title character, Clareece "Precious" Jones - it's awkward and probably a little too big to fit in anywhere, but we have to take it as it is. Precious is a teen who has had, up until the point of her life when she's 16, a doomed existence. She's obese, pregnant again from her father (first child with down syndrome that she never sees), an abusive mother- physically and sexually- and she's just been kicked out of junior High School where she's been repeating the same grades for years without any literacy (she can just barely write her name). That she also has AIDS from her father's raping is found out later, which is kind of like a s***-icing on the cake.So, going in and knowing this about the character in the film, one knows that the story by default will end, at best, bittersweetly. But it's the dramatic strength of Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire to get us there without too much of the conventions that Hollywood might try to put on us. It's 'indie' in a good, if not great, sense of the word. The director Lee Daniels wants us to feel something of what it's like to be in her shoes, which is something special: we hear her narration, withdrawn and sullen and knowing at least what it's like to be in the Ghetto of Harlem in 1987, and we see some of her fantasies of making it big, in a video on BET or walking a red carpet (these scenes, for me, aren't quite as effective as they should be, even as they're the plastic dreams of a girl with a limited worldview, but they're not bad either).And, as well, we see what it's like for her to then be put into an 'alternative' school where she can possibly get her GED. It becomes one of the major dramatic angles if she will learn how to read. It's that simple, and it makes for a wise one to go in on: by the end of the story she can meet this goal, and at least have achieved something in all of her past abuse and future problems. But what makes it interesting- if a little 'black-and-white' as far as characters go- is the dynamic between the mother figures. There's Precious' own mother Mary, played by Mo'Nique as an evil whale of a woman, a barking wretch who occasionally reels in Precious by sounding soft, then goes in for the verbal and physical abuse. Yet there's also the surrogate mother in Precious' teacher, Blue Rain, a woman who knows the cruelty of the world but always goes for the positive, and it's this that Precious can hold on to when times get very tough late in the film.I may have not been totally won over by Daniels' direction choices all of the time (sometimes he just stays very close and solid in dramatic scenes, and other times, like the fantasy numbers or other moments of high-flying cinematic fancy, i.e. Two Women, it falls flat or is too much), but what he is strong as it getting fiery and honest performances out of his actors. Sidbe, playing Precious, is extraordinary in how she makes Precious a damaged but good person, someone who loves McDonalds and TV, and it shows restraint and power. Mo'Nique, on the other hand, is giving us Oscar bait. More power to her; it's an awesome villain she portrays, who is conniving and puts on a face for outsiders like the social worker and welfare woman (Mariah Carey, also very good), but one can just see the desperation. There's a lot of depth there, and it's just wonderful work from her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not good or bad: it's uninteresting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's a sad world out there and there are some pretty messed people having children. Nothing new there, nothing useful to learn, nothing surprising. The context is black people but you can copy/paste this to any other society. This could have been in a white "trailer-trash" park or in a third world slum or event in a bourgeois Washington neighborhood. Change the decor and voil?.Ever heard of Charles Dickens? Surprise! Charles Dickens wrote those sad child abuse stories 170 years ago. Go read Oliver Twist or Great Expectations. The main difference is that the Dickens characters overcome their trauma and raises to greatness. They are masterpieces while this film "might help to pass time". The girl in "Precious" greatest achievement: she learns to read at 16... Ah! What an accomplishment... This was worth telling...This film is for the Hallmark channel and the people who watches it. Thumbs up for the actors who did a fantastic job but please don't let the script writer and the producer ever make a film again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of poor performances and bad writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very dreary movie about an overweight, abused, pregnant teenager's life in Harlem. The acting is absolutely uneven from everyone except Gabourey Sidibe. She's fine in this role but the script really limited where she could go with this role.The main problem with the movie is the script. It doesn't flow very well after the first act. Precious' fellow students in the alternative school were cut-out characters from every movie ever made about inner-city black schools.The mother (played by Mo'Nique) is a welfare case who mopes around in her kitchen, eats and watches TV. It's hard to feel sympathetic to Precious when her mother is an After School Special version of parental abuse.The writing was simply puzzling in places. Okay, she has to overcome adversity, but the script just kept throwing more and more at Precious until I was convinced that the writers were really laying very thick and playing to the audiences' sympathies. How many adversities does Precious really have to face in order for the audience to feel sorry for her? One or two would be sufficient but they keep coming. The ultimate result is one very dreary movie.This movie will ultimately be compared to last year's "Slumdog Millionaire" which was also about someone overcoming their poverty as well as many other obstacles. The good thing about that movie was that although the first chunk of the movie was very dark, the movie lightened up in the second half. I think we need to see both sides of this world and showing only the darkest part of this character's life was emotionally cloying.I'd slightly recommend the movie because at times it is unique and there is a slight spark of life. The problem is that the spark is never really around long enough for this movie to be very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Reinforcement of Black Stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precious finally made her way to the Vancouver International Film Festival last night as did one Mr. Lee Daniels.Overall I am left with a feeling of a movie that at it's heart is simply pandering to give a typical film festival audience what the script writer / director thinks it wants. After last night's presentation a standing ovation followed and the director applied his impressive charm on the audience to gain, what I am certain will be, another award for the trophy case.It was observed that the usual Exit signs to the theatre to street were turned OFF (though they are left ON for other showings at the film festival) as the sold-out theatre was encouraged to pass by voting boxes.This movie adaptation touches on various dark elements but rather than exploring them takes the mass-appeal route and simply dances around them with fantastical scenes in the manner of an African-American version of Pan's Labyrinth with a side of rape and AIDS. Personally I find the stereotypes reinforced within this movie somewhat insulting rather than endearing and found the majority of characters were presented as quite shallow and lacking any true depth.Though a good movie this should never be mistaken for a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monique Has Proved That She Can Really Act In This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a new actress to play the role as the overweight dark skinned girl who is a 16 year old mother of two. This was the first time I have seen Monique serious throughout an entire movie! She was the abusive mother of Precious. Mariah Carey acted much better than she did in Glitter, but she was still one dimensional and monotone as the case manager in this movie. Lenny Kravitz's role was mediocre at best. Paula Patton stole the show as the caring teacher. This movie ended in a cliffhanger. It took place in 1987. It would be amazing if we fast forward 20 years and find out that Precious was misdiagnosed as being HIV positive and raising two successful young adults, while having a master's degree and a great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could set up a picket line for this movie. You should have left it in the book. For the first time in USA history we have a black woman in the white house that's not mopping the floor, cooking the food, washing the linens, kissing the white man's butt and this is how you celebrate it? How could you? You put out a movie with a four hundred pound girl with a Crackhead, alcoholic mother, a incest ridden daddy, two incest ridden children, which one is spastic while the girl wants to be white. In what way is this inspirational to any young black girl? Why not use the black women who didn't come up like this. Why not make a movie about the black female astronauts, the head of companies, teachers who care. How could you make this movie, there is nothing precious about it. How dare you. If this train wreck goes world wide they will think every black family is like this, that every black woman is like this, that every black child is like this, how could you. SHAME ON YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold and Distant Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks great. It sounds great. The performances are great. And yet I left the theater feeling cold and empty. For some reason, this movie is not connected at all with it's heart. Which is ironic, because it wants you to think that it is a movie all about heart. But really I think it's a cold film. Lee Daniels has talent, but he lacks compassion. I didn't really feel like he cared about the girl in the movie. He cared more about showing off as a director. The movie puts gloss all over the grit. You don't really feel like you're in poverty, because Daniels puts gloss all over it. And while the performances are all great, they too lack something. It's as if every note was hit perfectly, but a true emotion is never really there. People cry, but it's not moving. People get angry, but it's not scary. It's just empty, good film-making. Which is to say, not very good film-making at all.Cassavetes used to say that all he cared about was feeling, not craft. Lee Daniels needs to watch some Cassavetes.Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry must have been drawn to this so much because bad vibes magnetize other bad vibes. Lee Daniels+ Tyler Perry + Oprah= Scary bad vibes. Don't believe the hype. None of them are gurus, geniuses, or great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Push is Sundance at it's worst. It's all glitzy fake heart, with no subtlety or clarity. It's pure adrenaline, the movie equivalent of Red Bull, but if you look closely-- it's just another re-done Rocky, except poorly. Lee Daniels is talented, but he also has no idea what he's talking about and is sugary and sentimental. It's a movie that people like to give awards to, because of the subject matter. But it's everything that's wrong with independent films. It's politically correct, flashy, heart-tugging, sappy film-making.It's also one note. So one note that I found it nearly impossible to watch. Someone else might say relentless in a good way, but the film is relentless in an ovebearing, one dimensional way.</fullReview>
