		<shortDescription>A pleasure to see again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film when I saw it in 1985. To see it again after seeing film and series like the Godfather, The Soprans etc is a treat. It is a lovely film, elegant,well-played with a with lots of humor. Jack Nicholson pays the not very intelligent Charley Partanna with flair and a lot of humour. Kathleen Turner is beautiful as ever. The rest of cast is also very good. John Rudolph playing his charing but very dangerous father, Angelica Huston is magnificent as the deserted MaeRose who wants to revenge Cahrly but still loves him. The music is very much a part of this intelligent film. It is a joy to listen to how it comments or highlights what happens in the film.It is a loving parody of the mafia genre. A must-see for any one who likes this genre and for film lovers everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Fine Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is often good and funny, but sometimes 's not focused enough. The story tries to cover a lot of themes, genres, and plot implications which doesn't always work. The best parts are the ones which deal with Charlie/Irene complicated relationship, in which you never know for sure if she's manipulating him from the beginning or not. One funny thing was the homage to Mafia movies, such as The Godfather. Some lines really hit their targets, too (Well, it's not many if you consider the size of the population, comes to mind).The acting is very good, and the best thing of the movie. Jack Nicholson plays an incredibly dumb character, that gets wonderfully developed by the end. He has a great comic timing. Kathleen Turner is very good, she has a great chemistry with Jack, and can look innocent and the moment after a total bitch. Besides, she ha a great, calm, sure delivery. Anjelica Huston is very funny playing mean / jealous / spoiled / manipulative/sweet, though lack of screen time hurts. The supporting are all great, and the one who plays the Don is hilarious, with his sadistic way of saying his lines.The direction is simple, but has some original shots, it works with this material. It's mostly steady camera. The music creates a contrast; it's quite cheery and happy, and that makes the movie funnier. It's a very dark comedy in my opinion, and sometimes a romance drama. It's worth watching, and original, but not a masterpiece. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't be just an "honorable" mention in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mafia-comedy hardly seems like a new idea in 2009, we've seen it done well ("The Sopranos"), done alright ("Married to the Mob" or "Analyze This") and done badly (any number of films, "The Godson" for example) and it practically seems quite an established film subject, even a cliché one at this point. However, to fully understand "Prizzi's Honor" if you've seen some of the latter day mafia-comedies that followed it, you have to understand that at one point it was a novel idea to make a movie where mafia dons and hit men were comedic fodder.If you approach "Prizzi's Honor" expecting it to pick up where its successors left off, you're bound to be disappointed and will likely find it slow and its jokes stale. It's important to remember that this was the first major production to take the subject matter of "The Godfather" (high-level mafia families) and satirize it. It therefore must have seemed quite clever and groundbreaking in 1985 to lampoon the bizarre behaviors and concepts of honor that "The Godfather" and all its imitators had presented to us as reality. You really can't hold "Prizzi's Honor" accountable because so many others realized there was a satirical goldmine here and exploited it until the mafia-comedy film was as cliché as the mafia film, so when approaching this movie, I tried to remember nothing like this had really been done before.Prizzi's Honor opens with a wedding scene, which is probably a nod to "The Godfather", but it is a very weak and plodding scene by any definition and especially in comparison to the masterpiece it emulates. From there it's mostly uphill though, as Nicholson's tremendous acting is just enough to suspend disbelief as his character, the son of a high ranking mafioso, has a wacky whirlwind romance with a dashing woman he meets at the wedding, only to discover she is mixed up in scamming his own mafia family and she's actually a hired killer just as he is, but that his love for her is so strong that her background doesn't matter. Dating the enemy becomes more and more of a tightrope walk and increasingly their genuine wedded bliss seems to be interrupted by their real world jobs, which would suggest they should see each other as a threat, and both of them typically deal with threats by homicide, leading to a quite funny problem that recurs throughout the film.The film is very quirky, since it's basically making up a new style of film there's a lot of imagination and the plot itself doesn't fall into any clichés. However, it does exploit a basketful of mafia movie clichés, from the over-the-top Brooklyn drawl that Nicholson somehow pulls off to the corpse-like appearance of the decrepit yet ruthlessly brilliant Don Corrado Prizzi. As most of its successors have just combined mafia clichés with a basic plot, "Prizzi's Honor" seems quite fresh with its complex plot and wonderfully offbeat characters."Prizzi's Honor" seems to have fallen by the cinematic wayside, at least, it's not on too many short lists of great films, and its lackluster IMDb rating (6.8) rates it below or alongside many works it actually paved the way for. To some extent I think it suffers from the notion that very few good "serious" films emerged from America in the 80s aside from the stuff Woody Allen was doing. While to some extent this movie does seem to reflect some of the mid-80s film-making malaise, there is a lot of very clever work being done here, and this really is a movie worth remembering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Family Above Everything, In a Masterpiece of Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the hit-man Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) is like a son for his godfather Don Corrado Prizzi (William Hickey), who is a powerful mobster. In a wedding of a member of their family, Charley meets Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) and he falls in love with her. Irene introduces herself as a tax consultant, but indeed she is a killer hired by the Prizzis for a "contract" in New York. They get married, and later Chaley realizes that she betrayed the Prizzis and had stolen their money in a casino. Charley has to face and decide between his code of honor with the Prizzi's family and his love for Irene. "Prizzi's Honor" is a masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of the 80's. The story is engaging, having a very dark black humor and many plot points. Jack Nicholson, Angelica Huston in a Machiavelian role, Kathleen Turner (gorgeous, sexy and elegant) and William Hickey are amazing. The performance of the magnificent cast and the outstanding direction of John Huston are marvelous. I have seen this movie at least six times, and I do not get tired of watching it. Unfortunately "Prizzi's Honor" has not been released on DVD in Brazil. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "A Honra do Poderoso Prizzi" ("The Honor of the Powerful Prizzi")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Godfather" Gone Stark Raving Mad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prizzi's Honor" is one of those strange charmers that thrives on dark comedy and whacked situations. Mafia hit-man Jack Nicholson (Oscar-nominated) meets the super-erotic Kathleen Turner at a wedding and of course ends up dumping girlfriend Anjelica Huston (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn). The fact that Huston is the daughter of one of Nicholson's associates only makes the plot thicken. What Nicholson does not know is that Turner is really an assassin herself. Will he find out that his lover by night is really a hit-woman by day? And will he learn in time that the two have actually been hired to kill each other? Also along for the ride are scene-stealers Robert Loggia and William Hickey (who received an Oscar nod as the family's don). "Prizzi's Honor" was the final venture for legendary director John Huston (who was near death when he was Oscar-nominated for this). That little tidbit does not change the fact that "Prizzi's Honor" is really a strange experience that does not completely succeed. It is a movie that serves its purpose, but the ending does not justify the means used to get there. The Oscar-nominated screenplay makes itself out to be much more intelligent than it really is and ultimately Nicholson and Turner have to carry the production. Still a good movie, but over-rated and even a bit disappointing when all is said and done. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr.&amp;Mrs. Partanna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a whole lot of his contemporaries were dead or in retirement, John Huston was still making some very good movies and even winning Oscars for family members. Prizzi's Honor was kind of a coda to his career having directing his father Walter for Best Supporting Actor for The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre in 1948, in 1945 daughter Anjelica Huston wins for Best Supporting Actress in Prizzi's Honor. That's a feat that will really be hard for any director to duplicate.The Prizzis are your Eighties version of the Corleones, a Mafia family headquartered in Brooklyn with far reaching interests including Las Vegas like the Corleones. Jack Nicholson is Charlie Partanna, not the most polished knife in the drawer, but one of the sharpest. Mafia families inbreed more than royalty or hillbillies and Charlie's expected to marry Maerose Prizzi who is played by Anjelica Huston, the ultimate Mafia princess. He's practically been raised to be her prince consort.But one look at the beautiful and sophisticated Kathleen Turner and Nicholson's hormones are at light-speed overdrive. But Kathleen's got a secret or two as well. She was in on a scam that took $720.000.00 from the Prizzis in Las Vegas. And in a real bow to women's liberation, something indeed from a tradition bound organization like the Mafia, she's also a hit woman with a contract on Nicholson.Some 20 years before those marrieds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were trying to bed and kill each other simultaneously in Mr.&amp;Mrs. Smith, Nicholson and Turner were going at it, tongue and gun. John Huston after 30 years finally repeated a black comedy, a much better black comedy than Beat The Devil.Besides Anjelica's win, Prizzi's Honor was up for several more Oscars in 1985 including Best Picture, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Supporting Actor for William Hickey, Best Director for John Huston and others. Prizzi's Honor is the kind of film where the jokes sneak up on you, don't expect belly laughs, but minutes after something is said, the line will kick in.And Prizzi's Honor was a great film to have to your credit in the twilight of your career for John Huston.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally love Prizzi's Honor, it is one of my favourites. John Huston does a very good job directing, and while black comedy is not what I call his comfort zone, he does show talent for it. The film looks stylish with the cinematography and scenery great. The script is great fun with some delightful black comedy elements, and while the story has its bizarre moments it is compelling all the same. The film doesn't feel boring or dull either, and I always have fun watching it. The cast are wonderful, Jack Nicholson and Kathaleen Turner are very believable and Robert Loggia is great too but it is Anjelica Huston who steals the movie. Overall, I love Prizzi's Honor. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family, Honor, Pride and Loyality overtake Love, Lust, Passion and Pleasure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt in my opinion one of the best and most underrated films of all time has to be 1985's "Prizzi's Honor". The film to some may seem like a black hearted comedy and somewhat of a "Godfather" ripoff, yet for me I found enough drama, intrigue, and chemistry between the characters to go along with a well written script that made it an instant classic. The performance from Jack Nicholson is great and along with the veteran cast the support is the backbone of the film.Directed by legendary John Huston in one of his last works, "Prizzi's Honor" is a wickedly sly and well crafted mob tale of romance, family conflict and defending pride and honor that comes with family. Set in Brooklyn, New York the Prizzi family the oldest and richest well known crime family starts off with the wedding of head Don Prizzi(William Hickey's) granddaughters wedding. As the relaxing theme and face shots of the characters gets the viewer attached early to the drama from start to finish. Enter Charley Partanna(played to perfection by Jack) the head hit-man of the Prizzi family who's tough and gritty and direct and to the point with a high temper. Yet upon Charley's meeting of an elegant and attractive sexy blond an out of town lady named Irene(Kathleen Turner)and after Charley visits Irene on the west coast at her California home, it doesn't take long before the two develop a hot and steamy passionate romance affair based on sex which both mistake it for blind love.As the film develops the viewer quickly sees that the Irene Walker character has a dark and hidden past with a closet full of secrets, yet Charley soon accepts her hand in marriage once some things are ironed out. Now family conflict and displeasure arrives when the Prizzi's tell about the real identity of Irene and her real job and mission shocks Charley. This also hurts an ex flame of Charley's that being Prizzi granddaughter Maerose(Anjelica Huston)and Anjelica was wickedly fantastic in her performance her character is so intelligently cunning with advice.The drama heightens as with all mob dramas when watching you have to figure out what's next and think about who's gonna double cross who next and the plot has many subplots that you must pay attention to. As one can see that both Irene and the Prizzi's are sly and greedy as they will look out for their own self interest and wealth. The support of the family members of the Prizzi's like Eduardo(Robert Loggia)Angelo Pop Partanna(John Randolph)Dominic(Lee Richardson)and last but not least legendary Don Corrado(William Hickey) finally wear on Charley making him choose between family and love, proving that blood is thicker than water and that honor and being loyal is most important with family.As in the films ending as the viewer can see the final scene between Charley and Irene proves that love hurts and it cuts like a knife! It may be amoral yet some relationships weren't meant to last. Overall "Prizzi's Honor" is a classy film that's one of my best to watch numerous times the performances and story just works so well with the characters chemistry. As the supporting performances from Loggia, Randolph, and Richardson are good backbone, and William Hickey's performance is old and crafty yet beautifully stunning and at ease. As for the females Anjelica was marvelous and sly and cunning, yet you feel sorry for her depressed Maerose character, and Kathleen Turner is fabulously sexy and super erotic as the sneaky and deceptive and stunning Irene Walker. Last but not least the legend and all time greatest actor Jack Nicholson puts the icing on the cake with one of his better and more underrated performances as tough and gritty mob hit-man Charley Partanna who's walk, talk, and dress along with actions made him seem so real and believable. John Huston really had a winner here proving that the most important thing is family honor them and respect them and that's all that matters. Remember family is the most important thing and it should be special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances for a stylistic exit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people refuse to believe that this is a comedy. They are wrong. Just watch Angelica Huston's screamingly funny moment as she brings in her father's dinner. She is walking towards him behind his back... calm, cool, suave - and suddenly transforms herself into the pitiful, broken, submissive daughter that her father is expecting her to be. She has the hunched martyr's pose down pat - and it is brilliantly funny. That said, the problem with Prizzi's Honor - which I enjoyed immensely by the way - is that too many things just don't gel. For one thing, Nicholson kills someone in California, and we discover (at the same time as Nicholson) that his (Nicholson's) major love interest, Kathleen Turner, is in fact married to the man he has just killed. And they continue their lives as if nothing has really happened. They continue their love affair and the body in the garage is completely forgotten. But wouldn't the police or someone have found out that he is dead? Wouldn't the police have wanted to speak to interrogate his wife? None of this happens. .. which, is, of course, nonsense. Many people have complained that they can't believe in the characters - and I agree with them. But I am not complaining - just agreeing with their statement. I don't know if the director, John Huston, was totally up to making this film, as he was deathly sick and probably knew that it would be his last one. But I suspect that Huston decided to make Prizzi's Honor and go out in style - for that is really what this film is about - an exercise in style. Nicholson is the arch stereotype of the dumb hoodlum; Turner is the vamp of all time; the Godfather of the entire Prizzi clan couldn't be more brutal or ghoulish, especially when he is smiling - all done with a certain camp flair. And Huston's daughter Angelica plays the long-suffering "wronged woman" with proud, wicked vengefulness. These are all well-known types, yet here they come across as hysterically exaggerated stylized versions of what we have seen in other movies. Huston is too good a director to have done this by accident. He wanted to go out in style - and with Prizzi's Honor - he did so, most honorably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many films glorify the mafia, even those like 'Goodfellas' which pull no punches still allow a residue of glamour to stick to their portrayal of the wise-guy life. So 'Prizzi's Honor', which ridicules its protagonists and shows them to be anything but wise, is a welcome sort of mafia film. Unfortunately, although it's reasonably entertaining, the film ultimately doesn't wholly succeed in any respect; too daft to work as black comedy, too slow to work as riotous farce, to humorously conceived to work as tragic drama. Jack Nicholson is good as the dumb hit man Charley, but the plot leaves us unsure whether we should laugh at him or cry with him, and in the end I felt inclined to do neither. Personally, I prefer Jim Jarmusch's 'Ghost Dog', another offbeat look at organised crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The humor in Prizzi's Honor comes from the everyday humanity of its characters juxtaposed with the fact that the family business entails killing people, so, like in the funeral business, death is discussed (and dealt out) matter-of-factly. The screenplay sparkles throughout, character- driven and organic despite the many plot twists, with a masterful consistency of style. Its point of view is completely amoral, which maybe makes certain 21st century viewers uncomfortable. Anjelica Huston is a force of nature in the film -- by turns defiant, vulnerable, manipulative, sexual, heartbroken, and innocently delighted. Every moment she's on screen she delivers absolute raw conviction.The film suffers slightly from the need to condense a novel's worth of material into 2 hours, and maybe certain plot points and motivations could have been a little more developed. For example, Kathleen Turner is strong and believable, but it would have been great to see a little deeper into the darkness and contradictions of her character. The cast of supporting characters seems to embody facets of John Huston's persona and his dry, macabre sense of humor. William Hickey's performance as the Don is a spectacle unto itself. "Have another cooooookie" LOL. John Randolph (the Jeffrey Tambor of the '80s), Lee Richardson, and Robert Loggia are all flawless.Fascinating to see Jack Nicholson play completely against type, as a simple-minded and earnest character. He pulls it off brilliantly, although it's a bit puzzling that the Don would entrust him with running the business -- again, probably something that fell through the cracks when adapting the novel.How weird that none of the online reviews or comments mention the time period. They obviously had a lot of fun with it -- at first it seems to be the 1920s, as Anjelica Huston mentions that as a decorator she does "Art Deco" (a term that I believe was coined well after the actual period in which it was in vogue); then Kathleen Turner tells Jack Nicholson her car is an Excalibur, which is an '80's car made to look like something from the olden days. Later they're driving a Ford van from the '60s. Anjelica at one point goes to meet an informant in full-on Alexis Carrington drag, but most of the sets and costumes are '40s film noir inspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure Richard Condon has ever written a serious word in his life. "The Manchurian Candidate" had its pathos but it was largely masked by Condon's prose style -- detached, ironic, and humorous. In another novel he describes a typical meal for his Alfred Hitchcok character and it takes up half of a full page. (So many "rashers of bacon," a joint of mutton, three apple pies, and so on.) John Huston has got the style pretty much down pat in this film, although if you're not prepared for it, the intentionality might slip by you and you wind up with a pale drama.I guess by 1985, the year this film was released, the mob movie was ripe for a parody. Some seventeen years elapsed between "Frankenstein" and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein," and about thirteen years between "The Godfather" and "Prizzi's Honor." When a genre is so near exhaustion it doesn't have many places left to go.No one in this movie seems authentically "Italian", as we've learned that authenticity from the mob movies, not even Robert Loggia. The most hilarious impersonation is given by William Hickey. He's a wizened, gaunt Don Corrado, a tiny frame, his voice a hoarse, goaty whine with more ups and unanticipated dips than a roller coaster ride. The other performances are good too. The dialog is out of a comic book. People "clip" one another or they "zotz" each other. Nine hundred thousand dollars is "nine hundred dollars." Everyone is evil but some are more evil than others, just as in "The Godfather." There is a happy ending for Jack Nicholson as Charlie Partanna, a hit man who winds up murdering his own wife. (Man, what happened to the code?) You probably won't respond to this very warmly if you are looking for another movie about the Mafia with lots of tragedy and gore. But if you're able to accept this as an adumbration of movies like "Analyze This" (a much more obvious and funnier movie) you'll get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prizzi's Honor enthralled me with masterful performances by Jack Nicholson as the enforcer for the Prizzi mob family; Kathleen Turner as the mysterious blonde he falls for and who turns out to be a professonal assassin; and Angelica Huston, as the daughter who struggles to regain the honor of a Prizzi and the love of her life. The paradoxical outcome of the Mafia's ethic of loyalty which leads to the killing of those we love, raised to the level of tragedy in The Godfather, here unfolds in a black tale of macabre humor, rendered with flawless timing of its unfolding twists and turns. The humor does not demean the genre of Mafia gangster films, but rather pays tribute to the legacy, replacing tragic irony with dark humor.

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It has substance, it has style, it has humor, and it has some excellent acting. Nicholson is wonderful as Charley Partana, William Hickey is both funny and frightening as Don Corrado Prizzi, and Anjelica Huston does a great job as Maerose. The plot is full of depth and intrigue as Partana falls in love with Turner's character only to find out she's a hit-man like him. So, in Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson and John Huston are working together again, but this time Huston is the director, and Anjelica Huston is on screen this time, as the daughter of a powerful mob family. Anjelica really steals the whole film, and wins an Oscar for her performance. It helps, I guess, if your father is the director, if you are going to steal a film from the ostensible leads, but though John Huston may have been an accessory to the crime, it was really Anjelica's performance that got her that Oscar.The performances are great all around. The old don (William Hickey) in this movie is incredible - creepy and decrepitly sinister, a very unique 'don' character in the catalogue of mafia movies. Charlie's father was great, and of course, Nicholson does a great job as Italian gangster Charley Pattana - his acting is distinct and fitting (i.e. he goes beyond himself as himself). Kathleen Turner as his love interest then wife, Irene, was likable as well. I wasn't always sure I bought the chemistry 100%, but the movie is bigger than just their relationship - which certainly wasn't bad by any accounts - just not 'sizzling', for all the love that was professed. Then again this is love between a hit-woman and a gangster, so I don't know what exactly one could hope for. There was a certain touchiness in the trust that develops between them, and of course there's a comic tone that lightens the whole thing in the first place - but never to the detriment of the story.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

I didn't expect for both characters to be on top of each other already, especially they only just met a few times after a wedding that they both attended to.The storyline was alright but a bit grotty for my taste. I would've loved more action and give you a feel on what happens next. Just because you have big stars like Anjelica Huston, Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson, it doesn't mean they would be involved in great movies! That's unfortunately the case with some stars, they are talent but they needed more in my taste. It really is disappointing but sure what can you do?

Much more nuanced, complex and brilliantly acted by Jack Nicholson, Kathleen turner and Angelica Huston. It is a bit of a spoof on the godfather and so has lots of allusions and in jokes. Fun, not high art but still way better than the remake. The ending is adroit and exciting if somewhat predictable and the twists and turns of the plot are dizzying but plausible and internally consistent. Jack Nicholson's mouth filler is a mistake but Kathleen turner looks spectacular and angelica Huston does a good turn as a spurned woman with charisma and panache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit mixed but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston, as he reached the end of his life, was clearly searching for new ground to cover as a director. In this film he may have put a foot wrong, but that's not to say this isn't a very, very enjoyable film. You can sense from the quality of the performances the willingness of the actors to do anything for the chance to work with the legendary actors. There is a virtual clinic put on by all the key performers in this movie, from Jack Nicholson putting on a very convincing Brooklyn accent to depict a hard-nosed, not-too-bright tough guy to Kathleen Turner as his romantic and professional foil. Turner, in this film gives us the blueprint for how James Bond could ever be depicted as a woman. She sizzles with cool. For my money, one of the most amazing, terrifying performances I've ever seen is William Hickey as Don Prizzi in this film. His voice is not intimidating but his demeanor is. The detachment and reserve in his voice makes his cool demeanor all the more terrifying. He was so scary that I actually wondered if it was a joke. It nearly veers into farce, it's so scary. He steals every scene he is in as the aging mob boss. Honestly I found Angelica Huston's performance a bit one-note. She had the look of a hangdog puppy in the picture and I didn't feel much charisma emanating from her.I thought softening up a wonderful plot with some sentimentality was not the best decision but the acting, direction, and the fencing between the two leads make this a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston's 'Prizzi's Honor' is A Memorable Film with Solid Performances! Its a throughly entertaining film! 'Prizzi's Honor' tells the story of a mob hit man &amp; hit woman who fall in love, even though they have been hired to kill each other. 'Prizzi's Honor' is well-paced, funny, engaging &amp; memorable. Richard Condon &amp; Janet Roach's Screenplay is throughly entertaining &amp; offers terrific moments. John Huston's Direction is of high standards. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Costume Design, are superb.Performance-Wise: Acting God Jack Nicholson is astonishing, once again. He plays the twisted protagonist impeccably. Kathleen Turner is extremely witty &amp; unpredictable in her portrayal, while Anjelica Huston's Oscar-Winning turn is simply brilliant. William Hickey is outstanding, what a performance! Robert Loggia is in form. John Randolph deserves a special mention.On the whole, 'Prizzi's Honor' is definitely worth watching. Go For Some Vintage Entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mafia hit man falls in love with a hit woman, but complications arise. Nicholson is not at his best here. To reinforce the notion that his character is a dim wit, he apparently stuffed tissue under his upper lip for this role. It is very distracting. Otherwise, the acting is generally good, particularly Turner, Randolph, and Huston. However, Hickey steals the film in an amusing turn as an aged mafia boss. Plotwise, it is hard to believe that Nicholson and Turner become engaged hours after meeting, and the ending is unsatisfying. Anjelica Huston won an Oscar under her father's direction. John Huston also directed his father Walter to an Oscar (Treasure of the Sierra Madre).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hickey Loggia &amp; A. Huston Steal this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the story may be told numerous times. John Huston's brought a new meaning to the 'Mob Genre'..Women excellent in traditional male roles.K.Turner excellent as the Vamp wife girlfriend hit woman.Angelica with not that much on screen time was perfection, reason she garnered the Best Supporting Oscar.William Hickey stole the entire movie. Over a thirty/forty year period now the aging Don has Evolved.. His mannerisms can not be described as comedy,nor stereo typical of any nature. He can be ICILY cruel without violence yet the recipient knows as he stirs up fear.The best line of the movie ' Charley she gotta go.... And YOU gotta do it'. While this breaks me up it also shows how he remains totally in Control.. People will say he is not Italian. He portrayed an Italian Mafia Don with expertise even outdone Robert Loggia (A Sicilian). Remember Brando was not Italian as well.Further Loggia quietly stole many scenes IE; Reading Charley's letter to Dominic &amp; Pop Partana, &amp; that classic elevator Groping scene. Yet he knew his father was the undisputed head of the family. 'Capo Di tutti Capo'Now Nicholson's portrayal was to much over the top. I believe he had Novocain injections upper lip area to maintain that stupid look.Jack is a great actor &amp; he could have completed that role without any Brando cotton in cheeks effect. He made him appear overly dumb.Remember the story line he was born to the Don's longtime friend, he became the Don'd Godson. They brought him up to become a mob member (Birthday gift brass knuckles), later the Blood oath with the then younger Don Corrado.This was a sleeper hit, I do enjoy it having seen it numerous times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clash of ideals leaves muddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie which falls short of masterpiece because of the contrasting and conflicting styles which go into the mix. The writer, Richard Condon, is more interested in creating a dynamic, twisty, interesting plot as much as anything. He succeeds in this, with the viewer having to work very hard to keep up with the tergiversations of the action. This style, however, is not suited to Prizzi's Honor. The director, Jon Huston, knows this. He is more interested in the development of the relationships between the characters, particularly Jack N and Kathy T's love affair. But, so breakneck is the speed that this is not allowed. The only character I could truly believe in was Maerose, brilliantly assayed by Anjelica Huston. Nicholson plays it well (altho De Niro would have been even better) but his character is too stupid to be believable. Turner, also wonderful, is also saddled with a tough role, the character too gentile to pass as a hit-man, too duplicitous for Jaaaack to fall for her. Overall, Huston tries but fails to inject an elegiac theme into this, his penultimate film. You can sense his bitterness at life, but he never successfully puts it up on screen. Blame Condon: when his fast narratives work, they really work (Winter Kills, The Manchurian Candidate), but he would have done well to bow to Mario Puzo et al (ie. Sicilian writers) when it comes to taking on the Mob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somewhat fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) was groomed from the time he was born to be a hit-man for the Prizzi crime family. Don Corrado Prizzi (William Hickey) is the leader. His sons Eduardo (Robert Loggia) and Dominic (Lee Richardson) help run the business. Maerose (Anjelica Huston) is the family black sheep disowned by her father Dominic. She still has a good relationship with her ex-husband Charley. At a wedding, Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) catches Charley's eye and they start dating. Dominic has hired an outsider for a hit. Meanwhile they send Charley to hit people who are cheating the Prizzis. It gets complicated when Irene is the one with the stolen money and he finds out that she's actually the outside hitter.The movie is a little dark. I didn't find it funny. It has a few quirks. The beginning has the feel of 'The Godfather' with the wedding. The caper has a bit of wacky. Nicholson is not the traditional Italian mobster. I wouldn't say it's great with all the youse. There are a few slow spots before getting to the marriage. There are a lot of good stuff here also. I like all the great actors here. William Hickey is just terrific as the Don. It's a fine movie but I'm not sure it's Oscar worthy. I guess the John Huston name made it a safe pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huston Fails To Deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Huston was 79 years old when he made this...and it shows. The man who started his directing career with the great Maltese Falcon in 1941 is way "out of touch" here. The facts that he was a huge cigar smoker and a "hard" drinker would not have helped his brain age naturally. Anyway the directing is very clunky, the photography pedantic, the continuation (editing) poor and the script only average. Jack Nicholson plays the mentally challenged Mafia hit man Charley Partanna...but his one dimensional performance is boring. Kathleen Turner becomes Mrs. Partanna after an absurd sequence which (I guess) was supposed to be funny. The "expert reviewers" call this a black comedy. Its not really. It is a below par movie which is only very mildly amusing . (more grey than black). Made in 1985, it has already become dated and insignificant. Remarkably...it was nominated for 8 Oscars. It won one...Anjelica Huston (Johns daughter) for best actress in a supporting role. She deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfunny comedy. Jack is too dumb not to be nasty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago --- it must have been in about 1986 --- my sister told me that she and her husband walked out of this film before the end. They hadn't seen the jokes, I suppose, and felt an ever-increasing sense of nausea and distaste. The tale is certainly sick, and it must have been a great deal more fun to make than it is to watch. It could also be seen as a multi-barbed satirical attack on all three parts of "The Godfather", mercilessly mocking the ethos of that second (after Shawshank) most loved and praised of all iconic American masterpieces, portraying the society of the US to the rest of the world. Instead of secreting cotton wool in his cheek pouches, like Brando, Nicholson tucks a roll under his upper lip, making him look even dumber than he's acting.Most reviews here agree that this is all just taking the mickey, and for that reason it may merit moving up a couple of rating notches. However, it still isn't that good. I couldn't really understand the plot, with all its intricate insurance angles, but that didn't matter much, as it was mainly about caricaturing a well-known stereotypical group which nobody wants to get on the wrong side of.Perhaps the story repels to some extent because there isn't a single sympathetic or likable character in the entire cast. Was this why so many stars appear to have turned down offers to play various parts ? Every character looks upon taking other people's lives as just another job, an unimportant happening, which is all in the day's work, not worth a second thought. Only a relatively mild reservation about offing one's wife. Money is the most important commodity in the business world: it's business, just business. No hard feelings.There is one special feature of this movie which elevates it into unusual memorability, and that is the performance of William Hickey as the Grandfather, Godfather, Don. In 1985 this actor, born 1927, was only 58 ! I do not believe I have ever seen a more convincingly undead Zombie, aged at least 200, than Hickey delivers. Perhaps he was sustained, in common with all vampires, by the blood of his victims.I see Hickey's act has been noticed by several others. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The overly overrated movie that pushed me to sleep for every minute of it !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many many Academy award nominations this movie had face now much much rage and provocation I had while and after watching it ! While this was nominated for the best screenplay, I see that it chose the wrong genre utterly. While this was nominated for the best director, it's directed in incredibly uninspired way that made such a spiritless and atmospheric-less movie! While this was nominated for the best performance by an actor in a leading role, I see that (Jack Nicholson) was yes into the point as a dumb loyal bulldog, but mostly ugly. And while this was nominated for the best performance for an actress in a supporting role, and won, I see that (Anjelica Huston) did fine, but not great !The theoretical structure of the script is catchy and amusing. While telling a story about fidelity, love and honor in the world of mafia, it is a momentum of crime games and double crossings which leads to a tragic and ironic climax. However all of that could have been done way better as a comedy, not pure crime. It has a mega black comedy potential, though it was made in a way that has nothing to do with comedy. It's like looking to Marilyn Monroe and thinking only of analytical chemistry ! The conversations were left to lead everything obtusely. Don't be hungry for a good line or ? god forbid ? a slick joke out of the deeply ironic material. There is absolutely no moment portrayed in meaningfully artistic or even enjoyably aesthetic way. Simply the image didn't help establishing an expressive shape for the events or one eventual goal. The thing is it has no sarcastic soul, or else !(Nicholson) was deadly monotonous. There was no scene he did interestingly. And his voice in specific annoyed me extremely! EddieLarge, one of the IMDb users, commented on Nicholson's acting in the movie's board so wisely by saying that "Sticking some tissue under your top lip and speaking like a caricature of a Gangster does not equal good acting!". Maybe that performance could have been utilized in originally comic cosmos, but the movie's one was mute and dull. So what's bright here?? (William Hickey)'s face and performance. He did beat all the cast with his half stinking corpse, half elegant devil character that he mastered. Now nominating him for best supporting actor was something ? finally ? right. (Kathleen Turner)'s beauty; especially her mind-blowing, unbelievably perfect, long legs. And the Italian music-crazed soundtrack by the always prodigious Alex North; it was the only joking element around, rather the only sincere element to the movie's "lost" nature as genius black comedy. I was between pish and yawn. It's like a vast desert with meanings far far away. Why this wasn't made as a comedy is a question that swallowed the whole thing. They lost a huge chance, and made instead a boring and so silly movie, which went to be awfully overrated as well (beside the 5 academy awards I mentioned so far, it was nominated also for best costume design, best film editing, and ? get ready for this ? best picture !!). OK, it was nominated for almost all the wrong reasons then! Doesn't it eat you when a movie is loudly praised while you see it as usual or less than usual ?! Anyway, thank god that it didn't get nominated for best short animated film too !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange mixture of mirth and murder and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of John Huston's final directing efforts, Prizzi's Honor, confuses me since it is unlike anything he ever did prior to this. Huston, best known for Golden Age classics with strict moral settings in them such as The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Asphalt Jungle, goes a completely different route here telling the story of an organized mob family in Brooklyn trying to deal with its business both inside and outside the family. Jack Nicholson is the dim-witted yet somehow clever Charley Partanna, a hit-man for the Prizzi family and godson to the Don. He falls for an outside assassin, the beautiful and seductive Kathleen Turner, and soon has to deal with her problems as well as the effects that causes the family considering he was once promised to Maerose, the Don's granddaughter and she now wants to reconcile.As mentioned before, this is unlike any other type of John Huston picture I've seen. It combines elements of The Godfather along with scenes that seem better to fit in a comedy than a Mob drama. Yet, most of it works, perhaps thanks to the serious performances of Nicholson and Turner who have marvelous chemistry between them for two people that aren't very likable. Angelica Huston won an Oscar for her role as Maerose, which surprised me since I didn't think she had much of a serious part at all in this messy tale. The supporting cast is solid as well as the writing and direction, yet it didn't affect me as much as I thought it might. Perhaps it was the sheer bizarreness of the story that threw me off, but then again its tone is part of the film's unique manner. Despite its shortcomings, this is a special and mostly enjoyable tale about love and the Mafia and how they shouldn't be mixed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Late in John Hustons life he made some of his greatest films. He made some very different films in this time, some like nothing he had made before. Maybe it was a end of the life crisis, who knows. Prizzi's Honor is in my opinion his best movie ever. The performances are amazing, particularly by Jack Nicholson and Angelica Huston, who was Nicholsons flame at the time of filming. Kathleen Turner also turns in one of her best performances, not that it really says much, but she is actually pretty good. The plot is outstanding and the ending is far from what you will expect. It is what the movie needs, far from what we want to happen. The direction is also Hustons best ever, and he is an amazing director. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Nicholson roles, as Charlie Partanna.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I saw it in theater almost 20 years ago, and I still love it on DVD that I found at my public library. Nicholson normally plays a very clever character, but here he plays a mob hit man, a bit slow upstairs, but having achieved favored status by being the godson of the 'don.' Plus, he appears to be competent if straightforward in carrying out his 'assignments.' Kathleen Turner whom I so enjoyed in movies as 'Romancing The Stone' and 'Peggy Sue Got Married' plays Irene, a beautiful west coast blond who shows up at a Prizzi family wedding in NYC. Charlie is instantly smitten and the romantic comedy, a dark romantic comedy, begins. Angelica Huston, daughter of director John Huston, plays spurned lover Maerose beautifully. The remaining comments contain SPOILERS, SPOILERS - please read no further if you have not seen 'Prizzi's Honor.'The title comes from developments near the end, when Maerose is telling her father how Charlie 'took her.' 'He did it to me, father, on the floor, he forced himself on me.' Of course she was lying, the sex was invited by her, it was consensual. But it was her way of getting back at Charlie for having spurned her affections, and to get back into the good graces of the Prizzi family. So dad hires a contract killer to snuff Charlie. Problem is, he hired Irene, who he didn't know but was already Charlie's wife. Meanwhile, the 'don' tells Charlie that he must snuff Irene, because she had stolen $360,000 from the family before she and Charlie met.SPOILERS still!! In the end Charlie comes home to find Irene gone, he calls, she is in Califirnia to tie up some loose ends. He knows she has the contract, so takes a long knife taped to his leg. He arrives, they embrace, he gets in bed, she undresses, he puts the knife under the bed, she walks into the room, points her pistol, fires and hits the pillow, as Charlie pulls the knife and throws it to pierce her neck, she dies almost instantly. A very dark romantic comedy, not for everyone. But I really enjoyed the characters created by Nicholson, Turner, and Huston.</fullReview>

The second family member to be directed to an Oscar by John, his father Walter won in '48 for "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre".

		<fullReview>What a wonderful surprise this film was. When I thought about a comedy about the mob I was worried it would turn into a low brow slapstick about bumbling gangsters. Nothing could be farther from the truth in this incredibly intelligent comedy that is brilliantly acted. Jack Nicholson is pure gold in the lead role as Charlie the less than average intelligence mob hit man. His romance with a fellow hitman(hitwoman?) Kathleen Turner is terrifically played and leaves you on the ground laughing every few minutes. The star of the movie is really William Hickey though. He steals every scene he's in as the venerable mob boss. He goes from threatening someone to offering them a cookie in seconds and it seems completely natural. One second he seems senile and the other a mastermind. This movie is the crazy without the actors trying to play it that way. It is a seriously played zany film which works perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood has long enjoyed an almost incestuous relationship with the so - called Mafia who,it strikes me,are rather like"Pop",the Etonian society that is entirely self - electing and is answerable only to its own members.Contrarily,on the one hand we are always being told that the Mafia does not exist and that is entirely a racist conceit and ,on the other hand that Organised Crime figures wield serious influence in the film industry,not the least through the unions. Certainly most movies concerning themselves with Italian - American criminal gangs whilst ostensibly being careful to avoid glamourising the milieu nonetheless make sure that due deference is paid to the "Honoured Society" ethos at some point,perhaps in order to avoid the producer waking up one morning with his favourite Arab stallion's head on his pillow.Whatever the truth - and I doubt we'll ever know -"Prizzi's Honor" is yet another Mafia movie that slyly offers admiration to the Organisation whilst disrespecting some of its members. Mr J.Nicholson,loyal and not clever enough to be dangerous to his superiors and Miss A. Huston,too clever for her superiors,are on/off lovers and Miss K.Turner,not quite as clever as she thinks she is, make up a deadly triangle.They all overact with evident relish,and therein lies the fatal flaw of the whole movie,there is not one believable performance in it.We all know it's Jack Nicholson with a New York accent with "dese and dose" abounding and are happy to be in on the joke but we can't take him seriously as a hit-man. Another drawback for a movie supposedly a "dark comedy"(whatever that means) is that "Prizzi's Honor" isn't remotely funny.A police captain's wife is cold - bloodedly shot dead in a lift and we're supposed to fall about laughing? I don't think so thank you. The Partana family obviously couldn't organise a drink - up in a brewery unlike the real thing that continually evades the best efforts of cop and FBI alike and no one will be fooled that the Mafia is full of husky - voiced old geezers spitting impotent hate across the table at the younger generation,but who have hearts of mush under all their psychopathic exteriors. "The Godfather" was a fine movie but Mr Coppola has a lot to answer for. Too many second rate "hommages" of one sort or another have rolled down the pike ever since and,disappointingly,"Prizzi's Honor" must rank amongst them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't do any one thing well but does everything well enough to produce a good, if unsatisfying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Partanna is the number one hit man for the Pizzi family. At a Prizzi wedding he spots a beautiful woman and tries to get to know her, although she is called away. Later that night she calls him and they get together, have sex, hang around and gradually fall in love. He finds out later that she is also a professional killer and is an easy choice when he is given a kidnapping job to do that involves taking out some bodyguards. However Irene is forced to kill a woman that sees them in the act ? only to find that the woman was married to a police chief. With the police cutting all ties and coming down on the New York families, Charlie and Irene end up in a perilous situation.For all its class and reputation, something doesn't quite satisfy about Prizzi's Honour because, although it is mostly enjoyable the variable style means that no one approach works really well even if they all work a bit. The plot sounds pretty good and it does move along well enough but it is regularly a bit too slow, without giving depth in return for the patience it asks for. At turns it is a comedy, emotionally deep, a mobster saga and a romance ? it cannot seem to decide which one it wants to be so it tries to blend all aspects in; an attempt that never really comes off but still works well enough for the film itself to be enjoyable. Personally I found it to still be rather unsatisfying because since it didn't go one way it felt like most of it was half-done. So instead of being a deep mobster epic it only had aspects of that; instead of being a satisfyingly tragic romance it tried but was unengaging and instead of having dark laughs it only hit "comic" here and there.The cast help but they tend to be part of the mixed style rather than trying to get above it. Nicholson tends to overplay the simplicity of his character and thus prevents any real depth to come out ? although the final scenes are moving this tends to be despite him and not because of him. Turner is better because she has a better character to play with; ultimately she cannot do it alone but she tends to lift the film a little bit. The two of them have to move between styles as the film does and it is too much for them. The rest of the support tend to exist within one main style to the film and generally benefit from it ? for example Hickey, Loggia and Randolph all exist within a mob epic of sorts and have pitched their performances more or less to there. Huston is enjoyable and small turns from Tierney and Pounder are nice finds.Overall this is an OK film but it could have been better by either focusing on one or two aspects and doing them better. It is a nice try at a nice mix but it doesn't totally come off despite doing enough and having enough class to still produce an enjoyable film if rather muted in most areas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old John Huston movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston made movies mainly during the 40's and the 50's. He is well known for some of his great movies like The Maltese Falcon (1941) and The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (1948), two movies who earned themselves a position on AFI's top 100 list and what many consider to be his best picture ever, 1951's The African Queen which was ranked 17th on AFI's top 100 list. His major collaborations with Humphrey Bogart also made him quite popular in the beginning of his career. Unfortunately, he died in 1987. However, he did not leave us without giving us an 80's classic ? la John Huston. Prizzi's Honor was his final stand and what a stand it was. The Mob is probably the topic that has been the most used in Cinema. Movies like Little Caesar (1930) and The Public Enemy (1931) are the young classics that gave us a taste of things to come for the more modern classics such as Goodfellas (1990) and the ultimate movie of all-time, The Godfather (1972) and its terrific sequel, The Godfather Part II (1974). As with every other common movie topic, Hollywood has produced many disappointing movies about the Mob such as Scarface (1983). However, it has produced the ultimate disgrace to the Mob movies with 1998's Mafia which tried to parody The Godfather, Scarface, and many others. This is something that I can not tolerate, to make a parody of such great movies. So looking at Prizzi's Honor, I thought this might be a movie that had a similar objective to Mafia with a few big stars in it. I was mistaken. Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) is a wiseguy. At a wedding, he sees a beautiful tall blond woman (Kathleen Turner) with whom he immediately falls in love with. He finally meets this woman. Her name is Irene Walker. He soon finds out that she had made a hit for the Prizzi family, the family of which he is part, the day of the wedding. The two of them fall in love and make plans for marriage. But Irene goes back to California for a few days. During her trip, Charley also learns that a scam has been going on in one of the Casinos owned by the Prizzis and that the man who orchestrated this scam is a man named Marxie Heller. So Charley is sent by the family to get the money back from Marxie. Charley goes to Heller's house and knocks off Heller. He waits for Heller's wife to return as she apparently had something to do with the scam. But surprise surprise for Charley as Heller's wife turns out to be Irene Walker. Charley spares her after she returns half of the stolen money and goes back to Brooklyn claiming he could only find that and he marries Irene. But complications are bound to arise and they do. Huston's smart directing does not allow the viewer to call out a mistake in the movie an Richard Condon's script is intelligent as it releases all its small twists and turns in the correct order at the right moments. One of the key actors in the movie is Anjelica Huston's role as the rejected daughter of a second level boss for the Prizzi family. Without her, the movie would probably not end the way it does. Jealousy, greed, love... these are the principal themes of this black-comedy along with, of course, the theme of murder. But as I said at the beginning, this is a typical Huston classic and is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor, pride, and family. Remember never fall in love. A masterpiece of John Huston.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Huston was able to adapt this Richard Condon novel well to the screen. Many felt Prizzi's Honor was a dark comedy, but I saw it different enough drama and suspense is present to make this organized crime drama a classic winner. If you've read some of my other comments I guess you know what a big Jack Nicholson fan I am. And once again Jack delivers a bold performance in fact one of his best ever. Nicholson once again proves his preparation to be impeccable everything from the wardrobe and the strong Brooklyn accent that Jack displays makes him seem so realistic as the tough and direct to the point Mafia hitman (Charley Partanna). Nicholson's tough and bold performance is helped along with the great supporting cast of Kathleen Turner, and John Huston's daughter Anjelica. In fact Anjelica caught the eye of the industry as she received an Academy award for Best Supporting Actress. I couldn't agree more Anjelica's offbeat performance made her very deserving. William Hickey gives maybe behind Nicholson the strongest performance of the film as (Don Corrado Prizzi) the oldest crime figure of the Prizzi family and when the camera is in front of William he is magical his words and expressions just steal the show. Not only does Prizzi's Honor offer crime and drama but romance steals a good portion of the movie. From the beginning of the film when Nicholson discovers a beautiful blond stranger (Kathleen Turner). Instant chemistry between them-not unnaturally, perhaps, because she is secretly a hired gun for the Mafia. A love affair develops into passionate sex, then when the former fiancee of Charley Maerose Prizzi (Anjelica Huston) begins to wry her way to seduce Charley the twists continue. As the film progresses it shows just how organized greed corrupts all. In the end I felt that John Huston's most important message was to never fall in love and I agree with that message and have adopted it in many ways. That message is presented so perfect in the final scene when Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) and Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) are together for the final time. No matter how much love it dies even if individuals have similar backgrounds. Believe me love hurts. Remember stand and support honor, pride, and most of all family take those things over hot passionate love because love can really hurt in big ways and Prizzi's Honor proves it. I must say this is a great movie to add to your home video collection and cherish for years, I know I have and I was once again pleased with Jack Nicholson hey aren't we always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this movie after reading a piece by Angelica Houston referring to her Oscar win. Gee, I thought, I've never seen it but it is by Houston, has Nicholson and (then still gorgeous) Kathleen Turner, so I purchased the DVD. From the beginning, it was so corny, so poorly acted, often so stupidly, almost jokingly melodramatic, and so almost plot-less until far along, that I simply could not believe I was watching a movie that had won anything, much less an Oscar. It never came close to making me laugh, if it was supposed to be a funny spoof, so failed there. And Angelica who won an Oscar? Had a very limited part, not that many lines -- and was always rather monotone, even the one time she emoted (weeped -- which you only really knew because she kept wiping her eyes). Such a silly, B grade (at best) movie that I looked up the contenders for best supporting actress that year -- must have been a dog of a year -- but no, there was Oprah from the Color Purple. Really? I've heard the argument that, well, maybe Angelica was "owed one." (And how she was "owed", I do not know,). And yet how could the academy nonetheless award someone who hardly had any acting in such a low-grade movie is beyond me -- and should be beneath the standards of the academy.Spend your hour and a half doing anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly dull or dully brilliant ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prizzi's Honor" is an odd, intriguing and somewhat puzzling gangster film, it borrows a lot to standards like "The Godfather", starting with a wedding, focusing on a big Italian family, yet it so insists on its seriousness I fail to perceive any hint of parody, and the line between black humor and plain family drama is so thin only Jack Nicholson's comical performance confirms that the film is meant to drain laughs more than anything, still, I was desperately waiting for a few laugh-out-loud moments. Maybe the whole project was meant as a long and big gag by itself, mocking the archetypes of a genre with a sort of operatic decadence, but I suspect it might leave many viewers cold.I wish I could develop the former paragraph but this is as far as I can go trying to sound like all the distinguished critics, probably smarter than me, who raved the film, I didn't hate "Prizzi's Honor" but how this was praised as one of the best film of 1985, nominated for several Oscars while "Back to the Future" alone is a far better production, did I miss something? John Huston is one of my favorite directors, Jack Nicholson one of my favorite actors, yet the film had no savor, whatsoever, the comedic parts weren't that funny, the drama ? actually, the film doesn't even inspire me a review, I don't want to bash it not to praise it all, I just want to forget about it? forgettable, maybe that's the word.Forgettable among John Huston's filmography, the maverick director contributed to some of the most passionate and iconoclast portrayals of men facing the adversity of life with a temerity that transcend the status of losers to inner nobility, in "Prizzi's Honor", I couldn't care for any of these characters, their motives, their ambitions, their flaws or strengths suffered from a lack of focus from the script, to a point we couldn't get who was the heart of the story. Behind every great Huston's film, there is a man, and in no way, Charley Pattanna was in the same caliber of Huston's previous heroes. Granted it's a comedy, Burton in "The Night of the Iguana" or Bogart in "Beat the Devil" were far funnier, speaking of the latter, the film is as campy as Prizzi but it wasn't supposed to be regarded as one of the best of the year.Had "Prizzi's Honor" been bashed y the critics, it would have probably increased its chances to become a cult-classic, to encourage viewers to look at what is so bad about it, which is the best way to find the hidden brilliance. But I blame the critics for having set the reverse mindset, people want to see what's so great about "Prizzi's Honor", only to end with a "huh" feeling. Is it good? Not that good. Not that bad either. In fact, what was it about? A hit-man who falls in love with a hit-woman, only to find out they have to kill each other, well, talk about spoiling the ending of the film, when the main premise only takes place at the end, the whole story turns to the slow build-up of a so-so punchline. What happens during the first act isn't without entertaining value, but I guess the veteran director, who'd die 2 years later, was tired enough, and this showed in the film that lacked direction.I used forgettable for Huston, I'd use it for Nicholson, too. He is supposed to be the main protagonist, the one to root for, the first time I saw him in the film, I couldn't get away from the thing under his lip, was he supposed to imitate Bogart? It's Jack Nicholson, for Christ' sakes, he doesn't play characters, characters dilute in him, he's larger-than-life enough not to need a lousy disguise. The second viewing, I closed my eyes on the lip, then I realized that his accent was horrid, it wasn't badly done, but it sounded like he was drunk, slow minded, or simply retarded, no one talks like that, this is Nicholson's worst performance, almost Razzie- worthy. And they give him an Oscar nomination for that? Hello? Where was the Academy when Al Pacino played Tony Montana, granted his accent didn't sound Cuban but it couldn't have been worse than Pattana and at least the character communicated some energy.Huston depressed me and Nicholson irritated me, and they're all among my favorite performers, when you're lead to these conclusions, there's not much left to be enjoyed, apart from Kathleen Turner's breathtaking beauty but she doesn't do much in her role. All right, there's the priceless running gag with the plane going back and forth from New York to Los Angeles, there's Anjelica Huston who saves the day by a solid performance only ruined by the ambiguity of her character's motives, and thank God, there's Charles Wickley who reinvents the character of a new Don without even thinking of playing Don Corleone, half-don, half Dracula, he oozes the relative tiredness of a man who sees the downfall of his family and can only count on Patanna, that's how desperate the situation is.At the end, it's the frail little man embodies the very desperateness of the film, and it's the only real good thing about "Prizzi's Honor". Maybe I change my mind if I get older enough and contemplate the disillusions of my life that I appreciate the sights of scumbags taking their lives seriously, while realizing they're all nasty, cruel, ugly in their way, maybe the film inspired me the very nastiness that allows me to see it in a better light, maybe its dullness is brilliant to a certain way, flirting with uncertain caricature and gruesome black comedy. I only concede this to Huston because he never made an unintelligent and unsubstantial film, there's got to be something.Still, I could have made it without that phony accent ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prizzi's Honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch any film includes Jack Nicholson's sex scenes on screen literally makes me squirm, and at age of 49 in this film, he and his love-at-first-sight object Kathleen Turner's shagging is so self-consciously clumsy (Ms. Turner basically is off-scene), despite of being graphically implicit. Physically speaking, he has never aged well, and technically the eye-broccoli might suit well with a comical tone of this Godfather parody. Directed by John Huston (his penultimate work before THE DEAD 1987) and earned Anjelica Huston an Oscar for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, the film has its dated setbacks, as a BEST PICTURE nominee, it is bizarrely mediocre. Supposedly Mr. Houston aspired to stew a Mafia burlesque, but the scarcity of comedic fodder stunts the intention and after 27 years, which bears out to be an inadequate oddball. Anyway, the film proffers a fitful performance treat, Anjelica's win sounds like a moot point to me since her flare only glistens for basically two scenes (viciously confronting her father and schemingly seeking help from her grandfather), but her costumes should be merited for her compulsive appealing. Another two nominees are Jack Nicholson and William Hickey, the latter is plain worthy (a steadfast panache exuding from an ailing but slick godfather) while the former is less impressive to say nothing of Nicholson's a dozen of other virtuoso acting prowess. The leading lady Kathleen Turner is on the other hand, a bona fide underachiever, both as a wife and a professional killer, and a mawkish affection is such a pain to watch. So, Alex North's arrangements of Gioachino Rossini's music is an utter saving grace (namely, Il Barbierie di Siviglia), and the film actually is more pleasant to ears if one can erase its incongruous scenario and an awfully lame denouement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This tongue-in-cheek fairy tale of true love between hired assassins is more demanding than it should have been, almost certainly requiring a second viewing just to unravel Richard Condon's convoluted plot. Jack Nicholson portrays a dim-witted pet hit man for the Prizzi crime family; his rival/paramour is Kathleen Turner, and the scenario demands a heroic suspension of disbelief to accept either star in their role. Both were obviously chosen for their marquee appeal, but it's the supporting cast that makes the film worthwhile, including William Hickey as the frail Prizzi patriarch and Angelica Huston as his scheming granddaughter (the former earned an Oscar nomination; the latter won the award). Director John Huston, for all his acknowledged talents, shows no special gift here for black comedy, and the cold-blooded conclusion may leave viewers with a bitter aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just didn't interest me....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner both are assassins, though when Jack first notices her, he has no idea she, too, is a professional hit-man (hit-woman?). When they fall in love and get married, it seems kind of darkly sweet, but soon there are LOTS of complications--including the mob ordering them to kill each other. How will they work this out? Well, the film manages to do it in a way that I certainly didn't expect."Prizzi's Honor" is a well made film and it was a sleeper hit back in 1985. However, I've gotta be up front about this one....it just didn't interest me very much. I think there are two main reasons--it should have been funnier and I just don't like most gangster films. There is a HUGE fascination among the public for gangster films, I know, but apart from a few classics, I don't care for the genre at all. So, keep this in mind as you read my review--this guy just isn't into gangster films. Now this isn't to say I hated the film--the acting was quite nice. But I also found the plot needlessly complicated and it's hard caring at all about evil murderers. Worth seeing, perhaps, but to my it just wasn't up to all the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The all-American hood"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970s the honourable mafia family was the stuff of sophisticated drama, so it only follows that in the 1980s it would be fair game for a spoof. Prizzi's Honor actually features a fairly serious and workable plot, a Machiavellian tale of revenge and double-cross, and looks like it may have begun life at one point as a straight crime pictures. However rather than rehashing a bunch of clichés it takes the tack of sending up that world of casual violence, unshakeable loyalty and half-mumbled Italian accents.Yes, the basic approach here is to reel out the sillier aspects of the mafia movie and make them sillier still. Jack Nicholson reprises his post-lobotomy face from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and throws in a few Brando-esque grunts and bits of business. It's not among his best comedic roles. William Hickey is actually quite subtle and nuanced as the stereotypical elderly Don, but the performance is just too much of a caricature for anything outside complete farce, which this isn't. Prizzi's Honor does however contain some very fine non-comedy performances. Anjelica Huston stands out in her smooth and confident portrayal of the manipulative outcast daughter. She really dominates the screen without ever once exaggerating or using some trite gesture. Kathleen Turner is very good too. Watch her eyes in the scene where she and Nicholson have their first drink together ? she's not listening to him, she's eyeing him up.Director John Huston was a veteran of the classic era, now in the twilight of his career. In Prizzi's Honor he displays the professionalism of his generation and the uncomplicated, unostentatious approach of an older man, as well as the various tricks that he had been using to make great pictures since the 1940s. He knows exactly how little input is really needed from the camera, letting the action play out in some very long takes, shifting our focus by smoothly dollying in. Sometimes, rather than changing angle or moving in he will have the actor do the work. For example, there is a scene with John Randolph on the phone, sitting back in his chair, but at a key moment in the dialogue he leans forward, effectively putting himself into close-up without the camera moving an inch. His detachment from the action can be sublimely elegant, such as the garage door slowly coming down for a killing to take place offscreen. Huston was never known as much of a comedy director, and as I've hinted the cod-Sicilian business isn't that funny, but he works in a handful of nice sight gags such as a trio of rudeboys all handcuffed together in a row.The trouble is, Prizzi's Honor is a dreadful mediocrity, and it's not just the hit-and-miss comedy that is to blame. True, the plot is strong enough to have been done without the spoofing, but to be fair the mobster archetypes are so familiar it would be hard to do it any other way without seeming corny. The real problem is that it simply doesn't have enough meat to its bones. There are some decent characters, and their machinations certainly make for a good story, but there just aren't the great, memorable set-pieces or crackling dialogue to make the whole thing rattle along as any decent crime drama should, comical or otherwise. It's a shame. With the amount of talent available here this is a wasted opportunity.</fullReview>

He plays mob assassin and falls in love with Kathleen Turner, not one of my favorite actresses then and now. She turns out to be a killer herself and their next job is to kill each other. Wiliam Hickey earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as the Godfather. The film is dark comedy complimenting the Godfather saga.

Not just the violence of it, but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.I enjoy a good shocker, but this seemed so out of character... Also, when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s, and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.Somehow, mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny.

		<fullReview>A dynamite conceit -- a hit-man and hit-woman fall in love and then find out that they've been hired to kill each other -- falls flat because of director John Huston's inability to settle on a consistent tone. It's not a satiric comedy, though it has satiric elements, but it's never compelling as drama either. Jack Nicholson is humorous enough as the dolt of a hit-man, and Kathleen Turner was at a career high when she made this film and just about runs the show. Creepy William Hickey gets a few scenes as don of a mafia family, and Anjelica Huston became the first actress (and I think to date only actress) to be directed to an Academy Award by a parent, but her role doesn't consist of much more than her walking around, decked out like a bird of prey.Maybe it's because Huston was reaching the end of his illustrious career (this was one of the last movies he made), but the movie feels plodding and lifeless.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in his career but I don't buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study set in Mexico, that ranks among the finest he ever did. Prizzi's Honor on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a major letdown.The overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early 90's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake, the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga etc. Jack Nicholson (doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations: she starts out the victim of her bigot father's disdain, she proves to be supportive to her ex-husband, then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate.The colours of the movie have a washed-up quality like it was made in the early 70's and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. There's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been morphed to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy? Not really. Drama? Little, if any. Tragicomedy? Possibly, some, but not developed as such. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is much, much too slow. The acting is quite solid all-round, but that is, unfortunately, not enough to save the film. The action is daft. The tension is low and both poorly built and utilized. The characters... I could *not* get behind anyone's motivation. Also, to quote Team America: World Police(more specifically, the character of Kim Jong Il(who I understand is quite a "character" for real, as well)) "Why is everyone so f**ing stupid?!" To be honest, it's mainly the mobsters. Why? I "get" wanting to make gangsters look dumb and inept, but... you might want to check the level of reality at some point, too. Or make sure you have your audience check their brains at the door. This started out almost poetically... slow, building... beautiful images. Then it starts trying to be funny. Much of it is dark comedy, but very little of it actually works. Not long after, it starts trying to be dramatic... here, it fails even more-so. With Nicholson being painfully dimwitted and Turner being fairly... easy, slutty, it's just difficult to find reason to sympathize with these people(and let's not even *mention* the notion of liking them). I doubt there's a single credible character in there. I think what takes the cake here, though, is the ending... or, rather, lack thereof. Please, anyone who's seen this, let's be honest; this movie doesn't "end", it just stops. The words "The End" fade onto the screen, followed by the credits, but there's no real closure(not to mention, it came across as tacked-on). To the story, to the characters, to the plot. I recommend this to only the biggest fans of the people involved in making it, and urge most anyone else to just skip this one... it's no great loss. The loss is the great chance that was wasted in the production of this film... with an interesting premise(later made into a Hollywood flick that manages to be more entertaining than this), a (or so I've heard, this is the first of his films I watch) competent director and a highly talented cast, this could have been simply breathtaking. Instead, it's rather moan-inducing. Sad. 6/10</fullReview>

Elsewhere he has Turner's sentimentality and conformism (she expects men to capture babies, to want sex rather than assassinate her etc) result in her downfall. Turner may play a headstrong, undercover assassin, but certain quaint expectations she has of men leads to her ruin. Men, apparently, are dishonourable, unreliable oafs, a fact which gets Turner a knife in the head.5/10 ? Dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Really Wanted To Like It....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FILM: John Huston is in his late 70s. He isn't what you'd normally call hot stuff. Richard Condon wrote a book about the mob, it was a comedy. Condon decided he would make his story into a film, so he approached Huston, despite Huston not having made a comedy in some time. Huston went through an impressive roll call of names for the various parts, but he made his mind up in the end with Jack Nicholson playing Brooklyn mobster Charley and Kathleen Turner playing the seductive Irene.Huston even cast his daughter Anjelica in the juicy part of Maerose. The film was not expected to perform well, but it became such a massive sleeper hit that when it came out on VHS, it was still in theatres. Critics loved it, and it nabbed Huston his last Oscar nomination for Best Director, at the young age of 78, a record that stands even today. So it would make sense for this film to be regarded as a classic these days, right?Wrong.THE PLOT: Charley Partanna is born into the mafia, so when he becomes of age he becomes a contract killer for the Prizzi's, one of the most famous of the New York mafia families. At a family wedding, he notices the beautiful Irene Walker. He is immediately smitten, but he loses her and can't find her. Afterwards he gets a call from her, she's in California and she wants to meet him. The next day Charley flies out and they fall immediately in love, and so does she.He flies back home bursting with happiness, and he gets an assignment. Someone stole money from the Prizzi's casino in Vegas, and they aren't happy. It was a husband and wife job, apparently and they are in California, so Charley flies back out. There he shoots the husband, and then waits for the wife to come home. The wife is Irene, and she gives him the money, only there is half of it missing. In doubt over weather to kill or kiss her, Charley flies back to New York (again), and consults his former fiancée, after they have sex on the carpet.Charley decides to kiss her, and flies (seriously, they use the same airplane each time, it's really annoying) back to California and marries Irene. From there, the newlyweds go back to New York (guess the method of transportation) and begin to work on a new job. It turns out that Irene is a contract killer and she and Charley plan to kidnap a bank manager for ransom, only they are forced to shoot a cops wife, turns everyone against them, even each other.THE CRITICISM:I really wanted to like this movie, but I think you can tell by my annoyance over the constant air travel (seriously, it's like an ad for United) that I didn't love this film. I didn't hate it though, because Nicholson is just so entertaining while trying to pull off a Brooklyn accent, though it almost works. It is a black comedy, but I did not laugh once or cringe. I sat there and saw the movie.Above, I wrote that this film has mostly been forgotten, and that is true. it was apparently a big hit in the 80s and I can see why. But it has been partially forgotten. Maybe because 1985 was such a weak year for film, this was regarded as good enough. Nicholson looks a little old, but he and Turner had sufficient box office appeal to pull it off. I had been told that this film was amazing and really bad. Personally I did not enjoy it, but it was entertaining enough.With the performances, Nicholson is so completely over the top that his Charley Partanna almost works, the accent is enough to make me smile, but unfortunately for a two hour long film, a smile is not enough. Kathleen Turner certainly has an abundance of sex appeal, but I found Irene to be incredibly similar to Turner's work in the outstanding Body Heat. She had me confused about whether she was a hero or villain, up until the last few minutes I did not know. Some would sat this helped the performance, but I personally just found it confusing.Anjelica Huston won an Oscar for her work as Maerose Prizzi, but like I said above, it must have been a weak year. Huston was good, but again I couldn't figure out weather she was good or evil. It just ended up confusing me. The rest of the cast does good work, but nothing jumps out. The cinematography can feel rather old school at some parts, but I guess that's just the way Huston interpreted the story. Alex North's score can feel clawing at some points, but the covers of popular Italian music can be entertaining.I felt as if the film was Huston taking a break. It certainly didn't feature any amazing shots or scenes, I cannot comprehend the film's multiple Oscar nominations, it seems to me like a really average film. That is not to say that it wasn't entertaining, Nicholson was enough to save the film from mediocrity. The end result is not the boring film it might have been without Nicholson's presence and Anjelica certainly injects life into her scenes, but in the end, despite the wicked satire of the plot the film never really goes anywhere you want it to and you are left feeling empty.But I guess that's better than nothing.Prizzi's Honor, 1985, Starring: Jack Nicholson, Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston.

		<shortDescription>"The Godfather" with a smirk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deliciously tongue in cheek, "Prizzi's Honor" is a black comedy where the lives of two "hit men" are intertwined in an all-out mob war. It all starts off with a delicious spoof of a mob wedding (the type seen in "The Godfather") with close-ups of all the eccentric characters you will meet in the next two hours. They include guests Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as the two hired assassins who meet, share a dance, after which they fall in love, marry and share a hit. Nicholson and Turner share much tenderness in their love scenes, so this is as far as Turner's later "War of the Roses" as you can get. Add on some truly funny "Dick Tracy" like characterizations by Anjelica Huston and William Hickey, and the result is a spoof of a Greek tragedy, New York Sicilian style! The magnificent Huston shines as a black sheep mob princess turned spider woman. The future movie Morticia Addams (and a delightful sorceress in "The Witches") begins her career of larger than life characterizations. While she had been around seemingly for ages, this is the film that brought her into the consciousness of the film-going public. Her director father John Huston wisely chose her for a part that in the 1940's, Gale Sondergaard would have slithered in front of a camera for. Hickey, in the role of the Prizzi patriarch, seems so aware of his grotesque appearance that he utilizes it to his advantage to deliver the type of performance that makes him unforgettable.Nicholson and Turner are outstanding but unfortunately, Turner is nowhere as near to her future flamboyant characters, sort of a calmer "Serial Mom" who does mob hits rather than kill teachers for flunking her son in math. Nicholson, either adding cotton or ecologin to his upper lips, is nowhere close to any of his many grotesque characterizations, and this brings out a truly original performance. One of the best screenplays of the 1980's, superb direction by a master, makes this a classic of the genre of mob films resulting in an instant masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't really work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that I would have understood or liked this movie more if I had seen it back in the 80s (but I was too young for that then). Now in 2010, I feel that it is lacking in many respects, and that it has perhaps aged a little bit and follows the movie-making styles that were the rule thirty years ago.Watched with today's eyes, my personal opinion is that it hasn't stood the test of time the way other old movies do. The black comedy just isn't funny enough, the action is not exciting at all, and it doesn't work as a gangster-mafia movie either (which other older gems obviously succeed at). It aims at many things and doesn't succeed at any of them. There is too much dialog that doesn't serve any real purpose, as it does not move the plot forward or make for any entertainment, either; and I'm all for movies with good dialog, but this one just isn't one of them.I loved Kathleen Turner and Anjelica Huston in this, but everything else was quite disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny and endearing, where comedy comes in through behavior and little jolts of the unexpected surrounding dark romantic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of John Huston's last great successes, he adapted a Richard Condon story- and Condon, who wrote the Manchurian Candidate, is the kind of writer who can deftly mix some bizarre comic moments in the midst of a dark drama- keeping the story's tone and substance but adding to it a kind of traditional era Hollywood star power, and it's a multi-layered, if imperfect, concoction. It was a possibly risky move to have Jack Nicholson play a slightly stupid Brooklyn hit-man who falls for a beautiful tall blonde after a chance encounter at a wedding (Turner, on the other hand, was a given, especially for her fame of the period at playing a quasi Lauren Bacall type). But Huston knew what he was doing putting him in as Charlie Partanna. It's not just in the eyebrows this time, but in the eyes too, and the little inflections that come up on the face when faced with a dilemma. He looks as if he thinks he's smarter than he is, that he knows everything that's going on. He's a professional killer, but he's also got a soft heart, and it's always a pleasure and point of fascination to see Nicholson make Charlie not merely a caricature of a Brooklyn mobster. It's also very, very funny to see such little inflections and touches of his accent.Same goes for William Hickey as Don Corrado (you might remember him from Christmas Vacation as the old grandfather), who looks like he could be brittle enough to break at any moment. But perhaps most successful was Angelica Huston as the scorned lover of Charlie's, who has a devious way of getting back at him for a doomed relationship (one of the great scenes in the film is when she tries to embellish to her father what Charlie did to her in her apartment recently, graphically). It might've been a given that Huston, working under a Huston, would deliver the goods, but her's is a subtly tragic performance, putting more into context the darker emotional side to the Prizzi family. The plot itself is fairly convoluted- which is a big part of the twisted fun in following it along- but it gets to something like this: Charlie is ordered to murder a man and his wife, but finds out the wife is Irene (Turner), whom he's just fallen in love with. He can't do it. Soon they get married, but there are further complications- specifically that she killed some significant people- and soon it comes down to husband and wife being ordered to off one another.Sound a little like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith much? It's not of that league; Huston is very classy with how he deals with the mob violence, showing only so much, and getting more explicit as the film goes more dark with the pressure coming down on the principal characters. One murder scene in-particular is quite startling, as it provides just the emotional high-point needed during the climax. But it's not all a soap opera of love and the mob criss-crossed into a weird kind of mayhem. It's also, at least on the surface, bitingly funny, though always in how the characters behave, how Nicholson carries himself or how the Prizzi's have a discussion with little ticks and asides thrown in. And as director, Huston mixes together contemporary material- sex, language and violence for 1985- with a style that's more complimentary to the Golden Age of Hollywood pictures, where a transition across the country was done with a shot of an airplane (a running gag in this film), fades were common-place, and the clothes matched the elegance with which the camera moved around (only once, or twice, are there hand-held shots).It's a very rich film, yet if it does lack something it's the complete adherence to a perfectly clear plot. It's understandably convoluted, though not to the extent of a Maltese Falcon or other, and it also veers a couple of times into becoming too serious for its own good. But these quibbles aside, Prizzi's Honor is involving and strong as drama and a tale of bad love, but the added touches of comedy rise it to the level of the sublime- just watch as Charlie and Irene go for the kidnapping plan, and find someone unexpected coming around in the elevator (and who doesn't catch a baby?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well then, what is it?! I found Nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a filthy no good slut. It's not that I "don't get it". It's not that I don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more. This is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has going for it. That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd, but then again, it is intended to be so. This however does not strike me as a.)funny, or b.)...even remotely interesting!!! This was a waste of my time, so don't let the hype get the best of you...it is a waste of your time! With all that being said, the opening church sequence is quite beautiful...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of tasteless ham courtesy of the Prizzi Meat Co.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight academy nominations? It's beyond belief. I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I feel distinctly cheated as a result.So it's a black comedy is it? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi's Honor? It's certainly tasteless (the shooting in the head of a policeman's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life) but with the exception of a joke about 'your favourite Mexican cigars' (which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try. There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché doesn't constitute humour in my book.Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd, and it usually just has the feel of a really bad (and cheap) Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody.With one-dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them, the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces. Well it isn't enough; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brando's padded jowls in The Godfather?... Oh! Who cares?... all I know is, it isn't funny).Throw in some slow, plodding direction (this film drags on for 2 hours), some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as; "You remember the Camora? Well we're far bigger, we'll track you down wherever you go", and clichéd mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say "capiche?". Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's "masterpiece" and is rather a very poor last work. It's definitely one work in the great director's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson River.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie just entertaining, nothing else. I think it was an overrated movie because it received an Oscar nomination as the best movie. I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars instead of 6.8, so I give it a 6.I didn't like the performance of Jack Nicholson as Charley Partanna in spite of he received an Oscar nomination as the best leading actor. What I liked about the movie were the main idea of a romance between two professional killers and the performances of Kathleen Turner (Irene Walker) and Anjelica Huston (Maerose Prizzi).The plot of the movie is about two professional killers who are in love, Charley Partanna and Irene Walker, but the are going to have problems with the mob Prizzi family whom Charley work for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still not sure what constitutes a "spoiler". So, this movie was made in 1985. I recently purchased it for $1.00 out of simple curiosity and the fact that it purportedly was nominated for eight Academy Awards and directed by John Huston. Well, I guess it was worth about $1.00 to see Jack Nicholson play himself (again) with one of the worst Brooklyn accents I've ever been subjected to. The "voice coach" must have been watching old Bowery Boys flicks (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey) and Saturday morning cartoons.The old Don was almost as laughable. At any rate - the only thing I found truly humorous about the entire film was the fact that it was nominated for eight Academy Awards. This cannot be the same Huston who directed "Chinatown".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the mafia becomes the argument of an action film and little more it is no longer funny, it is no longer strange, it is no longer fascinating. It is nothing but outlandish and terroristic. It takes all Jack Nicholson can give to make these characters in anyway palatable, and even so. In the Prizzi family all other considerations than the family is outlawed, except maybe for a couple of weeks and the woman concerned by this out-breeding passing passion has to submit and take the color of the wall on which she is being pinned. If she does not then she will be executed and cut off. There is no depth in that film, no subtleties or even subtlety. Get the message, bang it down on the table and then cram it down your brain. Business is business and in-breeding is the rule. I will always wonder why a hit-woman with a reputation of efficiency and effectiveness misses her husband when he intends to kill her though she manages to shoot one bullet first. Suspend your disbelief and incredulity. The cinema is the new church of the visual dominant animal man is. To see is to believe. But at times to believe is easier when you are blind, and probably deaf too. Apart from that it is interesting even if we do spend a little bit too much time in planes going east and planes going west, kind of an airlift between New York, or whatever may titillate you, and Los Angeles, or whatever it takes to please you.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Could Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast featuring Jack Nickolson, Anjelica Huston, and Kathleen Turner among others, and with a director such as John Huston, a grade of 7/10 cannot be considered as big achievement for "Prizzi's Honor", as one would definitely expect even higher. What are the reasons for the relative under-achievement of the film?I believe that the main weakness of "Prizzi's Honor" is that it fails to compare successfully against classics of the same genre, such as the "Godfather" trilogy, "Once Upon A Time in America", and "Goodfellas". While the latter movies made you leave the theater with a strong and lasting impression imposed upon you, "Prizzi's Honor" does not have this... honor! In fact, although the movie is well-acted and directed, and the story is the typical crime/mafia type which most of us like to watch (albeit with a rather bigger dose of romance than the usual), "Prizzi's Honor" does not offer the viewer anything more than two enjoyable hours.Of course, one can retort here that two enjoyable hours is good enough. Fine with me, but as I said in the beginning of this comment, the film's specs predispose us for a 9/10 or 10/10 quality. In that sense, 7/10 leaves us with a feeling of unfullfilment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how painful it was to watch this film that actually started off promising. The first three to five minutes where the wedding ceremony is taking place and Ave Maria is playing in the background and there are a few cross dissolves looking at each main character was actually a beautiful scene and played out nicely then the actors began to talk. I wasn't to keen on seeing it anyway but I thought Jack Nicholson could change my mind and everybody always praises the work of John Houston but I think neither could do anything to make this an interesting black comedy gangster film. For one the relationship between Charlie and Irene has to be the worst I have ever seen on film as there is just no chemistry between them and you just don't believe there love for one another, it's pathetic how Houston rushed there characters and Kathleen Turner is not on very good form as is Angelica Houston. Goodness knows how she got her Oscar for this, I thought she was more convincing as Morticia Adams than she was as Prizzi's daughter.The only thing that made me watch this to the end was the great William Hickey who was just as convincing as Marlon Brando as The Don. But that is something which I didn't take kindly to, because there are a few scenes here which do take ideas and story plots from The Godfather. They are not the same but throughout the family meetings in this film then just seemed all to familiar and it all left you thinking to yourself `Have I seen this before'. I was so unimpressed that I would include it in one of the worst films I have ever seen for pathetic acting even from Nicholson who was trying to hard to be Mr Gangster, there must have been not a lot of good films that year, because this got nominated for 8 academy awards so it must have been on a shortlist. But you would think this to be a great film because of the acting talent and good director but It did nothing for me and will do nothing for those who have yet to see it. Trust me, don't waste 2 hours and 4 minutes of your life because you will never get them back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film. I had rented it a few times before and couldn't get through it, but I thought it was because of poor tape quality. So today I rented the DVD so there would be no excuses, and I thought it was an utter waste of time.This should have worked (and many of you think it did): a great cast, a legendary director, based on a popular book, but nothing clicked. The weakest link (and it kind of pains me to say this) is Huston's direction. He sets this up like a film from the 1940s, and I don't mean set in the '40s, but shot in the '40s. The acting is stilted in that "golden age" style where acting was just reading lines and being melodramatic. There are antiquated fade-outs, poor vocal dubbing -- actually horrible vocal dubbing -- and slooooow pacing (especially the wedding scene which took forever to get off the ground). The love affair between Jack and Kathleen Turner never seemed real to me, in fact, it seemed completely contrived; they meet for 10 minutes and suddenly they're saying I LOVE YOU and getting married?!?!?!?!?!?!?! What the .... ?And I couldn't agree more with some of the posts here that it just flat-out was not funny. The only time I snickered in the whole thing was in the first scene where the reporter says "Holy s--t" in church while making the sign of the cross. It was a throw-away moment, and I found it amusing, and I was looking fwd to laughing a lot more, but I didn't, not once more.If you want to see a good mob comedy (and I don't mean the neo-mob comedies like Sopranos and Analyze This, where mobsters are really sensitive inside), see MARRIED TO THE MOB. It's much funnier, and is simply much more entertaining (not to mention that it has a love story that actually works).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Huston's last movie, "Prizzi's Honor", has usually been well regarded, but it actually seems sort of slow at times. Starring Jack Nicholson as Mafia hit-man Charley Partanna in love with one Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) who turns out to also be an assassin, the movie strives to be a zany comedy but never totally achieves it. Still, there are some good parts throughout the movie. It just seems that they should have come out with more, given the talent involved. And I certainly wouldn't compare this movie to "The Godfather". Also starring Anjelica Huston (who won Best Supporting Actress), Robert Loggia and William Hickey.</fullReview>

I watched it as a straight drama, but afterward, coming to IMDb, it seems that many people, including the Golden Globe folks, have it pegged as a comedy. Yes, I did notice some ironic things going on, and the shot of the jet going back and forth, like one of the Howard Hawkes screwball comedies should perhaps have tipped me off.The production values were top-notch, direction and photography outstanding, good cast, good acting. It just seemed to have something missing. (Oh, and I did think that William Hickey was badly miscast as the Don, but since I see he received an Oscar nomination, I guess many do not agree) I gave it a totally mediocre rating. Then, on discovering that this was a (dark) comedy, I re-thought the matter. But really, if I cannot tell that it is comedic, I cannot really give much credit for it. It isn't a bad or terrible movie, but it's not really good either. You would expect so much more from this cast and director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mafia from A White Guy's Point of View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like watching Goodfellas with a bad hangover. It doesn't always make a lot of sense but you don't forget it either. Nicholson seemed like he was stoned throughout the whole thing and from what I've heard about his relationship with Anjelica Huston that's not too far off. Huston is the one bright star in an otherwise barren sky. She deserved her Oscar as she is frighteningly heartless and insidiously scheming til the camera stops rolling. The other character's don't look Italian and don't act Italian. Maybe that is because they aren't Italian. Seems logical to me. Does the Mafia kill their own family members and steal from one another? Perhaps but at least there are reasons for it albeit not good ones but these guys don't play fair with anybody. The Mafia doesn't set fire to buildings with innocent people inside them or publicly shoot their own men in broad daylight with literally hundreds of witnesses in downtown New York City. I found many things unbelievable that I couldn't get around even if I had wanted to. Especially letting a woman do killings for them that is almost completely unheard of in the Mafia I have know of one only case where that had transpired and even then only as a secondary role. I would say watch it if you want to but don't be foolish enough to assume this is how LCN families are run regardless of what city they are in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but dosen´t work as a comedy!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It dose not work as a comedy because theres no sympathic characters, only cold murders and that is not an good idea for a comedy.It´s the same thing with Pulp Fiction(even thought that one is VERY good) but theres maybe Bruce Willis good and that is maybe no comedy???? Still technical Perfect and the acting is excellent by all of the cast (a wonderful cast with stars like Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston).John Huston is one of the best American directors off all time and "Prizzi´s honor" is a cynical film that is good but dosen´t work as comedy.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm certainly not a film student by any definition, but it seems the original story, cast and director are enough to have made this a much better film.I don't know if it's the victim of a poor screenplay or direction, but it is barely 'dark', 'romantic' or 'comedic.' I found none of the characters or their motivations convincing, the action was plodding and the execution flat. It took my over a half hour to 'get into' the film, I kept asking when the comedy would begin.Wouldn't you have loved to see the Coen Bros. direct? Maybe it should be viewed as a product of it's times, but it doesn't stand up well over time.I gave it 4/10 stars because I categorize the film as a 'safe to rent when the in-laws are in town' type of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst multi-genre films you will ever come across; John Huston looses his honor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, how we have a misfire here; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since D.W. Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as 'the yellow man'; characters so unimaginative and un-engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film.Prizzi's Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible. The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character. Prizzi's Honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime ? this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no ? what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all.I'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is. Firstly, the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of MY time. Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest more than an international hit-man. He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker (Turner) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right. I read that the plot for this film is: "A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other." Well, yes that's true but that actual revelation doesn't happen until about twenty minutes to the end! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60: he walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees; he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin ? one really poorly shot assassination early on (that actually happens off screen) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied, best of the best, international hit-man.So with a main character who is un-likable and un-realistic, we move to the script. The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions: Partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again: "Do I marry her?; Do I love her? What is love? What do I do?" and it gets so repetitive, it's not even able to act as good humour. This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone: a girl called Maerose Prizzi (Huston) played by director John's daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it ? that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? Should I be laughing? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alá The Godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film. But what we get is something very, very different.The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with ? maybe the film will kick-start. I was so very wrong: with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office: this scene sums the film up. Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy. We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs ? the scene isn't even edited correctly. Some suspense, some drama: "Do I shoot or don't I?"; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late ? anything but how it was actually executed. Prizzi's Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax. It's a film where cameras reflect in windows; lights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged. Prizzi's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film-goer and don't say it was a comedy because I didn't laugh with it ? AT it is another matter. The film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unaccomplished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that strikes you in this is the total lack of rhythm. No movie on earth will make you laugh if you have time to fall asleep between scenes.The acting of Nicholson is the equivalent of a car going around with the brakes pulled. Anjelica Huston is absolutely tasteless, no flavor at all. Kathleen Turner is definitely a talented actress but she isn't passionate. She is cold. No pulse on her wrist. She even looks much older than her age. When she is together with Nicholson they seem people of the same age, yet Jack is 17 years older!The dialogs are long, very long and with never a wriggle. The story is potentially very interesting but the engine never gets started. The movie is unaccomplished. The only thing that made me laugh is the DC-8 aircraft.This movie got nominations and won an Oscar? You must be kidding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit(man) black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very solid, satisfying film that mitigates against its violence with considerable humour and a genuine romance. As a black farce about the unlikely or queerly viewed assassin there are better (subsequent) movies like Grosse Point Blank or even Leon. Neither of these have the convincing romance of Prizzi's Honour. This is a very useful facet of the film - it's as if the romance is trying to muscle in past the comedy and thriller genres from which the film is constructed and so something has to give.Nicholson gives a rather subdued performance but then he's playing a hit-man not a flamboyant mob boss. Kathleen Turner is a terrific casting decision - like all that Romancing The Stone baloney, she's a strong, comic and romantic co-lead. Robert Loggia isn't a fearsome capo but its really about his daughter, Maerose played slimily by Angelica Huston who sows the seeds of the drama. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of life's lessons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a simple lesson to be learned from Prizzi's Honor: Don't fall in love; women are evil. Jack Nicholson is great, of course, almost even playing someone other than himself. Angelica Huston and Kathleen Turner (overdrive) are good also. I can't say anything amazing about John Huston's directing, but it wasn't bad. Get plenty of sleep beforehand, or you'll end up dozing off, like I did. It's not exactly action-packed, and I'm running quite a sleep deficit. Otherwise, not bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of Jack Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is, but empathy comes at a price like all things-when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke as a mafia-hit-man(also because the part doesn't suit him one bit, him being so extroverted)and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this.Kathleen Turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde, because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes, when she opens them wide which she's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and Anjelica Huston is the absolute same(granted interesting) in everything, just like Robert Loggia. The movie is a lame draft(and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster-movie, with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster(they certainly gathered the party-going elite in this). What, did they shoot it in 1 day?-cause that would be the only explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prizzi's Honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film once before, I guess I didn't fully acknowledge it, e.e. the actress that won an Oscar, and the story, so I'm glad I watched it again, from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen). Basically Charley Partanna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Nicholson) is the professional hit-man who works closely with one of the richest crime syndicate families in the United States, the Prizzis. One day he attends the wedding of one of the members of the family, and he sees sitting in amongst the crowd of spectators Irene Walker (Golden Globe winning Kathleen Turner), and he is very eager to make her acquaintance. They do eventually have a meeting, and slowly as they have more and more they fall in love, and it is only a while later that he finds out she is a free-lance killer herself. He also finds out that the Prizzs have hired an assassin to kill the person who has double crossed the family, he is crushed to find out it is him, and that the assassin is Irene herself. But what is worse is that he has been hired to kill her as well, so both their jobs have become complicated because of their feelings towards each other. To offer some comfort along the way is the only member of the Prizzi who holds nothing against Charley at all is Maerose (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Anjelica Huston, the director's daughter), who seems innocent but is actually quite wise. Don Corrado Prizzi (Mousehunt's Oscar nominated William Hickey) obviously carries on just like Charley like nothing has changed, doing business and whatever else needs dealing with, but neither contracts can be carried out. In the end Charley and Irene decide that the only way to stop the mob killing them or whatever dastardly means is to end the relationship and part ways, going into hiding, but Charley does still keep in contact with and try to build something with Maerose. Also starring Independence Day's Robert Loggia as Eduardo Prizzi, John Randolph as Angelo 'Pop' Partanna, Lee Richardson as Dominic Prizzi, Michael Lombard as Rosario Filargi 'Finlay', Reservoir Dogs' Lawrence Tierney as Lt. Hanley and Stanley Tucci as Soldier. Nicholson does rather well as the male hit-man with quite a few things good and bad going on around him, Turner is equal as his female hit woman lover, Hickey when he is on is a good head of the mob, and I can see good reasons why Anjelica Huston won the Oscar for her interesting performance. You could call it a near film noir, it is certainly a gangster film with some moments that keep you interested, it may have confused me in some moments and I didn't fully grasp the story, but from what I remembered and could follow, a worthwhile black comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who hated this movie. I took a date to see it because the CRITICS were raving about this movie as a brilliant "dark comedy". Raving is the correct word, because I feel the CRITICS must have been MAD. It certainly was "dark" but it was NO comedy. My date and I both agreed there was nothing funny about the movie. There were no characters we liked and the idea of a Man and Wife in bed with guns at the side of their beds ready to kill one another because it was their "job" was about as funny as going to the dentist.Yet to this date I still see people claiming it is a great movie. Talk about the EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES. I just don't get it. It is nice to know that I'm not the only person who felt he/she wasted their money on this over rated movie.</fullReview>

The only comedy in this is the fact that it was nominated for an oscar. The rest of the films that year must have been utter rubbish but I recall 85 being a vintage cinema year.Definitely Nicholsons worst film(I have seen). The whole thing just didn't seem to hang right the whole sort of ineptness of the gangsters and the slow pace of events really didn't sit well with me......Re-reading this comment it seems really disjointed and doesn't flow well. Well thats because it is like Prizzi's Honor and not really worth the effort.</fullReview>
