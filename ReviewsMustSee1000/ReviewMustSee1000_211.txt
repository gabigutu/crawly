		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their "oddness". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, "Beauty and the Beast" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while "Home Alone 2" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche "You'll laugh, you'll cry" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one "Beauty and the Beast" is worth a thousand "Akira"s. And "Shrek"s. And, I'm willing to bet, "Treasure Planet"s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget "The Silence of the Lambs" - this is the real best picture of 1991.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great movie story done with wondrous animation and lovely music. the pacing was perfect, the music blended extremely well with the action, and each character was developed charmingly. the contrast between the mean but insecure beast plays very well against the lovely but bright and secure belle. the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow. except for pinocchio, I don't know any disney movie more lovely. It's a movie that appeals to children of all ages, especially adults : )enough of the "technical stuff" let's get on to my emotional attachment to the movie.I remember the first time I saw B&amp;tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry. I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps. Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, I'm swept away back to that ballroom.I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity. She is a heroine I'd love girls to emulate. She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal. She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.I've loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift. So I know my opinion is strongly biased : ) but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself. I realize it is difficult to get access to the videos or laser discs (check out the spanish version cover imdb is using in B&amp;tB's page) but it is well worth the search. The first time is most magical. I envy you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect mix of music and animation...a solid achievement...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics ("Belle's Song") which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions. Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on "Be My Guest" (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, "Beauty and the Beast". Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more "modern" style. Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Transporting Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply: love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.' And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale. When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return. And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation.  The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep. Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey. Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him: If he will release her father, she will stay in his place. The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever. And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls. With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts. There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly. A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).  The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster). There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made: As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed. And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away. It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films.  One final note: Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience. It's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cream of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic movie. We have breakthrough films like Snow White and Fantasia, and we have other greats like Aladdin and The Lion King, but this definitely tops them all. There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics. This film has emotion, incredible music and animation, characters that you admire, laugh at, and despise. This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives. The way we can identify with the characters sucks us into the story. Don't miss this classic...the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast.

		<shortDescription>Classy piece of animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time ? only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children ? but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects ? in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have won best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and possibly last animated movie to be nominated for best picture, and it should have won. This is an absolutely beautiful movie, and it makes me miss the art of hand drawn animation. Don't get me wrong Scilence of the Lambs was great movie and its really a tough choice but i think this one should have won. I hate to admit it but it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. If only Disney could get back to the likes of this film, and stop dicking around with the boring cgi movies. I hope someday we will see an animated movie win best picture, but sadly i think it will not happen, the only one in my opinion that came close was spirited away, and thats still no Beauty and the Beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney, Why Can't You Make More Movies Like This!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember watching this movie when I was very little. I did not appreciate it as much then, but now because I am older, I can cherish this blessed masterpiece. The music in this movie is one of the best film scores ever and contains the catchiest Disney tunes. Who could ever forget the ever-popular ballroom scene? This movie, in my opinion was Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's best! I also think that this is the best Disney movie made after the great Walt Disney passed away.I had the opportunity of seeing the Special Edition on IMAX. What an experience! The scenes were breathtaking to see on such a large screen. I even found the new song "Human Again" very entertaining.It's such a shame that Disney hasn't made a movie like this since "Mulan". "Beauty and the Beast" will be forever remembered as the epitome of modern-day Disney movies (and should have won the Best Picture Oscar instead of "The Silence of the Lambs"). Bravo to Disney!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is without doubt the best animated movie of all time. The artistry was perfect. I was spellbound at the animated sequences to the songs "Be Our Guest" and "Beauty and the Beast" especially. The characters were very well drawn, and because of the dark and colourful backgrounds, the film looked beautiful. The songs are fantastic. Another movie with great songs is "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"(which has the best beginning to a Disney movie). In fact, all the Alan Menken scores are brilliant, with the exception of Home On The Range, which is one of the weaker Disney efforts. My personal favourites, were the songs I just mentioned, and "Gaston" was great fun too. The incidental music was the best in any Disney movie, and that is the same with the other Menken scores. The music in the transformation of the Beast was phenomenal, as well as the animation, and reminded me of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is really frightening. Another Disney with great incidental music is "The Lion King". The story is quite simply one of the best love stories ever, and the characters are wonderful. Belle was voiced beautifully by Paige O'Hara, who has a beautiful singing voice. I love Belle, she is beautiful, clever and strong, and is one of the best Disney characters for those reasons. Gaston was made into a complex villain, and quite narcissistic(great idea Disney). When he was nasty he was quite frightening, and Richard White can really sing. Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers were really entertaining as Lumiere and Cogsworth,(I just love how witty, elegant and debonair Lumiere is) and Angela Lansbury gives a brilliant rendition of the title song. The best voice over was that of the Beast, who was very frightening, and there were some parts that were truly sensitive. Why are some people fussed about him as a human? Remember, true beauty comes from within. In conclusion, an essential to your Disney collection with a very poignant ending. 10/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film promotes the sensitive male of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This timeless fairy tale has been reworked to respond to specific gender preoccupations of the day. Disney's Beauty and the Beast addresses the contest between two types of masculinity, aggressive and gentle, targeting young boys to socialize into the new sensitive male of the 90s. The representation of femininity plays a minor part in the story.Because Disney films are targeted to a younger audience, the sexual implication of the `Beast' is replaced with a coarse, boorish and unrefined type of masculinity. This film is about the socialization of young boys, and the audience learns through textual analysis what behavior the film deems appropriate. The Beast is 11 when he is put under the spell and 21 by the time it is broken, which covers the formative years of the transition from boyhood to manhood. The most obvious lesson he has to learn is to love, and to be good enough to have that love returned. Heterosexual love sets everything right and is the definition of the manhood he has to attain. The rest of the film reads as a transcript of proper behavior, and Lumiere, the dating etiquette expert, is his teacher. The Beast is expected to find more suitable accommodations than the dungeon, walk Belle to her door, say something to fill the awkward space on the trip to her room, and invite her to dinner. As a man, he is expected to control his temper, eat in a civilized manner, and learn gentleness with the birds. In the scene depicting his table manners, Belle switches from the role of date to that of nurturing, instructive mother. Belle recognizes his effort with the spoon and compromises with him by sipping her broth from the bowl. All of the characters have a part in his instruction. Especially informative is the scene when Belle sings about how he was course and unrefined, and now he is dear to her because he is unsure. It is the self consciousness and insecurity, in eating and getting dressed in bows, that sets the Beast apart from Gaston and makes him the ideal 90s (less masculine) man. In fact he has physical prowess but he represses it, and appeals instead to Belle's mind with the library. The film reassures boys that one can be both gentle and manly. The key to winning the girl lays in his evolution; he overcomes his selfishness. The Disney film leaves no room for competing versions of masculinity. Only one would survive; the bad guy dies.Gaston and the Beast are quite similar rivals, analogous in their social worlds. Either the entire town or all of the appliances cheer their respective protagonist. Gaston is beastly as shown by his shadows, bestial shape, and pride that every last inch of him is `covered in hair.' Their fight in the tower marks the emotional high point of the film and is essentially a rivalry between two types of masculinity. The sensitive male that the audience has witnessed evolving, or the 100% pure testosterone laden Gaston who is aggressive, has a thick neck, eats to excess, is not an intellectual (he knocks over a chess table) and is a model to which all those in the village aspire to. Belle drops out of the equation entirely, as the major lesson of the film is the contest between two versions of manhood, with the sensitive male of the 90s the victor.To a lesser degree, the film is also about the new woman of the 90s. Belle is the new heroine that Disney produced, though she is just as skinny and wide eyed as the heroines before her. She does read books, but they are fairy tales and her idea of `something more than this provincial life' is prince charming. She is really not all that intellectual. She does have two physical saving scenes, when the Beast is attacked by wolves, and before he falls off the tower and she catches him. However, overshadowing Disney's attempt to create a modern, liberated woman, Belle ends up faced with a choice that is really no choice at all. She has to get married in the end whether it is to one man or another.Belle simply settles for the best type of masculinity, what she a `new woman' is looking for in a `new man.' She has little choice, since she doesn't like Gaston and she does want to get married. The lesson is that one type of masculinity not only triumphs and survives, but it also gets the girl. It is surprising that a more recent film, after the women's movement, and one self-consciously trying to create a new heroine, actually takes more power out of the female's hands then older versions of the tale. Animations oftentimes reinforces stereotypes, and the `happily ever after' genre conflicts with any real independence Belle could have shown, resulting in no choice other than marriage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pure magic. I love Disney films, especially the traditionally animated ones. I sincerely hope that does not become a lost art form.So, first point for the movie: it's French. I adore the language and the culture, so getting a smattering is a delight.Secondly, it's a classic fairytale that is also quite dark. There is much tragedy woven into to castle and its surroundings. I like best the tales that aren't overly bubbly, and this one keeps the goofiness down pretty well.Next, the heroine actually possesses some intelligence! She reads and has her own mind, and, unlike many, is flawed. It's nice that the film was taken seriously enough to have some dimension, even if it was "only" an animated movie. Plus, I really want to have her library someday.Lastly- the movie is just so beautiful! The castle and the woods were gorgeous, the ballroom was beautiful, but the best was the breathtaking scene right after Belle dumps Gaston and runs out to the field behind her house. Sheer perfection. No wonder this movie was nominated for best picture. My only wish- I would have liked to have seen some more of the Beast as Adam. He was pretty cute!Quote of the Film:- Well YOU shouldn't have been in the West Wing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is one of the greatest Disney films to ever grace audiences. A personal favorite, the story of Beauty and her growing love for the Beast is one that people have enjoyed through the years, from the theater to Broadway.I first saw Beauty and the Beast when I was a little girl, around the time that I watched the other Disney classics. And, like I did with the others, I fell in love. The stunning animation and soundtrack coupled with the captivating story kept me in my seat till the very end.This movie is thrilling, with it's message of how love can happen even if the people in question aren't incredibly beautiful. Although the idea of the Beast changing to a prince doesn't sit well with me-- Beauty fell in love with the animal, not the man-- the film is a treasure from Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Masterpiece: Disney's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast (1991): Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Richard White, Rex Everhart, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury, Jesse Corti, Bradley Pierce, Jo Anne Worley, Mary Kay Bergman, Kath Soucie Kimmy Robertson, Brian Cummings, Tony Jay, Alvin Epstein, Frank Welker, Scott Barnes, Bruce Adler, Jack Angel, Vanna Bonta....Disney entered the 1990's with "Beauty and the Beast", by far their most unabashedly romantic film and for many viewers, their all-time greatest achievement. There is so much to admire and love about this terrific film which was adored by the critics and hailed as an instant classic at the time of its release in 1991. It was so loved that it became the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The 18th century French fairy-tale is given a twist to cater to a more modern audience A selfish and heartless prince (Robby Benson) falls victim to an enchantress' curse and is transformed into a beast. His castle is bewitched and even his domestics are turned into household objects such as candelabras, clocks, feather dusters, teacups and kitchen utensils. Only the love of a woman can redeem the prince and only when she sees past the monster and into his humanity can he become human again. Enter Belle (Paige 0'Hara)the beautiful single daughter of an old and eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) who lives in a small town in rural France. Belle stands out from the other townsfolk in her fondness for books, her individuality and her intellect. Bored of provincial life, she longs for "adventure in the great wide somewhere". She's pursued by Gaston (Richard White) a hunky but vain, self-absorbed and wicked hunter who wants to marry Belle and make her his "trophy wife". When Maurice sets off to sell his new invention to a fair, he becomes lost in the woods and stumbles into the Beast's castle. Before long he becomes his prisoner. Belle comes to the rescue but in order to save her father she must replace him as the Beast's prisoner. What ensues is a "tale as old as time". Despite his monstrousness, Belle learns to see past all that and in time tames the Beast herself. Their relationship is based on respect for one another as human beings, exemplified when Beast saves Belle's life and she in turn saves his. But it's not long before the villagers discover the Beast's existence and Gaston leads a murderous mob to attack the castle. The late Broadway singer Jerry Orbach provides comic relief as Lumiere, an amorous French candelabra and David Ogden Stiers portrays the stuffy British clock Cogsworth. Broadway icon and British actress Angela Lansbury portrays the kindly voice of reason, Mrs. Potts and young Bradley Pierce portrays her son Chip. Jesse Corti plays Lefou, Gaston's awkward and goofy sidekick. These minor characters, purely there for comic relief and cuteness, not only entertains younger audiences but they are so wonderfully portrayed by the actor's voices that even adults can enjoy them. It is through voices that can act as well as sing (Paige O'Hara, Richard White, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are all Broadway singers) in harmony with a solid plot and superior animation that this film truly shines. Beauty and the Beast still ranks as Disney's all-time greatest after 16 years. In fact, Disney does not make films like this anymore, owing to the excess use of computer graphics which can often dominate the story itself. Shortly after the success of the film, a Broadway musical was made, one that is still enjoyed to this date. And this film contains many wonderful song numbers: "Belle" - a gossip song as the villagers follow Belle on her way to the bookstore, "Gaston" sung by Gaston and his drinking buddies in his honor, "Be Our Guest" as the enchanted castle's staff entertains Belle for dinner, "Something There" a duet sung by the leads as they begin to fall in love and the title song "Beauty and the Beast" sung by Mrs. Potts as the newfound friends waltz beneath an opulent chandelier. This romantic song was popularized when a young Celine Dion, not yet a major star, sang a duet with Peabo Bryson for the soundtrack. With its theme of beauty found within, a woman's courage and virtue rewarded, the movie is also a sort of women's empowerment film for girls. Belle, the first Disney princess of the 90's, is strong, resourceful and dares to be different. Far from being a damsel in distress, it is she who rescues the Beast from doom and fights the villain Gaston by firmly renouncing him as a lover. Brilliant music and songs by Alan Menken and a splendid cinematography that used stunning computer-graphic art for such scenes as the ballroom waltz, this film was ahead of its time and marked the beginning of the great Disney films of the 90's - Aladdin, Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame and others, all which used special effects made of computer graphic art. For this film, animators drew inspiration from Romantic 19th century art(Fragonard and Bouche) and from Loire Valley castles. Animators also drew from Cocteau's 1946 live-action version. The look of this film, the attention to detail, is a real winner and it's a pity that Disney does not return to pure animation. For me, this is the zenith of Disney animation and a representation of classic Disney at its best in the 1990's. This is a wonderful film for both young and old and looks as great as it ever did, thanks to restorations as seen on the new DVD version, where you can enjoy seeing how the film was made and scenes that were never part of the original theatrical release. Enjoy this romantic classic today with a date or with the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as old as time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This animated masterpiece is and will always stay one of the best romantic movies ever created.This is one of those rare movies in which everything comes perfectly together. The characters, the music, the humor, the pace, the story everything in this movie is just perfect. It's a highly memorable movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.The movie is beautifully animated and it features some of the best Disney characters. Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere and of course Belle and the Beast are highly memorable and very well constructed characters. Also the villain role Gaston which is always one of the most important elements of a Disney movie is a good one. However the villain isn't as prominent to the story as in most other Disney animated movies is the case. This movie truly is about love and the beauty inside. The movie its love story is nicely supported by the very good songs composed by Alan Menken and with lyrics by Howard Ashman. Unfortunately this was Howard Ashman's last project and he died before he could receive his well deserved Oscar for this movie. Unique fact is that this movie was also even nominated for the 'Best Picture' Oscar. Something that was really well deserved by the way. The story is quite 'mature' but also there is still plenty to enjoy for the little one's here. The movie is filled with lots of humor and imaginative characters. The movie is told in very good quick pace and features some of the best editing I have ever seen in an animated movie.The voice cast consists out of some good actors; Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach are especially perfect for their roles.The movie features some unforgettable classic moments and is a milestone in animated movie making. An highly recommendable animated romantic movie that shall always remain one of the best romantic movies ever made. This movie is recommendable to everyone, even those who normally don't like romantic stories and movies, thrust me, you'll love this movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other Disney movie in my oppinion, except for some of the classics from fifty years ago can compare to Beauty and the Beast. Disney hasn't made any good movies really in the past fifteen years except this. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disey, Musicals, or movies at all. It is a true classic!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast tells the story of Belle, an unusual but beautiful girl, who goes in search of her inventor father and comes across a mysterious castle. She enters the castle in search of her father, to discover it is occupied by a beast. She becomes his prisoner. The beast is loveless and thankless, but she soon begins to fall in love with him, and he with her. The film's end is happy, satisfying, and inspiring, showing what the power of love can do.Beauty and the Beast is a charming story of love and magic. It features lovely music. Songs like "Beauty and the Beast", "Be Our Guest", and "Belle" are catchy and fun to listen to. It features first-class characters: the quirky Belle; Gaston, the hateful attractive villain; the Beast, a character one can't help but feels sorry for; the enchanted objects - Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, and Lumiere, characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie. Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation. It isn't hard to tell all the talent, the sweat, and the heart that was put in this film. The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.Beauty and the Beast is great in another aspect: it's ageless. Although it appears to be a children-oriented film, it doesn't take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing. It's a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.When I first saw Beauty and the Beast, I fell in love with it. It's a beautiful tale, an engaging musical, and wonderful fable of romance. One of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years, it will go down in history with other beautiful Disney masterpieces, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Cinderella.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's most beautiful movie and my all-time favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dunno about you, but this flick is without a doubt one of Disney's best and their most beautiful movies, which makes it my all-time favorite. The characters are very well-developed and have multiple dimensions to their personalities, not to mention particularly different to the typical Disney character. Belle's wanting to escape her life to see the world(which is the reason why, amongst other things, she is my all-time favorite Disney princess) and hate for Gaston, the best-looking guy in town, Gaston's vanity and lust for Belle's hand in marriage, and Beast's evolution in his hate for Belle to his love for her, which she experiences too, helped make this movie the beautiful masterpiece it is.The music, which was by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, is without a doubt the some of the best music Disney has made. From the eerie, yet beautiful twinkling of the "Prologue", the introduction of Belle and Gaston's personalities and wants in "Belle", the the get-up-and-dance fun of the musical extravaganza "Be Our Guest", and the simply magnificent "Beauty and the Beast", amongst the other songs of the film, work together to push the story forward, express characters' inner-most thoughts and feelings, and are just plain entertaining. Menken's scores too were quite beautiful, especially the "Transformation" score, which conveys extremely well a range of emotions, from Beast's dying to the triumphant finale.And what would this movie be without the animation? The sweeping of the camera to Belle and Beast dancing in the ballroom during "Beauty and the Beast", which gives me the chills every time, to the ominous darkness of Belle's trek into the forbidden West Wing, along side with the music, make it a treat for both the eyes and the ears.All in all, the movie is a pure masterpiece in many ways and forms and it clearly deserved all the awards and nominations it received, including the nomination for the Best Picture Oscar. This is a movie all Disney fans should watch and I guarantee you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to "the desktop is mightier than the pencil." There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this "tale as old as time" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.The main part of what makes Beauty and the Beast such a brilliant film is the fact that the relationship between the two title characters doesn't feel artificial or one-dimensional, even though they're drawn on paper. Unlike other famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast feels quite realistic in its definition of love. The story breaks all conventions by not going the "love at first sight" route and letting the romance progress at a reasonable pace. Belle also proves to be the most interesting Disney heroine, as she doesn't fit the norm of typical princesses like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Unlike the aforementioned characters, Belle is not bland, but actually as a personality. She defines individuality and seeks to do more than just marry a prince. Her annoyance at Gaston is not only humorous, but also shows that her ideas of romance don't consist of "a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife, massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs... we'll have six or seven," as Gaston puts it. The Beast is also a rather stubborn, but loving personality. Despite his tough exterior is a nice person at heart which Belle begins to realise the more into the relationship they enter.Adding to the brilliance of the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast are the songs from Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Although both did terrific work on The Little Mermaid and their cult musical Little Shop of Horrors, the music in Beauty and the Beast stands as their best. The title theme song is quite possibly one of the most romantic songs ever written, combining beautiful lyrics with a very memorable melody. This song enhances the film's famous ballroom scene to ever impressive heights, already helped by the breathtaking animation in the sequence. "Beauty and the Beast" was not written as just a way to sell soundtracks and win Oscars. It adds another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other. It is both moving and deep. The other songs provided by the team also contribute wonderfully to the film, from a show-stopping Broadway number called "Be Our Guest" to the very funny ode to "Gaston." They're bursting with energy and humour made even more poignant by the fact they would feature the last lyrics written by Ashman (who had also already contributed some work to Aladdin). It's a brilliant way to end his career and the end credits homage him perfectly: "To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)"Probably one of the most important ingredients that make Beauty and the Beast such a success is the startling animation. The animators at Disney did a terrific job at making everything absolutely perfect, from the character designs to the sets. Each character has their feel, whether comedic or dramatic, and the animators allow them to breath, seamlessly combining the actor's voice to the moving drawings. The sets are also worthy of mention, particularly the look of the Beast's castle. The Gothic castle is drawn and painted beautifully from top to behind, so much so you're forgetting you're watching an animated film. The film is bright and colourful, but also dark and dreary when necessary. As mentioned before, the ballroom sequence combines Menken and Ashman's music with the animation flawlessly, giving a completely magical feel to it. When computers are brought into the scene, it seams in perfectly, not feeling distracted in the least. Beauty and the Beast most certainly stands as Disney animation at its finest.Some of the best animated films in the world have come from the Walt Disney studios and Beauty and the Beast is deservedly one of their crown jewels. At the film's release, it was honoured with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, a rare feat for an animated film. It proves that like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Movies, Just for Kids?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iv'e heard the comment before and I definitely would never believe it.Classic Disney Films have a certain unbeatable magic that gives you such an emotional feeling if your like me, and I would never say that these movies are just for children.Think about it about 75% of Classic Disney movies (im not talking about the emperor's new groove, Hercules, etc) I'm talking about Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Alladin, The Lion King, Bambi, Snow white, The little Mermaid, and Pochahontas, are all romances (or have a portion of romantic moments.When I was little I loved those movies so much (I grew up a Disney baby I'm now 13) because they were colorful, bright, happy, fun, and magical, but somehow they mean even more to me to this day.Beauty and the Beast has definitely become my favorite Disney film (I also love Aladdin, the lion king, Bambi and the others I mentioned VERY much).It's easy for me to understand now and there's something about Disney that now means so much more to me.It's not just about fairytale princesses and fun animated little objects, Beauty and the Beast is a beautiful tale of romance and acceptance.Showing you that love comes from the heart, not the eyes.I cry every time I watch it because the significance has an amazing effect on me and my entire family.This movie (and many other classic Disney productions) is a masterpiece and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool, this movie is beautiful, original, and very heartwarming so anyone that says Disney films are for children can't appreciate the message they really send out, just because they're animations and not some sick bloody gross-out horror movie or crude sexual comedy or blow up action film, it doesn't make them childish.It makes them meaningful by their stories not their appearance, just like the whole theme of Beauty and the Beast ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast!!! Best Animated movie ever done!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is truly the best animated movie of all time. Tonight I watched again after 4 or 5 years and it just opened my eyes. If all of my brothers weren't watching it with me I would have cried so much. The story is incredible, but what really makes this movie so wonderful and beautiful is the music. The songs are great, especially " Beauty and the Beast", Alan Menken did a great job on this movie( Songs and score). I'm very happy that it won 2 Oscars, and got nominated for best picture, I think it should have won. Beauty and the Beast is a movie for all ages, it will make you happy when you're child, and make you cry when you're older. In conclusion, I believe that this movie is one of the greatest ever made and I'm surprised it's not in IMDb's top 250 'cause it really should be, anyway, to all of you who still didn't get the chance to see it or thought that it was to silly and childish, believe me it's not, it's a true masterpiece. I love it!!! And I know you will. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful love story ever told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'' The Beauty and The Beast'' is one of the greatest stories ever told and one of the best movies from Disney that I watched in my life. I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books. Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father. She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom. But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.This story is very inspiring and very beautiful! =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as Old as Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is undoubtedly one of the best animated movies ever created. It is magical, enchanting, and moving in a way only classics are. We learn in the prologue that a selfish and unkind prince was cursed to be a beast. If he can learn to love and be loved in return, he will return to his original form. Belle is a smart, kind, and brave young woman living in a nearby town. She spends her days reading and rejecting advances from the local lout Gaston. When Belle's father gets lost one night, he wanders into the Beast's castle. The Beast accuses him of trespassing and throws him in the dungeon. Belle sets out to save her father and strikes up a deal with the Beast: if he lets her father go, she will stay in his place. The Beast and his servants, who have been turned into household objects, see Belle's arrival as a chance to finally break the spell. However, the Beast must first learn to be a gentleman. It's hard to describe how good this movie is. The songs, story, and characters all come together so perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Belle after All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty &amp; the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a "tale as old as time" ? they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating "she's the one" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and "sidekicks" and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, fun?this movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney "We Want Even More of Your Dollars" way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words ? trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star rating?the movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat &amp; tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain &amp; snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain &amp; snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film ? though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty &amp; the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty &amp; the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that ? it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Beauty and the Beast about 25 times. I own it on DVD, and Blu-ray. I still own my old video copy of it. I am obsessed with Disney and Beauty and the Beast is my favorite animated Disney film and it is my favorite Disney film of all time. I have seen the stage version at Hollywood studios and I've seen the Broadway version. I love everything about the film except the villain Gaston. Gaston is one of the most vile villains ever to appear in a movie. He is one of the only Disney villains that I hate. I like the Beauty and the Beast was romantic, funny, full of adventure and drama and I think it is the saddest movie I have ever seen. I always cry at the end. Beauty and the Beast is the most romantic film ever made, it is my favorite musical of all time and one of my most favorite films. The Beast was mean and resentful at first but it was his fault that he was this way. He was miserable and wanted everyone else to be too. He turns out to be charming and funny, sweet and romantic. One of the best scenes is when he gives Belle his library. I love when Belle and the Beast dance to the title song. The battle between the Beast and Gaston was another great scene. I also love when Belle tends to his wounds after he saves her from the wolves. My favorite character is the Beast, but I also love Belle, Mrs. Potts, and Lumiere. I hate Gaston but his theme song is good and The Mob song is a well-written hate song. He only wanted to kill the Beast because he had a rival for Belle'a affections. At the end he completely deserved to die. My favorite songs are Beauty and the Beast, Be our Guest and Something there. Beauty and the Beast had an amazing cast. Robby Benson, Paige o'Hara, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Steirs, Tony Jay,and Bradley Pierce all did a wonderful job. I'v always loved Angela Lansbury mostly because of her being Mrs. Potts. I like Beast so much that I even like Beauty and the Beast 2-the enchanted Christmas. I may own the movie but I plan on seeing the 3d version. I could debate with anyone who does not love Beauty and the Beast. It is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and I think it is the best animated film I have ever seen or will ever see. On IMDb I give it ten stars but in reality I give it 170 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Cartoon Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words fail me as I try to express my feelings about Beauty and the Beast, the best cartoon movie ever made! Praise is all that I can find for it and anything that I or any fan writes about it simply cannot do justice to this tour-de-force of top-class animation and elegant story-telling.Beauty and the Beast marks one of the first and best uses of digital animation for the range of human emotions that it captures. Even today, there is no sequence as memorable as the ballroom sequence where Belle and the Beast dance to the strains of the title tune. Speaking of tunes, no mention of this movie's artistic merits is ever complete without a mention of the songs. The lyrics written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are absolutely poetic (Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme) and the voicing of the songs by Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and others is simply incredible!The two best song sequences in the movie are 'Be My Guest' and 'Tale as old as time'. The script is excellent taking the old but fairly well-known fable and developing it into something modern yet touching and poignant. The new innovations of the scriptwriters to the original story such as putting a feminist touch on Belle, the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, the talking cutlery are fully fleshed out and have been integrated into the pace, moving the story forward and never slowing it down. The characters are sharply developed. Belle is a vibrant bookish girl who lives in a world of fairy tales, yet dearly loves her wacky but likable inventor father. Also it is worth mentioning that she is shown to have an individualistic bent of mind who sees the handsome but shallow Gaston for what he is and spurns his advances. She has the spunk to wear the type of clothes and act the way she wants unlike the other dumb village girls.At first she fears the Beast, but when he saves her she appreciates him and finds the prince within the Beast. She is intelligent, compassionate and has a mind of her own. She's also very outspoken and courageous as is evidenced by her opting to take her father's place in the Beast's castle and in her tirade of reason against the Beast when he rebukes her for putting herself into danger by trying to run away from the castle. With her strong personality, she makes a terrific role model for young girls everywhere. Long before Titanic, this was the first successful attempt at female empowerment. The Beast is a fierce ape-like creature whose short temper stems from his frustration at being unable to find true love. Gaston the narcissistic village champion who thinks that brawns are more important than brains is ridiculed by the movie and eventually exposed as its villain. Even minor supporting characters such as the clock, the lamp and the teapot are fleshed out and will enchant both kids and adults alike.I actually started crying during the movie's finale when the Beast dies after the struggle with Gaston and my sorrow was turned into joy when the curse is broken and the Beast gets transformed into a handsome prince. The transformation effects are simply mind-blowing (for a cartoon movie!).Some eighteen years after its release this movie only gets better with time. Cynics who normally dismiss cartoons and G-rated fare should see this movie and experience a change of heart. If this movie does not move them, then they should go admit themselves into a morgue!My Grade:A+!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow,this is amazing,and one of the best Disney's movies.I believe Beauty and the beast,Pocahontas and The little mermaid are the peak of all of the Disney's movies.how great it shows love,humanity,abomination and so on. And the songs are just wonderful,specially "Beauty and the beast".when this movie was made I was just 2 years old,when I watched this movie I was only 10 and now I'm 18 but still count it as my favorite movie. and this is the best dialog of the movie: Cogsworth: Well Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly. I knew you had it in you, ha ha! Beast: I let her go. Cogsworth: Yes, yes, - You... what? How could you do that? Beast: I had to. Cogsworth: Yes, but, but... but... why? Beast: Because... I love her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Frightening, and Powerful....Oscar Worthy In Every Way....You Too Will Fall Instantly Under The Spell Of This Beautiful Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Disney's greatest achievement. From the first shot of the castle right on to the end view of the stain glass window it is funny, frightening, and powerful. Every shot is even more enchanting and fantastic than the last. Walt Disney would be very proud of this film.Howard Ashman and Alan Menken have done what most composers can only dream of. To create a "script" in every lyric and every note that is heard. This film is nothing short of spectacular.Every voice is flawless. Robby Benson in particular reminds us all that you do not have to be in front of the camera to give off a believable and touching performance.The film is Oscar worthy in every way. The viewer would be well advised to bring a box of tissues during some of the films more tender moments. The ballroom scene is an example of how seamless the animation really is. Other tearjerker moments include a fight between Belle and The Beast which ends with the Beast leaving the protection of his castle to rescue the one who could break the spell from a pack of savagely monstrous wolves, the transformation of a monster into a man, and a dedication to the late Howard Ashman. You too will fall instantly under the spell of this beautiful story. If there is ever anything you will miss out on don't let this movie be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living the fairy tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the commentator who mentioned that we should "live the fairy tale" because Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that teaches the viewer not to judge a book by its cover. This movie is my favorite movie of all time because so much of it applies to myself. I am very much a bookworm, and I used to keep to myself a lot. Eventually, I met my prince and am now living happily ever after. I hope that everyone can live this way or live the fairy tale. A lot of Belle's attributes are worthy of praise: intelligence, kindness and bravery. At a young age, I was taught to value these characteristics and to incorporate them into my own personality. It is probably these three attributes that my friends like about me, therefore Belle is an excellent example of a role model, especially for young girls. She also teaches everyone, and not just children, that perserverence pays off in the end with love and happiness. The objects/servants are a colorful lot, much like your friends, family and everyday acquaintances. They add color and meaning to your life and offer humor: the best medicine. Overall, the scenery and the animation are incredible. I especially loved the details in the castle! It is no surprise that the movie was nominated for an Academy award. 10 stars out of 10 =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Perfect Animated Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour. Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.Unlike many animated Disney movies where a song may be thrown in here and there, and do little to move the story along, each song here is directly related to the story line, moves the movie along, and leaves us anticipating the next big number. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman deserve every bit of the praise they received for this film, and then some.All the characters in this film are so well animated and voiced, you never once think about the fact that you are watching an animated movie, as is often the case. From the town that Belle lives in, to the Beast castle, the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in detail, and vibrant alive colors. In 1991, this was a ground breaking, animated film, and over ten years later, as much as I enjoy many of the new computer animated movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, none has come close to the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast, which mixes romance, music, comedy and drama, in a perfect blend that may never be seen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality. Hasn't everyone, at some time, felt like a hideous beast hungry for someone to love us as we are and in doing so, transform us into something beautiful?The film itself more than delivered. Belle was the first Disney heroine who wasn't either boy-crazy or a doormat/victim. She has brains, heart, and above all, character. The Beast's transformation from monster to hero is believable and poignant. In a world where possessiveness has become the norm (witness the selfish custody battles of birth parents tearing children from the only homes they've ever known), the Beast's heart-wrenching insistence that he had to let Belle leave because he loves her is a breath of fresh air.The music is perfection, the animation astonishing. Together they raise filmmaking of any kind to new challenges. The ballroom scene is heartbreakingly beautiful.If you've been in a coma for ten years or have some other excuse for never having seen this gem of a movie, correct that omission as soon as possible. And have a hankie nearby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only second to "The Little Mermaid" on my list of favorite Disney classics, I have been captivated by "Beauty" ever since seeing it in the movies in 1992 (I was 7). The film combines the best of Disney: stunning visuals, appealing characters, great music and a timeless story. The first thing you notice about B&amp;B is the gorgeous artwork - the film opens with an eye-popping shot of a forest and remains a visual delight throughout its 90 minute run-time. B&amp;B includes some of the best Disney songs as well, most notably "Belle", "Something There" and the title song. I own the soundtrack and the score is just as good ("The West Wing" and "Transformation" being my favorites). I also think Belle and the beast make a great couple. There's chemistry between them and their romance doesn't feel forced, but natural and genuine. I was very pleased with my 1993 LaserDisc so I was quite hesitant to obtain the blu ray, fearing it would ruin my enjoyment from the film (wasn't too familiar with the format just 2 years ago). Gladly, I was wrong and the film looks breathtaking in HD (although I do reduce the saturation, given the colors are a little too garish to my taste). Now we just have to wait for my other favorite Disney classic to arrive on Blu Ray, The Little Mermaid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney movies in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story goes something like this: A prince is cruel, and rejects an old woman's rose in return for shelter. She's really an enchantress. She turns him into a beast, and placed a magic spell on everything and everyone in the castle. He then secludes himself in his home, with a magic mirror as the only view to outside the castle. The rose will bloom until he turns 21--pretty young for a prince, eh? He needed a girl to fall in love with, and get her to love him back, then it would be all good. And if not, he's doomed to stay as a beast forever and ever. The narration--by David Ogden Stiers, who plays Cogsworth--was great, and really like "...for who could ever learn to love a beast?" The next scene, we meet a young girl named Belle, a very beautiful but very odd girl, because she always likes to read, and is somewhat of an outcast, like her father, Maurice. The song 'Belle', which is a great song, really shows how much she's different from everyone else, and that she wants more out of life than just her small, poor French town. And really, don't we all want more out of life? A man, Gaston, the town 'hunk', wants to woo Belle, while his oddball sidekick, Lefou, doesn't think that she's the best of the best, as opposed to Gaston. Belle knows that he's handsome, but 'rude and conceited' as well, and not for her. As she gets home to help Maurice, who's working on what could possibly the weirdest machine made to chop wood. At least it works, and he takes it to the fair.He and his horse Philippe trot off to the fair, but they get lost. Men and their direction skills. That last statement was just a stereotypical thing, because we see it happen often. So they take the dark, gloomy road that Maurice wants to go, rather than the safe, light road that Philippe wants to take. Maurice should've listened to the horse. But of course, then there would be no story. Maurice then realizes that it's not right, and as usual, blames Philippe for it, because no one wants to take the blame for something that they did wrong. They get chased by a pack of wolves, Philippe gets away, and Maurice ends up in the castle where the Beast lives, but he doesn't know that. When he gets in, we get introduced to Cogsworth and Lumiere, the clock and candelabra, who are pretty much opposites, and Lumiere's welcome eventually wins over Cogsworth's attitude to get Maurice out. Lumiere makes him comfortable and Mrs. Potts and Chip, a teapot and teacup, serve him tea, and then the scary part comes. Enter the Beast. Maurice gets taken to a prison.The next day, Gaston tries to get Belle to marry him, but our heroine knows better, and works a way to get him out, and she finds Philippe, who amazingly tells Belle in some form or way that Maurice is gone. They try to find him, and immediately Philippe wants to leave, but Belle keeps him steady. She goes inside the castle to find him. As she searches, the servants in the castle see her, thinking that she's the one who can break the spell. Lumiere and Cogsworth try to remain inconspicuous, and Belle finds her father, and the Beast finds them. Belle then makes the sacrifice of her life: she takes her father's place, and promises to stay forever, after seeing the Beast. She feels terrible and without a goodbye, Maurice is taken back to the village. Belle is told that she can go anywhere in the castle except the west wing, because it's forbidden. She is told that she must join the Beast for dinner that night. She then finds out that everything is enchanted,and she is stunned. She decides she's not going to go to dinner. After finding out she's not coming down, the feud between the two of them grows. When Belle comes down to eat, Lumiere starts to sing 'Be Our Guest', and it is entertaining! After the number, Belle is taken by Lumiere and Cogsworth for a tour and Belle stumbles upon the stairs that lead to the west wing. She tricks them into taking themselves to the library, and ventures into the forbidden zone. She sees some peculiar things, but she then sees the most intriguing object of all: the rose. She wants to touch it, but is caught by the Beast, who scares her away from the castle. The Beast saves her from death by wolves.The Beast and Belle dance with Mrs. Potts singing 'Beauty and the Beast', and it makes their bond so much better. Belle realizes that her father is sick, and the Beast releases her, because he loves her. The town find out about the Beast, and try to kill him. The servants fight back, in a hilarious battle, while Gaston goes in for the Beast. The Beast and Gaston fight each other, and Belle returns for the Beast, but right as they reach for each other, Gaston stabs the Beast, but then karma gets back at him and he falls to his doom. Belle tries to keep the Beast with her, but it seems too late. She whispers to him, "I love you," right before the last pedal falls. The spell is broken, just in time. Sparks fall from the sky, and the Beast resumes his original form, and they kiss. The castle returns to normal, and it's all good.Deserved the Best Picture nomination and it is one of the best Disney movies in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CONTAINS PLOT REFERENCES AND SOME SPOILERS**Before approaching Beauty and the Beast it is worth mentioning that this is a movie which Disney himself had always intended to make before his death. The finished product I should imagine would fail to disappoint even he himself the most intimidating of perfectionists.What separates this particular Disney offering from the usual litany of animated boy meets girl stories previously is the particularly deft and mature characterisation. We have always come to expect charming and technically leading animation from Disney, but the characters themselves are what sets this movie apart as a jewel in the studio's crown.Belle is a truly contemporary and cerebral heroine, beset by a life that offers little to her aspiring imagination and intelligence. The small village in which she lives with her father seems to be a place in which she does not fit. She is looked upon as a crank because her passion is reading. Her father is viewed as insane because of his quirky inventions.Beast is by far the most deep and complex Disney character to date. He is not a perfect prince, far from it- but rather a fallen man, and the product of his own misfortune. Filled with bitterness and cynicism, he exists in a damned world of his own creation and must endure the limbo that surrounds him as a result of his selfish choices in life. Pride has led to his great fall and hope has deserted him. From the outside the viewer feels the plight of both of the lead characters and it is a joy to watch both characters come together, not in the usual Disney formula of a magic kiss, but a real relationship with real pitfalls and real emotional challenges.We witness lonely bookworm Belle finding that books can not be judged by their cover, finding a true friend for the first time in her life, and ultimately true love. Beast's gradual redemption ensues and he discovers the error of his ways, and abandons his defences and even his sense of self in order to truly love Belle.The music delights and the animation charms with a surrounding plethora of delightful supporting characters which appeal to both children and adults alike. Villain and all round sexist boor Gaston adds some comic relief and grotesque cave-man charm in his desire for Belle whom he views as another beautiful hunting trophy for the wall of his lodge.The musical aspect of the movie is astoundingly well written and performed. Each song lends something unique to the movie as a whole without detracting or seeming unintuitive to the storyline.One of the most charming things about this movie is that its French origins have not been eliminated by Disney, but incorporated into a colourful backdrop for a story that will stand the test of time.This movie has so many personal high points for me that I wish I could mention them all. It contains one of the greatest pieces of animation I have ever seen in the Beast's transformation at the end of the film. Beast emerges from his seeming demise magically and changes to his staggeringly beautiful human form almost resembling Michaelangelo's David emerging from the marble. This ending is a fitting climax to a great work of both animation and storytelling.In conclusion this is an unmissable slice of classic animation, served up so beautifully that future generations will keep coming back for more. Beauty and the Beast was well deserving of it's Best Picture nomination, for here at last is a Disney story which will stand the test of time and melt the heart of even the most cynical beast.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beast Got Gypped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So in Beauty &amp; The Beast, the Prince is offered a magic rose by a haggard old witch in return for some shelter for the night. The Prince says no and he is turned into a Beast (surprise!) as punishment for his selfish and shallow nature, and the curse will only be lifted if he can get someone to love him before the last rose petal wilts on his 21st birthday.But lets take a closer look at this, shall we?Right at the very end of the film, the last petal falls, and since the film only takes place over a couple of days (thanks to one of the most economical scripts I've ever seen), and the curse has been on the Prince and his servants for 10 years (as Lumiere sings in 'Be Our Guest' ? "Ten years we've been rusting"), I think there is only one thing to take from all this:The Prince was only TEN YEARS OLD when the curse was put on him!No wonder he was scared of the "old beggar woman" who came to his castle. He's ten years old, all alone on a dark stormy night, his parents are nowhere to be found, clearly his servants are neglecting him as well as he had to answer the door himself, and he confronted with a hideous old crone. What ten year old wouldn't be scared by that?!And then he has to find love as a beast when he wasn't even old enough to have had a chance to develop any understanding of love as a human! No wonder he's been so angry all these years.Think about that next time you watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie for the whole family. I was already in Junior High when this came out but it quickly became one of my favorites. Even now with children of my own I love to pull this movie out and sit down with them to watch it.It starts out with beautiful scenery and wonderful singing. You will follow the life of an ordinary girl named Belle who has a love for reading. She lives alone with her father who is a but odd with his inventions and solitary lifestyle. He goes off to show his invention, he gets lost, finds a castle in the woods and lets himself in. Once inside he meets the enchanted occupants. Then the story really starts. The Beast discovers he has an unannounced visitor and thinks he is there torment him. So the father gets thrown in the tower.Belle has an unwelcoming admirer, the town bully. He tries to woo her, unsuccessfully. She runs out to the field to escape him and finds her fathers riderless horse barreling down on her. She then travels to the woods in search of her father.When she finds him at the castle she trades her life for his and the Beast releases her father and keeps her. Then the story begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's Beauty and the Beast is still the most enchanted of their animated fairy tales</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just rewatched Beauty and the Beast with my movie theatre-working friend at where he works. This was actually my first time seeing it on the big screen and in 3-D, to boot! What can I say except after 20 years, it's still one of the most wonderful of the animated Disney fairy tales to be depicted in movies. No wonder it was the first of its kind to be nominated an Oscar for Best Picture. And the songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman like "Belle", "Be Our Guest", and the title song were also worthy of the nominations with the last one deserving of the win. And those voices, ah, what voices! I mean, Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts) just make the picture perfect with their line readings and singing. The last one, especially, when singing the already mentioned title song which would also be lovingly rendered by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson during the end credits. Really, all I'll say now is Beauty and the Beast gets a very high recommendation from me. P.S. I also loved the dedication at the very end "To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3-D Re-Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally have a legitimate excuse to review this movie. One of the great ones. One of the greatest animated masterpieces of all time. There's no real reason to hate on this movie; it really is a gem. It's been talked about to death that all I can hope to do is bring my own opinion to the table.The story is still good. It's perfectly paced and excellently executed. The best scenes involve Belle and the Beast falling in love. One of the best elements in the movie is the romance. Unlike most Disney romances where the couple meets, falls in love, and gets married a few days later, Beauty and the Beast takes its time. You never know how long it takes the couple to fall in love; it could be weeks, maybe even months, so its open for debate and allows the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions. The characters are still memorable. Belle is beautiful (duh, the title tells you that), but she never flaunts it. She is constantly taunted and mocked, but does she care? No. On top of that, she's smart, kind, and anything else you look for in a Disney princess. The Beast is drawn great and you do believe he's evolved throughout the course of the film. Gaston is one of the best villains of all time. I love how egocentric he is, and when he doesn't get his way, he becomes this vengeful, hateful person. His transformation is just as believable as the Beasts.The side characters...do I need to say anything about these guys? You all remember the quick-witted Lumi?re, the snobby Cogsworth, the gentle Ms. Potts, and the hilariously stupid LeFou. They're all memorable and I don't need to say anymore about them.I guess I'll talk about the things that I don't like about the film. The first thing is the design of the human version of the Beast, or as Disney so persistently calls him, Adam. It looks goofy and unlike Disney males of the past. Adam looks very out of place, but that's just nit-picking. The 3-D is another gripe I have with the movie. I did not want to see the movie in 3-D, not because it's not a good film, but because I own the movie. Why would I want to pay $13.50 for a ticket when I could pop it into my DVD player FOR FREE? But, after the 3-D Re-release of the Lion King, everyone began to praise the 3-D animation. So, I spent the money on the ticket, and within the first 5 minutes of the film, I regretted it. The 3-D isn't a cheap conversion like The Last Airbender or Clash of the Titans, as I am told that Disney put a lot of money into re-releasing the movie in 3-D. But still, the movie is so clearly NOT shot in 3-D that it just doesn't look good. The opening shot in the forest looked great, but that's it.Final verdict: Though I don't think the movie is worth seeing in 3-D, still take your kids to see it. The animation, the characters, the story, and the music is perfect. It's a better alternative than something like The Smurfs. Raise your children on stuff like this, parents of America. I hear some theaters show the 2-D version, and by all means, go see that. For the problems I have with the 3-D, I won't deny that it was great seeing this film on the big screen. Do yourself a favor this weekend and go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all-time favourite animated movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is probably the closest to perfection of any film I've ever seen. It's such a beautiful love story, full of suspense, humour and emotion. The animation, as usual with Disney, is stunning. Every frame of the movie has very detailed, beautiful artwork. Special mention goes to the animation of Ms. Pots, Lumiere, Cogswarth, Chip and all the other objects who manage to move naturally without any limbs. And of course there's the Beast, who starts out very menacing and scary and gradually becomes more and more human by his posture and facial expression. The voice actors also have exceptional talent. The actress who plays Belle has a very nice voice and is a great singer. Gaston has very deep, manly voice that suits his character perfectly. But if there was an Oscar for best voice-over performance, it would go to the Beast. He gibes such a powerful, tortured performance, that I really wish I looked up his name before writing this. And also usual with any Disney movie, the songs are ridiculously catchy. I especially love that fun, energetic song about Gaston, and the very beautiful title song "Beauty and the Beast." The latter song is sung during a very beautiful sequence where Belle and the Beast are dancing in a CGI room. The CGI maybe dated, but it's still a timeless scene. Another thing Disney also does greatly is mixing romance, comedy and suspense. The movie has lots of funny scenes, especially the parts with Cogsworth and Lumiere, but there are also very intense scenes that will keep you in suspense, like the exciting climax. And of course there are a couple scenes that will have you reaching for the tissues.With interesting characters, catchy songs, nail biting suspense, a beautiful love story and stunning animation, I recommend this masterpiece to just about everybody who watches movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epic love story ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Mrs Potts rightly sings- "Tale as old as time", the story of 'Beauty and the Beast' lives on forever and ever. Never, ever in my life, in my opinion, have I ever seen a film with such complex themes, with such a message to keep the audience thinking and such depth to its story. Of course and rightly Disney has presented this film beautifully and poetically, so all the audience, who have seen the film from old to young, will understand the message and directed by Gary Trousdale, he shows this amazingly.When a selfish prince is turned into a he is hideous beast by a beautiful enchantress, disguised as a beggar women, he is forced to be confined to his castle, along with his faithful servants, who have been turned into common house-hold objects. The only thing with him is a single rose, which will bloom until his twenty first birthday. Until then, if he doesn't find true love, then he is doomed to remain a beast forever. However, there is little hope, when a lovely young woman comes, looking for her father, who is kept hostage in the castle she seems to be the solution and the one to break the dreaded curse. "For who could ever love a beast?" Disney really delivers the message of never judging anyone, simply in this fairy tale, in which everyone can keep in their hearts. With characters with such depth, 'Beauty and the Beast' never fails to entice the audience, with the theme of love, finding what really matters and looking deep to what really matters.With the best actors, providing the voice for the characters including Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston, Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice). With Mrs Potts singing the legendary title song, we see the Beast becoming the man that he has hidden all those years.Overall, I cannot stress how much this film touches everyone's hearts. A must see to see... again and again and again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly a wonder to behold. An excellent film in every aspect. For me, this is the only Disney movie in which the music is comparable to that in "The Little Mermaid". Visually, "Beauty" is a great example of how CGI can complement hand-drawn artwork without taking over it, like in later Disney films (most notably "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" and "Tarzan"). The ballroom sequence was truly groundbreaking but that's about the only "computerized" part in the film, thankfully. Belle herself is a fantastic heroine, one who dreams of adventure and not about a lover. I don't see why so many people were let down by the prince in his human form. I thought he was done very well. "Beauty and the Beast" is definitely up there with "The Little Mermaid".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film captures the true essence of what animation should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the time we could walk we would all hear about films such as The Little Mermaid or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and how they changed film-making forever. These films helped bring animation to life (Snow White being the first animated film and The Little Mermaid reviving the genre after it had almost died) while there are films which keep it alive. Beauty and the Beast is one of (if not) the best work of animation there has ever been.The story is about a girl named Belle who wants to have a better life than the ordinary one she got stuck with. In the beginning we learn of the prince who got turned into a beast for his heart was cold. And if he couldn't find anyone to love and love him in return before the rose he was given had wilted then him and all of the people who live in the castle (turned into house ware items) would remain the way they were forever. And that is where Belle comes in, as she goes in search for her father who went missing she finds herself at the Beast's castle and her father as well. In exchange for his freedom she would remain there and never leave again or see her loved ones again. So now a chain of events has been set into motion that will determine the fate of the Beast and all who inhabit his castle.Beauty and the Beast is obviously one of the most romantic, funny, charming, and enchanting films ever made. The characters are funny, loving, and beautifully made. The music is perfect along with the animation. Because of the animation we can see many charming characters do things that hasn't been done before in animation. The choreography moves everywhere and leaves us all just wanting more. This film is an instant classic filled with beautiful animation, great choreography, timeless music, and a love story to make your heart melt. Beauty and the Beast is one of the most enchanting films ever made, people will want to watch this over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Disney Film. My All-Time Favourite Movie. Brings Back Memories, Old &amp; New. Arguably ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters in 1991 (I was 5 years old) and fell in love immediately. I used to watch this movie when it came out on video soon after. Wore out my VHS copy. I was excited when the movie came out in IMAX in 2002 (I was 17) and, though I would have preferred to see it with my friends, I enjoyed it nonetheless. My aunt bought the movie when it was released on Special Platinum Edition DVD, knowing that I'd be upset if she didn't.This movie is arguably one of the greatest films ever made, with its great story, stunning animation &amp; Academy Award winning songs, my favourites being "Belle," "Be Our Guest," "Human Again" &amp; the heartwarming title song, of course. The movie reminds me very much of my best friend, as she is a lot like Belle (forgiving, slow to anger, very patient, understanding and loving) and I'm a lot like Beast (ugly and utterly abominable when I lose my temper). In spite of all this, she loves me for who I am, though we can never be together.I cannot recommend this classic movie enough for everyone. Classic songs, a great story and stunning animation make this film a treasure. The Special Platinum Edition DVD has a treasure trove of riches with which you are most certain to be enchanted, including not one, not two, but 3 versions of this most excellent and history making movie (it is the only animated feature ever to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, winning two for Best Original Score &amp; Best Original Song, also picking up two nominations for Best Original Song and Best Sound and won 3 Golden Globes, including Best Picture). Rated G.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney discovers feminism (sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belle is a beautiful, innocent, intelligent and kind young girl bored with her life in her small village. Her lovable father falls in the clutches of the Beast who is really a handsome prince under a spell. She trades herself for her father's freedom. The Beast agrees. Also the spell on him can be broken if someone loves him--but time is running out. Since this is a Disney film you probably know how it ends.This was a blockbuster success for Disney. It was also the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It's beautifully done with some jaw-dropping animation--the ballroom sequence is already a classic. Also it's a musical and it's one of those rare occurrences where EVERY song works! This was a well-deserved Oscar winner for Best Song and Score. I saw the extended version with one new song--"Human Again"--which fits in seamlessly with the original movie. All the voices match the characters perfectly--it's quite amusing to realize that Robby Benson does the Beast's voice! Also this was (for Disney) a step forward in portraying female characters. Their previous film ("The Little Mermaid") got some heat for how the mermaid NEEDED a man to live. In this film Belle doesn't need anyone--she's strong, self-willed and can fight back. She does fall in love with the Beast but not because she needs him--in fact he needs her! For Disney that was feminism.Basically one of the best Disney cartoons ever. Also it's perfect for the kids--only really small ones might be frightened. Perfect for everyone--a 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie a lot, and it is amazing! I saw it for the first time when I was about four years of age, and fell in love! This movie has such a great message, and everyone should no it - don't judge a book by it's cover! This movie is such magic, and warming and inviting. Belle is such a great character, and I'm so happy I own this movie and can see it. It's so great, and it's one of the best Disney movies ever made! It deserved Best Picture at the 1992 Academy Awards, I'm so glad it at least won two Oscars. The music is soo great, and the voicing of Belle and the Beast is so incredible. The whole movie, concept, and message is just so great. So watch the movie, it's one of the best, you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spoiled prince is transformed into a hideous beast, and must learn to love another and regain her love in return before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time, a prince lived in a shining castle; and although he had everything his heart desired, he was spoiled and selfish...." Thus begins one of Disney's most wonderful animated classics. The prince is transformed into a hideous beast, matching his outward appearance with his heart. He is given an enchanted rose which will bloom until his 21st birthday. By the time the last petal falls, he must learn to love someone and earn her love in return, and the spell will be broken. If not, he must remain a beast.The story, music, and characters are all truly enchanting and wonderful, fully embracing the Disney Magic. The setting is France, and I can see the French influence in it when I compare it to other French stories like "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "Phantom of the Opera," and "Les Miserables." (The last two are not Disney, by the way.) What I really like most about all of these is that they all encourage us not to judge by outward appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale on the possibility of being able to change and become better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if the story itself can be a little controversial (a beauty falling in love with her tormentor), Disney's bring us here one of its best motion picture ever. Catchy songs, well developed characters (especially for the supporting roles), incredible animation, very romantic moments, a good drama, will make your trip into this imaginary world, an unforgettable one. Comparing to most Disney's movies this one is more "grey" than "black of white" and some may be scared that the message deliver is not clear enough for children but life is grey and rather than focusing on the tormentor part it is the idea of the possibility of being able to change and become better, the hope that this brings, that the Beauty and the Beast is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Disney romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in my opinion, is a delightful Disney romance. If you ask me, Gaston (voice of Richard White) was truly diabolical. Still, in my opinion, he was very good-looking. On the other hand, the songs were truly superior. Well, despite the fact that every song in this film was good, I would have to say that the title song was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in delightful Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie/cartoon i've ever seen! I just love it! I watched this movie 20 or more times I think. The songs are terrific. The dress of Belle is absolutely amazing, isn't it? :) The little cup of tea is really sweet. I think the voices suit really good for all characters. I would like to see "Beauty and the Beast on Ice" but for now it's really impossible. I think that who saw this show is really really lucky! "Transformation" part of this movie is good enough and I think you should pay attention the music because Disney orchestra is terrific playing the music. Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast!!! I don't like Celine Dion and her voice either but Peabo Bryson sings very well. He just showed his talent! The new part of show in special edition is good enough. I just love the song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>by Ashley Chewning.The movie The Beauty and The Beast is a heart-warming production by the Disney family. The movie was about Belle (Paige 0' Hara) who was trying to make a beast (Robby Benson) very lovable for him to change back with his friends: Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansburg), Chip (Bradely Pierce), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers, who is also the narrator for the movie), Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley), Bergman or Babette (Mary Kay), and the stove (Brian Cummings). If the beast and his friends don't change back before the last rose petal falls, then they would stay like that forever.I thought that The Beauty and The Beast was a very good movie. I thought it was dramatic because there was a lot of fire that threatened the Beast and other people. There were many scenes that made the movie action-packed. For an example, at the end of the movie Gaston (Richard White) and the beast fought with each other at the top of the castle. I thought that was a cool thing to watch.The romantic part was the best part out of the whole movie. It all started at the dance in the middle of the ballroom floor. The song came on and they were dancing and having fun. Then it went to near the end of the movie when the Beast and his friends turn back to normal, and Belle and the Beast live happily ever after.I think that this movie would be good to watch with a family member or with your best friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Wonderful! I fully recommend this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While loving Disney may seem a bit, childish for a high school teen, I would like to say this movie just pushes my lack of care even more.The narrator that starts the movie does a wonderful job of describing the beginning, which cuts right into a song which Belle sings. Not only is the music beautiful, but the characters are creative and full of personality. What really makes this movie stand out from others is the voice acting, brilliant! Angela Lansbury, Page O'Hara, Robby Benson, Jerry Orbach, and many more.The reason I think this movie is so great, is the fact that the story, music, colors, characters, and voice acting blend so well, it is hard to find fault with this movie. This is THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIE TO DATE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the best films I have ever seen........Perfect in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I was three when I first saw it in the theater and didn't realize at the time how good it really was. I was just one of those kids dancing in the aisle during "Be Our Guest". But recently I watched it again after learning that it was nominated for Best Picture. In the first three minutes I thought, "I can see why". The opening song is a masterpiece. It tells of an entire history of the characters and what they think of each other in three and a half minutes. Once again we see Howard Ashman's gift for writing lyrics that the animators gain a lot of their inspiration from. Gaston (the villain) starts off as the butt of every joke. Then he begins to become a monster and finally a murderer. This is by far the villain that goes through the biggest change throughout the film. The ending of the film is very moving. With the Beast transforming into the prince. This film also was the first one to have successful use of computer animation. The ballroom scene in which the Beast and Belle finally fall in love is very deep. There is two versions of the title song. One for the credits performed by Peobo Bryson and Celine Dion and one that Ms. Lansbury sings during the dancing sequence. Both may require several boxes of tissues. I still believe that this film is perfect in every way.</fullReview>

In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do!

		<fullReview>This is the most amazing movie i have ever seen. Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out. The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more "provincial life" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves himWhat really makes it the best is the voices too. Just listening to hte music without the movie can make you feel the same way. i am a real Disney lover but i would highly recommend this one above all others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favourite Disney film, made in the last great era of the company, before the new wave of technologically advanced films came along. This era included Aladdin and the Lion King, but it is Beauty and the Beast which comes out on top for its simple story, beautifully told. Based on the classic French fairy tale the story is one of love, understanding, and seeing the true nature of a person, not what is on the surface, and the wonderful characters along with sumptuous animation and timeless songs make this a deserving classic.Belle lives with her old father Maurice, and her horse, just outside a quiet country town. She is shy, would do anything for her father, an inventor, but is lonely, wishing that there is something more than the world she sees everyday. Local hard-man Gaston wants to marry her, but she is not interested. One day Maurice gets lost in a massive forest, and finds shelter in an old castle. There he finds magical creatures, cups and ornaments who can speak. However the castle is owned by a monster who captures Maurice. The beast will only save Maurice if Belle will go to him forever, and Belle sacrifices herself. At first the beast is frightening, but with time they grow to understand each other, eventually falling in love. The beast's curse is that he must have a woman fall in love with him before his magical rose dies, or he will be trapped in that body forever. Years ago he was cursed for not helping an old woman and has become bitter, but Belle changes that. However, Gaston has plans of his own. The film is full of beautiful imagery which will stay with you forever-the rose petals falling, the ballroom dance, and the swooping camera adds a new dimension to the musical score. Seasons change from summer to winter and the animators eye for detail with each change is truly breathtaking. Smaller characters like Chip, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the clock add to the delightful mood. Only a heart of stone could dislike this movie, and the story is sincere and touching, if a little whimsical. Each song is charming and memorable, and the Oscar is well deserved. Short enough to keep any kid occupied, but older viewers can equally enjoy the romance which is more effectively shown here than in the majority of non-animated features. Watch this and the world doesn't seem so bad. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated movies. It has a great soundtrack and tons of unforgettable characters. I love cogsworth and all those guys, they're hilarious. gaston is also a great character. He's a perfect bad guy. The scene where he's talking about Belle marrying him and talking about her messaging his feet is so funny. My favorite part is the end when he turns into a human. It seems today that Disney movies are becoming pretty dull. They're all turning into campy pixar movies. It makes me appreciate Beauty and the Beast more. In my opinion, it's one of the best Disney films made. It definitely should've won the Oscar. I don't even remember what did. Whatever it was, it probably didn't go down in history like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney movie EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been my favorite Disney movie since I was three years old. It is filled with humor, magic, suspense, and heart. It tells the story of a teenaged girl named Belle, whose father Maurice has been captured by a hideous beast, who is actually a selfish prince with a spell put on him. She makes a deal with the beast: The beast releases her father and takes her instead. She eventually warms his cold heart, and the two fall in love. But, a selfish man named Gaston, who has been in love with Belle, doesn't approve, and his plans almost prevail in an excellent climax. The title song "Beauty and the Beast" performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is classic. I would highly recommend this movie, even to adults, because it is sure to touch all who see it. 10/10.</fullReview>

It allowed me to see a lot of details that I didn't notice before, good and bad. The only bad part was at the end where people are standing still while Belle and the Prince are dancing... but that wasn't a big deal to me. I thought watching it on IMAX was great, but it's probably better if you've seen the movie before because you'd appreciate it more seeing it on the super-huge screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, from it's opening narration, to the end credits, is a beautifully animated adaptation of a well known classic.When I first saw this, I was captivated by both the animation and the story. It's a nice tale, and as always, has something to teach us.The songs are really great too. Every one in this movie, is beautifully sung and well orchestrated. Everyone knows the song "Be our guest" and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear/see it.The villain of the piece is of course Mr Universe with his bulging biceps and pearly white teeth, and we as an audience can't wait for the inevitable confrontation between him and the Beast.But to me, the real star of this film is Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury). She sings THAT song wonderfully, and sends a shiver down my back, and brings a tear to my eye every time!!This is, I must say, Disney at their best, they don't make them like this anymore, and it shows that when people care about something that they make, it'll all work out, and everyone will be happy ever after.10/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

Scene where the scum goes to attack the castle, singing the best song of the whole movie, shows that at least Gaston has voice!

		<fullReview>This is possibly the greatest animated film ever made. That's right, the greatest. Although, more artistically adept Anime fans may detest and although 'The Lion King' is traditionally realized as the quintessential animated film, 'Beauty and the Beast', in the indiscriminate animated realm, may very possibly be one of the most important animated films, Disney, Animated, or otherwise, ranking alongside the likes of 'Snow White', 'Toy Story', and 'Fantasia'. First of all, let's talk about the cinematography. I declare there is not a single shot in this film that does not impress me. Prior to this film's completion, Rescuers Down Under had enjoyed the distinction of being the first full length animated feature in CGI. But, Beauty is the film that perfected it. Even with all of the animated films that have come since the release of Beauty, I am struck by the polished clarity of the animation in that the background and its objects remain completely in focus in proportion to the objects in the forefront, as critics are still astounded today that young Charles Foster Kane playing in the snow is able to remain in focus through a window in proportion to Agnes Moorhead in 'Citizen Kane.' Likewise, look at Belle and the Beast's snowball fight in 'Something There' while the objects converse. Belle and the Beast, from a distance, can be clearly viewed as easily as can the objects. When Maurice runs down the staircase of the cottage before the angry mob, the camera flies down following him, and yet Belle and Monsieur D'Arque remain completely visible. Remarkable shots like these can be found throughout the film, such as the Swooping Ballroom Ceiling Scene, the wolf chase, and the Beast's transformation sequence. It is understandable that Walt Disney gave up on his treatment of 'Beauty,' just as it is understandable that the makers of this film almost gave up on its completion. The story does not scream success (a beautiful girl passively sacrificing her life for her father and falling in love with a cursed beast). And, yet it is a testament to the power of storytelling that this film is as entertaining as it is, for a film without a straightout villain or hero. From the start, we are taken from a haunted castle, paranormal in its scope, to a simple French village bustling with activity, and the film never loses its power. The film's only legitimate weakness is its instrumental score. Following the fantastic score of 'Mermaid' and preceding the wonderful score to 'Aladdin' and the riveting score to 'The Lion King,' the score to 'Beauty' holds few surprises, for the most part. Otherwise, this is a film devoid of weakness and, more importantly, scandal (like most of the other "Renaissance" films). And whatever I could say about the film's wonderful and groundbreaking songs, characters, scenery, and detail has likely already been said. All I can do is recommend this as highly as any great film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this Disney film some time in my childhood, so I was very eager to see it again when grown up, remembering bits and pieces, and especially hearing it was the first cartoon to be nominated the Oscar for Best Picture. Basically an old beggar with a special rose knocked on the door of selfish prince (apparently named Adam), and he turned her away twice, and when she revealed herself as a beautiful enchantress he tried to apologise to her, but seeing no love she punished him by turning him into a hideous beast. With a magic mirror as the only way to see the outside world, and a spell over the castle and all in it, the spell will be broken when he learns to love and earns their love in return before the last petal of the magical rose falls. Meanwhile, Belle (Paige O'Hara) is the bookworm and daughter of eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) who tires of her life in the village, and is often pestered by handsome but rude and arrogant Gaston (Richard White) to marry him. Maurice leaves for a fair for one of his inventions, and when he gets lost and danger forces him into the castle, he becomes the prisoner of the Beast (Robby Benson) inside. Bell eventually finds the castle, and bargains with the Beast to have her take her father's place as the prisoner, and knowing she could be the one to break the spell he agrees, but his temper doesn't do him any favours. Bell refuses his order to have dinner with him, and the servants, candle stick formed Lumi?re (Jerry Orbach), carriage clock formed Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) and teapot formed Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) go against the orders not to let her eat. Belle explores the castle, and breaks a rule not to enter the West Wing, where the rose is kept, angering the Beast and frightening her to run away, but encountering some wolves he saves her life, and she helps him heal his wounds. While Maurice leaves to go in search of Belle and Gaston plans to have him put in an insane asylum to force Belle to marry him, she and the Beast have been bonding some time, having dinner and a romantic ballroom dance. He allows her to use to mirror to see her father, and she is devastated to see him sick, and even though the rose has only hours till fully wilted he lets her go to help him, and she takes the mirror to remember him by. After saving Maurice and a mob threatening to put him in the asylum, Belle proves he is sane showing the Beast in the mirror, but Gaston, filled with murderous jealously, convinces the mob to help him go and kill the Beast. The mob storm the castle, but the servants fight against them and scare them away, while Gaston manages to find the Beast and corner him, and he is too depressed to fight back, but he gives back, and spares his life. He is happy to see Belle back, but after Gaston stabs him before falling to his death the Beast is dying from the injury, and when it looks like he is dead she whispers that she loves him. This comes just in time for the last petal that falls, and the Beast's body is lifted by magical lights that change him back into a human, Belle recognises the eyes of Prince Adam, they kiss for true love, all the servants and the castle are restored, and they all live happily ever after. Also starring Jumanji's Bradley Pierce as Chip, Jesse Corti as Lefou, Hal Smith as Philippe the horse, Jo Anne Worley as Wardrobe and Tony Jay as Monsieur D'Arque. The voices are all well chosen, the animation is superb with the moments of computer animation, including the ballroom scene with a wonderful swirl through the chandelier, the songs are all fantastic listening, and of course the story is captivating and will delight all, a must see animated musical fantasy. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Alan Menken and Best Song for "Beauty and the Beast" (sung by Lansbury in the film, and Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson at the end) (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for "Belle", Best Song for "Be Our Guest" (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Film Score and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score. It was number 22 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one the best animated films I've ever scene, it's creative, musical, spatula, romantic, anything what a Disney should have. The characters are great and this what EVERY Disney film should have had; a male/female protagonist, a comic relief sidekick, and a villain with a sidekick that has an idiot personality, that what every Disney film would have, in fact that's pretty much what The Lion King and Aladdin has, a protagonist voiced by a great actor, a sidekick voiced by a great comedian, and even have a villain with a sidekick that would make us laugh. The animation is spatula the designs of the castle is really great, its like as if the animators have went to every castle drawn all the detail in one castle, even the beast has a great design, this is what the beast would look like in every adaption to this story, a beast thats a frankensteined beast of every part of a mammal. In conclusion, Beauty and the Beast is really a great film to watch, and defiantly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is currently ranked #1 on my Walt Disney Animation Studios BEST to WORST list - http://www.imdb.com/list/xd1gMExGbXg/ - and it is currently ranked at #10 in My Top 250 - http://www.imdb.com/list/Ds4FGytT3MA/. It is not hard too see why this is a wonderful film. We love each of the characters (except Gaston) for their own special reason, like Lumiere for his comedy and Cogsworth for his attempt at being a leader. This is without a doubt the greatest adaptation of this story, and will stay the greatest for many years to come. It is a wonderful story, telling you not to be deceived by looks and look for the beauty inside. As much as this movie is a pinnacle for the animation genre, I have to commend Alan Menken &amp; Howard Ashman for their Golden Globe &amp; Oscar-winning score and song "Beauty &amp; the Beast". Also nominated for a Globe &amp; Oscar was "Be Our Guest", and nominated for a Globe was "Belle".This movie is a piece of cinema history that made it into the National Film Registry in 2002, 11 years after it's initial release. And it is not hard to see why. "She glanced this way, I thought I saw... And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw. No, it can't be; I'll just ignore...

		<shortDescription>Disney At It's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the film of animation went to CGI and special effects took place. It shows them at their best in their 30th feature film of all. As they were coming off "The Little Mermaid!" Yet another female protagonist in the version of Belle, voiced by Paige O Hara. As she has a charm and sensitivity to her. One day as her widowed father tries to go to a fair with an invention, he gets lost and runs into the beast.The Beast used to be a spoiled and unloving prince, voiced by Robby Benson. As he traps her father. As she finds his horse ran off in the dark without him, she tries to find her dad as she meets face to face with the Beast. And trades her own freedom to release of his.As she finds herself trapped, she meets an assortment of characters including charming candle Lameire, kindly teapot Miss Potts, and grouchy but sympathetic Cogston. Who help her make the most out of her bad situation.But after a near tragic situation and the Beast being nursed back to health, his attitude changes for the better and he and Belle formed a friendship that blossoms into something more.But as the rose pedal that will keep peeling away until the last as if it falls without them admitting to one another that they love one another, everybody will remain the way that they are and not turned human as they will be trapped forever! Meanwhile her father tries to find help to help release his daughter. As a handsome but arrogant and conceited suitor for her, Gaston and others in the town at first refuse him. But after Belle returns(Won't tell you how she returned from the beast), they are up to the challenge.Really the best Disney Movie of all time. Beating even the Lion King and other films. Great story and great music. Along with great animation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Golden Age of Disney!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Lion King and Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast is widely considered by most as Disney's finest film. That is simply a completely fair observation considering how good everything about the film is.The film follows the story of a man who was turned into a beast by a witch after he failed to help her due to her hideous appearance and a sweet young lady named Belle. As Belle is held prisoner by the Beast, both begin to discover what each other are deep down. Why do I absolutely love this film? Simply said, I love everything about the film. I love the voice acting, I love the classical animations, I love the story itself and the characters and also find the songs surprisingly good! This film has a magical taste to it. It just has this sweetness to it that many film nowadays attempt to accomplish but obviously fail, most notably Twilight. The relationship between Beauty and the Beast works so well during the film and it also adds a lot of comedy to it. I loved the pacing of the film and find that this is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>best movie period. first to be nominated for Oscars as a animmated film. thats awesome. trying to fill up 10 lines of space. yadiyadiyadiyadi.Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated musical-fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the third film of the Disney Renaissance period, the film is based on the fairy tale La Belle et la B?te by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont[4] and uses some ideas from the 1946 film of the same name.[5] The film centers around a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, the Beast must love Belle and win her love in return, or he will remain a Beast forever. The film's animation screenplay was written by Linda Woolverton with story written by Roger Allers, Brenda Chapman, Chris Sanders, Burny Mattinson, Kevin Harkey, Brian Pimental, Bruce Woodside, Joe Ranft, Tom Ellery, Kelly Ashbury, and Robert Lence, directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and produced by Don Hahn. The music of the film was composed by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, both of whom had written the music and songs for Disney's The Little Mermaid. Beauty and the Beast was released on November 13, 1991. The film was a significant commercial and critical success during its initial release, and has now earned $418 million in box office earnings throughout the world as of January 2012. Beauty and the Beast was also nominated for several awards, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, with two other awards for its music. Famously, Beauty and the Beast was the first ever animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and was the only animated film to hold this honor until 2009, when the Academy Awards switched from 5 Best Picture nominations to 10, and Pixar's animated film Up was nominated. Beauty and the Beast received a total of six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Sound, and three nominations for its song. It ended up winning two, for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the song "Beauty and the Beast". A direct-to-video midquel called Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas was released in 1997. It was followed in 1998 by another midquel, Belle's Magical World, and later by a stage production of the same name and a television spin-off series, Sing Me a Story with Belle. An IMAX special edition version of the original film was released in 2002, with a new five-minute musical sequence included. After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, the film returned to theaters in 3-D on January 13, 2012.[6]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of the original (1991) &amp; the 3D version (2012)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this as Disney's first breakthrough cartoon, boldly crossing demographics between children &amp; adults. It's a cute, digestible story with some silly laughs for the young'uns, and it's also packed with some subtle, witty, almost suggestive zingers for the grownups.After seeing it again for the first time in 20 years, in glorious 3D no less, I thought I'd give a review on how it has aged over the years.First, let's talk about the 3D. Well I may be easily impressed (considering the last 3D movie I saw was "Space Hunter" in 1983), but the 3D experience really brought this story to life and made me feel like a kid experiencing something new again. No, it's not quite as dazzling as the modern, computerized 3D films like I saw in the previews. But I don't know if we'd want it that way. The modern upgrades shouldn't upstage the timeless simplicity of this classic work of art, much like we wouldn't necessarily want to hear the old Beatles recordings remixed in bowel-busting, pelvis-pounding 5.1 surround sound. But some tasteful upgrades here &amp; there can effectively liven up the presentation to today's standards. Here we get a nice enhanced depth of vision and a few spectacular moments like in the song "Be Our Guest" and the ballroom scene. But I still remained immersed in the story instead of thinking "wow this is 3D!"The material... Given that this is a vintage fairytale, it can feel a little dated and, well, "cartoonish". But isn't that the point? The good guys are unquestionably good. The bad guys are unquestionably bad. There is no moral ambiguity, and all personalities and situations are greatly exaggerated to make it clear to the audience. That's the part that may seem "dated" in light of today's more complex, irresoluble story lines where good blends with evil and the universe isn't always fair. No, "Beauty and the Beast" is one of the last true fairy tales &amp; about as idealistic as it gets. So be sure to leave your cynicism at the door.The music &amp; performances are first class. Songs are fun &amp; playful, and I can imagine little kids squealing with delight as well as adults cracking big smiles. This film and "Aladdin" stand out in my mind as being Disney's most entertaining musicals. There's a certain edge to the music that separates it from the old school Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein type of songs and puts it in a new class of songwriting like Danny Elfman's work on "Nightmare Before Christmas". Beyond that, it's hard to describe. You just have to hear it.I was shocked to see the theater completely empty except for one couple hiding in the back. I suppose a lot of people are reluctant to pay the heavy price tag for a 3D film that was never intended that way. Make no mistake, I don't think the visuals will blow you away, especially if you already own your own copy of B&amp;tB on DVD or Blu-Ray. But if, like me, the last time you saw the movie was 20 years ago, I think you owe it to yourself to revisit this great flick, and be sure to go for the full presentation. Who says you can never be a child again? For us old timers, 3D gives us the fresh novelty we need to make it happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadn't persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. It's not a clever or complex movie, it's not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a children's one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great: 1: The music. Beauty and the Beast' richly deserved its Oscar, but 'Part Of Your World' deserved it even more.2. The animation. Quite simply, it's absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching? I urge anyone with even a touch of sentimentality about them to set their predjudices aside and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably The Best Disney Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty And The Beast is one of my personal favorite Disney animated films.Its timeless theme about love and kindness appeals not only to children but to adults likewise.The story centers around a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. Belle is a girl who is dissatisfied with life in a small provincial French town, constantly trying to fend off the misplaced "affections" of conceited Gaston. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet.To become a prince again, the Beast must love Belle and win her love in return, or he will remain a Beast forever. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet.Narrated by Mia Farrow, who also supplies all the character voices, this half-hour animated version of Beauty and the Beast was originally a component of "Stories to Remember", an internationally syndicated package of children's story adaptations.Aside from that,it features great music such as the "Beauty and the Beast" theme performed by Cline Dion and Peabo Bryson,"Be Our Guest","Beauty and The Beast (tale as old as time)","Belle" and "Something There".Overall,this isn't merely the best of the fairy tale features but it's very close to being the best Disney movie of them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding animated version of an archetypal fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the best of the latter-day Disney cartoons, Beauty And The Beast is a stunning film that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. After a lengthy lull for the studio, stretching right back to The Aristocats, they finally returned to form with The Little Mermaid in 1989. This 1991 film, based on a Madame LePrince De Beaumont novel, is an absolute delight and marks a high point in Disney animation unmatched since the days of Dumbo and Pinocchio. So impressive is this film that it was the first cartoon movie ever to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, an award it conceivably might have won had it not been up against the mighty Silence Of The Lambs in the same year.In a small provincial village in the French countryside lives a beautiful young lady, Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), and her inventor-father Maurice (voice of Rex Everhart). Belle is obsessed with books and loves stories of romantic derring-do, but the rest of the villagers find her odd - her nose is always stuck in a book, and they think she should be more in tune with what is happening in the real world. Most of the girls in the village have a crush on the handsome hunter Gaston (voice of Richard White), but he desires Belle.... even though she thinks he is nothing more than a brainless, muscle-headed fool. One day Maurice sets off for the nearby city to sell one of his inventions but he gets lost in the woods on the way and ends up seeking shelter in a foreboding castle. Belle grows worried by his absence and sets out to search for him. She too finds the castle and, upon entering, discovers her father imprisoned under the custody of a fearsome beast (voice of Robby Benson). The beast agrees to free her father as long as she takes his place. Initially Belle hates being confined in the castle but gradually she discovers that the beast is not as cruel and heartless as he appears. Just as she is about to fall in love with her captor (thereby breaking a long-lasting curse and turning him back into the prince he once was), a mob of angry villagers - led by Gaston - turn up to kill the beast.Beauty And The Beast is distinguished by splendid animation, memorable voice work, brilliant songs and a perfectly-paced narrative. The animation is a fantastic leap forward for its time, utilising computer generated imagery that brings the characters and places marvellously to life. All the vocal talent is spot-on, with O'Hara and Benson doing lovely work as the titular characters, while the likes of Angela Lansbury, Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers provide memorable supporting voices. The entire film has about it the feel of a stage show, most significantly during the song routines - tunes like "Be Our Guest", "Gaston!", "Tale As Old As Time" and "Kill The Beast" are instantly catchy, and are brought to life in vibrant, well-worked out sequences. The original story is an archetypal fairy tale and the makers follow it to the letter, adding a few clever trimmings of their own. Individually, each sequence is brilliantly put together creating an overall sense of awe and wonder, and the whole story flows smoothly putting barely a foot in the wrong place. A great film for the family, Beauty And The Beast is outstanding entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale as old as time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast it's a classic of literature, but, there's no adaptation of any tale that has surpassed the original one as this. The visual style blends perfectly the paintings of Europeans like Goya and Rembrandt on the fascinating land of Provence in France, and the Gothic-terrific architecture with beasts, devils and dragons with the fascinating Romanesque-Renaissance grand flavor of color, spaces, and themes. The haunting music in the beginning mixed with the glasses telling the story of a feudatory prince that was transformed into a beast by a beautiful enchantress. That glasses blending medieval style and moons and heraldic blossom's and dazzling blonde enchantresses are a perfect introduction to what we are going to see. The characters, there's no one of them useless, all of them loving. The music, the score, the story itself. The perfect movie for those who love perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Beauty And The Beast " is Disney animation at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where hand-drawn animation is a thing of the past and computer animation is the dominant form of art, it is necessary to reminisce to a time when Disney animation was at its peak instead of at the sorry state it is in now. Beauty and the Beast retains the charm and elegance of the old Disney films such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan. If anything, the music is phenomenal, often being hailed as the cartoon Broadway musical. Songs such as "Be Our Guest" are brimming with soaring string melodies and punchy brass chords, while the latter song even provides operatic aria vocal talents if listened to closely enough. "Battle On The Tower" is possibly the best form of orchestration from any Disney film ever, capturing the dramatic urgency of the final battle between the beast and Gaston as well as the humour of the animated characters. Apart from the music, the characters are naturally funny, likable and charming. In particular, the voice talents of Angela Lansbury create a comforting,touching, motherly atmosphere as Mrs Potts in the film's most moving musical number, "Beauty And The Beast". Even Gaston is almost a comical caricature of the baddie, creating moments of humour with his arrogant and hilariously naive belief that Belle will be his wife. The charming nature of the characters is a far cry from the characters in recent cinematic features (such as Chicken Little) where the writers are almost trying to make the characters funny and faltering embarrassingly. There doesn't seem to be the natural "charm" present in Disney films anymore. Rather, children seem to be interested solely in the modern visual representation of things, with Home On The Range being the last hand-drawn animated effort from Disney. Disney is now trying to "wow" youngsters with impressive special effects rather than trying to tug on their heartstrings, and not always with success (remember Treasure Planet?). Furthermore, Disney is trying to aim their films towards kids more and more and so there is not the "family entertainment" factor anymore. Beauty And The Beast seems to provide humour for the children with animated characters such as Cogsworth and lumiere, while the love triangle between Gaston, Belle and the Beast provides humour for the adults (in particular, Gaston's arrogance and chauvinistic view towards women, while appalling on some levels, does provide light adult humour). In contrast, the recent film "Chicken Little" may have used some form of humour for adults but was yet too juvenile to be enjoyed by an adult audience. It now appears that adults are taking their kids to the cinema for their kids and not for the whole family anymore. There are some advantages to modern Disney cinema; the computer animation is spectacular and Disney must also pertain to the times. With more and more computer games around, kids want to see computer animation more and more in films; Disney are simply trying to serve a modern audience. The sad thing about this is that Disney films now seem to lack the rich deep colours present in "Beauty And The Beast" to accommodate a warm, rich, deeply satisfying and charming cinematic experience. Disney computer animation seems somewhat colder and as such the humour and characters seem cold. What a shame that the new generation of Disney fans will only be fed visually rather than through the soul with the charm and poignancy of Disney at its best; Beauty and The Beast.</fullReview>

Watched a few minutes of it once. That tells me something.I can watch this film, however, over and over and not tire of it.How many films can you say that about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacularly beautiful, if anachronistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine a more delightful telling of a fairy tale. Sure, there are some anachronisms, but this is fantasy: clocks did not exist until the Renaissance, and modern eating utensils (knives, forks and spoons) are decidely not medieval. Above all, Belle is a feminist and a bookworm, two rarities of the Middle Ages, and above all a person more sophisticated and mature than the typical denizen of the Middle Ages. Then again, so is the curse that turns the Prince into the Beast... Characters are well-defined. We see Gaston, the rival for Belle's affection, a man who could supposedly have any woman of his choosing and can't appreciate his pretty toadies, as a crude, boastful, male-chauvinist pig and as an organizer of mob violence against The Beast. Disney's trademark anthropomorphism of animals and even such objects as plates, candles, knives, forks, and spoons reaches the zenith in "Be Our Guest", a dance sequence that would have put Busby Berkeley to shame, to music reminiscent of the first movement of Mahler's Third Symphony. (If you don't know who Gustav Mahler was, he was merely the greatest symphonist since Beethoven). Realistic? No -- it's a fairy tale, one very much in the canon. The best-established fairy tales have lives of their own. An absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made "Bambi", "Little Mermaid" and many other great films. "Beauty and the Beast" represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar. Well worth seeing and owning--a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional, beautiful animated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone can tell you that 1991's "Beauty and the Beast," the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. "Beauty and the Beast" is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, "Beauty and the Beast" is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with "The Little Mermaid" (1989) and ended with "Tarzan" in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's "Aladdin" or 1994's "The Lion King"; "Beauty and the Beast" is easily the best film from this time."Beauty and the Beast" is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale &amp; Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall."Beauty and the Beast" is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's "Up" in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though "Beauty and the Beast" has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that "Beauty and the Beast" didn't receive at least a "PG" rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated "G," but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life."Beauty and the Beast" is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure. I especially appreciated its message about inner beauty, a theme that has always been particularly of interest to me in the few love stories I actually like but has never been realized so brilliantly as it has been here.A true Disney classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beautiful love story ever told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is my second favorite Disney movie. I was 2 years old when it was released, I'm 20 years old now and I still love it and watch it all the time. It hasn't lost its touch and it never gets old. It's amazing how you can watch a movie over and over again and still love it. Of all movies, this is the one movie I grew up on.Of all the Disney movies out there, how can people not like this one? I don't understand it, I really don't. It's so beautiful and heart felt and always cheers me up when I watch it. Look at the animated movies being made today. It disgusts me and makes me really sad knowing that movies like Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin will never be made again. Some of the animated movies nowadays aren't too bad, Kung Fu Panda and Over the Hedge I love, but will never live up to and be as good as Beauty and the Beast. This movie is pure magic and is one of the best Disney movies ever made. I don't care for the old classics like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, not that I dislike them or anything. All my favorite Disney movies are from the 90s because I grew up with those one.Beauty and the Beast shows one of the most beautiful love stories ever told, showing us that appearance isn't everything but what's inside. Belle fell in love with the Beast, seeing the goodness inside of him. Some people don't like this movie because of why Belle loves the Beast. The message they're trying to give is that you can love someone for what's inside of them, it's just one of the key elements when in a relationship but not the only. During the ballroom dance scene, you can see that Belle and the Beast's love for each other is getting stronger and the way they look at each other, you can definitely see how they have bonded since their first meeting. It's just beautiful and makes me feel all warm inside.The funniest part is when Gaston has his wedding prepared and hasn't even proposed to Belle yet. I mean, what's up with that, but it's funny!Beauty and the Beast makes me miss how they used to animate Disney movies back in the day. The coloring, the gleam in the characters eyes. They added everything. It's absolutely brilliant and with the picture quality increasing nowadays on DVD it makes the movie look even better! I honestly can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie in the last 18 years growing up on it. I personally think it's the most beautiful love story ever told and this movie will stick with me until my dying day. No doubt, I'll be 50 years old and I'll still be watching Beauty and the Beast.I missed buying the special edition when it came out in 2002 so I still have the tape, which surprisingly, still works! I'll be waiting for the re-release of Beauty and the Beast next year in 3D.Beauty and the Beast isn't just for kids but for all ages. It's always gonna be one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

Lion King is very good but it's not even close to this. It will give you bumpers, it will make you laugh, smile and cry. It will change your life in some small way, but still it will do something to you. The music is amazing, the voice acting is fail free, everything about this movie is perfect! I will not give any spoilers about this film but it is a MUST SEE for everybody! Watch this movie and you'll know that it deserves better ratings! Beautiful, just beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Beautiful Story Ever Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a child, and liked it OK.As the years passed, the VHS sat in the corner of my room and collected dust. We moved, and my family lost the copy of it. Strangely, one day, while opening an unopened box, I stumbled across some old Disney movies, and a beat up VHS player. So I hooked it up, and put in Beauty and the Beast on a whim. The only word I could use to describe the experience is: stunning. From the low drone of the tuba at the start of the movie accompanying the enchanting story of a selfish heart, to the triumphant end with some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen... I was astounded. The artists from the movie were brilliant. The beast was Perfectly scary enough to still be human, and Belle was normal enough to be beautiful. The colors used throughout the movie are perfect. The use of warm, dark colors moved with the story, creating a very atmospheric setting, relaxing enough to lull one into a dream.Aside from the art, the music is impeccable. Every catchy tune repeatedly pops into my head just thinking about the movie. The orchestration flows smoothly throughout the movie, blending remarkably with the art, and the story.Finally.... The story. The story is one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. The idea that a beautiful (stubborn) girl could ever fall in love with a hideous, but troubled beast- even with an evil man trying to split true (yet, perhaps, undiscovered) love apart- is so pleasing and encouraging to everyone with a heart. Whole, broken, or mended. So, whether you watch the movie every day, or just remembered that it was in a box in the attic, you can surely appreciate the beautiful art, music, and message which is presented in this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as Old as Time It Never Gets old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast in my opinion never gets old! It's always young and magical. I love the characters, animation, music, and story. In the story a Prince gets transformed into a Beast for being selfish towards an enchantress disguised as an old woman. He later falls in love with a girl named Belle who he takes prisoner. His whole household who have also turned into objects from the enchantress also like her hoping that she falls in love with the Beast to break the spell and be human again. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and Cogsworth (David Ogden Siters)argue over who told who that Belle was gonna break the spell. That was funney. I also liked when Gaston told Belle that his little wife (Belle) was going to massage his feet while the little ones (Strapping Boys) played on the floor with the dogs. That was hilarious. Gaston in my opinion was one of the greatest animated villains ever because he's got a lot of comic in him. Filled with great animation, story, characters, and music written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who sadly died of Aids before the film's release) Beauty and the Beast is an animated feature that'll go on forever and ever. I'm glad it's the only animated feature to win an award for Best Picture because I think it really deserved that and I think Walt Disney himself would of been very proud to know of that award. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very popular Disney movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 30th animated Disney "classic" is, without a doubt, one of the most famous Disney classics, which is a good and a bad thing either, because its success tends somewhat to overshadow other very good Disney classics (often better than this). Or maybe what happens is that this movie gets the deserved attention, while others sadly do not have the same luck (such as "The Rescuers", "The Aristocats", "The Fox and the Hound", "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh", "Robin Hood" and others). That is the worst aspect of this movie's success. So, as one can see, it's not all roses.Nevertheless, "Beauty and the Beast" is one of Disney's most original movies. To a point, it is every bit as creative and imaginative as "Alice in Wonderland", except that it isn't as eccentric as that one.One thing that is very obvious from the beginning is that this is a french tale. It's quite easy to understand that because all the characters have french names. Plus, they often use french words such as "Bonjour" (which means "Good morning" in french). Lumi?re even uses the word Sacr bleu once. However, it's not very clear the exact place of our story. All we know is that it's somewhere in France.As much as I don't like all of the movie's characters, some of them are very charming. For example: Lumi?re (the candelabra), Cogsworth (a clock), Mrs. Potts (a teapot), Chip (the cute little teacup), Belle, Maurice (Belle's father, who is also an inventor) and Philippe (the horse). It's funny that a horse is named Philippe (Philip in french) - LOL.Belle is one of Disney's most beautiful chicks, together with Jasmine, Ariel and the Blue Fairy. Belle is also classy, charming, carefree, nonconformist, conservative and nice. All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his "little wife". Belle is appropriately named like that (her name means beautiful in french).Gaston (who is considered the villain of the movie) is a character who's got no culture at all, being the epitome of pure strength and no brain (like Biff Tannen from "Back to the Future"). Gaston is a tall, muscled, vain, arrogant, snobbish and chauvinistic guy with a heart of stone.On the other hand, Gaston's follower and helper, Lefou, is more of a goofy guy than anything else, nearly like a comic relief. No wonder he is named Lefou (which means "The Fool" in french).Monsieur D'Arque is a strange man with a sinister appearance that makes him seem to come from a terror film. For some children, he might be a bit of a creepy character.My favorite character is Chip (he is the cutest of all, besides, his natural sweetness and innocence helps). However, Lumi?re and Belle come incredibly close to Chip when it comes to my favorite characters of this film.The soundtrack isn't entirely spectacular, but the romantic ballad "Beauty and the Beast" is beautiful. It has 2 versions. Angela Lansbury's version is good, but the original one by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is extraordinary.As for the cast, it is brand new comparing to older Disney films and most of them do well. Paige O'Hara and Angela Lansbury are among the best ones, but those who steal the show are Bradley Pierce as Chip and Jerry Orbach as Lumi?re. Jerry Orbach gives so much life and energy to Lumi?re, with such a convincing french accent.The best part of the whole film is the famous ballroom dance sequence, which is wonderful, brilliant and very artistic (the graphics also make it look incredibly close to a live-action ballroom).Generally speaking, this film has the main ingredients of an animated Disney movie: great picture quality (good designs, backgrounds, sceneries and colors), very good animation, creativity, originality, some charming characters, some romance, adventure, darkness, suspense, classic humor and so on...The Prince (that is, the Beast as a human being) almost looks like Jean Michel Jarre with that long hair. That said, his change of heart during the movie is amazing. From a person who is spoiled, selfish, unkind and with an explosive temper, he becomes kind, gentle and even romantic.Although the sequence "Human Again" was originally gonna be included in the movie, it was removed in the final version. It was recovered for the DVD. Yet, the version I consider the true one is the one without the sequence "Human Again", even if that one is not *officially* the movie's true version. But for me the true version is the one I know since 1991. It's the way I always knew it, so it makes perfect sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a well-done Walt Disney animated movie. Although not a huge fan of the movie, I find no fault at all with this film, and it's especially appealing now that it's out on DVD. It looks and sounds super. The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little "teacup" is the cutest of the characters.The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our heroine, Belle longs for adventure and little did she know, she would have one and it was truly a journey to remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was simply artful! Not only was the graphics superb, the music was resonating and it kind of blends well with the scenes at hand.Beauty and the Beast was a great movie not only because of its physical appeal but also because of the waves of emotion felt from within. It empowered me to believe that what was seen on the outside isn't what was truly inside. "She warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within." I think what I loved from the movie the most was how the character of Belle was built. Throughout the movie, it was seen that she was depicted as a humble and courageous heroine. I think I resonate with her the most since she desired so much more. She wants to venture out into the unknown and take the risks. And what I really admired was her faith that there is kindness in everyone (well, except for Gaston, just kidding). She believed the Beast that even if the world turned their backs on him, she still stood by him. (Be us against the world~)It was truly engaging and powerful. I highly recommend this to everyone who are young and young at heart. Hands up, heads down, hats off to Disney for this amazing work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Tale as Old as Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reviewing "The Little Mermaid," a film everyone praises, you may wonder if I'll hate on this film as well...No, I won't! This hasn't become Disney's most acclaimed movie for nothing! It's such a great and perfect movie!ANIMATION: The animation in this movie is gorgeous! There are two moments I LOVE watching: 1) the ceiling as Belle and Beast and dancing, and 2) the changes in Beast's face as he holds Gaston over the edge. Without talking, he goes from wanting to kill Gaston, to realizing he's not that man anymore, to deciding Gaston isn't worth it. It's fantastic!SONGS/MUSIC: Do I even have to mention the songs in this movie? They're all beautiful and they fit the movie perfectly! One of my favorites is actually a deleted scene the supporting characters sing called "When We're Human Again." Catch it on the DVD or Blu-Ray...Did I just do a plug?ROMANCE: My gosh, this has got to be Disney's greatest romantic couple in anything the company has ever done! I love that it's not love at first sight. I love that Beast is one of the last people Belle would ever think of falling in love with, but he's the one for her. I often hear the argument that since she didn't kiss him until after his transformation, she's a shallow person. Really? She confessed her love to the Beast. She danced with the Beast. She and her father went back to save the Beast. She was clearly in love with the Beast. The human form is who she'd like to be with, but the soul of character of the Beast is who she fell in love with.CHARACTERS: I can't go through and talk about all these characters individually. They are all wonderful and memorable. Belle is a fantastic lead - she's smart, beautiful, thoughtful, and kind. Beast is probably my favorite character in the movie. I love his story arc, I love how kind he is, and also tries to be throughout the movie, and I love how funny he is, too! Gaston is one of Disney's finest villains! He has a story arc to him as well; he doesn't just start off as the bad guy. He's the town's celebrity, but he becomes menacing and deceitful after Belle hurts his pride; he's not just power or money-hungry like most of the of Disney villains. The supporting characters are a lot of fun. I don't find any of them annoying or bad! I love everyone!STORY: There was a lot of detail and time put into the story. It is paced perfectly, and there isn't too much activity going on. There is one flaw that the story has that people seem to look over, though. Belle finds the Beast's castle, where the Beast is imprisoning her father Maurice, because the horse, Philippe led her there. But how did Philippe know where Maurice was? Philippe ran away before Maurice got to the castle, so he couldn't have known where he was...Well, that's OK. Really, everything else about the movie is done so wonderfully that, not only did you not notice this mistake, but you don't care.CONCLUSION: I know I didn't really say much in this review, but honestly what can I say? This really is a perfect movie! It's a masterpiece, it's colossal, it's the perfect "tale as old as time!" I praise God for you, you wonderful, gorgeous movie! Enjoy it, people! BOOYIKA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of the Disney Renaissance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Disney Renaissance (1989-1999) was in many ways the studio's second golden age (the first being from 1937-1942), where experimentation and sublime artistry where the rule rather than the exception. Most of my generation grew up with these movies, so everyone has a favorite. The most popular seems to be The Lion King (1994), but for me the true masterpiece of the era is Beauty and the Beast (1991), arguably the most romantic Disney flick of them all.All the characters are perfect. I think the only cast I like better than this one is from Pinocchio (1940). Belle is an appealing heroine: she has a compassionate and dreamy nature, but she won't let herself be walked over by anyone (notice she doesn't fall for the Beast until he starts acting like a decent person). The Beast has excellent character development, evolving from a selfish brat into a kind, passionate fellow. The enchanted objects are both fun comic relief and interesting characters in their own right. Gaston is one of Disney's best villains, walking the fine line between comic and menacing with ease.BatB boasts the greatest soundtrack of all the Disney canon. Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken outdid themselves here. The choreography is magnificent too, especially the Busby Berkely inspired "Be Our Guest" and the superbly animated "Beauty and the Beast". The incidental music is lush and romantic, a pleasure to listen to in its own right.That's not to say the film doesn't have flaws. The animation on Belle goes off-model at times and the CG in the ballroom sequence is dated. And then there's that plot hole concerning how long Belle was at the castle. None of these issues diminish the greatness of the picture. This is one of the most beautiful and adult love stories ever put put on screen. Absolutely essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and the honor is well deserved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, "The Little Mermaid" (1989) was the film that started the Disney Renaissance, the period in the 1990's which saw the Disney Studios returning to producing high quality animated films again. Many have debated which film from this era was the best. A lot of people say that it's "The Lion King" (1994), and others say that it's "Aladdin" (1992). But in my opinion, the best animated feature from this era was the Disney Studio's 30th full-length animated feature, "Beauty and the Beast" (1991). This was the first Disney animated feature to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture and that honor is well deserved. It's the best Disney animated fairy tale the studio has produced and it's also a superb movie musical. Most of us know the story to this one. A young, spoiled prince is transformed into a beast by an enchantress after his selfish behavior towards her in a beggar disguise. This spell on the prince also affects his servants as they are transformed into household objects (candlesticks, clocks, teapots, etc.). He is to remain a beast for the rest of his life unless he earns the love of another person in exchange for their love before his 21st birthday. We are then introduced to Belle, a beautiful young woman who loves to read books and dreams of a better life than the one she is currently living. She is tired of a repetitive life in the village she lives in. Although a town hero named Gaston has interest in marrying her, Belle could care less. Her father heads out of town, but gets lost along the way and stumbles upon the Beast's castle. When the Beast takes him prisoner for trespassing and Belle discovers the Beast's castle searching for her father, Belle volunteers to take his place and save her father's life. At first, neither of these two have any interest in getting to know each other. But as time passes and certain events take place, these two eventually start to open up and develop feelings to one another. "Beauty and the Beast" has some of the most breathtaking animation and visuals the Disney Studios have ever put out. It's the type of drawing that simply needs to be seen in able for one to truly appreciate the craft behind it. Some well-drawn scenes include the introduction with the stained glass windows, the "Belle" and "Be Our Guest" numbers, and the ballroom scene. If you want more proof why I believe 2D animation is superior to 3D animation, then look at what this film has to offer since it is a visual marvel. "Beauty and the Beast" has perfectly crafted music and songs by the colossal teaming of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Every song is a classic from the excellent opening musical number "Belle" to the hilarious villain song "Gaston" to the timeless musical number "Be Our Guest" to the immortal title tune. There's a reason why this is the only Disney animated feature on the AFI's list of the 25 Greatest Musicals. All of the songs contribute to the story. They all have memorable melodies and rhythms, and they all enhance the enjoyment of the picture more. Then there's the film's high quality storytelling and tremendous characters. Belle easily ranks as the finest Disney female leading character in that she wants something more out of life than a prince, which is more than can be said for all of the other Disney princesses. With his physical attractiveness serving as an ironic contrast to the Beast's deceiving outer looks and his willingness to do whatever it takes to force Belle to marry him, Gaston makes for an excellent even underrated Disney villain. I must also compliment the storytellers on a job well done with making the Beast a complex creature that is stuck in between being either a hero or a semi-villain. You can tell that he's stuck between doing the right thing and doing something that will only please himself in the film's first half. Between the way he was designed by the animators and the way the Beast conveys his internal struggles from this spell, everything about this character was handled impeccably. The other side characters are well done. I personally enjoyed Lumiere, the candlestick, the best. I loved his elegant charm which is shown in full display when he's singing in the "Be Our Guest" musical number. I also liked his simple mindedness when it comes to how long it takes for someone to develop a romantic relationship. Cogsworth is another great side character between his loyalty to the Beast and how he sometimes needs to act as his conscience. Also, the film's central message about looking past the outer looks of certain people or creatures and into their soul is a virtuous message to get across to kids. Sometimes, what we all seek for in life is in the last place we'd look at and what Belle eventually discovers in the Beast is no exception. "Beauty and the Beast" is easily one of the studio's finest films. The animation is stunning, the music is sensational, the characters are excellent, and the story is well told and well-paced. It's one of the rare Disney films that adults might enjoy even more than their kids. See this film if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece for movie lovers of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I reluctantly attended the showing of this film with my grandchildren, and sat through the entire movie absolutely mesmerized. Not only does this film retain its charm and appeal throughout every frame, it faithfully expresses the human condition as all great fairy tales were meant to do. While the songs are top notch and energetic, Paige O'Hara's voice is picture perfect as Belle, the girl who doesn't seem to fit in with her surroundings. I was blown away when I discovered it was Robby Benson doing the voice of the Beast, and he is perfectly cast. However, it is the story which kept me in rapt attention. Fully encapsulating Carl Jung's theory of depth psychology, the theme of the movie is psychological wholeness, that every man has an inner female (the anima) and every woman has an inner male (the animus), and that wholeness can never come into fruition until both male and female compliment one another. This isn't the story of two separate individuals, it is the story of one person -- the viewer -- being given the chance to explore their feminine/masculine inner self, and becoming complete. Nominated for Best Picture, it should have won, if not for the dreary nastiness of Silence of the Lambs. Hollywood will never be ready to admit the cartoon is as valid a movie art form as live acting, and that's a shame. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only "The Silence of the Lambs" was not on the way, this movie could be the first animation to win Oscar as best picture. The characters are so alive, the music and songs are very entertaining, and the storyline is great.The most memorable character is actually Lumiere. But other characters are also very well-developed.Robby Benson is great as the Beast. He gets into character perfectly and is able to give the audience the right feeling at the right moment.In terms of entertainment, it still looses out to both "Aladdin" and "The Little Mermaid". In terms of movie as a whole, maybe it's better. However, I still prefer the other two movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, and my most favorite movie of all time!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful Disney film is just magical and great, with its fun songs and touching story. I remember going on the Disney website and looking at the top 20 animated features of all the time, and guess what... This movie was #1!!!!!! Right when I saw that on the page, my face was starting to get really happy, while my eyeballs were wide open and my eyebrows were going up. My sister and I used to watch this movie when we were kids, about eight years ago, when I was seven and she was ten. I think this film is a very important masterpiece, and a lot of people would agree with me, because of all the things I just said. But who really makes this a worth-seeing movie is the heroine, Belle (also known as 'the Beauty'), because she is gorgeous and sweet all the time, plus is even considered to be the best Disney heroine of all time. She even resembles me in a nice and neat way, because I love to read books, see the good in everybody around me, and even willing to be selfless for everyone in the world. Most of the songs made it to the top 100 Disney songs of all time, with the exception of the Mob Song and Human Again. But Be Our Guest and Beauty and the Beast were really high the list. So if you are a Disney or romance fan, this definitely worth seeing. Verdict: 12 out of 10; Way Beyond Perfect!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the beast is beautiful. It may sound a little gay to some, but they can go to hell. Beauty and the beast is one of the best animated films. I mean before Pixar came along, it was one of the best animated films ever. I was one of the rare few who loved The Aristorcats, my favorite. Beauty and the beast is a sad and romantic epic that was actually nominated for Best picture. Not best animated picture, best picture. Might I say, it damn well deserved it. Beauty and the beast was my favorite film of 1991. I ma sorry to say this, but I'm not going to go into the plot with you because I don't want to spoil any of the beauty for you. There aren't many voice talents, but they are great anyways. Angela Lansbury(Murder, she wrote), who I think has a cute voice, is cute as a teapot. Jerry Orbach is pretty funny as the candle. Those are really the only famous voice talents. The film is fantastic enough without voice talents. Like The Little Mermaid, the film is cute and an eyeful. I really had a great time with Beauty and the beast. it's a great film filled with story and it's one of the best animated films ever. Beauty and the Beast is true beauty and it's a beauty film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite of all the Disney films, I just love all the aspects of the film- the music, the story, the characters and the animation.It has stayed a favourite of mine since I first watched it on video. Beauty and the Beast has always been one of my favourite fairy tales and the film does justice to the spirit of the story. I really like the characters, I don't think there was one that I didn't like but my favourites have to be Belle voiced by Paige O'Hara, Lumiere voiced by Jerry Orbach and Cogsworth voiced by David Ogden Stiers.The songs also make the film what it is, they are so catchy and you can't stop yourself singing along to these wonderful, jolly songs.The animation is amazing and I know how so much has happened since the film came out and the technology has moved on considerably but it was breathtaking at the time particularly the ball room scene which has been talked about a lot and quite rightly.It is a good film to watch when you have had a bad day, it is sure to brighten your day up again.</fullReview>

We also saw this in the IMAX a few years ago, and not only did I love it, I adored it, too. Since then, it renewed my love for Disney musicals. And now, watching it on DVD, it just keeps getting better and better every single time I see it. They say that most Disney movies are meant for kids, but they're really meant for the entire family, no matter how old you are. The only thing though, the beast might be quite scary for littlest kids, so make sure you're supervising them when they watch it. Oh, I neglected to mention that this film will be re-released again next year, in 3D! (Is this enough to grab your attention?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's beautifully animated twist on de Beaumont's famous fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite French Fairy tales. I am terribly in particular about stories from different countries.Based upon Madame Le Prince de Beaumont's famous fairy tale (with a few twists here and there), this film is about a beautiful young peasant woman named Belle is considered strange by the villagers because her preference for reading books and dislike of being courted by the local hero, Gaston, who is an egomaniac and 'positively primeval'. At one point Gaston offers his hand in marriage to Belle,but she rejects and this serves a hard blow to Gaston's ego.While traveling to a fair, Maurice who is Belle's father and an eccentric inventor , becomes lost and loses his horse Phillipe in the night as wolves chase him. Cold and tired, he stumbles upon a mysterious castle and enters it. One by one, the enchanted household items, Lumi?re the candelabra, Mrs. Potts the teapot and Cogsworth the clock and head of the household warmly welcome him and shelter him from the cold. But a horrifying Beast discovers Maurice and, in a fury, locks him in a dungeon on top of the castle tower. Belle, who worries when Phillipe, returns home without him, decides to seek out her father. Eventually, Belle winds up at the Beast's castle. She finds him at the tower dungeon and tries to break him free, but the Beast catches her instead. She offers herself in exchange for her father's life, against his wishes. The Beast agrees and releases her father. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.I love the film's prologue, told in stained glass windows, with David Ogden Stiers' (Cogsworth) narration. And I also love the scene where Belle asks if she can see her father and the magic mirror reveals that Maurice is lost and sick in the forest. The Beast, having fallen in love with Belle, releases her to rescue her father; even though his heart is breaking and he would give up his humanity. I do love Belle, beside being a bookworm (just like me, my mom and my grandmother), she is strong-willed, and not a slave to petty superficial things - being a house-wife and raising children. She is also independent and allow herself to see inner beauty without sacrificing her own values. Belle is a perfect role-model for girls. Beauty and the Beast was also the first animated movie to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Movie of 1991, and had an equally successful adaptation for Broadway in 1994.Overall I love this film - from beginning to end, and you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best I would say this version; the French version made in 1946 and the 1987 "Canon Movie Tales" version are the best to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet and Beautiful Love Story that Happens to be a Kids Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is arguably one of the best Disney films ever (second only to The Hunchback of Notre Dame), as well as one of the most touching love stories of all time. The relationship between Belle and the Beast is both funny and endearing, the songs are remarkably good, and the animation is beautiful. A lot of the humour is very witty (even though most of it was childish, it can also give the parents a chuckle or two), and, while it is quite violent for a kid's movie, it gives very good messages; the most poignant of which is "appearances aren't everything".It's based on a very old story, but it has been altered to become Disney-fied. Belle (French for "beautiful") is a gorgeous but odd girl who confounds her entire town with her looks and strange ways. Her father is an inventor, ridiculed as well for his seeming madness, though everyone accepts that he's harmless. When Belle's father goes off to enter his wood-chopping invention at the fair, he gets lost and stumbles into a strange castle inhabited by living objects, like clocks, candelabras, feather dusters and teapots. However, his warm welcome at the castle is cut short when a ferocious beast appears and locks him away. When her father doesn't return home (but his horse does), Belle goes off in search of him, only to find the castle herself and to exchange herself for her father. The Beast keeps her prisoner, in hopes that she will fall in love with him and break the spell that has been cast over him and his servants. But between the Beast's temper, Belle's stubbornness, and the constant plotting of muscle-man Gaston, determined to win Belle at any cost, this won't be so easy...As I said before, the relationship between Belle and the Beast is funny and endearing - funny, because at first, they can't stand each other. The Beast appears crude and frightening, and Belle is determined to be as difficult as possible. Once they begin to bond, however, a different kind of comedy emerges - the Beast is hilariously awkward and eager to please (though he isn't really sure how), and Belle is gently guiding him in the ways of human interaction. It's endearing for almost the same reason - essentially, the film turns from a tale of a jailer and captor's unexpected romance, into the story of two outcasts who find both acceptance and love in each other. The music is wonderful (again, as I said before), especially the songs "Gaston", "There May be Something There (That Wasn't There Before)" and the eternal classic "Beauty and the Beast", sung by the teapot character Mrs Potts, voiced by Angela Lansbury. The lyrics are at times funny, at times poetic, at times somewhere in between. The merging of the timeless love story, the conflict and drama, the humour, the songs, the animation, and the classic Disney talking things that shouldn't talk creates a thing of beauty. The story of a pair of oddities who fall for each other; the story of a man who was a monster; the story of a beast who learns to love; the story of the girl who taught him how. Truly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know that animations tend to get overlooked, as many believe that they are directed towards the children audience. Well, in some cases that is true, but this one is anything but. The Lion King is widely considered the best animation of all time, and it certainly is spectacular, but Beauty and the Beast elevates the level of animations to an unprecedented level. To be honest, it doesn't feel like a child's tale at all, with some themes being rather mature (although there is no inappropriate for a child). As with all Disney animations, imagery and symbolism is frequent, but in this case it works flawlessly. Characterization is utterly spectacular, and the characters themselves are perfectly designed. The music is enthralling, and the character songs are once again top notch. While children will certainly enjoy this, adults will be even more astonished at how masterfully crafted this animation is. To this day, it is the only animation to be nominated for Best Picture, and it should have won that as it truly was the best film of the year. Believe me, this movie is that good. If you haven't seen it, do so as soon as possible, because there are only a handful of movies that are actually better than this. Remember, this might be an animation, but if you look past its exterior, and absorb the message of the film, you will discover that it is something much more...it is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Beauty and the Beast' remains the first, and likely only, animated film to ever be nominated for the Oscar's Best Picture. It is perhaps the highest accolade ever bestowed on the world of animation, that they could compete with the best of Hollywood's live-action batch. It was and still is an honor very much deserved by this Disney classic. And years later, 'Beauty and the Beast' stands as a remarkable testament to the power of cinema.In a scene where Pixar appropriately dominates the field with stellar computer animation and heart-warming stories for kids and adults, it takes a film like 'Beauty and the Beast' to remind us all of the wonders Disney was able to accomplish. Of all the classics they have churned out throughout the years, this must be one of their finest. It is a simple story, but one that will sweep you off your feet with magic and enchantment.A classic story of unexpected love, a tale as old as time. One prince's curse to find the inner beauty leaves him a hideous beast, trapped to a lonely life in a vast castle. The arrival of Belle, a charming local, in a quest to find her father sparks the beginning of a true fairytale as she herself struggles to find the tenderness beneath the Beast's thick skin. It is a story for the ages, with sparks of magical imagination found in every beautiful frame of Disney's animation. It is not limited only to the youngsters, as 'Beauty and the Beast' has enough carefully constructed layers that will appeal to viewers of all ages.Touched with treasures of charm, romance, wit, and dazzling musical numbers, 'Beauty and the Beast' is an unforgettable portrait of love filled with memorable characters. From our two main characters to an castle full of enchanted objects. The brilliant presence of Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip light up the screen and bring a smile to your face. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a film to be cherished time after time, a truly great film with a warm message of love and acceptance. A breathtaking and spellbinding experience that remains a timeless classic.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Before and After "Beauty and the Beast"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To date, my favorite animated Disney film.In 1938, Walt Disney received a special Academy Award for producing "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and bringing a new standard to motion picture cartoons. Then in 1941, the Academy gave "Fantasia" a couple of special awards as another watermark animated film. "Beauty and the Beast" deserves to stand along side both of those films as one that changed animated films forever. For me, there are animated films before "Beauty" and after. Not since Disney's very first animated films ("Snow White," "Pinnochio") had one blended music and story so masterfully. But what sets "Beauty" apart from others is, strangely enough, the acting. The voice work is so perfectly matched with the way the characters are drawn that it's almost possible to forget you're watching two-dimensional creations.An enchanting film.Grade: A+</fullReview>

The storyline of the movie was excellent and the drawing was excellent. The love story was wonderful as well. The only downside to this movie is that there are annoying tea cups and candle sticks that make jokes. Disney always has something with eyes and a jabbering mouth and it can get weird.I liked the part where Gaston has that wedding and he hasn't even proposed to the bride or went on one date with her.

		<shortDescription>Perfection (almost)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great animated feature films of all time plain and simple. To say that it is anything short of great would be an insult. Winning two Oscars and being nominated for four others (including being nominated for best picture), this film truly broke the bounds of what animation can really do and put Disney on the map as a production company not only for kids but for all audiences.The music is fantastic, some of the best I've ever heard. All of the songs succeed in not only being catchy and whimsical but also with developing the plot and furthering the development of both the characters and the story. The songs run through different genres of tune and pitch while still maintaining a central sound and general feel. The characters are also some of Disney's best. Belle will always be my favorite Disney princess, she has too many good qualities to not be. Her character, despite her name being the French word for beauty, isn't focused around her looks entirely, instead focusing more so on her existential feelings of just wanting to find something greater than herself. This along with Paige O'Hara's terrific job as the voice, bringing the character to life and performing excellently in all of her musical numbers. The Beast, voiced by Robby Benson, is wonderful too in his journey that takes him to understand compassion which is done beautifully. Gaston, voiced by Opera singer Richard White, is fantastic as the movie's villain. Normally in any other Disney movie Gaston would play the part of the dashing handsome man who woos the heart of the main heroin, but this movie takes a delightful twist that may be painfully obvious to some, but to me is wonderful nonetheless. The supporting cast is great too. Legends like Jerry Orbach(Lumiere), Angela Lansbury(Mrs. Potts), and David Ogden Stiers(Cogsworth) add their talents to the film and just make it all the more grand.The animation is also so wonderful. The town looks great, the castle looks great, the woods look great, the people, the animals and everything else just looks beautiful and still can manage to take my breath away.Now with all of my seemingly endless praise for the film out of the way I have to address the films one flaw. The one thing holding this film back from being perfect is one thing that I absolutely can't stand. The ending. For those that haven't seen the film please don't read the rest of this review. The ending scene where the beast turns human just could've been done better. If the movie had ended the same way as Shrek (another great movie) and the beast would've stayed a monster, the movie would've been so much stronger. The whole movie is trying to convey a message of "beauty isn't skin deep" and all that jazz but if this is what they are trying to convey, then why does the beast have to become handsome for there to be a happy ever after? Wasn't the fact that a beautiful young woman could fall in love with a giant hairy monster the driving emphasis behind the whole freaking movie?But in conclusion, this movie is wonderful. I would without a doubt recommend checking it out and seeing for yourself what a great piece of animation this really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as old as time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Song as old as rhyme. In a way that's the perfect way to sum up this film. In many ways the magnum opus of the Disney Animation Studios. The first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Picture category, still considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, a classic beloved by children and adults alike, a timeless tale about hatred turned into love, love twisted into hatred, about redemption, determination, sacrifice and willpower. An all-around good film, easily one of my favourite Disney films, and one of my favourite films in general.You all know the story. You know Belle, Beast, Gaston, Lumi?re, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts. You know the songs, the castle, the quiet French village. You know about the rose and the mirror, about the curse. You've all seen this movie already. And if for some baffling reason you haven't, you probably still know how the story goes. So I'm not going to talk about that. It's a great story, one of the best. That's all you need to know.Instead, let me talk about what this movie has taught me. Belle taught me about being different, about being the odd one in a crowd. She taught me that it's okay to read, to dream, to stand up against the opinion of the many. Beast taught me about the importance of what's inside. He taught me that no matter who we are or what we look like or where we come from, it's what we do, how we act, how we treat others, that matters. Gaston taught me about the meaninglessness of public opinion. His popularity taught me that I had to make my own choices, that leaders are fallible, that good looks can hide twisted morals and empty souls. The servants of the castle taught me about loyalty. Maurice, Belle's father, taught me about not giving up. Belle and Beast together taught me about love. Their romance is considered to be one of Disney's finest for a reason.Beauty and the Beast, to me, is one of those perfect films. Yes, you can nitpick and say, for example, that the CGI effects have aged a little bit in certain scenes. But what truly matters is the quality of the story. And I adore this story. It shaped me, as a child. It helped me grow into a better man, a better human being. And for that it has my eternal gratitude, respect and love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few things that's not so cool about this movie. It gets old after watching it more than three times, some of the songs aren't very good, and the beast yelling is disturbing. I like the characters, and Gaston is one of the coolest and funniest villain in any Disney movie. He want to Mary Belle, and kill the beast. Disney could have done better with this movie! There were a few funny moments, like when Gaston fell in the mud, and Belle's father sneezing on a clocks face. There's a scene near the end where Gaston gets into a big fight with the Beast, and stabs him with a knife. A little bit of violence and heavy for a kids flick right there, eh? It was okay, I wouldn't see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical Disney classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazingly, up until now, I had never seen this movie. I'd seen The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, but not Beauty and the Beast. I'm really disappointed I never saw this movie till now because it's pretty great. I can certainly see why it is one of the 3 animated films that was nominated for Best Picture. The whole film feels extremely grandeur and epic in scale, especially the scene where Belle and the Beast dance. All the side characters are entertaining, and I'm really glad none of them were obnoxious and overbearing. One of the best things about this film is the fact that Belle and the Beast actually spent time with one another and developed a connection. At least more than other Disney films anyway. They felt more real than say Aladdin and Jasmine or Ariel and whatever that guy's name was. I'm really jealous of anyone who got to see this in the theater. It's a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, but until they hopefully re-release it, I'll keep watching it at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast in in the top three of all time Disney films in my book. Everything about this movie was spot on. The storyline of falling in love with the Beast despite his appearance and being repulsed by Gaston in spite of his handsomeness was inspiring and rings true today. The special effects were amazing, and I absolutely LOVED Chip. And, finally, the songs. What can you say but, WOW! Disney films always have a good soundtrack, but Beauty and the Beast(both versions) are simply put, perfection. This movie is just as great today as it was in 1992 and it deserves its status as a classic and I would love to see it appreciated by a new generation of kids and adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's A Classic But The Book Could've Worked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before any hate comments I like to point out like I said in the title, it's a classic and I like it. It has a good story, great animation, wonderful music etc. but after reading the plot of Beauty and the Beast book on Wikipedia I think it could've worked better. In the original, Belle is one of the six children in a wealthy merchant family, now you might think she'll be bratty or selfish and all that clichd stuff but really she sounds very nice and kind, as of course Disney had adopted the personality into the movie so credit for that. Though the sisters really have that 'ugly step sister' appeal like from Cinderella treating Belle like a servant and secretly taunt her. The merchant lost his wealth in a storm and was forced to live in a small farmhouse. Years later, the merchant, found out that one of his ships had survived the causality and returned to the city to find out in the end that wealth has been seized to pay off his debt. Beforehand, thinking that the ship might have something valuable promised his daughters some jewels and dresses and Belle a rose, which is from the beast's garden, more of the plot can be seen on Wikipedia. The book's plot pretty much works better then Disney's adaptation and as I said before, the movie is a classic. But I love stories that has also have no villains, Gaston is a really memorable villain, not plotting revenge or wanting to kill someone, well minus beast so he can win Belle, but not for glory. He's just pompous, self-centred person. But films like 'My Neighbour Totoro' works without a villain, it's shows the struggle of the main character. As much as I love this film and its story, the book version would've been a better choice to adapt. As of the movie. I love the side characters and climax, and I do accept the Disney version by the way. The songs are fun and the animation very fluid and colourful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's Most Memorable Features.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Effortlessly enduring the test of time, Beauty and the Beast manages to retain the same flair &amp; charm that made it an instant classic during its time of release, The story covers the relationship between a beast who once was a prince before he was turned into a monster as a punishment for his selfishness &amp; a young, beautiful woman named Belle who is imprisoned in his castle.Elegantly presented with pleasant songs, heartwarming music &amp; superb use of imagination as well as humour, the film even today manages to grip its viewers into its fairy tale right from the opening moments. The animation is dazzling, voice acting is impressive, each frame is finely detailed plus the story is very well narrated &amp; paced too.On an overall scale, Beauty and the Beast isn't the best ever Disney film in my book but it surely is amongst the most memorable ones. Its message i.e. "looks never really matter when you own a f*cking castle :P" is heard loud &amp; clear and makes sense even today. One of Walt Disney's finest offerings that works even better as an enchanting story of love, Beauty and the Beast is a delightful musical that should still appeal equally to people of all ages. Just go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of the best Disney films I have ever seen. The story was very creative, the music was standout, the characters were great, the animation was breathtaking, and the voice cast was good. It does better than The Little Mermaid in everything, with the exception of the characters.Don't get me wrong, Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara), the main protagonist, I consider her to be one of the best Disney heroines ever created, but I do not think she was as good as Ariel, mainly due to their interests. Belle is a bibliophile, where Ariel from The Little Mermaid, is more interested in adventure. The other characters, Beast (Robby Benson), Belle's love interest, Maurice (Rex Everhart), Belle's father, Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), the candle, Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), the clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), the teapot, Gaston (Richard White), the main antagonist, and LeFou (Jesse Corti), Gaston's dimwitted henchman, are all great characters.I highly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best love stories ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best love stories told by Disney. Belle is one of Disney's best heroines. Her &amp; Ariel were both refreshing. Belle took it a step further. Belle gives people the message not to judge a book by its cover. I can relate to Belle because people think I'm odd. She brought the beast back to life. This was the last great fairytale made by Disney. Tangled &amp; The Princess &amp; the Frog don't compare. Beauty &amp; the Beast is probably the best Disney movie in history. Many people say TheLion King is the best Disney movie but I think that film is a bit overrated. The soundtrack for this film is great. This movie &amp; along with Sleeping Beauty are Disney's most artistic movies. I think this film deserves the hype it gets. It deserved to be nominated for best picture. Its too bad it didn't win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best, and my favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I think one of Disney's best animated features, either cartoon short or full-length animated feature film. It is also my favorite Disney movie, about a Beast (an enchanted prince) who has been losing hope to learn to love and be loved in return in order to break the enchanted spell, until he meets Belle. Belle offers to stay in the castle with the Beast in exchange for her imprisoned father to be set free. What follows is a beautiful love story in how Belle attempts to tame the Beast as he learns the proper manners to be a gentleman from her, and attempting to learn to love and be loved in return.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a marvelous job directing this movie, providing a solid plot that offered a captivating, exciting and heartwarming story of adventure, courage and love. The chemistry between Belle and the Beast will capture your heart and probably put a lump in your throat; it is captured in a way that sent a strong message of changing one's way for the better, humility and acts of selflessness.The characters, especially the enchanted objects, are very lovable and extraordinary, each one giving his/her own unique charm, including: Lumiere, a lovestruck, suave-talking candelabra; Cogsworth, a pompous and prim table clock; Mrs. Potts, the kind-hearted and warm teapot; and Chip, Mrs. Potts' son and an inquisitive teacup. I love the constant competition between Lumiere and Cogsworth as they try to win Belle's liking and command of the castle's duties. All the objects provided the right touch of humor and comedy for a dramatic love story.Alan Menken did a great job on the music score - very spirited, lively and moving. And, my hat is off to some of the greatest songs, by Menken and Howard Ashman, in cinema history: Be Our Guest and Beauty and the Beast. Lumiere and Mrs. Potts (Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury) sang "Be Our Guest" during a grand dinner for Belle. As the enchanted objects performed dances and acrobats to the song, it gave what I think are some of the best pieces of animation work in history. Just the unveiling of the chandelier and the Eiffel Tower forming under a bevy of wineglasses are breathtaking. And, the song "Beauty and the Beast," sung by Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), is a beautiful and stirring song that basically summarizes the entire movie - "tale as old as time," "sweet and strength," "finding you can change," "Beauty and the Beast." Other memorable characters I like to mention are the conceited and villainous Gaston (Richard White), the slapstick and somewhat clueless LeFou (Jesse Corti) and the brilliant and bold inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart).There is never a slow or dull moment in this movie - it is thoroughly entertaining and exciting from start to finish. This movie definitely has that "Disney touch," which makes it that much more special. It is the perfect one for audiences of all ages, one to watch again and again and, for myself, will remain my favorite Disney film, animated feature in general and one of my favorite movies of all time.Grade A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be younger again in the early 1990's. And be hyped about movies like Beauty and the Beast the 1991 cartoon version. Back at that time we had another pretty young girl falling in love with an outcast. But this is blended with a transformed monster, and both lively songs and at times dramatic background music. A young girl named Belle ends up in a castle after her father is lost in a spooky forest. Up there lives some cursed people as teapots and on. Now Belle must make the beast good. But the young and strong village hunter faces the beast at the end. There are memorable songs spoofed in many movies and shows. Even I danced to it under a show for artists as younger. If you want classic good versus evil love stories watch this. That was good enough for it's surprising Oscar nomination for Best Movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films Of The Disney Renaissance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has created a few classic princess fairy tale films in the past, so does Beauty and the Beast still matter? Simply yes. In comparison to the other princess films in the Disney Renaissance, this tops it but overall it isn't my favorite. The Disney Renaissance was film after film executed with brilliance and there are four films that would almost always be chosen either one as the best of the pack; The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. I fall in the group that thinks Aladdin is the strongest film but either one are great enough to be number one.The story team for this film, did a great job as they meshed the melodramatic tale ,that is commonly found in the Disney princess films of the past, with modern dialogue and humor that appeals to the newer generation. With Disney animated films, I expect to see funny side characters. The difference between the old Disney and the new Disney is that somehow the most memorable element of the cast is the supporting cast rather than the main star. With Disney's old films, the main characters were the memorable ones for me. The film is an endearing, feel good, romantic story; with hilarious dialogue; that will appeal to all ages.This film was directed by Gary Tousdale and Kirk Wise, and this film was their debut in directing a Disney animated full length feature. What a great way to start, they created a film that is now regarded as a classic and was the first animated feature to be nominated with Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I think they took the best things about The Little Mermaid and added other things that work. Their next directorial efforts for Disney did not achieve close to what they have done for this, although those films did gain a cult following.I felt that The Little Mermaid and The Rescuers Down Under in comparison did not have that beautiful cinematography that Beauty and the Beast shows. It's cinematography is one of the main reasons why so much of this film work, whether it's the beautiful and dramatic lighting or the way the "camera" moves in a particular scene. An example would be the scene where both Belle and the Beast had a romantic dance in the ballroom; the scene was lit gorgeously and the iconic moment when the "camera" starts from the chandelier and glides its way down to them dancing. I felt that this aspect of the film should have been awarded with something.As expected from a Disney film, it is going to contain musical numbers in it. I don't usually mind it as it allows the animators to show off something daring and outrageous. I feel that the songs in this film are much more accessible and beautiful, like 'Be Our Guest' and 'Gaston', rather than something grand and iconic, Lion King, or as fun and daring, Aladdin. Be Our Guest and Gaston are definitely the favorite of mine. Be Our Guest due to it feeling like a Broadway musical and Gaston because it is so ridiculously egotistic that it is entertaining. Also pretty much who has seen the film, would remember the words "Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme". The soundtrack is wonderful but I don't feel any of it out trumps Aladdin's 'A Whole New World' or Lion King's 'Circle of Life'.The voices of the film fit well for the characters and certainly gives the characters a bit of personality. The animators did a wonderful job drawing the characters as they look very clean and attractive. The animators pushed hard on this film as large amounts of objects or people move in one shot, and each movement has a personality of its own. Cogsworth and Lumiere are one of the best character duos ever animated on Disney.The film is an icon of its own and definitely ranks in one of the top romance films of all time. Beauty and the Beast is a film that would be competing against films like Casablanca and Gone with the Wind in deciding which melodramatic romance film is the best. If you are looking for a great romantic film or a Disney film that hits all of its marks then this is that film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many pros, 1 con</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is arguably one of Disney's best movies. It's like one of the first animated movies to be nominated for best picture (The Jungle Book was supposed to be the first animated movie nominated for that award, but many disagree b/c it's a children's movie and all that &amp; the lion king should've been nominated too). It should have won in my opinion, but I'll save that for another time.This movie has so many wonderful things that make it fantastic. The songs are memorable, I recently watched it and I know every song by heart (except human again). The songs are amazing and romantic and funny. I can't stop listening to Belle (the song) and Be Our Guest! Belle is one of Disney's best heroines (the others being Esmeralda from HOND and Pocahontas). She can read!!!! I've looked up to her so much when I was younger and I love that she saw the beast as a kind man; even though the beast acted like a jerk for half the movie. She's kind, clever, and she can read! I found many wonderful things about this movie like the sidekicks, the animation, the message, etc. Now lets talk about Gaston!Gaston is probably one of the worst Disney villains ever! He's not Scar or Ursula who are actually evil! Gaston is a selfish jerk who just wants a lady. He didn't do anything evil except for the mob scene. But as humans, we tend to want something that we can't have (ie: having Josh Hutcherson as my boyfriend). If you want to see a human like villain actually do something, go watch Cinderella or The Rescuers.Otherwise, this movie is fantastic! It has wonderful songs, a fierce leading lady, a wonderful romance between belle and the beast, and Lumi?re which is one of my favorite characters. Please watch this classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's greatest ever movies and is a very well-known tale; a 'tale as old as time' some people might say! The main character, Belle, is often referred to as the Greatest Disney character of all time. The movie has gorgeous graphics, an amazing score and beautiful songs, such as Beauty and the Beast (Tale as Old as Time), Be Our Guest and Belle making it a timeless classic that almost everybody loves. The fact that this great movie was returning to cinemas delighted me. I saw the 3D version of this film and loved it! It was even better than I remembered it! Unfortunately, the 3D wasn't very good but it is a spectacular experience nevertheless. This movie is simply amazing - everyone must own a copy of this classic Disney movie. Seeing as it is out of the 'Disney Vault' at the moment, I recommend those who don't have it buy it now! It is an epic movie for all age groups that you will want to watch over and over again. To conclude, Beauty and the Beast is one of the greatest Disney movies ever and is a must have for your household!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Disney classic,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty And The Beast is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. It's an absolute classic, and it became one almost immediately, it's one of Walt Disney Animations greatest films and it still holds up today as a movie that is both beautifully animated and has an inspired story. I felt like the film could have shown us more of Beast's origins, it describes it at the beginning very quickly, it should have jumped in to this back story more seriously and shown us how Prince Adam turned in to this beast, I would have also liked to see how this effected characters such as Lumiere and Cogsworth. The characters is in this film are terrific and are some of Disney's most memorable, Belle and Beast are great of course, but the stars of this movie for me are the talking cutlery, I love the movement and voice-over work of Lumiere, Cogsworth, Chip and Mrs Pott, and whenever I watch this they are always what I look forward to the most. Outstanding animation and voice cast, beautiful music numbers and a breathtaking story, Beauty and the Beast is fun for all ages and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. A woman is trapped away in a castle with a prince who has turned into a beast, after a relationship begins to develop between the two, it looks as if the curse could finally be lifted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20+ Years Later and it's Still one of the Best Disney Movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is Disney's 30th full-length animated feature released in 1991. Following the successes of "The Little Mermaid" and the much underrated "Resucers Down Under," Beauty and the Beast succeeded all expectations and made motion picture history by becoming the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1992 (it lost to Silence of the Lambs). Even though it didn't win Best Picture from the Academy, it's still a classic Disney film that is a favorite of many (including myself). It is the story of Belle (voice by Paige O'Hara), a beautiful young girl who, after her father is taken captive and imprisoned by the Beast (voiced by Robby Benson), goes to find him and take his place as the Beast's prisoner. While imprisoned, she meets a whole host of enchanted objects that were all once human but, because of the Beast's stubborness, he and the entire castle were placed under a spell that could only be broken if the Beast learned to love another and earn her love in return before the last petal on the rose fell. Some of the characters are: Lumiere the lovestruck candle (voiced by Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth the pompous clock (voiced by David Ogden Stiers who was also narrator), Mrs. Potts the kind-hearted teapot (voiced by Angela Lansbury), and Chip (voiced by Bradley Michael Pierce) who is your typical 8-year old boy. Every Disney movie has its antagonist (villain). Here it's Gaston (voiced by Richard White) an arrogant, heartless hunter who wants Belle at all costs. Once Belle falls in love with the Beast, Gaston's jealousy grows and Belle realizes that he's the true monster and Beast is more humane. This is a true classic: great story, great characters, great animation, and great music score/songs composed by Academy-Award Winning composers Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, who sadly died of AIDS six months before the film was released and never got to see how successful the film would become. I love the tribute to him at the end of the credits: "To our friend Howard, who gave a Mermaid her voice and a Beast his soul. We will be forever grateful." The song that will stick with you is "Beauty and the Beast," sung during the ballroom dancing scene (Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson did a good job singing it too). This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of gender. I grew up loving this movie (and all the other Disney classics on VHS), and I'm a guy who loves sports! All that being said, this is definitely one of my top 10 favorite Disney movies!!! Rating: 9/10!!!</fullReview>

It also of course is the basis of the hit musical.With great voice talent and lovely songs this film can be enjoyed by all the family.

		<fullReview>Why are the animation movies better than the regular movies. I know this is a Classic and has been around for years and years but all the same, it's just so well done, like many of the other original animation movie that have come out in the last decade. Toy Story, The Incredibles, and the lot. I know Beauty and the Beast has been around forever, but it just makes me realize that most regular movies are crap. No one takes their time to make movies anymore. It's just the same regurgitation over and over, except if it's a art house or original movie, and then in that case, we don't get to see them in the theaters and they never make the light of day. It's always the same people and groups in and making the movies that go to the theaters. But Beauty and the Beast, although old, was refreshing. This movie was beautiful, the story, the songs, the character, everything. I was so happy watching the movie I felt like a kid again. It was Magical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While The Little Mermaid takes my number one spot on favourite Disney animated films, Beauty and the Beast is a close second. Jodi Benson has a beautiful voice as Ariel and Page O'Hara is just as incredible as Belle.What makes me love Beauty and the Beast so much is not the musical aspect, although Howard Ashman's lyrics are genuine and Alan Menken's scores are some of my favourite, beside Danny Elfman, it's the plot of Beauty and the Beast that wins my heart.Beauty and the Beast is a typical story of the ugly duckling (Beast) winning the affections of the beauty (Belle). While in most cases back in the day, the roles were reversed and it would be Belle who was unattractive winning the heart of a handsome prince. In these modern times, it's so rare to see a beautiful girl with an average looking or under-average looking guy.Disney goes beyond the normal lengths of this basic premise and really touches our hearts. Belle comes to love the Beast's inner beauty. Sure, it's not realistic as a beast like a bear cannot speak, nor could a human fall in love with an animal. I put aside the realism need I have, and just enjoy the film for it's entertainment purposes.Musically, this is my top film from Disney. It's not Page O'Hara alone that wins me over, but it's the entire cast. Alan Menken is my second favourite composer and each one of his film scores are different. Aladdin and Mermaid aren't anything alike, but it's by him. Howard's lyrics are unforgettable. I think the great part of Beauty and the Beast, musically, is that out of ninety minutes of film, eighty-five minutes have some form of music in it.Aside from plot and music, Beauty and the Beast is well-crafted animation-wise. It's so perfect and gives me chills at certain moments. I love to listen to the soundtrack, but when I watch the film, I get all tingly. Angela Landsbury's performance is outstanding, my favourite scene has got to be the transformation. It's depressing and lovely. It's a hauntingly beautiful and tragic scene that lifts your spirits when the fireworks kick in.It's a great film for the family, especially the kids. It's not just for kids, though, because at the age of 21, I'm giving it an eight out of ten and I still love it to this day and I still listen to the soundtrack all the time. Disney is meant for everyone. Beauty and the Beast is a classic and will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absorbing, Magical Piece of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like several others, grew up with films like this as a child, and this was one of those that always stood out. When I first saw it I was about five and I think you can tell that a few of the scenes scared me quite a bit, given the Beast's anger-filled scenes with the darker parts of the film. But seeing the film again for the first time in over ten years it was both refreshing and easy to still remember.The story, style and execution all feel like something out of a Shakespearean play, and while I've never been much of a fan of old William I do tend to like other stories that have similar styles to him, which I will admit to being both a testament to this film and Shakespeare. One of the film's strongest points is that it easily manages to make several emotions arise out of the viewer, ranging from laughter to sorrow and several others (with a fair number of these instances coming out of the most briefest of scenes, a very rare case for any film). There are several scenes in the film that are both serious and dark with others that are light and funny; it seems that for every serious moment there's a scene of clever comic relief to balance the mood out.While I was certainly curious and excited to see this film once again now that I would understand it much easier, one part that I wasn't looking forward to were the singing sections, with me not being a fan of musicals. There actually wasn't as much singing in the film as I remember, I'd say about 40% to 50% of the movie is singing with the rest being dialogue. Even though I can't say that the songs were exactly necessary to the film they do compliment the given scenes very well and while this may be the case with any musical film, the singing sections of this film give it a personality in a positive way, unlike several others.If there was any word I could really use to describe this film it would likely be ironic, not due to anything in the movie itself but more how it compares to others. What's ironic is that this film has a heart and the characters, despite being computer animations and creations with little visual detail (compared to the CGI-heavy films by companies like Pixar) and half the characters being enchanted utensils they still come off as far more human than countless actors in several live action films. Heck, even the Beast comes off as one of the more human characters once his inner feelings and emotions start to come out. If it's not clear by now, the voice-acting in this film is simply superb and, along with the film's beautiful and magical art style is probably its strongest point.Of course that's not to say every other aspect is any less worthy of praise, because this film is one that almost feels like no number of compliments would be enough to justify it. The story, style, acting, score, music, pacing and really every other aspect you could pinpoint in this film are nothing short of superb. If there really is anything that I could say holds the film from perfection it would be that the ending feels rather rushed. While there really isn't much more they probably could've done with the last five minutes beyond what there was it still felt like it went by rather quickly compared to the rest of the film.But this is really the smallest of complaints and something that really does little to detract from the film. When you hear someone say that this is a film for all ages, they're not lying, anyone of any age can love and appreciate this film with ease. This film, along with a number of others, show that Disney were truly at their best before 21st century. With the exception of maybe Pinocchio and The Lion King I can't think of any other film with the same style and genre that is as magical and marvelous as this. If you haven't seen this film in a while or at all and are struggling to find a good film for the whole family, be sure you keep your eye out for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Romance for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "Beauty and the Beast" I was floating around the video store searching for nothing in particular. Then i saw it. I wasn't sure what I was getting my self into, but it was Disney, so I decided to risk it.I'm glad I did. From the very beginning with the stain glass prologue I knew this was magical. I can relate with Belle's dilemma in the beginning, living in a small town where your potential can't be reached, being the black sheep of town for thinking differently than the rest. It was a powerful scene when Belle sacrificed her freedom so that her father could return home and become healthy. It paid off. she fell in love, made new friends, and lived in her own fairy tale.Now some people may say that adding all these other characters was unnecessary. I say, "What's wrong with you?" Let's face it. If the Beast and Belle didn't have other characters to help them get to know each other, Belle would still be in the tower and the Beast would still be a massive jerk. Mrs Potts, Chip, Lumiere, and Cogsworth needed to be in the movie or it wouldn't have moved along as it did.I have to say that Gaston is a villain who changes more than any other in Disney history. In most Disney films, the villain is a dark, sullen creature from the very beginning. Gaston, however starts the movie as a stuck up jerk, much like a Quaterback in high school. He then progresses into the type of evil that ruins the innocent and manipulates the simpleminded to get what he wants. I actually cheered when he fell to his death.From the time after Beast rescues Belle from the wolves, you can tell that a great friendship was blooming. During the Ballroom scene you could see a great love. Some may say that the film proves that a great makeover makes great romance, but if you actually watch the scene, Belle is reluctant to believe the Prince is her love, until she sees the soulful eyes. Belle fell in love with the soul, not the look. It didn't matter if he didn't change, she still loved him. This is one of the great Disney movies with a great message: True love and friendship isn't looks and riches. It's loving someone from the inside out. If Hunchback ended with Esmeralda going with Quasi, it would be a much better film, almost up to par with Beauty and the Beast. If you've never seen it, see it. If you have, see it again. 15/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Second in the Nineties Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film-Beauty and the Beast Rating-G Creator-Walt Disney Feature Animation Release Year-1991With it's classic story, memorable characters, dramatic songs, and under toned villain, this film is one that absolutely deserves it's place in Disney's coveted "Platinum" line of DVDs. Now come along with me as I explore these three sections of the film-the Villain, the DVD, and instead of comic relief, the Music.Gaston is the rude and conceited man who tries to get Belle to marry him through his achievements and looks, and as a child you wouldn't see that this man is the dramatic villain, until the final sequences. His song, "Let's Kill the Beast," truly captures his intentions, and to me, is what truly made this film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.The 2002 Platinum release of this title was dazzling. The disc offered three versions of the film, a beautiful making of feature, wonderful packaging, and of course, silly games for the kids. It's a DVD worth buying, yet maybe not buying to wait for it's upcoming new Platium release in the years to come.And now for probably the best part of this film, the Broadway style music. Composing the film is Alan Menken, the genius behind "The Little Mermaid (1989)" who brings this film to stunning style musically, with it's basis of theatrical dramatic songs, and having the range to do the silly songs as well. And then of course, there is the glue between film and music, the lyricist for the film, the late Howard Ashman. His witty style doesn't dumb down for any age. It's glamor when needed, and fun when wanted, is witty and catchy-these songs will forever stay in your mind. Howard Ashman test HIV positive in production of this film, and died a few months before it's release. Fans of his work know this as his last true film, although he contributed some work to "Aladdin (1992)" though the lyricist for that is mainly Tim Rice. All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a golden triumph among the Golden ages, and should not lose it's place in any home. With it's fabulous villain, magnificent DVD, and genius music, it's no wonder that so many fans find this their favorite Disney film.Walt Disney Pictures Beautiful Classic, Beauty and the Beast</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As is Disney's way, this timeless classic has been adapted to animation complete with talking furniture, dancing dinner wear, and the most villainous villains. All wrapped up with a musical score worthy of the most highly funded Broadway show.This is one of the most endearing works Disney's animation crew has put out in years. As a romantic adventure, it's far above par, even for Disney, and rivals even Snow White in enchanting sweetness.While it's not my personal favorite, it is easily Disney's best animated romantic musical, and as such, it rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beauty and the Beast" truly represents a bygone era in animation. Remember when animated films were unabashedly charming and big hearted before becoming obnoxiously glib, crude, and cynical ("Shrek", "Chicken Little")? And remember when just the right actors were carefully chosen to give voices to the animated characters before every animated film became a hollow, "guess the celebrity" game ("Robots", "Shark Tale")? "B&amp;tB" is filled with emotion, heart, and spirit. The biggest star in the movie was Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), yet "B&amp;tB" will remain a classic long after "Madagascar" and "Open Season" are forgotten. Not to mention that it has the most engaging and likable of the "Disney Princesses". Belle isn't a passive ninny like Snow White, a pushover like Cinderella, dull like Aurora, or a reckless fool like Ariel. She's smart, kind, assertive, brave, and resourceful. She owns up to her mistakes, looks out for others, and knows her own mind. You all know the story: Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) is the daughter of the eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart). Her love of books causes her to be labeled as strange by the narrow-minded citizens of the tiny French village in which she lives. Belle is understandably lonely and bored with her "provincial life". It doesn't help that she's pursued by town celebrity Gaston (Richard White), an insufferably pompous, trigger-happy, chauvinistic nitwit and his ankle-biting sidekick LeFou (Jessi Corti). Gaston has the classic, sexist mentality that "no" means "yes", and that Belle will marry him without so much as courtship or a proposal, leading to a hilarious scene where Belle gives Gaston the humiliating rejection he so richly deserves. One day Maurice disappears on his way to an inventor's fair, and when Belle goes out to search for him, she discovers he's being held prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a horrifying Beast (Robby Benson). Belle nobly takes her father's place as prisoner, at first devastated at losing her freedom, but is soon comforted by the palace's delightful residents: Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), a maternal teapot; Lumiere (dynamically voiced by Jerry Orbach), an amorous candlestick; and Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), an anal retentive clock. What Belle doesn't realize is that the Beast was once a human prince whose cruelty to an enchantress in disguise caused him to be transformed into a monster as punishment (and everyone else in the palace suffered the consequences as well, becoming household objects). And the Beast now must earn someone's love before an enchanted rose loses its final petal (what is it with Disney and deadlines?). There is friction between Belle and the Beast at first (she thinks he's heartless, he thinks she's difficult). But when Beast saves Belle from wolves after she attempts to escape, a bond forms between them. Beast, tired of being a monstrous animal, begins to soften under Belle's kindly influence. Love starts to blossom, but when Belle is forced to leave when Maurice falls ill, it seems Beast's hopes of regaining his humanity are dashed. And it doesn't help that Belle's feelings for the Beast awaken the green-eyed monster in Gaston. A happy ending almost doesn't seem possible...It's easy to buy into all the "Beauty and the Beast" parodies, but when you look past all the Disney trappings, there is something so much deeper. We see a romance develop not due to physical attraction or plot requirement, but because of, well, development. Belle and the Beast spend time together, get to know each other, and share each other's interests. Beast really becomes a terrific guy: he gives bookworm Belle his massive library as a gift, learns to control his temper, and even learns proper table manners (Beast must have earned hundreds of wistful sighs from female audience members). It's a film about transformation in general. We don't have some vacuous Prince Charming, but a complex, anguished male protagonist who could easily be labeled as a villain in the beginning (he does throw poor old Maurice into the dungeon for no good reason). Once the Beast learns to let go of his self-pity and rage can he become more human. Gaston is a creep from beginning to end, but he is loved by all because of his looks. We see him as a harmless jerk, until his jealousy of the Beast winning Belle's love changes him from dumb jock to a murderous bastard. Even dopey Lefou undergoes a transformation, from token goofy sidekick to a demonic little creep capable of doing much damage. And how about that music? Not one song feels gratuitous, and every one is blessed with clever, poetic lyrics (sadly, the brilliant lyricist Howard Ashman died shortly before "Beauty and the Beast" was released). "Belle" is one of the best character songs ever written, and "Be Our Guest" is a lyrical and visual extravaganza, as well as a reminder of what a hell of a singer Jerry Orbach was. The ballroom scene is a masterpiece of cinema magic. With sweeping camera movements, glowing lights, and spellbinding special effects, it's truly a visual stunner. Enough of my hyperbole. You owe it to yourselves to see this "tale as old as time"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simply Charming Film and a True Triumph for Animation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger, this was my favorite film. I remember watching it with my mother in the Theatres when it debut, she was as entranced as I was by the whole thing. The music was delightful, the characters were fun, the animation gorgeous, and the tale simply timeless. However, as I grew older, the true magic of this film began to fade behind walls of cynicism, and it only got worse as I grew older. I completely forgot about this movie over time, until one day, over ten years since the last time I sat down to watch it with my mother, I found my old VHS of "Beauty and the Beast." I decided I'd sit down and watch it; after all, all my work for the day was already done. Might as well pop it in as I got ready to hit the sack.I was enthralled by what I saw; this movie is simply delightful. The characters are surprisingly complex for a Disney film. The Romance between the films two main characters is well realized and is achieved with the perfect balance of campiness and subtly, through both small moments which are rather clever, and not exactly something a child would pick up on; and lovely musical numbers in which the characters sing their hearts out to us in true Broadway fashion. This is much preferable to the generic formula of magic kiss/love at first sight we've grown to expect from fairy tales, and the fact that the characters actual have a real relationship with pitfalls adds a lot of appeal for the movie's older audience. In fact, of all Disney's animated films, this one is the most mature. The two primary characters, Belle and the Beast, are wonderfully three dimensional, as is their relationship. Belle, is quite unlike the typical Disney female, in that she seems more womanly and less blandly asexual, and overall is a much better realized character than those Disney heroine's which came before (or after) her. She's quite modernized when compared to Cocteau's version of the story (read: She's a feminist); The idea however is very well realized, and the end result is one of Disney's best characters to date. The same thing could be said of the other films star; The Beast, who also boasts an... um... interesting design.Even the supporting characters are interesting, and quite hilarious, especially the suave-talking Lumiere, his musical number is among the best in the film, and Orbach's performance is fantastic. Unlike many other Disney movies, these supporting characters are well integrated into the film and don't feel like tacky add ons; they have part in the Beast's plight, and try to help him win over Belle for their own benefit. Though they provide fantastic comic relief, they fit into the film well enough that they aren't annoying, unlike some other "Comic" relief characters. (Timon &amp; Pumbaa)While the film is an interpretation of an age old story, it's simply so well done that it doesn't seem like another mindless fairy tale simply devised to instill morals into our children. The moral message in this movie while quite obvious, is never stated or "overdone", thus increasing it's effectiveness tenfold, and even though the tale is as old as time, Disney's has taken given the story a unique twist, through such additions such as the Handsome villain, Gaston, who just so happens to share all the qualities of a beast, something which deviates from the formula typical of this sort of story. This richness extends to every part of the film; from the romance, to the comedic elements. Unlike so many films which "appeal" to all age, the "children's" comedy in this movie is never overly stupid, and rather than interject out of place sexual innuendo to appeal to older viewers, the mature comedy in this film is often more involved and poetic (An example would be the comical exaggeration of the films villain, Gaston's manliness in literally every way.), or Belle/The Beast's facial expressions during certain scenes. The comedy fits into the film so well that it never seems contrived at all, which is a welcome change.The films musical score is no doubt one of it's greatest strengths (Though it has no real weaknesses in the first place). The background music is extremely well written and a pleasure to listen too, as are the Broadway numbers. This is no doubt Menken and Ashman's finest work for Disney; there isn't a weak track in the whole bunch. Aesthetically the movie is simply beautiful; the gorgeous hand drawn images don't look the least bit dated, and the colors are vivid and vibrant. The artwork is also incredibly detailed; and the characters faces portray a fast array of emotions throughout the film. Belle herself expresses at least ten different feelings without the use of words, which isn't typical of animation and is once again a prime example of what makes this film a classic.In summation, this movie is well made on all fronts, and clich as it may sound, the movie truly is a timeless classic that really has that Disney Magic which is so often referenced. In the end, the wonderful characters, beautiful animation, incredible original score and unusually smart scripting come together to create a great film, by any standard. Quite possibly, the greatest animated movie ever created, and I've no doubt that if you give it a watch, you too will fall under it's enchantment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo(35mm and 70mm release prints)An unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) falls in love with the owner of an enchanted castle (Robby Benson), a handsome prince transformed by witchcraft into a monstrous Beast...Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest 'golden age' Disney classics. Returning to the European folk tales which inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves; the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury); and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. The film - which is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who died before the film premiered in 1991 - was subsequently adapted to great acclaim for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of direct-to-video sequels. Stick with the original.NB. A re-edited version was released to Imax theaters in 2001, restoring a musical number dropped from the original assembly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's Modern Tour de Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1991, there was renewed interest in Disney films. Beauty and the Beast happened to be one of the four big hits (along with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and The Lion King) that everybody went to see. It came at an appropriate time when Disney was recovering from shaky management from the 1980's, especially in the animation department.There's not a lot about this movie I can say that hasn't already been mentioned. It has a nice story, wonderful songs, and great artwork. The artwork particularly stands out among most of today's Disney movies. It actually FELT like a love story that took place in France!I recall seeing Beauty and the Beast around the time it first came out, but after seeing it again recently, I wanted to cry. Disney has been undergoing yet another era of shaky business, and their failures in the animation department have slowly been outweighing their successes. Ever since Pocahontas, although many of those films were actually good, Disney has seldom been able to measure up to the strength of their renaissance films (1989-1994). It really has me thinking about the good times...Beauty and the Beast came to be a powerful movie, and still is to this day. It broke box office records among animated films at the time, its soundtrack earned it numerous awards, and it earned the Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1992. Back then, it seemed like things couldn't be better in the Magic Kingdom.See it for fun. See it for magic. See it for old time's sake. See it with a date. Beauty and the Beast is for more than just for the Disney fans; it's for EVERYONE! It is HIGHLY recommended!</fullReview>

Not only does it have clever, catchy songs (which I sing even to this day), but it has a good plot with colorful characters. I love this movie so much that in my art class, I'm doing a painting of Belle.It takes place in a small French town, where Belle, a beautiful but "strange" (considered by the locals), lives with her father/inventor, who is considered crazy by the town. She loves reading, which it unusual to the town folk. Gaston, the town hero who is also a jerk, is determined to make Belle his wife, though she is in no way interested in him. One day, while lost in the woods, her father runs into an enchanted castle, where a prince-turned-beast now conceals himself and takes him [Belle's father] prisoner. Belle finds out about this and goes to his rescue, only to trade herself for her father's freedom. While being the Beast's prisoner, she and the former prince start to fall in love, much to the pleasure of the enchanted objects/servants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney Studios poured all their talent into this magnificent masterpiece to produce not only the finest animated feature ever, but one of the most entertaining films in cinema history. A terrific story line and a wonderful musical score enhance some of the best animation you'll ever see. Engaging from the very beginning, this is a simple story of a beautiful, but intelligent woman named Belle who has become bored with the provincial life of her French village. She gets more adventure than she bargains for, however, when she searches for her father, who disappears on the way to a local fair. In the meantime, she is romantically pursued by a handsome, but an exceptionally vain and shallow hunter named Gaston. Belle wants nothing to do with the brute, but he is determined to do anything to have her hand in marriage. Everything for Belle changes when she finds her father being held captive in a remote castle outside her village by "the Beast". Highly recommended. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild Spoiler.This is my absolute all time most favourite movie. I have never really figured out why, and never really tried. It just is. This is about the remastered version, I still hold it in the highest respect. The sound is no longer boxed, the picture is sharper and I love being able to watch it in widescreen. But the idea of "cleaning up" or recolouring the cells, well it is all good in practice, but the end result did not move me that much. The film is now TOO bright. Before it had atmosphere and a "lived in" look. Now any darkness of the gothic castle is gone, and all you get is a vividly grey building, and the soul of the characters is lacking, there is no texture to the colour. The overall effect reminds me of a cheap disney cartoon series of the late nineties such as "Hercules" or "Aladdin" no shadow or feeling of real life.The song "Human again" is sweet, and worked well in the broadway, but did not improve the film. I am being heavily critical, but sitting down with the dvd and video running simletaneously, I ended up watching the video, in monosound and all.I am dissapointed, but have no complaints with the original film. It is a masterpiece. And does not receive the credit it sincerely deserves.</fullReview>

And it is. It has a message that only adults could really see and understand. It also has many senes filled with drama and gore that are also aimed at adults. This has got to be in the Top 3 best Disney films!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece of beautiful animation and top-class storytelling. It effectively combines humour and pathos in an effective blend of music, personality and pacing. It is one of my top ten all-time favorite movies!It is great to see the way the makers have combined elements of the old-style Hollywood movies; especially with the villagers attack scene, the wolves attack and Gaston's wooing of Belle. And with the modern fluid presentation of the "Be Our Guest" number (with elements very reminiscent of DUMBO's "Pink Elephants on Parade"), and the big ballroom title number.I love the way the personality of the characters comes through; especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs Potts, the Featherduster, Chip and Lefou. And the music really captures the feel of the story excellently. A truly masterful piece of high-quality entertainment that anyone can enjoy - both the original and large screen versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't miss seeing this movie on the IMAX screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have kids, that either has never seen this in the theartes or has this is a great movie to bring your kids to. But if you miss this on IMAX, it will be coming to video and dvd on 10/08/02. This is one of Disney's best of the 90's. How can you not like this movie? As the movie opens, a prince is changed into a beast when refusing to let a old woman shelter from the cold. Belle (Paige O'Hara) is a woman from an un-named town, in France (I think that is where this movie is taking place). While a hunter named Gaston (Ricard White) wants to marry Belle. But when her father leaves town for a fair and instead goes to a castle when his horse ditches him where the grumpy Beast (Robby Benson) locks him in the tower. When her father's horse retuens, Belle goes off to find her father. And is taken to the castle where the grumpy Beast agrees for Belle to take her father's place as his prisoner. I agree with Tv Giude when they say the Belle is the smartest of all disney heroines, because she knows what she wants and doesn't spend her time looking a prince to fall out of the sky, land in front her and change her life. 10/10</fullReview>

An incredible story, which carries you along with Belle through first fearing and hating to loving and cherishing the Beast. Guided along by the beautiful music, the audience is enchanted with a story of sacrifice and true love. Bravo.Tale as old as time... Song as old as rhyme... Beauty and the Beast</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a heartwarming classic for all the family to enjoy. I love the character of Belle, who is no damsel in distress, but headstrong and determined, as well as beautiful. Paige O' Hara does a great job. The music in this film is fantastic, my favorite song though has to be 'Belle' performed by Paige O' Hara, Richard White, Jesse Corti and Chorus, or 'Belle (Reprise)' performed by Paige O' Hara. This is the second best film ever, for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt Disney's best movie ever. It was almost the first animated movie to win a best picture Oscar (Silence of the Lambs deserved to win). It is a beautifully animated movie in the tradition of the great Walt Disney. Everything about it is top-notch from the acting to the story, to the direction. I just wish Disney would do more movies like this.A word about the current state of Disney. There are now other studios (namely Dreamworks) that are willing (and able) to throw money into big-budget animated movies, and many have succeeded. Movies like Titan AE, Iron Giant (a Fox movie), and Antz are all examples of great animated movies that have features that Disney animated movies don't. First and foremost, these movies (and others like them) are NOT movies for just kids. This is one thing that made Beauty and the Beast so wonderful, and also what has made Disney movies after it so terrible. PLEASE Disney make more movies that appeal to both kids AND adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent and Unsurpassed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best animated feature ever made. Period. No argument. The Disney studios pulled out all the stops to create this sublime achievement, using the best animators, storytellers and musical artists in the business. Surpassing any animated feature made before or since this is simple story about a beautiful girl in a small village who wants to escape her "provincial life" and the clutches of the handsome town brute who wants to have her for his own. Told in the style of a lively Hollywood musical, this story is never boring and continuously engaging. You won't find a better family film. Even the movie's beginning, telling the background of the Beast through the use of stain glass windows, is stunningly beautiful and original. The musical numbers are alternately fun, hilarious, quietly sweet and rousing.Don't expect the DVD version of this film to last on the shelves very long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cocteau vs Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Beauty and the Beast" fable has been around for a long time, present in various forms in various different cultures under various different names. For example, in the 1600s there existed a similar Germanic folk-tale, often titled "The Beast" or "The Wolf Prince".Regardless, the fable is similar in each version, and seems to have started out as a tale told to young women in order to prepare them for intercourse and future marriage. At its core, the story says that man is an animal, is bestial, until a young woman's love redeems him. Or rather: man is not a sexual animal at all, once the woman gets to know him properly.So like most folk tales, this is a giant fantasy designed to placate (and probably even has evolutionary value). In the story the Beast loves the woman, lusts for her daily, though she does not love him. To keep the Beast's hormones at bay, the young woman promises to meet him at his castle, but because she is bound to her father and loves the old man dearly, forgets all about the Beast, who slowly dies of grief. The young woman, seeing the Beast dying, then suddenly realises that the Beast loves her and swiftly falls in love.In a very archetypal sense, the fable symbolizes the union between a sexually developed man and a young, innocent female who views the man as beastly at first, but eventually grows to love him. This happens after she cuts all ties with her father, who up until that point had been the only male figure in her life. When she accepts the Beast, he literally becomes beautiful, his clothes and bestial figure vanishing such that he turns into a prince.Jean Cocteau's "Beauty and the beast" (1946), a film which retells this tale, keeps the same structure but treats it in a much more baroque fashion. It's still a tale filled with much primal, repressed sexuality, but Cocteau is such a master stylist that he imbues virtually every scene with wonderful visual flourishes. With its dancing candle holders, animated household objects and statues, the film is a triumph of art design.Unsurprisingly, the Disney version of "Beauty and the Beast" waters things down further. In the Disney version, the young woman is an introvert and outcast (but gorgeous of course) who views the world differently to all the other young women around her.Being different allows the young woman to see and empathise with the "goodness" at the heart of the Beast, and so the two outcasts join together, teaching us that it's ultimately "what's inside that counts". (if this is so, why does the Beast transform into a prince and why is the "beauty" always outwardly beautiful as well? Where are all the fairy tales about an ugly woman struggling to inseminate a Doberman?)This kind of "march at the beat of your own drum" and "be different because you are better than everyone else" morality tale is common in Disney flicks, but there is also a slightly dark underside to this updated version of the tale.Both the Disney and Cocteau version of the myth feature a "Gaston" character who is not found in the original, ancient folk tales. This character represents the "common mentality" or "the standard values". He's the "practical male figure" who the young woman should marry, and whom she is encouraged to marry by her friends and family, but whom she possesses no love for. This little addition updates the tale for a more enlightened society, by portraying "woman" as having a certain freedom: the ability to choose the "bad boy", the "beast", and indulging in her own carnal fantasies, regardless of what her parents say. Of course to make this fantasy palatable, the story has to romanticise the beast and ruthlessly villainize the "practical man".In any case, all these re-tellings of "Beauty and the Beast" highlight how petty humans are. Incidentally, early art work from the 17th century featured the beast as a literal wolf or dog creature, often with an erect penis, the young woman on her ankles submissively before him. One recalls a line ironically spoken by Jack Nicholson in "The Shining": "Perfect for a child." 8/10 ? Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast" 7.5/10 ? Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" I suspect modern audiences are so familiar with this fairy tale that both Cocteau and Disney's "retelling" seem like old news. Still, Cocteau's film features wonderful art design (Cocteau mingled with many French surrealists), inventive camera work and is pleasantly fast paced. It's probably the best version of this story, though I wonder what use modern man has for these centuries old fables.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

Even now, it still is as magical and enchanting as it was when I was a kid, and the reason it works so well is its simplicity and witty humour, unlike the animated films nowadays which rely too much on forced slapstick humour without any real heart into it (Shrek an exception). The animation is superb, the voice acting done brilliantly and the storyline captivating, exploring the theme of love and being able to change for someone because of it.This is a film future generations of kids should watch and cherish, giving them a true sense of magic and wonderment.

		<shortDescription>Fine animation, but story doesn't strike a particularly good chord with me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's animated BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has received much praise and high ratings, but I don't know why it is placed above so many of the other fine animated films. For example, for me Disney's animated TARZAN is a much more entertaining film. Maybe because TARZAN's serious message (family, and accepting outsiders) is delivered in a more entertaining manner. In "beast" Belle is a beautiful young woman whose father becomes imprisoned in the castle of the Beast and she volunteers to be imprisoned instead, to free her father. The Beast had gotten that way from a spell, and could only become the handsome prince again if he could get someone to love him. A bitter person, that appears virtually impossible.some SPOILERS follow ...During her stay in the Beast's castle, Belle is rarely treated kindly, but still in the end she falls in love with him. The transition from the two being at odds, to the romance, seems to abrupt, without a plausible buildup to that point. It is well-done, but for me the presentation of the story was not altogther satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film has not dated well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film on the big screen last night at the Harvard Film Archive and I have to say that it has not aged well. There are odd plot devices with mess with continuity and poor animation at times. Regarding the first point, Belle's horse pops in and out as she conveniently needs it. She gains super-human strength having hoisted the Beast onto her horse and pulling his massive weight back onto the balcony at the climax. I realize the problems of configuring a fairy tale to fit into a 70 minute all-ages format but it messes with the mystery of the fairy tale.'Snow White' was as linear a narrative, but there was intense attention to detail and empathy. You never really know what it motivating characters in 'Beast'. She goes from hating him to loving him from one scene to the next. Her own character comes off as conceited as Gaston at times. (Me?! The wife of that boorish...) Additionally, the attention to detail and consistency in character design now seems like light-years from this film. Each character looks as though drawn by a different hand which shows the lack of control in art direction that exists now. Some of these are down right sloppy in long-shots. 'Beauty' was a transitional film as the studio was adapting to more digital techniques (digital ink and paint, computer animation) and the glitches in hand-drawn techniques help to date the film. At times the Beast is massive in scale and at others (after her befriends Belle) he is only slightly larger than her. It becomes cumbersome to look at him after a while. Once he does 'come into the light', his mystery is broken and the final design feels unsatisfactory. The supporting characters (townspeople, etc.)are not drawn well at all and one needs only to look at a film like 'Pinocchio' to see what solid animation art direction is. I understand why 'Beauty' makes everyone's top movie lists but it deserves criticism as much as any other film especially since the bar has been raised for animation storytelling since 1991.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale as Old as Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be in the 1% of people who had not ever seen Beauty and the Beast. It was only about 3 days ago when I finally saw what some call the best Disney movie ever. I can definitely see why.Plot - Belle is a pretty girl who loves books and minds her own business. It is for these reasons, she is seen as strange by everyone in the village, except for the town hero Gaston. Belle's father is the loony inventor of the village, and they live in a house right next to the village. One day, he leaves home to bring his latest invention to the convention, but gets lost in the woods after taking a shortcut. He and his horse are chased by wolves into a seemingly abandoned castle. The castle is however, inhabited by anthropomorphic household items and a prince who has been turned into a beast. The father is captured and Belle goes out to find him after the horse comes back. She agrees to stay in the castle, if the Beast lets her father go. Sure enough, Belle stays and the plot kick starts. The set-up for the things to happen is a really well done set-up. It might seem dumb for the father to take a shortcut. But, he was just too darn excited to care. 10/10 Voice Acting - The voices here are done to a T. The character designs of each character and their voices are all perfect. There's is nothing bad to say about these voices, every character sounds exactly like how they look. Even for the dresser, who sounds the least like how she looks. 10/10.Animation - The animations of the castle, the wolf scenes, and the climax are just beautiful. The way the characters move are just beautiful. There is really nothing to say in this area, it's way too great to be called average. It however, is not the best. 9/10Soundtrack - I feel bad for not really remembering any of the songs. I've never actually had the ability to memorize lyrics of a song, and I really wanted to get into the songs. It's just that I never grew up with this movie. I grew up with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Lion King, and Mulan. I remember most of their soundtracks. I guess I'm just too old to really get invested in the songs. For what it's worth, I actually really liked the song Gaston. It had a nice rhythm to it. Belle and Beauty and the Beast were really good, I just don't remember them. Just because I can't remember them, it won't effect it's score. The music just didn't really feel big for me. 8/10 Script/Dialogue - It's a Disney movie, there script and dialogue is always great. I loved every time the objects appeared on screen, especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts. The dialogue between Belle and the Beast is realistic enough for me. 10/10 Characters - The characters are portrayed here better than most Disney movies. Belle is a girl who wants something grand in life, but doesn't know what it is. She loves her books and minds her own business. She doesn't want to marry Gaston due to his arrogance, and is willing to stay a prisoner in order to save her father. The Beast has anger issues, and is really trying his best to woo Belle given his situation. He wants to Belle to fall in love with him and turn back into the prince, but is so angry, he just shouts at her and is very considerate over her feelings. Belle and the Beast have to develop their relationship over time, rather than just they met that day. And it's because of this why the relationship seems more realistic. Truly, a first for Disney. Gaston is a really good villain, he starts out as the arrogant hero who thinks he deserves the girl in the end. He is however denied his "bride", and turns more desperate as the story goes. He tries to admit Belle's father into the loony bin, and tries to kill the Beast purely out of jealousy. He however is one of the better Disney villains, as he isn't straight up evil. The house items were turned by the witch, and try their best to get Belle and the Beast to fall in love in order to turn human. Lumiere is a womanizer, Cogsworth is a control freak, Mrs. Potts is very caring, Chip is curious, and many more. These are wonderful characters who you'd just love to spend time with. Their transformations are arguably uglier than their cursed forms. 10/10 Overall - This was definitely the best movie that Disney has ever done in my opinion. Nothing beats it. Everyone is just so darn likable. I would also love to mention how, Belle's father should've died in woods from hypothermia, Gaston's second banana would've been the precursor for cryogenics research, that one guy was crushed by the dresser in the climax, the dresser fell from King Kong height (Beauty and the Beast reference right there). So along with Gaston, that's 4 deaths. Nothing important, just wanted to give those a mention, because who else would. 9.5/10, round that it's a perfect 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best that Disney has to offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some very beautiful scenes as well as action sequences that truly drive the plot forward. But those qualities are what we've come to expect from Disney. The only differences is the story. A prince is visited at his castle by a seemingly old beggar woman. She asks him for shelter in exchange for a rose. He denies her request. Well it turns out that the old woman beggar wasn't an old woman at all but a witch! Offended by his rejection she puts a curse on him. What could possibly be wrong with an independent thinker who decides who and when to help? So, there you have a prince who is lonely and rich. After all, many people have probably come to his door asking for favors and how could one person appease the will of many when he doesn't even know their intentions? Perhaps he was having a bad day?When he refuses to help her she turns into an enchantress and puts a curse on him transforming him into a hideous beast. To make matters worst, his curse has a time frame for him to change what she deems is an unattractive trait (unkindness) which requires the prince to learn to love another person and have that love reciprocated. The second act involves the introduction of Belle. Belle is a meek introverted library in an unknown village. She is is a humble woman. Her father, Maurice,smart man, an inventor. However, the setting of this film is not established although it is evident that intelligence and the scientific hobbies of Maurice have earned him a reputation of being crazy from the townspeople especially from a thug named Gaston. Gaston is your typical macho bully who thinks he can woo any woman that he desires just by his sheer masculinity. It really is preposterous idea that the writers take full advantage of with a few cute scenes of Gaston being stupid and his solo musical number later on in the film. Regardless of Gaston's efforts Belle is unimpressed with his bravado, so he devises another plan to win her heart which includes framing poor little Maurice. Belle has to rescue her father and proves his innocents to an angry mob of people that Gaston has riled up. This journey leads her to the Beast's castle and she trades herself for her father's freedom. The third act involves Bellle's time at the enchanted castle trying to live with the bitter, angry Beast and his fun loving yet caring protective staff of servants. In the process, Belle beguiles the Beast and his servants in a way that no Eartly magic could ever do. Will she break the curse?What astonishes me about the characterization and social dynamics of the characters is the message that the writers are trying to convey. Clearly Gaston is the villain and the Beast really isn't a villain at all. Gaston is an attractive yet poor man who really has no authority of his own besides exacting his will upon the citizens of the town. Whereas the Beast is an isolated prince who really hasn't done much to hurt anyone. So that is the message of this film: looks can be deceiving. Overall, this film is a treasure of American pop culture. There will be a live action adaptation to be released later this year. And that is fine, I just think that it wouldn't be the same at all. The story is truly for children and teens and I think that it would really be a disservice to change its image to appease a completely different type of audience with a British actor cast as Belle.Such wonderful songs and captivating scenes that you'll surely fall in love with as I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty is found within:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Beauty and the Beast' truly is a wonderful "Tale as old as time", that enchants audiences to this day with a terrific Disney classic.1. The story itself is adapted from the classic French fairy-tale of the same name, but of course things are modified to fit Disney's interpretation. Some of the best things include the wonderful added characters to the tale; Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts and of course the adorable Chip. Although not included in the original tale, Gaston is by far a fantastic addition and perfect villain for the film. He is the complete opposite of the Beast, who is hideous on the outside yet has a heart of gold and kind soul within, unlike Gaston who is beyond handsome on the outside, yet ugly and cruel within.2. The focal point of the entire film, is of course the beautiful Belle (Paige O'Hara) and the Beast (Robby Benson) himself. Disney's infamous animator Glenn Keane does an exceptional job creating the Beast. He is impressively combined with other animals to fit his build, such as; the arms and body of a Bear, the legs and tail of a Wolf, the mane of a Lion, the tusks of a Boar, the sloping head and horns of a Bison and the eyebrows and expressive eyes of a Gorilla. You can't help but fall in love with Belle, due to how humble and caring of a young woman she is. Hence the reason she's the undeniable Beauty who tames the angry Beast.3. As with most Disney animated films, the musical score and numbers are simply incredible. Disney veteran Alan Menken, is responsible for the wonderful musical compositions heard in the film. The two most outstanding numbers are; 'Be Our Guest' and of course the forever classic 'Beauty and the Beast'. The latter song (sung by the talented Angela Lansbury) is first heard in the incredible ballroom dance sequence. Back in 1991, the visual animation in this film was by far ahead of it's time, the ballroom in particular. The 3D version of the film is highly recommended since it emphasizes (even more) the gorgeous imagery.Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise did a directorial job of sheer perfection. Everything about this film works on all levels, and I dare anyone to find a single thing wrong. My only regret is that Walt Disney himself passed away before this wonderful tale was released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Beauty and the Beast" is that rare example of a vaunted Disney movie that really works; on pretty much every level. It says a lot that I - averse to musicals - gravitate toward the songs in this movie. They're all good . . . even the Celine Dion ballad. The requisite puzzle pieces come together just right here. It's got a (genuinely) strong female protagonist, good humor, very nice animation, and even a message about not being a douche. Also, the weirdest-looking prince I've ever seen in a Disney movie.But here's the bottom line: If Disney applied that "Lion King" prestige to this movie, it'd be well-earned, and they'd actually be right on the money. There's not a whole lot (any?) about this that turns me off, and it's a legitimately entertaining movie. Worthy of high praise. And as Disney Renaissance movies go (a phrase that gets thrown around with reckless abandon), this is right up there at the top.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super nice movie. I Like it very Much Love you all Belle is a girl who is dissatisfied with life in a small provincial French town, constantly trying to fend off the misplaced "affections" of conceited Gaston. The Beast is a prince who was placed under a spell because he could not love. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet. Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and Inspiring Disney Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the timeless classics of Big D, ever. Also, the movie is quite an inspiring starting point, because it started a pattern apart from traditional romantic film relationship buildings - i.e. the two meet, spend time together, open their hearts, starts emotionally affectionate(maybe a first kiss), things fall apart and the two separates, but they then manage to salvage the relationship and be never more in love before. Not this movie, though - this one started a unique pattern, one which I call "The Three Catalysts(or 3C)". 3C goes like this: Rescue, Sacrifice, Death, and exclusively in that order. The catalysts go off in these relationship buildings, and every time a catalyst goes off, the two people's relationship level surges upwards. But every next catalyst goes more dangerous than the previous one. So far Disney's Beauty and the Beast was the only pair to survive all three, and the only other pair was Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D's Fitz/Simmons relationship, and two of their 3C has already went off, and I really wish the third one won't. This movie is seriously inspiring, and I really hope to see more like this in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beauty of Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast (1991): Dir: Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise / Voices: Paige O'Hara, Bobby Benson, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers: A stunning Disney animated achievement about inner beauty and the girl who tamed the vile. As the opening indicates, a selfish Prince is transformed into a hideous hulking beast. Book worm Belle goes into the winter night to find her father, an inventor who lost his way and is taken prisoner by the beast. She happens upon the castle and bargains for her father's freedom. Her stay isn't totally frightening as an assortment of objects that were also affected by the curse band together to provide hospitality. Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise deserve credit for this enchanting stunning animation that will lead to other directing projects for them. Paige O'Hara provides the voice of Belle who sacrifices herself for her father and ends up saving the beast. Bobby Benson voices the beast who ultimately fights a pack of wolves for Belle then he is coaxed to extend a gentleman gesture that could result in true love thus transforming him before the last pedal falls from the enchanted rose. Richard White voices egotistical hunter Gaston who vows for Belle's hand. David Ogden Stiers voices the loyal butler who was transformed into a clock. We know the outcome but its beauty stresses more than a message. It is a rousing animated masterpiece. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's masterpieces of Animation films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty And The Beast is one of those films I saw in the 90s and often times during school back when we were allow to watch movies in school if we did well. Anyhow the 1990s were a good decade for animation films and from Disney it was nearly always going to be a promising motion picture. Beauty and the Beast is the third film in the Disney Renaissance series and it is praise for a lot of reasons. For one thing the movie feels like you're watching a play the animators and cast gave us the impression that they set it up like you would be watching a Broadway show and looking at it now I say it is very clever. The animation in this film remains one of my favorites in any animation films because they really did a wonderful job with the backgrounds and the attention to detail goes to show how much they wanted to take the time to make the film magical also the characters are very well design.The voice acting is very powerful each of the cast help bring the story to life and you could tell in their voice work that they were all in for giving their best. Again it feels like you were seeing a play unfold in front of you the cast really did a strong job. Songs written for the film help bring the characters out and the story because you could tell the songs would be hits when the movie came out. Each song does something special to make it well know for Disney fans.Music score in the film is nearly perfect and really helps brings the film to the fold because each piece of music written just does in it own way bring the movie to where it is I just really respect the music and it is one of my favorite movie scores.Overall Beauty and the Beast does a very well done job with making it one of Disney's best motion pictures. With super animation, great voice acting, superb music and a great story you can't not go wrongI give Beauty and the Beast an 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent adaptation of the classic fable.A prince is turned into a beast by a witch. He is doomed to spend the rest of his days in that way unless he experiences true love by a certain age. Meanwhile, in a nearby village a beautiful girl, Belle, is being harassed by the local casanova, Gaston. Then one day her father is imprisoned by the Beast...Sweet movie, though dull in spells. Part of the problem is that you know how it is going to end. There is some originality though - the animated pots, candlesticks etc - and these generally provide the most entertaining moments.Unfortunately, it is a musical. No particularly good songs: some are okay, some are quite forgettable and some are even a bit irritating. You know things aren't going to go well when Celine Dion sings the theme song...Kids should enjoy it. Adults can take it or leave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun fact: this is the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Second fun fact: the Beauty and the Beast story also inspired Miyazaki to make Princess Mononoke, one my personal favorites, a movie you will be seeing far higher on this list, the highest grossing movie ever made in Japan and the first animated movie to ever win Japan's version of the Oscars. Kinda weird how one story can inspire two relatively similar great movies on two different ends of the world.But of course, the Disney version is a more faithful adaption. And the version we will be discussing today.If The Little Mermaid started the Disney Renaissance, this movie brought it roaring to life. Many (myself not included) consider this to be the high point of the period, the film where the music, the characters, the animation, and the plot come together to form one insurmountable masterwork. And there is a case to be made for that. You can feel as you watch the movie that this was made by a studio at the top of its game. It may not be the best Disney movie, but I do believe it do be the least flawed. There is nothing wrong with the movie; across the board it excels.Belle is the most fleshed out Disney heroine to this point and arguable the most fleshed out ever. Personally, I prefer Ariel just because while the redhead feels alive and energetic, Belle feels a bit too perfect. But even so, the perfection is not the forced, morality-included kind that makes me hate Superman. It just does seem like she is just a legitimately nice and smart person. I have a friend like that; she's amazing. And just like her, while Belle may be a bit too goody, there is no doubt that she seems real and earnest.Of course, she is not the only character, though I would not mind if she were. The Beast is well-acted. He is able to pull to be fearsome and intimidating without surrendering his humanity. As such, the character development seems natural and flowing. You feel why he does what he does; you emphasize with him. My only qualm is one that many people have had: that his voice after he turns back is underwhelming to say the least. But if that's seriously the biggest complaint I can voice against this movie, and it is, then it is doing something right.Gaston is also done well; there are few villains in movie history who are both able to induce fear and laughs; Gaston is one of them. He walks the tightrope of being over-the-top without losing his human desires and ambitions. The scenes he and Belle share are legitimately creepy at best. But once more, you can see where he's coming from, though you don't agree with him. Great character work here.The plot is basic, but well-done. I've...used variations of that phrase quite often, haven't I? So be it; I guess I just tend towards movies like that. Anyways...it's amazing how few people pick up on the nuances that make films like this work. It's not the grand structure that makes it so effect; but rather the little things that build tension and drama like one line or one extra scene. Creative genius is fickle, but not unpredictable, not unless you aren't sensitive to it.But nothing trumps the animation. While I prefer the stark colors of the Lion King, I will say that this is the objectively best-animated movie in the DisRen. In fact, I say that it is the best-looking traditionally-animated movie ever made in the West. Every frame looks like a million dollar painting. Often, I find myself stopping the movie and just staring at the animation. Belle feels alive and full of vigor. The town feels quaint and peaceful with a tint of unease. The Beast's Castle is foreboding and grand but not cold. This is one of those films that makes me want to turn into an animated character just to immerse myself in the world.If the sterling animation arouses these feelings, the sweeping score amplifies it. While not as majestic as Lion King's, this soundtrack is emotional and deep, making every moment feel earned. I would even argue that no movie has as well captured the magic of the medieval-Renaissance era atmosphere as well as this one. There are scores that are thumping and sprawling, adding scale to the movie. There are scores that are intimate and romantic, letting the moment hang with passion in the air. This film does both.In its most famous song, it declares that the story is 'a tale as old as time.' I think this movie will last as long as that. I can safely say that there is not a film as good as Beauty in the Beast that is as good at doing what Beauty in the Beast does best better than Beauty in the Beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as old as time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other adaptation of the classic French fairytale has come close to capturing the magic of Disney's effort. It's a gorgeous film that fully relishes in its medium; the majestic Gothic architecture of the castle, the hulking form of the beast, the charming anthropomorphic household servants etc. These all would look not half as fantastic in live action, but in one of the earliest uses of the CAPS system, are beautifully fluid, lively and detailed. It sets the tone for some very strong and complex characterisation, particularly in the case of the Beast and his servants. The Beast himself is daunting and imposing in his character design, but the animation captures a more human side of the cursed prince in actions like slumps and walks and sighs. His piercing blue eyes add depth to his wide range of facial expressions that appear in both humorous and heavy scenes. The assortment of household items also benefit from the enchanting animation. A variety of unique characters from teapots to candlesticks are designed with great care and love in order to represent real humans as closely as possible. They bounce around, they wave and cross their arms, they emote via their eyebrows. When the magic turns back the Beast and his servants into humans at the end of the film, they feel strangely alien. That's because of the ability of Disney to assign the audience's devotion and care onto inanimate objects and ugly beasts. It couldn't be more natural to fall in love with this world. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman combine again after the success of The Little Mermaid for a memorable soundtrack. Be Our Guest is a lively tune which showcases the wide cast and crazy choreography of the household servants. Gaston is appropriately set in a tavern and features hilarious antics and boasting that could only come from the main villain. As despicable as he is the lyrics are rousing and catchy, depicting a true paragon of manliness that is as irresistible as the handsome face and rippling muscles of the addressee. The show stealer however is the title theme, lovingly sung by English actress Angela Lansbury in film as a poignant moment where Belle and the Beast have their first dance. Her rendition is not as lavish or as sweet as the Dion Bryson duet, but it's earnest and simplistic. It's one of the few instances in the film where the camera is allowed to move, via a complex production sequence where the entire ballroom was created using CGI. The end result is magnificent; the camera sweeping down from the ceiling chandelier and tracking around the couple, combined with Lansbury's richly tender and warm singing voice makes for one of the most beautiful scenes of Disney history. Beauty and the Beast's story is simple but remarkably effective. The even pacing of the characterisation and narrative creates a very accessible and engaging relationship between Belle and the Beast. There are clear moments of growth and change which earmark the path to the love they share at the end. Linda Woolverton's Disney debut demonstrates great emotion and sincerity for what would be recurring features in hits such as the Aladdin, The Lion King and Mulan. The voice-work is never once out of place and lends itself to the grand illusion. The film will captivate audiences of any age and displays Disney's mastery for creating a story that revels in its beauty, simplicity and magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst its cheerful to a point, Beauty and the Beast is assuredly the Wuthering Heights of the Disney classics canon, featuring kind-hearted monsters, provincial french colonies, Gothic castles and romantic curses, The musical numbers are the highlight of the film as is the trend with many of Disney's classic numbers such as Cinderella and Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Beauty and the Beast introduced a bookish and relatively plain girl who fell in love with a terrifying beast, kidnapper and of course, Prince under an unfriendly curse.

		<fullReview>A rich and powerful prince dismissed a beggar who turned out to be an enchantress. She turns him into a Beast unless he can learn to love another and earn her love in return before his 21st year. Or else he shall live as the Beast for all times. Belle lives a quiet life in a small provincial town. She's a bookworm fighting off the advances of the conceited arrogant Gaston. Her father is a struggling inventor. He gets lost taking a shortcut to the fair. He seeks shelter from the wolves in the Beast's castle but he's taken prisoner. Belle comes looking for her father and offers to take his place.The songs are catchy and the story has been simplified. There are great animated characters. The film makes some great choices. It starts with the great song from Belle. There are at least 3 great songs when most of the time, two would be amazing for any movie. The simplification of Belle's home life is probably for the best. It leaves more room for the romance between Belle and the Beast. It also gives a great opportunity for these terrific fun characters in the castle. The animation is terrific with a good use of early CGI. It is one of the icons of Disney animation.</fullReview>

Also, every time the movie got to the credits, I would always cry because the music was so heart-warming and beautiful to listen to. The characters were also hilarious. My favorite character(s) would have to be Lumiere and Cogsworth. There bond is so funny to watch.

		<shortDescription>A stunning childhood Disney Classic that I should have seen more often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film once or twice as a child upon owning the VHS and started watching again when I was 18 upon borrowing it from a volunteer/social worker but sadly fell asleep halfway through due to having had the tendency to tiring very easily. Today, which is Boxing Day 2013 as I type, my mum suggested we watch a Disney film and I insisted we watch this one due to its inclusion of a couple of memorable musical numbers ('Be Our Guest' and the titular song) that had equally memorable animation sequences and were also on my 'Sing Along Songs: Be Our Guest' VHS I had when I was five and retrieved from eBay a year or two ago. I also insisted on watching this because I mistakenly thought this was my mum's favourite Disney film but it is in fact 'The Little Mermaid (and one of mine)' although she found this one very good as did I.The 2D animation is fluid and smooth with beautiful interior and exterior backgrounds but there were one or two that looked a tad CGI-ish for the film, especially the ballroom during 'Beauty and the Beast' but it looked magnificent nonetheless. In addition to the musical numbers I've already mentioned, I also liked the opening song ('Belle/Little Town?'), 'Gaston,' and 'Something There' although I found 'The Mob Song' and 'Human Again' pretty forgettable as well as some of the incidental music, which was also pleasant if dramatic in parts. The script has its fair share of humorous and poignant moments, the former including the antics of Gaston's bumbling sidekick Lefou, Cogsworth's line, "It it ain't baroque, don't fix it (my mum was in stitches with that one)" and some of the townspeople's goings on during the opening musical number; and the latter including the falling rose petals and the Beast apparently dying. While Belle remains headstrong yet sensitive throughout, I liked the Beast's change of character after their argument while Belle tries to treat his wound/scratches from the wolves. Lumiere and Cogsworth are comical side characters while Chip is very sweet and Gaston became what some may perceive as a good man gone evil. I also liked the stained glass windows that accompanied the back-story of the Beast at the beginning as well as the final one depicting him as a handsome human being with Belle.Overall this is a stunning Disney Classic that I regret not seeing as much as 'Peter Pan,' 'The Little Mermaid' (both of which are as good as this one) and 'Cinderella (which is nearly as good but still a favourite of mine)' due to the majority of musical numbers being memorable and the animation being Oscar-worthy. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have absolutely love Disney films which I watched most of them since I was young. Especially, "Beauty and the Beast" is one of the memorable movies which I watched. Beauty and the Beast had published in 1992, and there are 10 musical songs so we can enjoy it with those music as the musical animation. The plot is that an enchantress offers a young prince a rose in exchange for staying his castle. But the prince rejected it because he is mean and selfish.Then the enchanted transform him into an Beast, also his servants into household items. She gives him a magic mirror to watch far away events and a rose which the prince must learn what love is before the rose have fallen off. After few years, Belle who is heroine in the movie want to come to Beast castle because her father become his prison. Instead of her father become free, she has to stay his castle forever. Then they fall in love but........ In my opinion, I think if you watch this movie, you can see the growth of the beast. Beast will learn to love gradually, thanks to Belle. His growth will teach us what love is. This is theme of this film and you can feel more deeply. Disney is not telling us about love with using words, I mean the dance. Belle and the Beast dance in the big room. This is the most radiant and beautiful scene. In 2010, Amazon started to sell DVD which edit to 3D, so you will be able to enjoy it which differ from 2D. I think 3D will provide you more realistic and dynamic Disney world. Finally, if you want oasis of the love, you can fell it from this film. Moreover, If your children or friends want to watch it, you can present it. I really recommend it. I hope that you could enjoy watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and The Beast Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a classic children's Disney movie. It is set in Paris, France within a little town and a big castle. Belle is the main character who lives with her father. Her father Maurice is the town's inventor. Gaston is the man of the town and wants to marry Belle. The Beast lives within the castle and has many servants such as Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip. The beginning of the movie explains how the Beast came to be. He was not nice to a woman who in turn turned him from a handsome prince into a Beast. The lesson was for him to learn to love and be loved in return. It then cuts to Belle in her town trying to help her father with his new invention. Maurice ends up being a prisoner in the Beasts' castle when he took a wrong turn towards the inventors fair. Belle rescues him but she needs to live in the castle for the rest of her life in order for her father to go free. She does so and ends up spending time with the Beast and seeing the good within him. She befriends the servants and begins to live happily. The music plays a huge role in the movie. First there are the actual songs that are sung by the characters. These songs give a brief glimpse into the character's personality. In the beginning Belle sings about how she loves to read and feels as if she doesn't fit in with the townspeople. The viewer can tell Belle loves reading because her nose is always in a book. She barely pays attention to any of the townspeople because they don't understand her interests. Belle feels alone. When Gaston's song comes on, the viewer learns who masculine he is and his interests such as shooting, spitting, and decorating. The background music is just as important. The background music helps the viewer feel what is going on during the scene. For instance, when Belle is being attacked by the wolves and the Beast comes to save her, there is a dark music in the background indicating that something scary, the Beast, is there. The music makes you feel as if you are in the fight scene. Also when Belle and the Beast are starting to get along, the background music is happy showing the sexual tension between each other. The camera angles and shots are very important to this movie. There are many close-ups on the beast in order to instill fear. Some of the shots are of his eyes in order for the viewer to see he really is human; he is not just a beast. There are also low angle shots of the Beast. This is to show that he is in power over everyone else and it is to make the viewer afraid of him. There are also establishing shots that are very helpful. Belle has her nose stuck in a book but around her everyone is going about their daily life in the village and giving her weird looks because why would a woman be reading? Beauty and the Beast is a classic princess movie. I personally love this movie. I have loved this movie since I was little. I love how well it is put together. The characters are well developed so the fact that the movie isn't that long is not a bad thing because you already know the characters. You already feel for Belle and you want her to end up with Beast. I like how Belle is not a typical woman. Back then women were supposed to be housewives and do everything for their husbands. They were not supposed to read or be educated but reading is Belle's favorite thing. She does not want to be a typical housewife she wants much more which is why she does not marry Gaston. She wants to feel equal in the relationship which she does in her relationship with Beast. I do not think kids are the only ones who would enjoy this movie. This movie is for any age and any gender because it's about romance and stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. Its been my favorite movie since I was a little girl. Its a good story about integrity and true character. I mean our world is so messed up these days. Belle didn't care what the beast looked she only cared about his true character which is how all love is supposed to be but sadly its not how life is anymore. Its a beautiful story about what life really should be and what love should really be and mean inside and out. period that's it. People now chose who they 'love' by looks or the way someone is known to be or if that person is a popular person themselves with nobody else's help not one little bit. I really love the movie and I think that you would as well if you watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to watch this movie over and over again when I was little, it was always in the VCR. It was my favorite movie, it still is. I love the music, the animation, the characters and the story line. I identify with Belle the most, I feel as if she and I are one in the same. We love our family and a good book...or two. I have never succumbed to the pressure of society and I always stuck up for myself and others, just like she did. I learned to love people for who they are, not what they look like. This movie always encouraged me to do by best and be the best person I can be. Plus, the library Beast gives her is amazing and I would love it if it were mine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated fantasy, romantic, and musical film distributed by Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast Featuring the vocal talents of Robby Benson and Paige O'Hara with Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Richard White, the movie displays the story of a prince, whose punishment for his selfish and cruel ways, is turned into a beast and Belle, a woman who willing takes her father's place as prisoner of the castle. To become the prince again, the beast must love Belle and in turn she must love the beast or he will remain as he is forever. The film is directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Gary Trousdale has worked on the story of Oliver and Company( 1998 film), The Little Mermaid(1989 film) as storyboard artist,Aladdin( 1992 film) as pre- production story developer and CGI, The Lion King (1994 film) on the story,The Hunchback of Notre Dame(1996 film) as director, Madagascar(2005 film) as an additional storyboard artist, Flushed Away(2006 film) as an additional story artist, among many more. Meanwhile Kirk Wise also worked on Oliver and Company as an animating assistant and with the story, The Prince and the Pauper as a storyboard artist, The Lion King with additional story material, The Hunchback of Notre Dame as director, Spirited Away as director of the U.S. Production, among others. Paige O'Hara voices the film's main protagonist, Belle. She also portrayed Angela in Enchanted. The setting of the film is somewhere in rural France in the 1700s. Character development was very well done, therefore solid 3-D characters.Another highlight was the computer animation, particularly the ballroom dance scene, which was impressively caricatured. The songs while a bit childish still are very nice. The score was also pleasing to the ears.The sound was very realistic and you could feel like you were actually there. The special effects were outstanding. The movie wasn't slow or fast, it was nearly perfectly well-paced and that's a lot given that the run time is only 84 minutes. It is the best film by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Quality wise, it's Kirk Wise's Spirited Away was significantly better. The plot was creative and quite unpredictable. The dialogue was also memorable. The movie flowed incredible scene to scene. The lighting and ambiance was superb. The animation was realistic and nothing looked out of the ordinary( in a good way). The costume design was intricate and realistic. It contributed positively towards the movie's overall tone. The set design was exceptional and it added to the movie experience. If the movie was filmed in an actual location, it would have to be well- chosen while there is hardly place where all of that is nearby. The background music was amazing. It worked incredibly well for the film.Ir was wasn't under-used or used in excess. The music was suspenseful and amusing, obviously in the correct places. All in all, the movie was fascinating and interesting, despite not being Disney's finest film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle of Disney's Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belle, whose father is imprisoned by the Beast, offers herself instead and discovers her captor to be an enchanted prince.This film was right in the middle of Disney's golden age, sandwiched between "Aladdin" and "Little Mermaid", pushing the boundaries of digital animation (just a few years before Pixar blew Disney out of the water). And the songs... definitely quite memorable.For me, Belle is the best princess Disney has had to date. While not an outright feminist role model like "Brave" was intended to be, she is a woman whose strengths are not in physical beauty, but in her intelligence. I think that was a great decision. Sure, she is not ugly, but the focus was on her being more than just "a prize to be won".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Disney Perennial Gets an Added Dimension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after the passage of just over twenty years, "Beauty and the Beast" remains one of the best animated films Disney has ever made. I knew this even before attending this rerelease, which, following the tremendous success of "The Lion King 3D" last fall, has been given the 3D treatment. But there was something about seeing it once again on the big screen that brought it home for me. Perhaps it was looking at the picture in a format larger than a television set for the first time in years. Or perhaps it was hearing the music emanating from a source other than my TV speakers or a set of earphones. Whatever the case, I watched the film as transfixed as I was when I first saw it as an eight-year-old boy in 1991. I then left with the satisfying knowledge that it hasn't aged a day; like Disney perennials such as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Pinocchio," it's a film you can grow old with.When I saw "The Lion King" back in September, I found myself in torn between two very different reactions. On the one hand, I appreciated reliving the story, becoming reacquainted with the characters, and once again experiencing the music and the animation. On the other hand, I was quite disappointed by the 3D conversion, which seemed to me the only reason the film was rereleased at all. When I learned of "Beauty and the Beast 3D," I was wary, for I didn't want a marketing ploy to diminish the power of its hand-drawn animation, the kind no computer could come close to achieving. Thankfully, my fears were put to rest. The technicians responsible for the conversion have seen to it that the process was immersive rather than gimmicky. It helped that I saw the film in a theater equipped with digital projectors that allow for bright, clean pictures.Having said that, the 3D is unique, for it has been applied to images that began life as two-dimensional cels. This is obviously different from modern-day computer animated films, where objects are intentionally rendered to exhibit depth, even when projected in 2D. One of Walt Disney's innovative touches on "Snow White" was the use of the multiplane camera system, in which drawings were layered one on top of the other and then moved separately towards or away from a camera mounted above them. The drawings in front would move faster than the ones in back, ensuring the illusion of depth. The opening shot of "Beauty and the Beast," which used the multiplane system, is a slow zoom towards the Beast's castle through tree branches and over a forest; because of the 3D conversion, each layer of drawings takes on the appearance of a theater flat, or a piece of plywood onto which scenery was painted for use live stage productions. This results in an uncanny storybook quality appropriate for the film.In other instances, most notably the musical number "Be Our Guest," more of an effort is made to make the characters and objects seem like dimensional beings. The moment in which the character of Lumiere is lifted into the air by a geyser of pink punch is surprisingly effective, as is a rapid tracking shot through a chorus line of living candlesticks as they raise their heads, eventually revealing Lumiere standing on a cake. The ballroom waltz of the title characters during the title song featured some fantastic aerial shots around a chandelier, all of which take on a new kind of grandeur with the 3D process. And there are many shots showcasing either rain or snow; because both represent a flurry of activity ? visual noise, if you will ? they seem the most dimensional of anything else in the film, making them the best post-conversion shots.But why am I making this about the wonders of technology? "Beauty and the Beast" should be seen first and foremost for the sheer magic of its storytelling. Equal parts exuberant fun, heartfelt drama, and sweeping romance, its plot of a lonely beast who must love and be loved in return transcends the simple archetypes of the traditional fairy tale and becomes a lasting form of family entertainment. The characters are all individually realized so that none of them disappear into the background; this wouldn't have been possible were it not for the vocal talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, and Richard White. The songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were Broadway caliber long before the film actually made the transition to Broadway. For Menken in particular, the film represents some of his best musical work ? second only, perhaps, to what he would accomplish several years later with the tragically underrated "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."The opening number, "Belle," is surely one of the greatest in the history of musicals, stage or screen; apart from being rousing, melodically memorable, and lyrically clever, it does a fantastic job establishing the character it's named after. It even has a thing or two to say about Gaston before a he's given a song of his own, a hilariously wicked ode to his overinflated ego. "Be Our Guest" is a showstopping and catchy display of choreography and gravity-defying acrobatics. And then, of course, there's the title song, which earned an Oscar for its touching sentiments on learning to love despite obvious differences. ("Human Again," a deleted musical number restored for the film's 2002 IMAX rerelease, has once again been omitted.) But I think the songs are only part of the reason why "Beauty and the Beast" has endured for all these years and will endure even in 3D; the filmmakers saw to it that the animation, story, and characters would appeal to all members of the family, not just young children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Beauty" Shines Brighter Than Ever in 3-D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1991, when "Beauty and The Beast" came out, it has changed the way we have seen animated films. This was a movie that had pure heart in storytelling and a groundbreaking score that could take moviegoers straight to Broadway heaven without going to the real place. Now it's back in theaters in 3-D, and from the first minute, it has never been more crystal clear and magnificent than before in 21 years. Belle{Paige O'Hara} is a daughter of a smart and funny inventor Maurice {Rex Everheart}. She has a love for her father and books but, she wishes for a better life. The town's most handsome man Gaston {Richard White} tries to get Belle's attention, but she refuses. Then one night, when Maurice tries to make a shortcut on the way to the inventor's fair, he is stopped by wolves. Maurice then finds shelter at a castle, but soon he becomes prisoner of the Beast {Robby Benson}. Later, when Belle finds her father in the dungeon, the Beast stops her from setting him go. But then, Belle decides to trade herself for her father's safety. Soon, Belle realizes that she is seeing magical things such as a teapot, a candlestick and a clock come to life. The magical things are really humans that have been cursed because of a spell that turned the prince into a Beast. Now the Beast must find a way to get back to his human self and Belle could be the one thing that could break the curse.Fans of the original will feel like going back to cloud 9 and the brand new generation of kids will be amazed. The animation is like so brighter and beautiful than ever. The "Be Our Guest" and dance sequences have never looked better. Plus, the soundtrack has a clearer new sound thanks to today's technology. Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman's songs are so tuneful and hummable that Stephen Sondheim and Cole Porter would give a run for their money. The characters' voices really deliver. Benson gives the Beast a creature that has been long suffering because of a mistake and a strong voice that would have made Clint Eastwood proud. O'Hara gives a marvelous and Streisand-like voice as Belle. Angela Lansbury is a revelation as Mrs. Potts and the late great Jerry Orbach shines as Lumiere."Beauty" really shows us why we go to the movies for. It makes us laugh, cry, applaud, learn something and be wowed. It really delivers the same evidence for now in 2012 as it did in 1991. Note: Before "Beauty and the Beast", the characters from Disney's recent hit "Tangled" are back in a very funny short ,"Tangled Ever After" showing the wedding of Rapunzel and Flynn. It will make cartoon fans remember the old days of the Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. Also, stay during the end credits for a special treat. Rating: 4 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange movie. Not subject or evolution of facts are important. But the brilliance of imagination. The small world in a crazy movement and the magic play of objects. The colors and the music. Nice details and love as delicate ladder. And the end as point for the evolution of characters in your imagination. So, the result is only spell. For the smart solution to create a fluid action, for the art to remind childhood areas, for the basic flips and for charming Belle. And, of course, grace new image of Beast - fragile, shy, dizzy, childish, melancholic, coarse, romantic, stubborn. But the best - dance scenes. A fairy tale in new clothes but with old gentle soul. An adventure. And fantastic holiday in the corners of golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an update from my previous review.Well I took my sister to watch Beauty and the Beast on 3D and I got to say, I was very satisfied. Beauty and the Beast has been one of my all times favorite movies, but Ill try not to be biased. I have never been a fan of 3D movies, I've yet to see a movie where it Really is 3D (hand sticking out and you flinching etc). This movie was no different in that it was nothing special as far as that affect. However, what I was really amazed was for a 3D effect was the stain glass windows in the beginning and the end of the movie. IT did look like I was looking at a real glass popping. Other than that, the movie was crystal clear in picture. I was able to see more definition that I would at home on blu-ray at home. They kept the original features as well. For instance, they did Not put the extra additive song "Human Again" which could be optionally watched in your DVD/Blu-ray. They also have kept the skulls in Gastons eyes when it showed a close up when he was falling of his death (apparently has something to do with the secret society of the Skull and Bones society, but the theories vary). Other than that whatever makes you feel good and makes you love this movie, its worth a watch. Even if you have it purchased at home, it would be good to see it in the big screen. Its a moment you will not forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the serious tone of this tale Disney manages to make this one really kids friendly. Yes Beast is really scary at first and the dark scenes in the woods and castle are really creepy. I was actually really impressed how the movie makers came up with the idea of turning the other people in the castle into pieces of furniture because of the spell. It was genius how each person had become an object close to the task they were fulfilling in the castle. This makes of course for some really funny scenes. The constant squabbling between Pendule and Lumiere is priceless. Belle is pretty different from other Disney female heroes that she is not interested in romance at all (at least not until she discovers she soft side of Beast). Yes it is heartwarming how Beast changes from a coldhearted monster into a loving and tender man. Let's not forget the catchy songs which are pretty much the best parts of the movie wanting you to sing and dance along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far I've seen RobinHood, Alice in Wonderland, The Sword in the Stone, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty and now Beauty and the Beast. Out of all of these, this one comes as my current favorite, with each of the others being close seconds.Why is this my favorite? Well, the story was pretty much perfect. Sleeping Beauty was okay, but seemed to lack character and story. I didn't really "care" about the characters as I did with this one. The kiss at the end was just that. Then everyone was happy.This one, you get involved with the characters. You feel for them. It was harder to scoff at the scenes that were romantic. I even shed a tear at the end. I mean, there was story in every scene, you connected with the Beast, you laughed at the funny moments and got frightened and angry at his 'beast' moments, and cried at the ending.I'm glad I saw this, as I rate it 10/10. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Beauty and the Beast' is a classic love story that anyone will enjoy, whether you're a small child, a teenager, an adult, or an elderly person. It's a film that's charming, elegant, and sweet, not to mention funny. The songs are fantastic, and share the honor with 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' of having the best lineup of songs. I guarantee you'll remember at least three of them for years to come, including 'Be Our Guest', and the classic 'Beauty and the Beast'. The story follows Belle, a beautiful girl living in an rural area. She has always lived to assist her father, a desperate inventor who seems to be losing his marbles. When he goes off to an inventor's show and gets lost, Maurice's horse returns to Belle, and they set off to find him. Maurice is discovered in a colossal castle, filled with mysterious inhabitants, including the master, a fierce and horrifying beast. Belle persuades the Beast to take her instead of her father, and thus the story begins. Belle soon discovers there could be so much more to this beast than rage and hair (laughs). Filled with excellent actors including the late Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury, B&amp;B is simply excellent, a beautiful romance that will attract any viewer to its unavoidable charm. As quoted in the song, it's a tale as old time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and the Beast.8/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. Following the adventure of a Beautiful Young Woman who finds herself captive to a hideous Beast and the spell breaking love that blooms between them, the story is as heartwarming and magical, as the music, composed by Alan Menken and the Late Howard Ashman, is completely memorable, which include such standards as "Be Our Guest", "Something There" and the Oscar winning Title Song. Featuring some of the most incredible feats in animation, it is the third film of the Disney Golden Age, that helped pave the way for Animated movies to be considered legitimate films, receiving the First Oscar nomination for Best Picture ever bestowed to an Animated Picture (and held the recognition as the only picture of it's kind to achieve this accolade for nearly 20 years). Kids will like it for it's comedy and memorable characters. Adults will like it for it's message that beauty is more than skin deep, and love can do miracles. Romantics will like it for the unparalleled love story that revolves around the famed title characters'. If your a Disney Fan this Film is a must. The same thing to parents out their, Musical lovers and anyone who wants to be moved beyond belief.</fullReview>

By 'Beauty and the Beast' I was crying, and by the end reprise I was happy again. I challenge anyone who dares say that this film doesn't contain everything a musical needs: a touching romance, an evil villain prepared to ruin her romance, fantastic songs and an award winning score (very deservedly), believable characters with no wooden voicing (Angela Lansbury singing absolutely beautifully) and how many decent films have been made into a successful Broadway musical? Only with Alan Menken, Howard Ashman (and a little help from Tim Rice). It is also a dawning, as this is the only villain in any film that I have fallen in love with. Gaston rocks, and if he was real, I would marry him without a doubt. I don't care if he is an animated character: Gaston is a very, very, VERY sexy tenor, and if no one else is attracted, then you can go to hell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting that for a time, the best music written for the stage was being introduced in animated features, mostly by Disney. This is one of the best and it translated well to Broadway. From the opening sequence of Belle, with her strong character, to the dancing household items at the Beast's castle, this has got to be one of Disney's finest productions. It has heart and soul. It has Gaston, a great villain, with a great song bearing his name. He is the epitome of male chauvinism. It is remindful of Miles Gloriosus in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." The fairy tale plays itself out with delightful pacing. The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation. That there are forces in the universe makes this a positive film. The scare factor is there as well, with the thorny forest of the Beast, providing a barrier to all who dare enter. It shows that love can be easy, but true love without sacrifice is empty. Until the Beast knows this his lot will continue on. The songs are complex and varied, some of the best every. All the characters have purpose. This is an outstanding film.</fullReview>

It's an adorable story with romance, comedy, and a little slapstick action. The characters are really well developed, particularly Belle, the Beast and the many implements of the house that play significant roles. They also provide the humor. The clock Cogsworth and the Candlestick Lumiere have a dynamic friendship with a brotherly knack for irritating each other.The motherly teapot, voiced by Angela Lansbury, is the calm, steady minded member of the house, and more often than not she can sets things straight.This really is a magical, beautiful film, almost more a work of art.

		<fullReview>There are nearly no words to describe how truly incredible this film is in almost every way possible. Everything is right up front and done beautifully; the cinematogrophy, the graphics, the frame rate, the development of the characters, the voice-acting, the layout of the plot, the music, the emotional impact, everything! I don't even know where to begin explain the power of this film. But to start, I am more than impressed with the graphics considering the computer technology that was available through 1989-1991. We were still running 386 PC's with Windows 3.1! To continue, the music is awesome and each song comes in at just the right time! While watching this film, you would say to yourself "I'd like to hear a song right about now." And it happens! Which is a 1 in a 1,000,000 chance of happening and it does just that in Beauty in the Beast. And every character has an excellent personality that develops smoothly and you never get bored with them whether you love or hate them. It is sad, however, that Howard Ashman died six months before the theatrical premiere of the film. To continue, this film truly teaches you the lesson of understanding people and love them for who they are and not for what they are or how repulsive they can be. And aside from the characters different from the novel, the heart of the story remains untainted. And it's truly enjoyable for all ages young and old. I'll be watching this film until I live to be 80 years old. The best film Disney has ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

Beauty and the Beast is definitely in the classic category. It has drama, comedy, music, and adventure all packed into 90 minutes. Even the new song 'Human Again' fits into the movie flawlessly. The animation is at times awe-inspiring. And unless, you're coldhearted and emotionally dead, the love interest between Belle and the beast will put a lump in your throat.

		<fullReview>"Beauty and the Beast" (1991), marked a return to top form for Disney. In this film, excellent animation, characters, story and songs all come together. After Walt Disney died in 1967, the animated films after that had lost that special Disney touch. With this film, Disney re-discovered it's magic touch."Beauty and the Beast" is a re-telling of the classic fairy tale. Here, the heroine "Belle" is an independent, book loving woman with a strong sense of imagination. The second change made to the traditional story are the castle servants under the spell as furniture and kitchenware.I was very impressed with the film. I felt it definitely deserved it's Academy Award nomination for Best Picture of 1991 (a first ever). It's competition that year were: "Thelma and Louise" and "The Silence of the Lambs" (both very good films, in my opinion). Now there is a new category: Best Animated Feature Film. If it existed then, this is the award that Beauty and the Beast deserved to win. I've seen the other Disney classic films: from "Snow White" (1937) to "Dumbo" (1942) and believe that this film ranks with them as one of Disney's Best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a great love story, not only for the little ones, but for the ?big ones' as well. I must admit that I, as a twenty-something, did feel that the story was somewhat predictable, but the execution of the whole was so excellent that it did not bother me that me that much. It remained a good film, although without predictability it could have been a masterpiece. Disney somehow never seizes to amaze me with the quality of their animated features and I hope that it remains that way for many years to come. If you want to see a really romantic film with your girlfriend and you're positive that she can't stomach Coppola's Dracula, Beauty and the Beast provides you with an equally dark, yet less brutal fairy tale. Don't worry though, there enough laughs as well!8 out of 10post scriptum: I watched the special edition</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's Return to Glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Disney first started animated films, particularly with its opening trio of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "Pinnochio", and "Fantasia", the point was literally to change the way film exists, particularly in a medium such as animation which is generally regared kiddy fluff with little real cinematic value. They succeeded. Watching the early films, with the moveable images, the wonderful swirl of imagination and music, creates a whole new way of experiencing the story.The later Disney features were a little more formulaic, but still outstanding: they found a story, ran with it, and focused on loveable characters with witty voices. Films like "Peter Pan", "Alice in Wonderland", "Lady and the Tramp", were all more like elegant pieces of pop art than real challenging stuff."Beauty and the Beast" re-wrote the rules. The camera flows effortlessly in and out and around a scene, creating a visual way of telling the story that's almost Spielberg-esque. Then you need a compelling cast of vocal talent, worked together flawlessly with charming music. Check off all of the above for this film. It really was a Return to Glory for Disney, a film that touched audiences that last really loved a Disney film when "Mary Poppins" was released. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live your own fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belle is a young woman who has arrived at that age where budding dreams and fantasies begin to well up inside her young heart and yearn for a form of release. The world of the small French town where she lives revolves around the dreary hustle and bustle of everyday life, with the fate of woman's domestic life waiting to entrap her. She alienates herself from her fellow townspeople with her quirky and aloof nature, and instead transmutes her desire for escape into a love for books. We see her passionately singing to a passing herd of sheep of her adoration for tales of romance and adventure, yet later when she sits alone in her house feelings of loneliness and depression begin to surface.Despite the importance literature holds in her heart, the film develops the theme of going out and living your own adventure. This message really strikes home in the closing scene of the movie, when an image of Belle and the Prince transfigures into artwork in a stained glass window, a grand gesture of how this small-town girl with big dreams has changed into a symbol of fantasy and magic that captured in the art of the stained glass attains a sense of immortality and truth. I think it is important in this sense to realize that both Beauty and the Beast undergo their own separate form of transformation.The Beast is somewhat underdeveloped, for we never really learn much about him other than that behind the rough, animal facade is something warm and benevolent that Belle brings to life. We learn more about him through his actions, rather than through dialogue or song, yet there are certain moments in the film, such as when Beast decides to let Belle go, when the magic of the animators really shines. Beast has the largest, most expressive face of all the characters in the film, and the animation team really brings it to life. After he transforms, though, he becomes just another pretty blonde face, which has a subtle resemblance to Aladdin (a later Disney character).Enjoy the film, then go out and live your own fairy tale.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Howard Ashman (who produced and wrote the lyrics to the songs) was an absolute genius. Its a tragedy that he never saw the movie's completion. He died in March of 1991 of AIDS. 7 months before the film's release. But boy would he have been proud of the tremendous success the film had; and how it touched the hearts of millions with lovable characters and brilliant songs. And the ultimate message "Love conquers all" and "Beauty is skin deep". The IMAX release in January 2002 only made it better, with a new musical sequence that had viewers scratching their heads over why it was left out in the first place. But without Mr.Ashman this film wouldn't be half of what it is. I leave you with the films dedication.

		<shortDescription>Excellent but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I most certainly agree that this is a wonderful film. Though, in my opinion, not the greatest of Disney animated features (that title goes to The Jungle Book), nor the most entertaining (that title goes to Aladdin), Beauty and the Beast still manages to have all the right parts to make a solid film.I love the score, it is another gem from Alan Menken. Howard Ashman really does give a Beast his soul (it was the end credits if you didn't catch it) with his lyrics. Also, the story is pretty good, with just the right amount of Disney magic in it. Its got great characters, including the house objects that add a lot of fun to the story (especially Lumiere, he's so cool, and his girlfriend feather duster is so gorgeous for an animated lady).And the animation, well what can I say? It beats anything else that Disney has come up with, except for The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, and of course, Aladdin. Its not that the animation isn't as good as in the aforementioned movies, its just that it is not better.However, there is one complaint that I have to make. It is not really about the movie, but about how one of its parts is treated. Though the Beast, Belle, and the castle objects are great characters, I feel that none of them deserve the title of most memorable performance in this film.That title goes to Gaston, one of my all time favorite Disney villains. Gaston is so complex. One minute, he's just an arrogant, stuck-up bum that is reminisicent of someone we all know and find irritating. Yet, he manages to add a little humor in his attempts to woo Belle. Then, he turns into a real jerk, willing to lock Maurice up to get Belle. And finally, he becomes pure evil, ready to kill the Beast to win Belle. That mocking laugh and look he gives the Beast when he says, "What's the matter? Too kind and gentle to fight back?" is one of the greatest scenes in Disney villainry history. A rare few scenes rank up with the amount of evil emotion that this scene has, such as Scar giving Mufasa an incredibly horrifying look before murdering him, or Jafar laughing like an insane lunatic after banishing Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to the Ends of the Earth. Great moments that illustrate just how dark a villain can be. Richard White outdid himself with this role, and I remember his work more than Robby Benson, Paige O'Hara, David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach, or Angela Lansbury. It upsets me that everyone focuses on the other roles in this film, but not so much on White's. When I read up about the great Disney villains of all time, often Gaston is not included. Though not the all-time greatest of the Disney villains, I feel he is greatly underrated and deserves more respect. Nevertheless, I love the film and give it a 10/10.P.S.

		<fullReview>This has to be the best Disney animation picture ever. Nearly all the other Disney heroines have ready-made Prince Charmings, but Belle learns to love a Beast (so she hated him at first - that wasn't because of his physical appearance, it was because he'd imprisoned her father). All the songs are lovely, but 'Tale as Old as Time' crowns them all. This film can be described in one word: beautiful.PS I only have one minor criticism of this film: that when Disney had a heroine that was a bit strange and very bookish, it offends me that they chose a brunette. It's basically saying: 'Blondes are the pretty ones'. But that did no way spoil the movie - it was pure perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of THE BEST movies ever. The story, the characters, the music, everything is pure genious but then what else can you expect from disney? :-) I love the character Belle, created by Mark Henn, she is so unique to the other people in the village, and i love how rebelious she is, a bit like Ariel and more of the modern heroines, as well as some of the older ones too. Andreas Deja did a great job with Gaston, i can't stand him...he is so conceited and you just wanna strangle him for being so egotistic - and the fact that Belle rejects him is fantastic too :-) And as usual Glen Keane did a stupendous job, creating the character of the Beast using a combination of different animals, yet giving him those gentle blue eyes which show his true being. The music is wonderful, another great colabiration between the late Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. Their music is so wonderful, and beautiful that its not really the same anymore. i find it so beautiful and cherishing that they dedicated the film to Mr Ashman, who sadly died 6 months before its release. Thankfully (and it took them long enough) Disney are re-releasing this fabulous film, with an extra segment, the musical number 'Human Again' which is a true gesture and sign of respect and gratefulness to Howard Ashman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to say one thing right off the bat; I absolutely love this film. But I was less than thrilled with the results of blowing it up to IMAX size. The additional sequence, "Human Again" was fun, and it was novel to see it on a huge screen, but so many of the background characters were so huge on the IMAX screen that it was apparent that they were a lot less detailed than the main, foreground characters. The final sequence, where Belle and the restored Prince are waltzing was a good example of this; they waltz, everyone else stands perfectly still, un-animated and it was so much more apparent on the large screen. It was my understanding that Disney was going back to re-animate some of these background characters. Well, apparently, they missed a bunch of them. Once again, great film, but the large scale format does it a great injustice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled "Beauty"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney sure doesn't make 'em like they used to. These words might sound a little facetious, given that "Beauty and the Beast" is only a little over ten years old, but in a way it's true. No film produced by the House of Mouse since then has exceeded the quality of this one; only a handful (The Lion King and both Toy Story films certainly) can claim equality.All the elements that Disney would employ in their animated features over the subsequent decade are present here and yet there's something in "Beauty and the Beast" that the formula has not duplicated, proving that good movies really are more than the sum of their parts. Perhaps it has something to do with the way the pieces fit together so flawlessly, the manner in which the certain elements combine to create a touching romance with all the right elements of humor, tenderness, and excitement.The visual aspect of the film takes hold at once with a prologue explaining the backstory through a series of stained-glass windows: as punishment for his selfishness and cruelty, a prince is transformed into a Beast by a powerful sorceress. He must learn to love and be loved in return, or face life as a monster. Enter Belle, a young woman living in a village not too far from the enchanted castle, admired for her beauty but looked down on by the townsfolk for her bookish ways. Belle is the grandmother of the spirited heroines of later animated features, and it is easy to see why. Instead of pining over the local hunk, she reads and helps her inventor father; rather than wish for Prince Charming, she desires a true soulmate. More than anything, she is noble: when her father becomes imprisoned by the Beast after losing his way in the woods, Belle bravely abandons her hopes for a better life to take his place.This is, of course, the opportunity the Beast has long desired, but as a servant observes "these things take time." How the romance grows, and how the characters grow because of it, is one of the highlights of the film. The Beast must learn to put aside his selfish ways and hair-trigger temper and think of others while Belle, in the manner of Elizabeth Bennett, discovers that first impressions can be misleading. Aiding them are the servants of the castle, transformed into various furnature and housewares by the same spell which altered their master. Far from feeling wedged into the film for the sake of comic relief these characters fit into the story seamlessly, their motivation clear: only by helping the love between Belle and the Beast can they regain their humanity. Villiany is provided by Gaston, the aformentioned local hunk. He too has designs on Belle, on the pretext that as the most beautiful girl in the village, she is the only one worthy of his attentions. At first a foolish peacock of a man, Gaston develops into a manipulative bully and a real threat to the heros.The score by Alan Menken is one of his finest, and also the last one which his longtime lyricist Howard Ashman completed. All the songs are perfect, but special attention must be paid to the title song. In addition to winning an Oscar, the touching ballad also acompanies the most stunning sequence in the movie, in which Belle and the Beast waltz around a gilt ballroom. The camera swoops and soars around the couple, creating chills that do not diminish upon repeated viewings.The recent IMAX re-release of "Beauty and the Beast" contains new footage, including a song originally cut from the film in '91. The large-screen format serves the film well, bringing out details lost in smaller mediums. Seeing it up on the big screen is like falling in love all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's best since its Uncle Walt was alive, but the attempts at feminism fall flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a very entertaining, very imaginative reworking of the tired old fairy tale. The animation is great (though it would have been nice if some the musical numbers--namely Be Our Guest--had stayed in the same physical plane as Belle instead of having the backgrounds vanish and allowing the characters to have free, nearly surreal movements), the acting is (usually) great, and the songs are fun.The problems I have with this movie are minor and more political/sociological than anything else. Belle is treated by the writers as more or less a model of modern feminism (normally I would complain about this sort of time-swapping social values without exception, but I've come to expect this kind of PC treatment from Disney, so what can I do?)--she reads, she doesn't listen to other peoples complaints about her reading, and she refuses to marry Gascon. That's about it, really. The latter two are truly good personality traits. The other is more iffy because of what she reads: fairy tales (ones with pictures, though Gascon must be blind not to see them). As it turns out, she's just dreaming about a prince charming coming to rescue her from her crass rural existence, not a thinker capable of doing that on her own. She is not much more than the reader of the silly romance novels that true writers like Alexander Pope, Aphra Behn, Samuel Johnson, and Jonathan Swift have been making fun of since the Restoration.This is none-the-less a minor complaint. I mean, at least she isn't cos-playing Sailor Moon or the Power Rangers. Now, here's a thought: why didn't the writers bother comparing the Beast with Gascon? Isn't it true that the Beast was just like Gascon before the spell was cast on him? As such, wouldn't that mean Gascon (though an idiot) could have been redeemed instead of cheaply plunged to his death (what is it with Disney lately, anyway--can't they think of other ways of killing people, or better yet finding a more interesting way to end a movie than killing the villain). There's just something sick about that sort of thing since he is only a human, and goes completely against the redemptive power of the main story.</fullReview>

That was a MAJOR mistake on Disney's part (what were they thinking?), but the plot, the songs, and the animation (not including the aforementioned) were top notch and make up for that fact. I vividly remember the first time I saw Beauty and the Beast. As soon as it started, I knew that this was going to be something great. When you first hear Belle sing... "Little town, it's a quiet village, everyday like the one before...". What a great opening! And, when Belle and the Beast danced in the ballroom, that was just spectacular.

		<fullReview>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been called so many things. Enchanting, magical, simply beautiful, a perfect love story. BEAUTY is indeed all that and is so much more. On the whole scale, it is a grand and powerful fable with a simplistic story sugar coated with the best animation effort at the time. In its finer moments, BEAUTY is also a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable, the characters are so easy to get into, and its made for children and adults in mind, BEAUTY is so much next to flawless, some people forget that it does have some silly mistakes kicking around in there (what is the Beast 's age anyway, it seems to change throughout the movie). Belle longs for more than a local life. Especially since the town folk think she is rather odd for keeping her nose buried in books all the time. Except for Gaston, a tall, muscular, but self absorbed hunk that wants Belle as his wife. Belle has no interest in the conceited oaf, but her life does take a change for the worse when her father, Maurice, disappears. Maurice wandered off into an enchanted castle where teapots talk and candles romance the dusting feathers. Although these 'servants' welcome Maurice, the master of the castle does not approve and imprisons him. The master is actually a tremendously huge and fearsome beast that everyone cowers from. But strong Belle stands up to him and takes her father's place as prisoner when she confronts him. With a beautiful woman in the castle now, the servants do their best to encourage the master that she may be, 'the one who can break the spell.' The spell being the one an enchantress cast on the castle and everyone after the prince (a k a beast) did not welcome her ten years ago.There is plenty to soak into this masterpiece. First and foremost is the beautiful C G I effects done in the ball room where Belle and Beast dance. It is definitely hard not to dislike that moment. C G I also does a superb job on the "Be Our Guest" song where Lumiere and the servants finally have a chance to strut their stuff. Very few musical Broadway shows can catch up to the energy that the silverware, candles, and even Cogsworth make. Gaston and his title song are also prime moments in this movie. He is interesting to Disney mainly because he is such a charismatic villain and literally has the whole town that Belle grew up in against her and, later on, the Beast. Finally, the Beast is definitely the most stand out main character compared to most Disney movies. Although his fearsome nature and angry attitude is emphasized by Belle and his servants, he never dulls the screen compared to other main characters like Ariel in THE LITTLE MERMAID or Mickey Mouse in general. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST will definitely survive the test of time. It is Broadway at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best animated motion pictures. It tells the classic tale of a selfish and greedy prince who as a punishment for his selfish acts was turned into a beast and would only turn back to human if he found the ability to love... and be loved back before the last petal of an enchanted rose fell. Then Belle, a beautiful young woman becomes his 'prisoner' to free her father from the Beast. As time goes by Belle sees that the Beast is not as bad as he seems and the Beast learns to control his temper. Beauty and the Beast is a true masterpiece and an unforgettable film, that anyone of any age can love and appreciate. It features some of Disney's most unforgettable characters: Belle (beautifully voiced by Paige O'Hara), The Beast (very well voiced by Robby Benson), Lumiere the candlestick holder (voiced very lively to my surprise by Jerry Orbach of Law &amp; Order), Cogsworth the clock (voiced brilliantly by David Ogden Stiers, who has also provided voices for Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas) and of course cinema's nicest teapot, Mrs. Potts (voiced magnificently by Angela Lansbury, who perhaps was the first to provide a 'celebrity voice' for an animated Disney film). And I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention Chip, Maurice (Belle's wacky father) and of course one of Disney's sexiest characters the feather-duster, who Lumiere constantly flirts with. When it comes to bad guys, I would say that Gaston is probably the most realistic Disney villain- He is human, he has no supernatural powers yet he is such a horrible person- he would actually lock Belle's father up in an insane asylum and only let him out if Belle agreed to marry him. I have constantly found myself enjoying Disney villains but I can truly hate Gaston as he is cruelty in it's true nature. Another villain very realistic with no supernatural powers like him is 101 Dalmatians' Cruella De Vil. And as for the music: Well, it rightfully deserved the Oscars for best score (provided by Alan Menken) and best song. It features unforgettable songs such as Beauty and the Beast and Be Our Guest. Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best achievements and most worthy of being called a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a time when Walt Disney could no no wrong. But then came DuckTales and stuff like that. And things were in turmoil for a while. Seriously, how many people watched "Oliver and Company"? I know I didn't, and I have watched every single animated feature of the company (except that one).That's the reason Beauty and the Beast is such a welcome surprise. This film, and "Lion King" are true masterpieces. I cannot say the same about Tarzan, or "Hunchback of Notre Dame" or "Aladdin". But there is something in this film that makes me cry every single time I watch it.What could it be? Maybe that, since the beginning, you learn to care for the Beast and his loneliness. Or you admire Belle for her will to be something more. And you cannot forget the sadness of the inhabitants of the castle, who know that they might be doomed forever.And then... and then Belle and the Beast dance in the ballroom sequence, and they glance at each other, and you can feel the love they have for each other. But how? This is only a cartoon, isn't it? Fact is, the drawings themselves have an incredible power in them; the facial expressions are simply perfect, and the terse, beautiful song enhances the feeling. Movie magic at its best. Beauty and the Beast is a cartoon that makes you forget you are watching one. It's full of love, passion and drama. Should have been nominated for Best Picture. Sadly, the Academy hasn't (yet!) learned to appreciate the power of animated art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The animation is superb and the characters are some of Disney's most memorable. I had to watch this in health class my sophomore year, and then I had to write a paper integrating the characters into modern society. (Don't ask why this was a health assignment):) It was an interesting assignment because it is so true. The characters can easily be integrated into our society. We tend to shun people just because they are unattractive on the outside, like the way people shunned the beast. Gaston is the "attractive on the outside but ugly on the inside character." These are the kinds of people most young girls fall in love with, because they are merely concerned with looks. All in all, Beauty and the Beast is a touching love story thatI will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may not match the popularity of The Little Mermaid, here in the Philippines, but this one is animation at its very best. The movements are so close to being human, that you may sometimes forget that these characters were drawn. This is evident in the dance hall sequence where the Beast dances with Belle. The wonderful musical score is a no-brainer for Disney movies: but who could ever forget the theme song? To stay true to the original material is really hard to do, but this one pulled it off with great success. What also makes this film different, is that it pulled in more adult audiences than kid audiences here in the Philippines. Certainly there are singing spoons and plates but taking into consideration the spell that the whole castle went into, adult audiences didn't have a hard time taking it hook, line and sinker. The thing here is not to enjoy, but to experience. Agree? Be my guest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Walt Disney chose as a fairytale the subject for his first animated feature: `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. The result was first screened in 1937. He revisited fairytales with `Cinderella', in 1950, and `Sleeping Beauty', in 1959. He never made another. Nor did his studio, until the release of `Beauty and the Beast', in 1991.It's odd: because the fairytales Disney chose are poor ones, and the films I just mentioned are of value mainly because of the valiant way they overcome the limits imposed by their subject matter - and they don't always do so. The story of Beauty and the Beast, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful folktales around. Somehow the studio managed to avoid it for fifty-four years. Perhaps it's a good thing they waited. `Beauty and the Beast' is a triumph, almost on the same level as the great films made in Disney's heyday (up to 1942), and considerably better than `Snow White'.It's hard to say what makes it so good. It's just a touching love story with neither cloying sentimentality nor jarring irony. The animation is mostly very good - and the animation (and character design) of the Beast, the most important character, is inspired. Trousdale and Wise pace and shape the story in exactly the right way, adding detail to the original where necessary, leaving the heart of it unaltered. The occasional clumsiness is more than made up for by sheer sincerity. For the most part it's anything but clumsy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Beauty and the Beast" is one of the finest movies ever made. Notice that I didn't say "one of the finest animated movies"--it is a great film--period.I still remember how excited I was to see this movie, from the day I saw a cardboard stand-up at the local mulitplex. I went on the night it opened, and I was moved from the haunting prologue onward. This is the rare film that exceeded my expectations. I've lost count of how many time I've seen it, but I did see it twelve times while it was in theatres (hey, it was out for eight months or something!).The animation is excellent, but the real key to "Beauty"'s success is its wonderfully real characters. There is nothing false about any of them. The songs, by Howard Ashman (lyrics) and Alan Menken (music), are moving, funny and catchy. We all lost a great treasure when Howard Ashman died. His lyrics were never dumbed down and always clever, enjoyable for adults and children alike.Special praise also goes out to the voice cast, who infuse their character s with life and real emotion. Before Disney starting casting voices just because they belonged to famous movie stars, they actually cast people on the basis of talent. Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Angela Lansbury, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and everyone else are fabulous!I forever lost faith in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when they gave the Oscar to "Silence of the Lambs" instead of "Beauty and the Beast".This will always be one of my all-time favorites!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure everyone who has seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAST can say only good about it as a movie. For example, think about the staff's show during the song "Be Our Guest" - it's quite incredible! And if someone thinks Alan Menken can't make good music he should hear all these songs. I like Belle because she loves reading and doesn't want to marry Gaston, that stupid boaster who doesn't have any manners. I really can't bear the scene in which Gaston "helps Maurice out" of the tavern. When I saw the film for the first time, I had to confess that hearing the Beast's voice really frightened me although I knew no-one needs to be afraid of him. However, I have always liked "The Mob Song". The story is beautiful, too. Belle is and intelligent and friendly girl who teaches the Beast kindness and patience. But once he gets really angry with her, and that's no wonder; think about what would have happened if the rose had snapped!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, all great movies are measured upon how they compare to Beauty and the Beast. In my opinion, this piece of magic is the very best that cinema has ever offered us.I was not a big fan of animated movies at all before I watched this movie. I found them to be childish, shallow, and detached. However, as I walked dizzily out of the theater for Beauty and the Beast, I was struck immediately with the sense that I had just watched the greatest spectacle of all-time. It usually takes me a good 2-3 days after I watch a movie to really appreciate it. I appreciated THIS movie even before the end credits showed up.Never before have I seen a movie so many times...28 times and counting. To me, this defines perfection in movies. There is no movie to date that can match B&amp;B's splendor, from the beautiful music to the breath-taking animation, this film is chock-full of emotions. I could go on and on about this film, but I'll just leave it here with one grand statement. I've seen over 300 films in my lifetime and NONE have ever matched the magic and splendor of Beauty and the Beast.ps - The Academy has forever lost its legitimacy when Beauty and the Beast lost to Unforgiven for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rude Prince refuses a poor elderly woman's present of a rose, and he is cursed to look like an animal, until he shares love with a woman, and if he doesn't make it before his 21st birthday, his appearance will never change back. When he finds a man trespassing in his castle(seeking shelter from the weather and the pack of wolves that always seem to hang around right outside the gate), he locks him up in his prison. The daughter finds out about this, and offers herself in his place. Belle is beautiful and could have anyone in her village for a husband, but she loves books, doesn't want to settle down, and wants adventure(...yeah, she does come off slightly ingrateful for the quite nice life she has for herself, anyway, she's interesting). Meanwhile, Gaston, the best and most handsome hunter around wants to marry her, which she isn't open to. The main theme explored here is, of course, that one should look underneath and not judge superficially. And as such, aforementioned Zapp Branigan type would be the hero in any other Disney piece. He isn't even really the villain right away. He doesn't look like a monster, his behavior makes him one. And the opposite is true(at least in time), of Beast(albeit his manners and temper need work), who is treated to a magnificent design, that allows him to be terrifying as well as express insecurity. That goes for his voice, as well, which is pitch perfect(literally). The underlying softness to it is fantastic. This keeps to a great pace, the plot is moving, characters are developed, things are never standing still(and humor is injected all over, without it costing(much) dramatic effect... whether you find it funny is like with much else from this studio, and for family films, a lot of it is for, or at least meant to also work for, kids). It's genuinely exciting and you want to know what happens next. The moral lesson is present without it being preachy, and it comes across rather well. Roles are all well-cast. This is a musical, and the songs can be pretty catchy. The dialog is good. This is animated well and with passion and energy. There aren't a lot of negatives. I would argue that LeFou doesn't look like he belongs, he's too cartoony among all these realistic-looking humans. There are the usual points about fairie tales and the conventions belonging to the genre. As an example, the romance is out of necessity, first and foremost(the magic has to be reversed, and within a set amount of time), as relationships tended to be back when this was originally conceived(hundreds of years ago, not the development of this interpretation). I personally can't help notice the disturbing(and not the only thing in this that is, either) nature of all the living furniture. If you drink from the living mugs, are you kissing the people they used to be? What if a plate is dropped on the floor, does that kill the person it is? And in the sequences where there are hints of hundreds of items that are alive, do they just sit around doing absolutely nothing when not being eaten out of or the like? Does the bottom cup in the pile get a bad back from the weight of the others? These are questions that shouldn't be asked, of course(and then one can choose to apply psychology, and wonder if this is a case of Stockholm Syndrome). I think a bigger issue is the timeline... from what happens in the small town, it comes off as this all happening over two, maybe three days. Is that really long enough for all that takes place in the fortress? Still, these are not big enough problems to take away from this being a remarkable piece, that hasn't aged a day in 20 years. The Diamond Edition 2-Disc DVD set comes with an amusing and informational commentary(with directors, composer, producer), a Sing-Along track, the well-done, tightly edited and compelling(somehow, the special features garner far more laughs than the flick itself?) documentaries Beyond Beauty(51 minutes, it goes into the people who created this), The Story Behind The Story(26 minutes, and since it has its own page here on the site, I will be reviewing it there), Composing A Classic(19 and a half minutes), "animation"(13 and a half minutes), Broadway Beginnings(12 and a half minutes), deleted scenes(27 minutes, the first two thirds of which completely change the approach and render it darker), deleted song(7 minutes, and 1 and a half minutes intro), alternate version: "be our guest"(5 minutes), 2 music videos(3 and a half minutes and 4 and a half minutes), early presentation reel(3 minutes), 4 TV spots(2 minutes), camera move test(2 minutes), alternate score: the transformation(2 minutes), games(Simon, and a personality test), Trailers(Tangled, Toy Story 3, A Christmas Carol, Hannah Montana Forever, Bambi, two for this(4 and a half minutes total, with intro by Don Hahn)) and a promo for BluRay. I recommend this to essentially everyone, as almost anyone will be entertained, engaged and endeared. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular. Magical, touching, and a little dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Disney's masterpiece in terms of fairy tales. It tells a story where moral takes an important role as it's demonstrated that inner beauty is what matters in humans and not humans.The plot is simple but interesting enough for those who enjoy fairy tales. The story turns dark when we get to explore the castle and the beast because we see some creepy things such as paintings, broken mirrors, and more. The animation is top level. The music is just beautiful. The f/x were great for it's time. The dancing sequence speaks for itself.The ending where townspeople led by Gaston fight against enchanted objects it's pure adrenaline and humor. My absolute favorite moment. This is a masterpiece on every aspect. Please give it a chance. It's a timeless movie for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was Good, but kinda overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Beauty and the Beast when the Diamond edition came out last year, when I was 17 years old. Maybe that's the reason I don't like this movie as much as everyone does, but I doubt it since I also saw Wall-e the same night and absolutely loved that film. Now when I first saw it, I was prepared to give this film a 6/10, but after thinking about it and listening to many peoples reasons why they love it I think it deserves at least a 7.The story is of two opposites that have a bad first impression but eventually fall in love. Simple, but it works. There are a few things that bother me about this film though. For one I feel that when the beast wasn't a jerk, he was really boring and bland, sorta the same thing that happened with Simba in the Lion King. I hate Lumiere alright, he is just a prick. And the songs aren't what they're hyped up to be. Be our guest is the only song that I loved, the rest are good, but I wouldn't sing along, and to be honest I don't see myself singing to Be our Guest either.But there are more good things, the love isn't just love at first sight, the rest of the characters are cool and the animation is stunning. Overall, good film, but not my favorite in the Disney Movie library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting with beautiful Music, and Develpoed with an Emotional Story of Love &amp; Darkness, this Disney Classic stands out Perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Disney classic is truly one of the most darkest but most loving films I have every seen. I don't want to say to much cause we all know that this film is very impressive no matter what level it's on.A young prince is rude to an old lady who's trying to get out of the cold. He rejects her again and she turns into a beautiful princess (Godest) and then she transforms him into a Beast and he must have love in his heart and he must learn to love another. The other person (who is the gorgeous Belle) must love the Beast. The Beast looses all faith and keeps himself in his black, darken castle for many years.Maurice then goes to the fair and gets lost in the woods and then Belle (who is the daughter of Maurice) goes out to look for him and ends up being a prisoner instead of her father. As the film progresses on, the Beast &amp; Belle end up falling in love and we do have a magical ending.i can't on how much I love this film. I think there where two sequels and they both sucked a lot of ass. The 1991 classic has a deep, emotional, loving story, characters are great, the settings are awesome and the music score of coarse is done well with both the themes of passion and darkness.After the Lion King, this would be my second favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angela Lansbury, as Mrs. Potts, sings the titled song in this 1991 enchanted film, which received an Oscar nomination for best picture. This was quite unusual for an animated film but the nomination was well deserved and considering, the eerie "Silence of the Lambs" was the winner.Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. The beast, really an enchanted prince, punished because of his inability to love, meets up with Belle's inventive father, who took a wrong turn. Luckily, his wrong turn sparked a picture right on the mark in all ways.Belle is pursued by the obnoxious, egotistical Gaston, who believes he is the Lord's gift among women. He may be handsome as they come but he exhibits an attitude and personality beyond the realm of human understanding.The late Jerry Orbach was the voice of Lumiere and you'll easily recognize the screeching voice of Wardrobe's Joanne Worley from "Laugh In" Fame.The film is an absolute timeless treasure for all ages. Good conquers evil was never better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film. The animation is beautiful, the emotional power is huge, the writing is great, the characters are memorable, the songs are all classics, and when I say this is one of Disney's best I really do mean that when I think of the best Disney film I think of this a lot. It moves along at a perfect pace. It never moves to fast, and never feels slow. Voice acting all around is really good. Jokes do work really well in the film too. I love "The Hunchback", but I thoughts its main flaw was that the one comedic gargoyle always took away so much drama in the dramatic moments. In this they have comedic moments that don't take anything at all away from the drama. The jokes also are nice. The Beauty and the Beast is a true masterpiece classic.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you either love or you hate. I think movie is very misunderstood by those who hate it. You have to understand that there is always a magical aspect to Dinsey films and very symbolic too. It is that good deeds (Belle's love/ the Beast's ability to learn to love, etc...) result to good things (the Beast becomes a handsome prince/ lived happily ever after). It may not be the way life works, but teach some morals. And this film does that very well! It is very entertaining musically and can bring out a variety of emotions. Yes, the characters are not developed as well as films like Lion King, but it is still very entertaining. The characters are still much more developed than movies we see nowadays. I say this is a must see, adult or child!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whilst covering a couple of genres and delivering an interesting study or two, the film retains a heartfelt and innocent quality that still works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairytale if ever there was one. It's a film about discovery; about adventure; about venturing off and away from home or a comfort zone to explore and discover. This exploration will be littered with danger and threat but it will evoke an element of magic and the unreal for equal measure although the smart move Disney make in Beauty and the Beast is that they do not clearly define who the 'villain' is and nor do they dumb down this role. In fact Disney bring an air of study and greater extent to the material other than shoddy metaphorical content, something that they very rarely did so before this and thus; Beauty and the Beast earns its place amongst the circles when talking about some of their best films.The film could be read as if told to us aurally, that is to say the immediate beginning is being narrated to us and we have rough sketches that look as if they're straight out of the Medieval era presented to us in story book fashion. These still images confirm to us of a Prince's back-story of how he became so hideous in appearance and how his castle and its inhabitants became so equally physically deformed, some of which are transformed into items that resemble their role in the castle whereas some others are not. Here is an interesting study of character 'bodies' within film, a brief reference to centuries ago during which what you wore would immediately tell others of your 'role' in the world ie; Royalty, jesters and peasants would all clearly be labelled by the clothes they wore ? this is significant due to the various items the castle's workers are transformed into and the manner in which the 'style' of the early images are presented to us in that mock, Medieval fashion.So if characters like Mrs. Potts (Lansbury) are transformed into a teapot because she's the maid that makes and brings the tea; the Stove (Cummings) is transformed into his namesake since he is the chef and the flirtatious French maid is transformed into a brush to signify her job as a cleaner then it's possible to read into the fact the two individuals we the audience follow more often than not, those being Cogsworth (Ogden Stiers) and Lumiere (Orbach), are of a certain elevated level since it's difficult to place a candelabra and a clock into a realm of profession within the domestic environment. If there's one thing people have had fun in reading into over the years then it's Disney and their particular animation styling they choose; characters with lean or fat builds can signify one thing; characters with very astute or pointed expressions another whereas a rounded character with a big smile and bright blue eyes could easily be associated with heroic tendencies.The Beast (Benson) himself is not necessarily transformed into something as he is turned inside out. The character of the Prince is an unkind 'beast' on the inside and has these psychological characteristics switched so he must physically resemble a 'beast' or a monster, cruel and consuming none-the-less. But Beauty and the Beast is more so a character study of the mind rather than just how fancy Disney can make and force us to identify with each character's animation. As a character, Belle (O'Hara) plays the protagonist and like most female Disney protagonists, she lacks a motherly figure but does her very best to figure out what's right anyway. As a character with a persona she is smart and outgoing, an independent woman who will not conform to stereotypes but will maintain an attitude that has an element of feminism throughout.Her mission through the film changes a few times, on one occasion actually reverting back to a prior one. Initially she sets out to rescue her father, Maurice (Everhart), after he is kept in the very castle the Beast inhabits following a similar exchange comparable to that of the enchanted woman at the beginning when she also requested shelter from outside forces. Things take a turn for the worst and Belle's new goal having achieved the last one is to stay behind with the Beast after which she must get used to. Belle begins the film within the filmic space that is 'the farm'; a simplistic and rural setting which is located within 'the village', a setting in which all inside is 'good' and everything outside is 'evil' or at least unknown and mysterious. Belle doesn't conform to the caricature she should do within these spaces and this is highlighted with a wonderful early musical number in which the villagers call her 'strange' and 'funny' because she's a free thinker and she reads books.Completing a future love triangle is Gaston (White), a physically powerful and space dominating character who possesses so much love for Belle, it leads to obsession ? you get the feeling in the real world if Belle had developed a relationship with someone else in the village, Gaston may well have challenged them because of it. He dominates his assistant Lefou (Corti) in the same manner Beast dominates his assistants initially within the castle planting a seed in the audience's mind to do with power struggles and what would happen if these two came up against each other. But Beast becomes more human when he seems to treat the assistants with more respect and is presented in compromising situations such as looking daft following a bath, whereas Gaston goes the other way. The film is a great study for certain things and will no doubt remain highly rated in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast are still beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child I didn't quite liked "Beauty and the Beast", because I though it was a too serious and adult cartoon. But I like this movie now as an grown up. From a child's perspective it is a "girl movie", cause I knew many girls instead of boys who liked this film."Beauty and the Beast" is considered like the real Disney classic of all times, who is understandable. Personally I think it's a little bit overrated, but still a beautiful and charming film. No wonder that it got nominated for Best Picture (it's a shame it didn't won).Like I wrote earlier, this movie it's more darker than you usually expect from Disney because of the subject matter of the story and it makes the movie a little more adult, even it's watchable for the kids. But the youngest audience may be frighten.Belle is a wonderful Disney heroine. As a kid, I though the secondary characters were pretty annoying, but now I think they're enjoyable (exept Le Fou, Gaston's sidekick and Maurice, Belle's father).The script is well written. Most of the songs are beautiful and so is the animation. I must admit that I think the climax scene it's a little bit weaker comparing to other Disney climax scenes, so that's why this movie doesn't get a higher vote from me. Besides that, it's a great Disney masterpiece.And for instant: Watch the "Human Again" sequence and make you'r own opinion about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney film since 1991?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reportedly five years in the making, this enchanted, inspired production is perhaps not quite on the level of Disney's first-tier masterpieces (Pinocchio, Dumbo, Snow White and Fantasia), but a strong case could be made for it being the best film the studio has released since its 1991 premiere. From the design of the Beast's awesomely monolithic castle to the heart-stopping, Busby Berkley-inspired dance of china and silver in "Be Our Guest", this is one of the most rigorously constructed animated films I've seen. Bolstered by grand, romantic themes of self-sacrifice and eternal honor in the face of persecution, this is a marvelous experience for any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could ever learn to love a beast? Girls into bestiality...Haven't watched this movie since I was a kid, but just in the first 3 minutes I'm already picking it apart.So it starts with a guy with a nice place doesn't want to let a strange old wandering crone into his home after dark on a stormy night. This is a really weird note to start off with for a kids movie. "Hey kids. Always let strange geriatrics into your home after dark, 'cause who know, it could actually be a hot chick." That aside, the story moves on and we find Belle given full run of the castle with the exception of the west wing and is explicitly told not the enter the west wing. So the first thing she does after emerging from her room is go there and start poking around in Beast's possessions.And of course the movie continues with more idiotic behavior and, ugh, songs, which are of course the bane of most if not all Disney animated films.Sadly, this particular Disney flick is of no value to anyone over the age of 10. Which is a shame considering Lion Kind still holds up today despite being an animated musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, but still something of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really cannot see why so many high-profile critics have such deep veneration for this film; so much that they include it in their "All-Time" lists. Surely they have seen many art films that are more profoundly affecting than this gorgeous, but (in the big scheme of the motion picture universe) somewhat slight animated flick. I am able to identify flaws in this diamond, this relic of my childhood, that I was blinded to by its light, but those will be elaborated upon later. I still love this film nevertheless, now that I am able to appreciate and articulate exactly why. The opening sequence is still hauntingly beautiful, with the tracking shot from idyllic Disney forest to the gloomy castle's stained glass windows as the Alan Menken score smoothly segues in accordance with the changing visuals. The series of stained glass windows that tell of the selfish prince's punishment would make one heck of a picture book on their own, and David Ogden Stiers narrates with class and warmth. In fact, all the music in the film fits well with the visuals, and the songs are still quite catch. "Belle" works in enlivening, Broadway style, the morning gossip of the little town and the respective yearnings of Belle and Gaston,"Gaston" has a suitably chummy beer-hall mentality, and of course "Be Our Guest" and the ballroom-scene rendition of the title song are both grand by their own standards. The characters are not particularly complex (hence the "slight"-ness of the film), but are still pretty well-drawn. Belle sees through the good looks of the chauvinist Gaston but is terrified at the Beast's appearance (of course, the fact that he locked up her father may be a factor in her fear), and is '90s empowered while being a romantic and a loving daughter. Odd-couple Lumiere and Cogsworth make good comic relief, as their rapport is rarely too immature; matronly Mrs. Potts and son Chip are also decently crafted objects (once human, of course). The Beast, menacing and then tender, has the two most touching moments in the film with his (SPOILER) sacrifice of possession of Belle and his merciful sparing of Gaston in the final battle, but his transformation into that unselfish being should have been more developed-here we come to the movie's flaws. (SPOILER END)Gaston is effective as a shallow, egotistical fool and an obsessively persistent suitor, but attempts to make him a villain are rather contrived.(SPOILER)Let's face it, blackmailing Belle with the threat of her father's institutionalization is not really enough justification for Belle to call him call him a monster, and there is no reason why he could not be redeemed just like the equally selfish Beast was instead falling to his death like many Disney villains.(SPOILER END) Also, the themes of the film are not incredibly subtle, and there are those conflicting morals of the Beast's physical transformation. Despite these flaws, I continue to prize the film while expanding my cinematic understanding by watching many others- I'll one day see the original French version of the story-, and I expect its Disney-style romanticism to keep my burgeoning cynical side in check with each future viewing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By chance I happened to see Coctaeau's La Belle et Le Bete about a year ago and now, having seen the animated version I was struck by how closely Disney followed Cocteau (who was himself, of course, following Perrault), especially in the opening sequences, albeit in Cocteau Belle was something of a Cinderella figure with a couple of siblings. But the father getting lost and stumbling on the castle of the Beast and Belle following him and trading places was all there in Cocteau. What wasn't in Cocteau of course was the score and that in itself was a throwback to the pre-1960 Popular Song when melodic melodies and literate lyrics were the norm before what Social Scientists would describe as de-skilling entered the equation and the new generation of songwriters not only could not produce quality songs but didn't WANT to. Thankfully we are now, so to speak, back on song, and better for it with titles like Be Our Guest, Gaston, and Human Again, actually fun to listen to. One of Disney's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale As Old As Time But Never Gets Old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Lion King, Disney is releasing another of their traditionally animated films to the 3D big screen. Three guesses which one. Anyway, I figured this was as good a time as any to give this a review.Beauty and the Beast is a tale of a beautiful woman who meets a horrible beast and changes his attitude for the better. Simple, but Disney takes this tale to new heights. First of all, Belle(the beauty) is a very pretty young woman but is seen as an outcast in her village because she doesn't put out like the other girls and rather prefers to spend her time reading books. The most popular man in the village, Gaston, wants to marry Belle because he considers himself the most beautiful creature to ever enter the Earth and Belle to be as beautiful as him. But Belle can't stand him and keeps refusing his attempts at courtship.The plot really kicks off when Belle's eccentric father, Maurice, travels to a fair to show off his new invention. He get's lost along the way and is chased by a pack of wolves to a mysterious castle. There he finds that the household objects are all enchanted. There's Cogsworth(a clock), Lumiere(a candlestick), Mrs. Potts(A teapot) you get the gist. The master of the castle however, is a beast with a serious attitude problem. He locks Maurice in his dungeon and a few days later Belle finds the castle while looking for him. Belle opts to take Maurice's place as Beast's prisoner.What follows is the typical romance formula of two people who can't stand each other at first but slowly come to care and love for one another. Only this is one of those times where it's done perfectly. First of all they don't start really building a relationship until Belle chews Beast out on his temper and Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves when she tries to leave. You start to see Beast's attitude really change for the better. He starts wearing better clothes, his voice becomes softer even his animation seems a little lighter. Near the end of the film Belle leaves to attend her sick father and Gaston finds out about the Beast and Belle's feelings toward him. He leads an assault on his castle which leads to an entertaining climax with the enchanted objects and a pretty intense fight between Beast and Gaston. This movie is great. The animation is great, the characters are well written, everything is great. And I don't think I have to mention the songs. I'm sure we're all familiar with "Be Our Guest" or "Beauty and the Beast" and they're great every time I hear them. Much like Lion King the only bad thing about the movie comes from an edit in the special edition. "Human Again" was designed for the original release but was cut probably for time purposes. It saw the light of day on Broadway and was added to the ten year anniversary edition in 2002. Well it's not a terrible song but it does interrupt the flow of the film.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of all ages. I'll probably go see it when it hits the big screen and I suggest you do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of The Little Mermaid, and the accompanying renaissance of their animation section, Disney Studios made another trip to the stockpile of classic fairy stories, and plucked Beauty And The Beast from the shelves. Importantly, they matched it up with their secret weapons from Mermaid - Howard Ashman (so much more than a mere lyricist) and Alan Mencken. This is not to dismiss the contributions of its creative team, for this movie was the first ever animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, a nomination which was well deserved.Howard Ashman's fingerprints are all over this film. His awareness of story, his ability to provide exposition, to humanise, and to convey emotion through the medium of song lyrics are strengths brought as strongly to Beauty as to Mermaid: if anything, it is an even more accessible story, with wonderful words (the lyrics of Gaston are extraordinarily funny, yet still provide us with character and plot-relevant information).This film is excellent, but forever tinged with the sadness that Ashman never lived to see it, dying at the appallingly early age of 40, 8 months before its release.The 3D conversion is good, but there are occasional weird moments when neighbouring image elements don't have their comparative depths quite right: this is particularly the case with Beast's face sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's finest films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a film that doesn't really on the overly cuteness that most of the Disney fans are used to. It also tells a classic fairy tale to the T.Belle is a young smart and independent woman who wants to live an adventurous life. A man named Gaston wants the affection of Belle but she isn't interested in him because he seems more interested in himself than the intentions of her. Here Belle is cast as a very strong female unlike most of the other films that portray the female as nothing more than the typical love lorn princess.One day her father goes out of town. While on his way to where he is going he gets lost in the woods and comes across an enchanted castle that is owned by a prince who is cursed with a spell for his selfish ways and takes the form of an ugly beast. The Beast locks Maurice away in his castle. Belle gets worried after her father hasn't come back and she goes looking for him and finds the castle. While she tries to take her father away the Beast finds her and tells her to leave. Belle tells the Beast to let her father go and in return she will live with him in the castle forever. Belle makes some new friends with the castle staff who are also enchanted under the spell and take the form of utensils and appliances. One of the most popular characters being Mrs. Potts.One day Belle travels to the West Wing which the Beast told her not to visit because it is forbidden although she can visit any other room. While going around the West Wing she finds the rose that holds the spell over the castle and tries to check it out but the Beast finds her and tells her to leave and never come back. Belle leaves and she is surrounded in the woods by wolves. The Beast comes to her rescue and gets hurt in the process. Belle takes him back and takes care of his wound. The Beast starts to have feelings for Belle and thinks that she is the one who will break the spell and eventually he lets her leave because she is concerned for her father. I won't spoil the rest.Beauty and the Beast has catchy songs without being over the top. There are plenty of laughs in the film as well. An enjoyable film that captures your heart and interest from start to finish.The only thing I didn't like in the film was how they portrayed the wolves. I get sick of the evil wolf stereotype. Other than that the movie is classic Disney fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so well done, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how good it is. A strong willed, warm hearted girl makes the ultimate sacrifice by taking her father's place as a prisoner in this "Beast's" castle....and that's only the start. The animated characters and the musical numbers are spectacular. When the Beast finally learns how to love someone and get someone to love him is enough to move you to tears, as well as when Mrs. Potts sings the signature song. It is no fluke that this animated movie was nominated for an Academy Award. No matter how old or young you are, you will definitely enjoy this movie. Very much recommended, even with the scenes involving the showdown between the awful Gaston and the Beast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about you, but the beginning of this movie gives me chills every time. It's funny how true classic can never lose its brilliance, and spark. I could watch this movie again and again, and it would still feel magical! The singing makes me smile, the background music is amazing?and the story is classic. If you haven't seen this movie?it just recently came out on DVD and bluray. If you don't have the money to spend?then look out on abc family?they played it the day before Thanksgiving?and they are bound to play it again during the holiday season. Experience the magic of Disney Classics?again and again! To read daily movie reviews visit: kimsmoak.com</fullReview>

Beast must find ''true love'' until 21 years old, otherwise the Beast can't go back originally a figure. Other, in town there is a beautiful women. She is liked by townsman .Her name is Bell. She likes to read and imagination. She is requested marriage by town man. One day, her father is caught by Beast. Her father's name is Mauris. Bell demand a Mauris in exchange for the live Bell in Beast's castle. Then, Bell knows that Beast is gentle man. So, Bell falls in love Beast, but townsman is angry because Bell tray by Beast. Then, townsman try to kill. So, Bell try to help....This is childish movie, but adult also can enjoy. This plot is fiction. It makes you impressed. Perhaps this is chick flick. It maybe prefer to girl. I think that ''true love'' can find. Most of the character seemed strange. Because cup dish and candle are chat,and walk!! It seemed human. This story is heart-warming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Disney's greatest feature-length animation in my humble opinion. Everything works form the first scene to the last. The film contains memorable images, outstanding comedy and a romance for the ages. Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson impressively voice Beauty and the Beast respectively. Richard White voices the odious Gaston. The songs are memorable, with Angela Lansbury winning a much deserved Oscar for the title track. I was in tears the first time I saw the film. Despite multiple viewings, it still leaves an impact on me. Highly recommended as one of the all time great movies.Overall 10/10</fullReview>

With great songs, a magnificent score, stylized backgrounds, and groundbreaking technology, this film pars with some of the Greatest films of all time, including Snow White, Sound of music, and Star wars. this is my very close second favorite Disney film (Behind Lion king), and fourth favorite film of all time(behind Shrek, Lion king, and Star wars).

		<shortDescription>Beauty and the Beast: A Disney cartoon as old as time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought that of all the Disney cartoons, "Beauty and the Beast" took the cake for being one of the greatest Disney cartoons ever released in 1991. You see, I got a copy of this Disney cartoon on DVD as part of the Walt Disney 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD series that showcases some of Disney's greatest animated films as it was said in some DVD booklets that came with the Disney DVDs themselves. You see, "Beauty and the Beast" is the very first Disney cartoon to use computer animation techniques, notably the backgrounds.Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and based on the well known fairy tale, it all begins in a peaceful village, and a young girl named Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) takes a stroll around, and at one point when she reads a book by a fountain, one of the sheep tears off a page and eats it. Later on, Belle's father, Maurice (voiced by Rex Everhart), shows her his latest invention that he will take it to a local fair. When he gets lost in the middle of the woods, Maurice escapes from a pack of wolves and ran into a castle complete with gargoyle statues and everything else.When Maurice says "Hello? Hello? Is someone there?", he gets welcomed by a candelabrum named Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach), a clock named Cogsworth (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), a teapot named Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), and a teacup named Chip (voiced by Bradley Pierce). But just as Maurice was about to settle down for a cup of tea, he gets imprisoned by a hideous Beast (voiced by Hal Smith), who happens to be a handsome Prince (voiced by Robby Benson) under a magical curse, and a spoiled, selfish, and unkind one too. The result: many years ago of a winter's night, an old woman came to the castle's entrance and offers Prince a rose, but Prince refuses and tells her to go away. The old woman then changed herself into a fairy, tells Prince that he had no love in his heart, and turns him into the monster of the same name. It's up to Belle to make Beast learn the true meaning of love just by angering him at a couple points, and such.Meanwhile, back at the village, Belle's macho fianc, Gaston (voiced by Richard White), who is that much of a game hunter, makes several attempts to make Belle his wife, and thinks Maurice is a "crazy old man" when Maurice shouts, "He's got her locked in a dungeon! A Beast! A horrible monstrous Beast!" And that's not all. In just a couple moments later, towards the end of this Disney cartoon, Gaston wants to kill Beast, and have his head mounted on his wall...The supporting characters in there also include Philippe the Horse (also voiced by Hal Smith), Gaston's goofy looking sidekick, Lefou (voiced by Jesse Corti), a Wardrobe (voiced by Jo Anne Worley), and Monsieur D'Arque (voiced by Tony Jay). In "Beauty and the Beast", the characters can be distinguishing just by judging by their personalities as well as their habits. For instance, Beast is a powerful character much like Stromboli from another Disney cartoon, "Pinocchio", and Monsieur D'Arque is much like Coachman from "Pinocchio" as well.The songs wrote by composer Alan Menken are very catchy, including "Be Our Guest", "Gaston", "The Mob Song", "Human Again", and the most memorable, "Beauty and the Beast". Everybody loves this Disney cartoon's humorous moments (Wardrobe landing on a villager for example, and a couple others to name a few), as well as touching scenes (at one point, for instance, before turning back into Prince's old self, Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls off) for many years to come just like the other Disney cartoons did.By the way. In the Disney cartoon/video game "Kingdom Hearts" series, Belle, Beast (now voiced by Robby Benson since "Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and "Belle's Magical World", even with a little help of some equipment and devices that they used in the 1996 film "Ransom" which starred Mel Gibson), Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Wardrobe, and Prince (appearing at the "Kingdom Hearts II" end credits) cope with Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy as Sora, Donald, and Goofy battle the Heartless, Nobodies, and the Orginization 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An admirable 84 minutes of animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only five years old when this hit animated Disney flick came into theatres, and don't recall ever going to see any movies on the big screen when I was that young, so I obviously didn't see this one. A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's "Aladdin", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times. Like many other Disney films, I'm still impressed with this one after rediscovering it.An enchantress casts a spell on a selfish prince, turning him into an ugly beast! She leaves him a rose, which will bloom until he turns 21. In order to break this spell, he must learn to love and be loved in return before the rose's last petal falls. If he fails to do so, the spell will be permanent. In a nearby village lives an inventor named Maurice, and his daughter, Belle, a bookworm who is not happy living in this village. One night, Maurice gets lost in the woods, and searches for a place to stay for the night. He comes across a castle, and doesn't know this is the Beast's castle! When the Beast sees him, he locks him up! Belle looks for her missing father, and finds him there. She begs the Beast to set him free and take her instead, and he accepts this offer, so Belle is now his prisoner. His 21st birthday is drawing near, and with Belle in his life, he finally has the chance try and break the spell before it's too late, but will he succeed?! While I don't like this Disney version of "Beauty and the Beast" as much as many others do, I can see why it's so popular. It may not have as much excitement as certain other Disney animated features, but it does have some (mainly towards the end, in my opinion). The movie also contains lot of humour, mainly thanks to Gaston (the rude, nasty man who wants to marry Belle) and Lefou (Gaston's silly assistant), as well as Lumiere and Cogsworth (two of the Beast's servants, one a candle and the other a clock due to the spell, who often get into fights with each other). Of course, the animation in the film is also something that deserves praise. So, while not the greatest film in Disney history, it's still one not to be forgotten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1 of the first Disney movies where people don't fall in love because of looks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love that UNLIKE movies like "Snow White" and "Sleeping Beauty," the main characters in this movie don't fall in love by first glance. They get to know each other and fall in love gradually. Not like in "Snow White" where Snow White and Prince Charming fall in love because they both think that the other is hot. That sort of thing doesn't happen in real life, if someone in real life loved someone else without even knowing their name. I'de feel really, really, really bad for that couple. And the movie has great music and songs, most of the characters are lovable. And it's just a great movie. It's definitely a Disney classic that you have to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty &amp; the Beast is still one of my favourite Disney films. It has a feisty, book loving heroine, a gorgeous beast, entertaining support &amp; a vile villain. Plus enchanting songs &amp; colourful, detailed animation. My favourite character is Chip, the little teacup, who has a vital role to play. Alas, the gorgeous beast is eventually replaced, but that's for sake of the fairy tale. What we didn't need was a new musical number. It's just an unnecessary filler in that spoils the pace of the film. Be sure to watch to the end of the credits. There's a wonderful dedication to Howard Ashman. The voicework is fantastic &amp; best of all, the film is in classic 2d. It's a shame we see less &amp; less of that style nowadays. With notable exceptions like Ice Age, 3d animation lacks the uniqueness &amp; charm of traditional films. CGI doesn't have to flaunt itself. It's the story &amp; characters that truly matter. 8/10</fullReview>

The horse escape and Maurice runs into a castle. When he goes in, he find himself trapped again. In the castle lives a big beast an he's NOT happy with the new visitor, and puts Maurice in prison. Meanwhile the horse ran home and Belle (Maurice's daughter) make the horse led her to her father. Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best movies, with humor and true love that will teach you not only to love the outside, but the person in other people. Are you more the the fun parts, you still won't be disappointed. Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip. And lets not forget the evil in this movie, and his name is Gaston. Not scary, but VARY selfish and he won't give up for the things he want (okay maybe that's scary). So lets all sing along with the movie, and see it (again).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Mermaid' meets Gandalf with 'Revenge of the Nerds'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is maybe the most well-regarded of Disney's Phase III projects as I've classified them. It's typical formula fair, so here's my reinterpretation of the events:This is your only spoiler warning...The townsfolk represent technology and knowledge. The Beast is myth and superstition. Having subdued the machines in his domain and made them his servants, the Beast turns on the villagers. After being mentally conquered by the Beast, the townsfolk reject their knowledge and fall victim to the Beast's superstition control. Thus they go off to kill their master, but fall victim to the same technology they once controlled. Ironic? By comparison, Bakshi was too obvious in his work.Some interesting points:There's a John Hughes undercurrent here. The Jock is the villain. The Beast is the Recluse. The Nerd is the comic relief. Belle is turning 16 years old.Of all the post-'Mermaid' work, this is probably the most colorful. So, despite the age-old philosophy behind the character designs, there's some imagination in the art department. The inventor is obviously a spinoff from 'Pinocchio.' Also, the design of the Beast's castle is pretty impressive.Once again, Menken is the real driving force. My question is "why didn't he do 'Lion King' and why hasn't he done anything since 'Hercules'?" As you can guess, the Oscars love him and his ilk.So you can praddle on about the "magic" behind this product, but in the end it's still typical. Nonetheless, Disney films can still be interesting when placed in the context of their creation. Here society is the Beast, having long abandoned it's fascination with Disney magic. So Disney manifests itself as Belle, a musical intellect that seduces us. We accept it, the curse is lifted and Disney makes a ton of money marketing its "new aesthetics".This lasted until 'Pocahantas', where the New World was actually Pixar. That leads to Phase IV. Sadly, Scott better understood the tone that Cocteau was trying to make with 'Legend'.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale as Old as Time, Song as Old as Rhyme: Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]There once lived a greedy young prince who was spoiled and unkind. One night a homely old beggar woman requested shelter and in return offered him a rose. The prince refused because of the woman's appearence so she turned into a beautiful woman then and because she had seen there was no kindness in the prince, she transformed him into a hideous beast and his servants into furniture. The rose was placed in his room and a spell was cast: if by the prince's 21st birthday, he would learn to love another and she would return his love, he would become human again. If not, he would remain a beast forever. Now this proved difficult, because who would ever learn to love a beast? In town, a girl named Belle, strolled to the bookkeeper's. Belle was a heavy reader and didn't quite fit in among this rougish town. One resident, Gaston, a bawny, conceited, muscleman tried to move in on Belle and she shunned him. When Belle got home, she helped her father, Maurice, perfect his latest invention: a steam powered wood chopper. It worked so Maurice hitched up Philippe, his horse, and started for the fair. En route, he got lost and wandered into a deep dark wood. Wolves approached, Philippe ran off, leaving Maurice alone. He sought shelter at a dark, unfriendly castle, which was the Beast's castle. Once inside, he met Lumiere the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the tea kettle and her son Chip the cup. He got that name from a chip on his rim. Suddenly Maurice met the beast who locked him in his dungeon.Gaston tried to make another move on Belle and she refused him again. She then found Philippe and learned her father was in trouble so she raced to the Beast's castle and offered a trade so Beast let Maurice go and made Belle his prisoner but perhaps she could be the one to break the spell so Lumiere coaxed Beast to be nice to her. Beast tried and ordered her to dinner; at the local pub, Gaston was furious for being shunned by Belle. Suddenly in came Maurice, telling everyone about the Beast. They thought he was nuts and threw him out. That gave Gaston an awful, evil idea; at the castle, Beast told Belle she could go to any room in the castle except the west wing which was forbidden; Belle refused to dine with the Beast, but Lumiere invited Belle to be their guest and dine with them instead, then he and Cogsworth take Belle on a tour of the castle and she wanders into the west wing. She finds a portrait of Beast in human form as well as the enchanted rose. Beast was furious when he saw her in there so she ran from the castle and ran into a pack of wolves. Beast came to her rescue but got badly hurt so Belle nursed him back to health. The two begin to get close. Beast even shows her his humongous library. Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts feel there's something there that wasn't there before, but Chip didn't understand that. Belle and Beast even dance together as Mrs. Potts sings. Belle looks into Beast's magic mirror and sees Maurice is sick so Beast releases her as his prisoner and she races home.Unfortunately, Gaston, his clumsy friend Lefou and the man from the insane asylum were waiting. Gaston planned to have Maurice thrown in the loony bin unless Belle agrees to marry them. She tells everyone that Maurice's beast story was true and showed everybody what he looked like. Gaston told everybody that the Beast was evil and said he should be killed so they all grabbed weapons and head to the castle. Gaston locks Belle and Maurice in the cellar. Luckily Chip had followed Belle and rescued them with Maurice's steam powered wood chopper. Lumiere, Cogsworth and the rest of the furniture battle the townspeople while Gaston gets into battle with Beast in which Gaston seemed to be winning, but Beast fought hard when he saw Belle. Gaston plunged a knife into Beast's back before falling to his death. Belle knealt beside Beast and told him she loved him. Right then, the last petal on the rose fell and suddenly Beast turned back into a human. Lumiere, Cosworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip and the rest became humans again too and they all lived happily ever after.Good Disney film. Not to mention one of the more popular ones. It had a sequel in 1997, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas and another sequel not too long after that. Belle's Magical something. Was recently released in iMax theaters so people could really get the BIG picture. Voices: Robby Benson is the Beast, Angela Lansbury is Mrs. Potts, Bradley Pierce is Chip, David Ogden Stiers is Cogsworth, Jerry Orbach is Lumiere and Page O'Hara is Belle. Anyway, if you enjoy Disney versions of fairy tales, then you should definitely check out Beauty and the Beast! Please, be our guest!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revelation on IMAX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people have complained about the IMAX presentation of this film that I felt the need to set the record straight. I took my kids to see Beauty and the Beast at the nearest IMAX, a 2-hour drive away, and left feeling like I would never look at this film the same way again. This is a good thing, because I never had the opportunity to see the film on the big screen during its initial release. I will concede that IMAX does show up some of the flaws in the film's animation, but it also does something more important: it shows us just how much hard work goes into making an animated film, as well as how difficult it is to animate those tiny characters present in the background.The main reason I enjoyed this presentation however, was the sound. Disney went whole hog and spiffed this puppy up with a full-fledged 5.1 presentation, which serves to amplify the emotions evoked by the film. I'm not ashamed to admit that this film still makes me weep, and that emotion was not diminished in any way by the IMAX presentation. Disney has made a gallant effort with this new presentation, and I look anxiously forward to getting this one on DVD as well as seeing the IMAX presentation of "The Lion King" next year, since it will look even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast, IMAXDid you enjoy this Disney Cartoon the first time around? Or didn't you? Either way, there's no good excuse to see it again in this larger format unless you're looking for any excuse to go to an Imax theatre.Personally, I liked the original effort and this translation to IMAX brings out the worst in B&amp;B. Since the move towards economizing in filming techniques, the paucity of distinct frames and the stock-still extras are really highlighted when enlarging it.And what about the added scenes? There clearly was a reason to leave this one on the cutting room floor so save yourself the effort. Reasons to see Beauty and the Beast at the IMAX: 1. You have children or grand children who missed it the first time around and love IMAX. 2. You think bigger is better. 3. You have a good friend that just has to see this one again.WARNING: If #3 is the case, watch the DVD version on a large screen with surround on a cold winter night.

		<shortDescription>Not as enchanting on Imax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going on, let me say that this is one of my all time favorite films. In its original release was is truly magical and richly deserved the awards given to it and I treasure my VCR tape. BUT IT LOSES MOST OF THE MAGIC IN IMAX.On the huge Imax screen there are so many things that were not evident in the smaller version, characters not fully drawn or animated are totally distracting. It is simply too overwhelming and the intimacy and magic are now missing.The only sequences that are truly effective in the Imax format are the opening sequence panning through the forest going to the castle and the two big musical numbers, "Be Our Guest" and the new "Human Again". The last mentioned song is terrific and was a highlight of the live stage version. Now it is in the film and illustrates that it should have been there from the beginning. The scenes with the wolves in which their mouths are so big a viewer feels as if being eaten, are simply too intense for younger audience members.The only good thing about the Imax release is the hope that this version with the new musical number will be released to regular theaters on the size screen it was created for when the giant screen runs are over and that a DVD will soon be available. Imax is simply the wrong format for a film like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great voices and music tie together this masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an astonishingly detailed masterpiece. I am reminded in the attention to countless small details of the way Lucas Star Wars team would obsess over seemly insignificant matters such as the "plop" of the snow falling back from an impact crater on the ice planet. Such loving attention to the texture lends depth to the films. So it is with Beauty in scenes such as her dazzling watz though the town at the openning of the film.Really good films are almost always marked by the quality of the voices of the leading players. This is the case with the Harry Potter and Ring movies, and is also the case here. Robbie Benson's digitally altered voice of the Beast is perfect, but then so is Langsbury's Mrs. Potts and even David Ogden Stiers' Cogsworth. Stiers (Charles Winchester from M.A.S.H) also Narrates the films evidently with some of the same digital enhancements as Benson's voice received. He does an absolutely masterful bit of work with the small but crucial narrator role. It is stunningly well crafted job that is further brought to life by the IMAX sound system.Finally - the music is nearly perfect. People comment on the individual songs, however, what has always most impressed me is that the entire movie plays like a single musical piece. The music is almost always there to support the drama and emotion from frame to frame, and yet it never remotely takes on the character of filler music. The transitions are seemless and the music brilliantly supports the drama at every point. An absolutely incredible job.Truly, this is the greatest animated work ever made, and the best film Disney has ever produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was reading some of the messages of the database for this movie (What of course is the best animated ever, no question about it), when I found a person who complains because our heroine falls in love with a brutal man, when what she really wanted was had an exciting life. Weeeeeeeell, my dear, you should remenmber that it is only a fairy tale, where anything can happen, so don`t be so hard. Remenber that poor "boy" had been ten long years (uh!) living a little alone and feeling sorry for himself, and, therefore, he had became a little antisocial... A little of happiness can made miracles... And now, I must say that this is probably one of the films which had fastinated me more... Instead I`m the biggest fan of filmnoir, and brutal and realistic stories, just like M, White Heat, Treasure of the sierra madre, the killing, Apocalipse now, Touch of evil...Something to do with B&amp;B. Well, it has made me feel like a child, who thinks miracle are posible everyday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch this film all the time when I was little, but after that, I kind of grew out of Disney, claiming it to be nothing but kiddie garbage. Later on, I watched it again as a mature teenager, and I found I was mistaken. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a gem in the sometimes-tarnished crown of Disney films. Although it departs quite a bit from the original faery tale, the voice acting, animation, and all-around feel sill brings back memories of my early childhood, when everything seemed magical. The best and most brilliant preformance is definetly that of the Beast. The songs, especially the title theme and Belle's main song, are unforgettable and some very catchy. The only thing I didn't like is Gaston, who seems a wee bit too flat a character (and he's a jerk, too). Anyone who loves animation, Disney, or just wants to watch a good movie should take a look at this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me a Disney shill, but I have never been able to resist watching a Disney movie, no matter how intrusive the songs, how inappropriate the comic relief, how formulaic the plot. This, however, has got to be my favorite of all of them. Every time I see it, it still creates some sort of magic with me. The story is a good retelling of the original fairy tale, which would have made for a very boring movie. The voices are perfect for their characters, and there is no overtly brash comic relief. The music flows nicely with the story, and I can (and will) still sing many of the songs on demand (or not). If you are one of the very, very few who have not yet seen it, I am telling you to go out and see it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the movies I have ever seen in my life, none of them have affected me and moved me in a more positive way than Beauty and the Beast.The animation is beautiful, the music is stunning, and the story, which is really why this movie is so good, touches within each of us, an emotion that we can all relate to. Each of us in our own way wants to be loved and accepted, and the way that Belle and the Beast found each other, and how their relationship progressed is something that each of wish would happen to us at some level or another.I tried hard to find something wrong with this movie. I can't. It is one of the few movies I have seen that is flawless. I have always been a huge fan of animation because I believe it allows us to explore realms in our imagination that a live action film simply can't deliver because of its limitations. Animation has no limitations. The castle of the Beast could have never been as intimidating had it been a live action film. This is truly one of the finest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Beauty and the Beast' is without a doubt the greatest animated film ever made, and the standard by which I judge all others. Recent Disney fare has been something of a disappointment, with films excelling in one area only to be weak in another. So if you're looking for a great animated movie that both parents and kids can enjoy, watch this. If you've seen it already, watch it again.There's nothing much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said by the critics. Visually stunning and with a fantastic score, it deserved the 'Best Picture' Oscar for which it was nominated. The high point? That unbelievable ballroom scene, where the beautiful title song and some clever computer animation combine to make me cry every time I see it.Altogether a great movie for romantics everywhere.</fullReview>

Beautiful Girls will end up with a jerk.Based upon the old tale, The beast is a prince who refused shelter to an old hag, because of his selfishness. the hag turned out to be a really, really beautiful enchantress, who turned the prince into a horrid, disgusting, mean beast. the only way he can go back to his old self is if he can find a girl to love him before his 21st birthday (except to make it easier for the kiddies to understand, before the last petal of a magic rose wilts and falls off.) just who is that girl? How about the prettiest girl in all of the village, Belle? Thank you, Disney for this great adaption from the ancient Fairy tale.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had recently re-watched this excellent film and I find it even more remarkable now than when I had seen it years ago. Everything about the film from the voice acting to the character design, to the production design and animation and so on is all unsurpassed. But the music, that wonderful music - the songs and the orchestral pieces - is absolutely pure genius. The work done by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman is so effective that when Belle and the Beast started dancing with Angela Lansbury singing 'Beauty and the Beast', yours truly, a 29 year old man who probably has a lot in common with Gaston ('cept I cook my eggs), started to choke back the emotion without great success. And I never cry at movies*. But this is not a movie or a cartoon or a Disney merchandising gimmick. Beauty and the Beast is true art. It is an emotionally compelling, spiritually uplifting, and thoroughly joyous exploration of the human condition. I think it is one of greatest motion pictures ever made.*The end of Millennium Actress by Satoshi Kon, another animated film incidentally, was the only movie that ever had me literally bawling like a little girl. I highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Beauty and the Beast" may not be the best animated film ever made, but its 1991 Best Picture Oscar nomination puts it in a very select class of films. A class that does not include other great animated classics like "Snow White", "Fantasia", "Pinocchio", "Cinderella", and "The Lion King". There is something about this film that makes it stand out from other animated classics. The storyline is superb, the music and songs are perfect, and the direction (yes, the film's direction) is focused and unrelenting. All in all, "Beauty and the Beast" is a film that was worthy of its Best Picture nomination back in 1991. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, but also quite overrated **spoilers?**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days ago, I sat down and watched this film for the first time in about a year. And I maintain my previous opinion about this film - very good (and certainly better than most movies), but the greatest Disney film ever? Okay, most of the animation is gorgeous (but it was in "Pocahontas" too, and that film sucked), the voice acting is great (esp. since they can sing their own songs, unlike SOME people), and the (instrumental) music is certainly better than most of the stuff out there. But again, I ask - HOW is this the greatest flick ever? It's probably just me, but I don't really like these somewhat cheesy Broadway-esque tunes. Well, the songs themselves are good, but rather the way they are presented - for example, the opening song with Belle - personally I didn't really get why the WHOLE TOWN was singing about Belle. I know it's called "suspension of disbelief", but I still wasn't that fond of that scene. "Like Gaston" wasn't that great of a tune, and the scene of course wasn't great (esp. since Gaston fired a 17th Century musket THREE TIMES in secession without reloading - despite Sgt. Kilrain's comments about men ramming ammunition down the barrel of a gun without stopping [see "Gettysburg"], I seriously doubt this could happen). "Be Our Guest" was, IMO, a boring and extremely overrated song that I did not like at all. Humor is another department in which this fails. Humor here is lowest common denominator stuff (the final battle scene between the servants-cum-appliances/whatever and Gaston's mob being a worst defender - such as when the one guy is eaten by a closet and comes out dressed in a bikini with Marge Simpson hair), and I just did not like it all. I also found the pacing a bit fast - since this is an animated film, I should probably cut it some slack here (esp. since I didn't mind it in "The Lion King"), but there wasn't really that much time for Belle and Beast to develop a real romance. I already mentioned the films' positives, so let me reitterate - good, but hardly the greatest Disney film ever. Seven stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too much comedy and stupidity, too little enigma and darkness is what strongly lets me down about this love story. However, I DO NOT hate it!THE GOOD POINTS OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST": 1. The Stunning Animation 2. The use of CGI for the ballroom and the title song that combines with this amazing scene 3. Belle's appealing character 4. The Songs 5. The Enchanted Rose glowing, spitting out sparks of magic 6. That emotional scene when the beast is severely injured and Belle holds him in her arms and dies. She tells him she loves him when it's almost too late after he dies (the last petal of the rose is about to fall). It's sad but, you know what? It cuts down on all that unwanted comedyTHE BAD POINTS OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST": 1. The opening scene in Belle's village - the townspeople are incredibly idiotic! 2. Belle's father Maurice seems more of a wacky, fiery person rather than a warm, comforting old man who makes such awful inventions 3. Gaston has got to be the most annoying and thick-in-the-head Disney villain ever (at least, until the last 15-20 minutes of the film when he turns nasty and mentally jealous) 4. LeFou drives me MAD! 5. The pub sequence when a party is held for Gaston - IT'S JUST PLAIN PATHETIC!!!Well, well, well! I think that kinda proves I love it more than hate it! And why should I hate it? It lacks the brainless stupidity of "Hercules" (not a good film AT ALL) and I'm surprised that according to Channel 4's "100 Greatest Family Films" "The Lion King" was more popular than this! This is MUCH better! And furthermore the "Lion King" is just plain depressing and, again, stupid. I still know that this film has already become a treasured classic after just 15 years - it's younger than ME! It's popularity is not surprising, if you ask me! The ballroom scenes with the sweeping camera-motions combining with breathtaking CGI and rich cartoons! Before I go, I will say that, while 6 good points outshines 5 bad points and while there are scenes that'll amaze you, there is no cherry on top of the cake (if you see what I mean) because, like I say, I am not too pleased with the amounts of times sheer dumb comedy comes into this movie - so I won't give "Beauty and the Beast" the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this movie after probably ten years of not having seen any of it. I had thought maybe I was over it, that its appeal had diminished with time. I was wrong.This movie is so well done, it defines "timeless." I don't necessarily love every moment--I can do without the drippy title song--but it is done at such a high standard, I can't really fault it. I asked myself if I had even one thing to criticize. Even though some of the songs aren't my taste, I can't complain.I think the main thing that always draws me back in are the three main characters. I like how the Beast is allowed to be angry, screaming at people--I like seeing that abandon in a Disney movie. Belle somehow wins me over every time. I had gotten to used to seeing her face on endless mountains of merchandise that I forgot how fresh and different she is when you see her in action. And Gaston, I think, has the best lines of any Disney villain. He was the character that made me decide, for a number of years, that this was my favorite Disney movie.Like the best animated films, there are moments that just make you enjoy watching the visuals. Little things like the way Belle kicks over a bucket of corn to feed her chickens.I don't really have any more to say, except this is pretty much perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this yesterday as an early Christmas present and I decided to watch it last night as it was a long time ago since I last seen it. Here is my say on this movie.Well what can I say about this film.Well here is two words to describe it absolutely brilliant. The beginning of the movie is the song "Belle" which focuses on Belle who is a daydreaming,oddball maid who lives in 17th century France. She goes on about handsome princes in disguise and wanting a provincial life. A man named Gaston wants to marry her but she doesn't want to be with him as she describes him as being conceited and very rude. Before this song we see how the prince became a beast as he didn't like the enchantress's ugly form(as she disguised herself as an old beggar woman)but when he turned his back on her over her ugliness she transformed him into a ferlious beast and those who were in the castle were transformed into enchanted objects.Back to Belle her father is an inventor and he goes off to the fair leaving Belle to be by herself as she is an only child. As her father goes to the fair,he gets lost and enters a spooky castle where the Beast lives along with his servants Cogsworth &amp; Lumiere.The Beast of course doesn't like the idea that Maurice(Belle's father) entered his castle and so he locks him up in the dungeon. Belle meanwhile is still being pushed around by Gaston(who is the villain in this film) and he keeps asking her to marry him and they'll have little boys like himself.As Belle gets worried about her father as he never returned she goes to the castle with her horse Philippe(who came back for her) and as she enters the castle she goes to the dungeon and sees her father.Of course the beast is there and she decides to take her father's place. Scared that she will never see her father again she finds herself becoming more close with the Beast who starts off as a stubborn,bad-tempered monster and later in the movie we see a whole new side to him. But what Belle doesn't know is that he is a handsome prince in monstrous form and in order for him to become human again,Belle must love him and as the rose's(which the enchantress gave him in the beginning of the film)last petal falls then the spell will be broken if he doesn't learn how to love someone then it won't wear off.Enough said about that as I might give away too much information but here is what I liked about this film;1)Accepting a person for who they are on the outside and not on the inside.2)The ballroom scene in this was brilliant 3)The chemistry between Belle &amp; the Beast was beautiful I could have cried for days as I see how their romance blossoms.4)The music is brilliant from the opening song Belle to Be our guest,to Gaston to Beauty &amp; the Beast I adored the score to this film.5) The villain was brilliant as he was cocky and vain as well as self centered.Beauty &amp; the Beast is my 5th all time favourite film as its so romantic,entertaining if not dark in some places but having said that it is a very good film. I like Belle as she isn't irritating like most Disney princesses(aka Ariel&amp;Snow White)and she is my 3rd favourite princess.If you never saw this film then I highly recommend it as it the best Disney movie I have seen since Enchanted which poked fun of this film in a nice way back in 2007.Verdict: A brilliant movie with a brilliant message to everyone who thinks that they aren't beautiful even though they are.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty and the Beast is a breath of fresh air. In a time where "popular" movies are defined by how much blood, sex, and violence they can contain, this movie has next to none of those things. What it does have is a compelling plot, wonderful voice acting, and animation that conveys each scene with authority. You may say that all "Disney" movies contain such things, but this one stands above the rest. It draws you in with the wonderful narration at the beginning and keeps your attention with the colliding egos and emotional conflicts that occur throughout the story. It's a movie about fantasy, greed, redemption, and love. There is a reason it is the only animated movie ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, watch it and find out why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that officially signaled Disney's animation renaissance (following The Little Mermaid) and the only animated feature to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, Beauty and the Beast remains the yardstick by which all other animated films should be measured. It relates the story of Belle, a bookworm with a dotty inventor for a father; when he inadvertently offends the Beast (a prince whose heart is too hard to love anyone besides himself), Belle boldly takes her father's place, imprisoned in the Beast's gloomy mansion. Naturally, Belle teaches the Beast to love. What makes this such a dazzler, besides the amazingly accomplished animation and the winning coterie of supporting characters (the Beast's mansion is overrun by quipping, dancing household items) is the array of beautiful and hilarious songs by composer Alan Menken and the late, lamented lyricist Howard Ashman. (The title song won the 1991 Best Song Oscar, and Menken's score scored a trophy as well.) The downright funniest song is "Gaston," a lout's paean to himself (including the immortal line, "I use antlers in all of my De-co-Ra-ting"). "Be Our Guest" is transformed into an inspired Busby Berkeley homage. Since Ashman's passing, animated musicals haven't quite reached the same exhilarating level of wit, sophistication, and pure joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Most Beautiful Love Story Ever Told"Beauty and the Beast is undoubtedly my favorite animated film of all time, and one of my favorite films of all time. I grew up with this movie along with the other classics, and I love it now just the same. The story is about a prince (Robby Benson) who is cursed, one a cold night, to become a beast by a beautiful enchantress. The prince was visited by her disguised as an ugly old woman who asks for shelter for the night. All she had to offer in return was a single red rose. With a cold heart he turned the old lady away, ounce and again after she warned him to not be fooled by appearances. The enchantress saw no love in his arrogant heart, and cast a powerful spell on the castle, cursing all who live within it. The rose was to become the core of the curse, for before the last peddle falls, the prince must learn to love and be loved in return. "But who could ever learn to love a beast?" Belle (Paige O'Hara) is a beautiful and misunderstood girl who is always distracted by the chanting wonders of a good fairy tale book. She has no one to relate to; even the arrogant and good-looking hunk named Gaston (Richard White) isn't her type. Belle dreams of living more than a provincial life, like a fairy tale. Her father Maurice (Rex Everhart) is an inventor who heads off to an inventing fair, but gets lost in the woods and ends up prisoner in the Beast's castle. As her father is imprisoned and sick to the bone, Belle makes a deal with the Beast to take his place instead. She is now a forever prisoner in the cursed castle, unknowing that she is the key to ending the Beast's torment. Through months of time both Belle and the Beast have learned their misunderstandings for each other. They gain a special friendship that is hoped to become love. "Crazy old Maurice" pleads to the town for the rescue of his daughter from the horrible ten- foot tall monster. Gaston plots to get Belle's interest by bargaining her father's freedom for marriage. The Beast has learned to love and gives Belle away to rescue her father. And the ending begins....Whatever did happen to the classic wonders of Disney? I don't know, and it all seemed to go downhill when Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney for DreamWorks with Spielberg. I think the best Disney films are the ones that Disney didn't make. I think Jungle Book was his last film, and that was the end of what I call the old generation Disney movies. Then you have your middle generation of movies that consisted of the less successful films such as The Black Cauldron and Oliver and Company. It wasn't until The Little Mermaid that the new generation took hold. If I'm not mistaken The Lion King was Katzenberg's last Disney film. Now we have the more recent and sometimes sucky films. Which consist of Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan and so on. This is too bad, because theses other films only come close to being as good as Beauty and the Beast.This masterpiece has more heart and emotion than another animated film. It is still astounding to me that this is the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. I think it's good and bad that they brought the category of best-animated picture. Animation will never have a chance to become the best picture of the year. On the other hand what are the chances of that happening really? Beauty and the Beast is the best not because it was nominated for best picture, or because it was listed third in Roger Ebert's top ten list, but because it is the best. Simple, yes?****/**** Stars Two Thumbs Way UpBeauty and the Beast (1991): Rated PG for some mild frightening and violent images</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good fun movie not oscar quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good points.The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it didn't deserved it.let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have " A TALE AS OLD AS TIME"captivatLY and beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear; and Alan Menken's score is his finest work with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman the songs themselves are good,but rather the way they are presented - for example, the opening song with Belle - personally I didn't really get why the WHOLE TOWN was singing about Belle. I know it's called "suspension of disbelief", but I still wasn't that fond of that scene."Like Gaston" was the best tune, and the scene of course was great followed by "kill the beast" for it's fun lyrics. Humor here is fun (the final battle scene between the servants-cum-appliances/whatever and Gaston's mob - such as when the one guy is eaten by a closet and comes out dressed in a bikini with Marge Simpson hair). Also the way that Lamier and Cogsworth are towards each other is quite funny at times.Gaston, one of my all time favorite Disney villains. Gaston is so complex. One minute, he's just an arrogant, stuck-up bum that is reminisicent of someone we all know and find irritating. Yet, he manages to add a little humor in his attempts to woo Belle. Then, he turns into a real jerk, willing to lock Maurice up to get Belle. And finally, he becomes pure evil, ready to kill the Beast to win Belle. That mocking laugh and look he gives the Beast when he says, "What's the matter? Too kind and gentle to fight back?" is one of the greatest scenes in Disney villainry history. A rare few scenes rank up with the amount of evil emotion that this scene has, such as Scar giving Mufasa an incredibly horrifying look before murdering him, or Jafar laughing like an insane lunatic after banishing Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to the Ends of the Earth. Great moments that illustrate just how dark a villain can be. Now the not soo good points or FLAWS THAT ARE TOLABLE Plot holes: When the enchantress shows up disguised as an old beggar woman, the prince answers the door. Why is he doing this, when he has servants to answer the door for him? Also here he looks like an older teenager when according to the story he was 11 years old when this happened.How can Bell's father build such a complicated machine (wood cutter) if doesn't know what tools to use on it. Why does it seem the horse is smarter than Bell's father when they get lost in the woods. The horse wants to go down the less scary path but Bell's father chooses the scarier path (go figure). I like the homage to "sound of Music" when Bell runs up the green hill singing after she rejectes Gaston's proposal' That horse of Bell's must be part hound dog to know where Bell's father ended up in the castle. (remember the horse took off before Bell's father made it to the castle). Lumier (the candlestick) must be extra magical by the way he can ignite himself anytime he wants.The musical number "Be our Guest" is way to "disney" in that it's style and presentation has been done in too many other movies. Although the song "Human Again' musical sequence was excellently done and a most welcome addition for the movie's special edition release it was done to Disney" for my liking also.VERY BIG FLAWS THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BEING A 10/10 MOVIEBell must be "super woman" by the way lifts up the Beast onto the horse to take him back to the castle, even though he must weigh about 300 pounds (after wolf pack battle). And again later when she holds the beast so he doesn't fall off the roof at the end of his battle with Gastou.How did chip figure out how to work the "wood cutter" and start the fire and control the direction it went when it was parked on top of the hill. (huh?)THEORY: when Bell goes into the west wing and into the Beast's private room, she does notice his human picture (she pulls up the torn sections) So she knows that the Beast is really human. So that is why she falls in love with him. She knows from all the fiction books she read that there must be a way to turn him back into a man. That is why she acts the way she does toward him. Why isn't Bell or her father or the towns people spooked by all the "living" items they encounters in the castle.Continuity: The seasons change several times throughout the movie. When Maurice is thrown out of the pub, he lands in a pile of snow. When others leave, the pile is not there. Gaston and others are wearing short-sleeved shirts in the snow. When Belle and the beast go outside (in the winter) after dancing, they are in shirt sleeves and crickets are heard. Also in the final act Bell arrives home (it's still winter) Then later that night apparently, during the climatic scene between The Beast and Gastou (it's starts raining). Continuity: At the beggining, the Beast scratches his own painting from top-left to bottom-right, later Belle discovers the paint and it's scratched from top-right to bottom-left.Continuity: After the Gaston song, the bear rug moves from behind the chair to under the chair.FINAL VERDICTI see "Beauty and the Beast" as one of those movies that you watch over and over again if you are in the right frame of mind like "leaving your brain at the door" and ignoring all the continuity problems and pot holes that show up. then you can relive the magic and atmosphere of the film and be taken in by the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist Pandering Turns Timelessly Wise Fairy Tale On Its Head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traditional versions of this story feature a good and handsome prince who has been cursed by a wicked fairy. The Disney version's basic premise is entirely different: the prince had been selfish and was consequently punished -justifiably- by a good fairy. He is described in a voice-over as "spoiled, selfish, and unkind." The Beast has until his twenty-first birthday, until the enchanted rose petals begin falling, to remove the spell. To do that, he must not only be loved in spite of his outward ugliness (as in traditional versions) but also learn how to love in spite of his inward shallowness (unlike traditional versions). A new character has been added, too: Gaston, the village bully and braggart. Vain, ignorant, arrogant, and preposterously macho, Gaston excels at hunting, brawling, drinking, and spitting. The Disney version also eliminates Beauty's evil sisters.There is a reason for these changes ? a political one. The major male characters, representing men in general, are evil in either the bestial or sexist sense. On the other hand, there is only one major female character, and she is flawless. Apart from her physical charms, Belle is good. She feels compassion for the Beast. She is intelligent,ambitious, heroic, &amp; liberated. In traditional versions, the Beast is interesting and even appealing in his own right. Indeed, he is often more important than Beauty ? not only to boys but to girls as well. Despite its title, this new version is not about Beauty and the Beast: it is about Beauty alone. In other words, a story that had once been addressed to both girls and boys, helping each learn something different, is now addressed only to girls. Belle is obviously a feminist from late twentieth-century America projected as a "fairy tale" back to what looks more or less like eighteenth-century France. In itself, this might be fine; girls do need to see strong and competent female characters on screen. The problem here is not what this movie does for girls but what it does to boys. According to traditional versions, the Beast is thoroughly human from the beginning. He just looks like a beast. He knows how to love but must learn how to be loved. A male counterpart to the female protagonist of "Sleeping Beauty," he must wait for someone to love him (as he really is). It is Beauty who must learn how to love. She discovers the difference between sexual attraction, for instance, and true love. Although physical beauty is only skin-deep, spiritual beauty is not. Or, to put it differently, she discovers that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It is a matter not of the object seen but of the way it is seen." Only when Beauty herself is transformed by maturity can she transform the Beast by "magic." And she transforms only his outward appearance, not his inner being.Although Disney's horrid Beast finally turns into a sweet prince, he is just another patriarchal villain for most of the story, a "grouchy bison" who growls and snarls at everyone who fails to obey him instantly. Actually, he is nothing more than a depressed version of Gaston. Both are archetypal villains for feminists, because they are not merely evil but evil in a way that is specifically and stereotypically male, masculine, or both. Because only male characters are evil in this cinematic world, and because both major male characters are evil, maleness itself is identified with evil. It is true, once again, that the Beast turns good ? but only after Belle goes into action. She transforms him both metaphorically and literally from a beast into a fully human being. So the problem with men is not merely cultural, according to this movie, as it would have been if men had been represented only by the hyper-masculine Gaston. It is also ontological, because Disney's Beast, unlike his prototypes, was inhumane (not ideally human) even before he became inhuman (not human at all). Men belong to some alien species, by implication, until women work on them. Like the Beast who slops his food all over the table, men are supposedly "mean, and coarse, and unrefined" until women civilise them. And even then, the effort can fail: Gaston, irremediable and unredeemable, is therefore trashed by being thrown off a parapet. To be sure, this movie says something "positive" to girls. Femaleness confers not only autonomy but also superiority. But it says something very negative to boys. Maleness confers dependence and inferiority. The males exist only to provide occasions documenting Belle's self-liberation. Nor does the Beast contribute anything to her voyage of self-realisation. It is not his surface appearance that prevents Belle from loving him, according to Disney, but his actual behaviour.If there is any message at all here for boys, it is that they are superfluous at best and contemptible at worst. For Belle, unlike either Beauty or the Beast, the source of darkness is "out there," not "in here." So how is all this an improvement over earlier forms of gender stereotyping? According to some, it is just a healthy "alternative." But a healthy alternative for whom? And what about an alternative to sexism of any kind? Would it have been so difficult to produce a fairy tale that affirms both femaleness and maleness?And my goodness, the songs are awful too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I didn't like Beauty and the Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about 12 years old when I saw this movie. While it wasn't the best movie I'd ever seen, there wasn't anything about it that really irritated me. However, when I last watched it, I was upset at the story line.Why does Beauty fall in love with the Beast? While he is not as conceited as Gaston, he certainly proves on a number of occasions that he is pretty beastly not only in appearance, but in his attitude as well.So this is the message I get. Stick with the guy whose really mean, bossy, scary, and threatening because deep down he's a nice guy. And good-looking.I know that this plot was not conceived by Disney, but Disney did choose it. Belle could have been an empowered heroine, but fails. The woman who sings of wanting adventure and excitement instead falls in love with the man that has imprisoned her. I hope my children have higher standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally enjoy Disney films (or most, with some obvious exceptions from almost recent Disney films). I personally enjoy a lot of the songs and score. So, I decided to re-watch the movie. What I found was a pretty good movie, but it seemed like they were rushed to finish the movie. Things just seemed to go to fast and the story did not go to in depth for certain aspects. However, I thought the characters themselves were cool, especially Gaston (why did he die).But I can't complain that this film is good on Disney standards. Great music, but at a very weird story pace. I just wish they took the time to do the best of their ability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about Beauty and the Beast is the stunning animation, particularly the ballroom scene. This scene really makes you feel like you are there; the movement is superb. Disney again takes an enjoyable and popular tale and weaves it into a magical film. Unfortunately, this is one of the last Disney films that has charm, particularly the charm of some of the old Disney films. It's enjoying to watch, and the characters are not annoying in the slightest, unlike some of Disney's other films. This film is worth a watch and should be enjoyed by the whole family. Captivating, romantic, and packed with action and good lessons - this is definitely a family film (though maybe with a slight preference to females).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney Pictures has had numerous animated trifles ever since the death of Walt Disney and this 1991 release is their worst one of all. I had seen it during its original theatrical run and even then I voted it the worst film I've ever seen. Almost eleven years later no film I've seen since has been worse and I don't expect any other film to take away this film's "honor." The lead character Belle is extremely whiny and insecure as well as unsure of herself. The Beast is actually more scary when he's not trying to be scary. His dialogue is mostly ridiculous. The "enchanted" objects get increasingly annoying as the film progresses. The so called bad guys are shallow and "Be Our Guest" has to be the most annoying song I've ever heard in an animated film. The other songs are no better. Film is only about an hour and a half long but it seems much longer at times and long before it was actually over I knew that I wanted it to end much sooner. Once again, my worst picture of 1991, my worst picutre of Walt Disney Pictures history, my worst picture of animated films history and my worst picture of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Overrated Disney Film Ever Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was told that this was (and is, to this day) the only Disney animated film ever nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, I said to myself- "I have to see it again." By this point, I was obviously a Disney completest. So I bought it (on VHS), and watched it. What can I say? It's a joke! Let's try to take it, scene by scene. First, we are told of the story of the selfish Prince with no love in his heart. A beautiful, magical Enchantress turns him into a Beast (a furry animal, human-sized, with monster teeth and claws) when he dismisses her on the basis of what he perceives as her surface ugliness. Okay, good story. Makes sense. Decent set-up - "for who could ever love a monster?" the story asks at the end.Well, we're going to meet her (the One who could love a monster). Her name is Belle, and she is a misfit in her small provincial French town. She reads books all the time while the townspeople feel beautiful girls should spend all their time waiting for a handsome man to make them wives and mothers. So, next we meet the handsome man who wants to be her husband, Gaston. He's conceited and arrogant - a real jerk, but a fairly accurate product of the time, with less than ideal views on independent, free-thinking women. Which Belle is. This is an okay establishing scene. We're told a lot. The characters are definitely a little flat, but the only real problem is, perhaps, that the woman singing (and speaking) Belle's part has a sort of grating voice. I'm not kidding.So, her father is an inventor who gets lost in the woods on his way to a convention and after being chased by the unsavory creatures in the woods to the Beast's Castle, he is imprisoned by the Beast in his tower. Belle is lead to the castle by the father's runaway horse, and when she finds him, she meets the Beast, who is just the biggest creep in cinema history, once we know it's actually that selfish Prince. Nice to know being this Beast hasn't taught him a thing about humility. Belle begs for the Beast to release her father, but he refuses. So she offers to take her father's place and that... SUDDENLY melts the Beast's heart... A little. He agrees, the father is taken back to his home by a Spider Carriage, and Beast offers to give her a more comfortable room.Now, by this time is where we start to get really worn out by the huge plausibility and character flaws. Belle is the woman, who is given the film's title of being "so Difficult" (important to remember), but it's Beast who is the moody one. Which is understandable, since he was turned into a Beast. But isn't the least bit understandable, given all we've learned about Karma. If you are a bad person, bad things happen to you. Beast got what he deserved, and it's incredibly selfish of him to expect that the work he has to do to become human again will happen on it's own. But the filmmakers have convinced all the people who like this film that it's not a problem. Because they've FLUFFED it up, by just tossing it to the side and saying, "oh, he's just got a bad temper." What does that mean? It means, Beast is still a bad person waiting for Love to make him human. So in effect, he'll still be a bad person when he's human, only he'll be human.Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. Because Beast, over the course of the film, learns to love Belle and becomes a hero. But right from the get-go, we are not supposed to like Beast. Then, under some extremely disturbing circumstances, Belle is thrown into the Castle and through some lame musical numbers (again, I'm not kidding, these musical sequences are not up to the standards of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin), we are manipulated into believing "oh, look, they fell in love so quickly!" Another example of this type of insulting manipulation is the scene where Gaston is convincing the townspeople that the Beast is evil. He sings 1 stupid song and suddenly, everyone in the town is storming the castle, Frankenstein-style (big points for originality there).This film is just one big sappy, unconvincing mess. If anything, it offers some extraordinary colors, 1 funny song ("Gaston" has it's riotously hilarious moments - "and every last inch of me's covered with hair!"), and Jerry Orbach (yep, that crusty detective from Law &amp; Order) is fantastic in his role as a Parisian candelabra, with an impeccable accent. But other than that, this movie just caters to girls and women, assuming that if you dumb it down for them, they'll love it. I hate seeing that happen, but it looks like the ladies (and some gay people) fell for it. Two Thumbs Down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a classic Disney film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's songs provide the cornerstone of this cartoon, inspired in part by the 1940s film by Jean Cocteau. Much of the settings mirror those in the classic film.This film was a major money spinner for the Disney corporation, but for me wasn't up to the standards of the days when Walt Disney was alive. However, it was an enjoyable cartoon with interesting characters and a Broadway feel - indeed, it enjoys a second flush of fame as a stage musical today.I think 'Beauty and the Beast' was the last really good Disney film - 'Aladdin', which followed, was just disappointing. The legend survives intact - Belle and her Beast dance in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers; the teapot and cups sing a welcome when she arrives; and the girl gets her Prince to the swirling sounds of musical Americana.</fullReview>

Great message for parents with daughters out there.

		<fullReview>Young woman sacrifices her own life to save her elderly father from imprisonment by a greatly feared beast, but she's able to tame the creature with charm and they come to love each other. Famous romantic story given opulent Disney-animated treatment, complete with bombastic Broadway-styled musical numbers designed to bowl viewers over with showmanship and sassy humor. Of course it's unfair to compare this colorful package with Jean Cocteau's black-and-white live-action French version, but Cocteau was working with actual sets, costumes and actors and yet was still able to conjure more magical wonders on film than the Disney animators. It's certainly well-made and well-voiced (especially by an undetectable Robby Benson as the Beast), but it takes about 30 minutes for the pacing to pick up (and it does, leading to a nicely directed nick-of-time finish). The editing is gratefully not slambang and the narrative does have the chance to unfold and allow us to get our bearings, but even when the pots and candles and utensils come to life, there's nothing intriguing about the Beast's castle. This Disney enterprise plays it predictably safe. For a movie about curses and magic, "Beauty and the Beast" is too uncomplicated and polite. Even the storybook had a little mystery. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical superficial Disney fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've finally discovered what happened to all the bad boys who were turned into donkeys in Disney's "Pinocchio": they went to live in Belle's town. Disney's anti-male bias is very much in evidence in "Beauty and the Beast": the perfect heroine is surrounded by the most grotesque collection of males ever found in one movie. Most of them are slobby-looking pigs, the ones who aren't dried-up old scarecrows. Even the lone good one, her father, is a bumbling, fat old fool incapable of even driving a broken-down farmhorse to the fair without getting lost. The one goodlooking man she knows is Gaston, a selfish, narcissistic brute, which leaves only the Beast, whose table manners leave much to be desired. But eventually he learns to "behave like a gentleman", which is all that is necessary to win the heroine in this very superficial retelling of the fairy tale. Watch the Cocteau version if you want a real story with some depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Beauty and the Beast" in the theaters in 1991 and just interpreted it as a nice Disney movie. I now see that it started what seems to be a trend in animated features: the villain has a doofus sidekick. And ever since I saw Jean Cocteau's version earlier this year, it's been hard to take this one very seriously (his version seemed to be commentary on the very idea of fairy tales). To me at least, the main redeeming quality here is that "The Simpsons" spoofed "Be Our Guest" as "See My Vest", as Mr. Burns boasts of his clothes being made out of animals.As for other things, it's surprising to see that Jerry Orbach was Lumiere's voice. I mean, who would ever imagine the "Law and Order" guy lending his voice to a Disney movie? Ditto David Ogden Stiers. Angela Lansbury is the only one who doesn't surprise me here, her roles in "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Harlow" notwithstanding.So, "Beauty and the Beast" is OK for some brief entertainment, but it is a Disney movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE IN IMAX!!! IMAX tickets are more expensive than regular film and this movie was never in intended to be viewed on an IMAX screen. The first five minutes of the film are incredible, because it is an entirely new sequence made just for the IMAX version and there are no moving animations just fades and zooms of still shots. The animation is choppy at best and flat out random images flashing on the screen at worst. It's so bad at times it will give you a headache. In the fight scene with the Beast and the wolves, all you saw were flashes of the Beast's body parts with wolves appearing and disappearing at random. It's like watching TV with your nose only an inch from the screen. What you can see is the lack of detail in the characters and almost monochrome appearance to all of the colors in the characters(i.e. all of the colors appear as a single shade there are no gradients). You can't see that in the regular film because it is much smaller.In short the film does not have enough resolution or the depth needed for the IMAX experience. Rent the video or wait for it on DVD; you'll be much happier.</fullReview>
