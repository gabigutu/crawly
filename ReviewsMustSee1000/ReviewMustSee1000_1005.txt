		<shortDescription>A challenging masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is only after a third viewing that I dare venture some comments on this awesome film. That I was fascinated from the start was beyond doubt but its funereal tempo caused me to nod to the extent that even on a second viewing there were whole sequences I had missed. By the third attempt I feel ready."Werckmeister Harmonies" is one of the great artistic challenges of our age. I cannot begin to admit that I understand it fully but I do know that it carries those haunting resonances remaining long after the final shot, that I recently found in the Japanese "Eureka" and nearly half a century ago in Antonioni's "L'Avventura". As there is very little evidence that even the professionals have got to grips with the film's meaning - most are clearly as mesmerised as me but talk mainly about style, in other words how the director looks at his world, I will venture a few ideas even if they are erroneous. Bela Tarr's masterwork can only be understood as an allegory. In the 17th century the German musician, Andreas Werckmeister, conceived the idea of equal temperament thus enabling music to be written and played in any key. In doing so, according to the philosopher musicologist of the film, the purity of the natural cosmic language and inevitability of ordered sound became tainted. As a metaphor for this concept we are shown a small Hungarian town in mid-winter under the threat of civil chaos, The catalyst that brings this about is the arrival in the main square of a circus consisting of only one giant lorry containing a stuffed whale and a mysterious figure billed as the Prince who occasionally speaks but is never seen except as a shadow on a wall. The circus is a challenge to man's understanding of his safe familiar world and when, as here, there is a failure of comprehension the result is a crescendo into anarchy. A mob go on the rampage and, in a sequence of extreme barbarity, attack the local hospital beating up the defenceless patients. That the film works as an intensely human document is due to the fact that the director has given us a character with whom we can identify in the form of Janos, a young postman, whose odyssey throughout the wintry town we follow every step. As each scene takes place in real time generally in a single shot, a walk down a street is the length it takes to achieve. Thus Tarr builds into his structure that element of reflective time for the audience that is a hallmark of the cinema of Angelopoulos and Aoyami. We assimilate Janos's impressions for the time it takes him to experience them. As much has already been written about Tarr's use of the long take I will just add that the attack on the hospital is every bit as powerful an action sequence as the massacre on the Odessa Steps in "Battleship Potemkin". What however is so extraordinary about Tarr's great set-piece is the way it generates a similar power not by Eisenstein-like montage but by long tracking shots. Equally extraordinary is the use of silence. Not one of the victims cries out in distress, there is just the sound of furniture and fixtures being smashed. Whereas Eisenstein homes in on characters and faces, Tarr views his as a dark almost faceless collective. There is just one face recollected from a previous crowd scene to relate this terrible event to the casually familiar. The sequence reaches its climax when a curtain is pulled down from a bath to reveal in longshot the naked standing body of an old man, just flesh devoid of personality. This has the astonishing effect of taming the mob so that they gradually slink away in shame. There is a strange parallel here with our final glimpse of Janos sitting on a hospital bed, traumatised after his unsuccessful attempt at escape from the town. The only sounds he makes are quietly sung unrelated notes. His uncle, the musicologist is with him. He admits to the by now uncomprehending Janos that he has finally compromised by tuning his piano to equal temperament as the only way of perhaps selling the instrument. For the rest all is silence. The musician visits the square by now deserted to see for himself the whale abandoned outside its wrecked carrier. It is Tarr's haunting resolution of a nightmare vision of a world gone mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Work-of-art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put it simply, "Werckmeister harmóniák" is one of the most beautiful and haunting European film of the recent years, and maybe the best Hungarian film in decades. After the breakthrough of the acclaimed 7 hours long epic "Sátántangó" in 1994 it took 3 years to complete this masterpiece for Tarr Béla. "Sátántangó" and 'Werckmeister harmóniák" made Tarr one of the most acclaimed and adored directors of the contemporary film making. This mind-blowing story is told in only 37 shots (I counted it myself) some of them lasts for 5 or 6 minutes. Despite the small number of the shots, this film has one of the most effective editing of all time. Every edit is perfectly timed and has a meaning of its own. Kudos to the editor.The stark black-and-white camerawork is by Medvigy Gábor, and the melancholic music is composed by Víg Mihály. The most harrowing scene is the raid on the town hospital, the longest scene of the film, shot in complete silence. Frightening and senses-staggering, the picture of the naked old man burns into the soul. Highly recommended, a must-see for anyone who is interested in the recent history of Central-Eastern Europe and wants to understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demanding, but rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine it. You spend four years on a project, with big funding hassles and changes in crew; and then, finally, after your film is very enthusiastically received at Cannes, the lab goes and destroys the only English-subtitled print before it's shown at the Edinburgh festival. Obviously Bela Tarr doesn't have his sorrows to seek.Some might accuse the film--which centres on a rural town riven by the arrival of a "circus" consisting only of a dead white whale in a corrugated iron trailer and a character called "The Prince" whose nihilistic and inflammatory remarks incite riots--of veering very close to a parody of miserabilist cinema. Okay, so it's in black and white; there's a lot of mud, rubbish, smoke and wetness; there's not much dialogue between not very attractive people; every take lasts between five and ten minutes; and there are many scenes of people trudging through cold and bleak landscapes. (You'll never see so much trudging in a film.) Lars Rudolph, as the hero Janos, looks like a cross between a young Klaus Kinski and Frasier's brother, Niles, and spends most of the film wild-eyed and harried.However, Tarr's distinctive style--exceptionally fluid and intricate tracking shots rendered in beautifully sharp monochrome--perfectly matches the grim story, which, as the director pointed out, explores the "boundaries between civilisation and barbarism". Any seemingly parodic moments are far outweighed by extremely powerful ones, notably the opening scene in a pub where the hero explains what an eclipse is using the sozzled bar clientele; the hero's deeply unsettling encounter with the "Prince"; and the mob's attack on a hospital.Although the narrative falls apart a bit in its closing scenes, the film's images stay with the viewer in ways unmatched much recent cinema. This film demands your time and concentration, but rewards them; it has a unique and mesmerising rhythm. And the music, by Mihaly Vig, is simply beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contemplative Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>made entirely of longshots of 2-4 minutes in duration. Layers of symbolism in poetic images. It's not a movie, it's not entertainment. It's film, and you have to engage and ask questions about what you are seeing. Why did only 2 people saw the whale? What was the significance of that? How did the riots get started? Who were the insiders and who were the outsiders? How could you tell? Why the hospital? Why do humans always need a causation? Why was the Prince's speech in a different language? What did the Prince represent? What did the Whale? A viewer may not want to be taxed with these questions but given the way the world is, these questions are worth thinking about. I've only seen one other "contemplative film" which is Angelopoulos' Ulyssey's Gaze, which I deeply cherish. This didn't get to me as deeply as it's images weren't as evocative to me. This is probably due to my being able access the cultural symbols of Angelopoulos more easily (though that film isn't "easy" either,it's just that I have more background in modern Greek poetry, etc.). Recommend this film as a unique chance to think of an alternative use of celloid, don't be intimidated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerising...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderfully balletic and poetic film, built on long, long tracking and steadycam shots (thirty-eight for 2hrs 25mins). A study in pervasive yet neutral melancholia; the main character, who accompanies us through the whole film, is a simple, dreamy yet quietly optimistic postman, if one were to interpret his wide-eyed stare and unquestioning attitudes in such a way. One is drawn in from the very beginning, via the evocative music and camerawork. It is rare these days to see European films that take so much time and care as they progress. Watching it I was reminded of Aleksei German's Khrustalyov, My Car! - 1998, Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor - 2000, Fellini and of course Tarkovski. I don't think that all cinema should be 'easy' or well wrapped up. Indeed, I often feel that I am simply not in the mood for seeing a particular film, or experiencing a particular atmopshere. After all it is fairly easy to tell from even short descriptions or reviews the kind of thing that is in store. So I was somewhat surprised to see one previous reviewer here describe this film as "dreary drek". Well, perhaps, but if they wanted to go and see a comedy or redemptive drama, why didn't they go see one already?! I may have had the odd moment of wishing certain shots were a tad shorter, but all in all I was mesmerised, from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nightmarish vision of a town going mad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is closing time in a bar somewhere in Eastern Europe. Someone says, "Show us, Janos". A blank faced young man, Janos Valuska (Lars Rudolph), begins to organize a ballet of inebriated patrons playing the Sun and the Moon turning in their orbits. Valuska pleads, "All I ask is that you step with me into the bottomlessness." As the dance continues, the men are spun. They stop suddenly as the orchestrater tells us that "in this awful, incomprehensible dusk, everything that lives is still?" Then, with a push, the dancers carry on until the Earth emerges from the Moon's shadow. The eternal conflict between darkness and light begins again. Containing shots that last up to fifteen minutes at a time, Werckmeister Harmonies, the latest film by Bela Tarr (Satantango, Damnation), is a nightmarish vision of a society duped by political demagogues and distracted by circuses, being led into a cycle of violence and despair. Based on a novel by László Krasznahorkai, it is a powerful and disturbing film that, in its surreal depiction of growing madness in an unnamed town, is reminiscent of Roy Andersson's Songs From the Second Floor. The film takes its name from the theories of Janos' "uncle" Gyorgy Eszter (Peter Fitz), a musicologist who tells him of his obsession with the legacy of Andreas Werckmeister, a 17th century German musician who created the twelve-tone scale. Eszter believes that perfect order does injustice to the holiness of music, and says that the heavens move to their own music.As Janos leaves the bar and walks through the cold and half-deserted streets, streets that in T.S. Eliot's phrase "follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent", an enormous van drives up the main street and comes to rest in a great empty square in the town center. A circus is in town. The exhibit contains the world's largest whale, dead and stuffed with tiny staring eyes, and The Prince, a shadowy figure that we never see. The town is full of rumors of impending violence. Janos sees the whale and watches a growing group of seemingly unemployed middle aged men gather silently around fires in the square. He seems to know everyone in the town. To further her political agenda of "town cleansing" (read ethnic cleansing), Eszter's estranged wife, Tunde (Hanna Schygulla), sends the compliant Janos on errands. He is told to put the children of the police chief to bed but, as if presaging the coming violence, they stomp on their beds to a cacophony of noise while one shouts at Janos over and over again. "It will be hard for you". "It will be hard for you." He is also asked to listen to conversations in the square and report back to her, but he only hears the Prince saying, `What they build and what they will build is illusion and lies. What they think and what they will think is ridiculous'. When the signal is given, the men in the square come together and march towards us with growing anger in a hypnotic parade lasting five terrifying minutes. They go on a rampage, setting fires and ransacking a hospital, beating the sick in an unbroken orgy of violence. Patients huddle by their beds in silent fear. Suddenly a door is opened. Confronted by the menacing faces, an emaciated old man stands naked in a shower bathed in an amorphous light. Transfixed by what they have seen, the men abandon their task and retreat silently into the street. On the morning after, order is restored. The van is broken down and the whale is exposed as little more than an overstuffed balloon. The Sun emerges from behind the Moon to the swell of ineffably beautiful music. We have reached the end of the cycle only to begin dancing again when the next Prince calls the tune.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced, beautiful descent into madness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's one film that sends shivers up my spine just with it's mere title and that's Bela Tarr's "the Werckmeister Harmonies". It's one of those films that may infuriate some viewers meanwhile leaving others awestruck. The story concerns a very cold winter in a small Hungarian town. The camera follows a man Janos in his various everyday events. We know that this is no ordinary film during the poetic intro in the bar, where the various customers act out different parts of the solar system in rotation. The peaceful order of the village is disturbed, when a traveling circus comes to town. The circus has a stuffed whale carcass on display and abnormalities in jars. A man known as the prince who runs the circus remains in hiding. The stuffed whale seems to have a mystical power. These and other small events which are not fully explained lead the town's people to go crazy and eventually turn violent. This film is very slow, at some times unbearable. Certain events are filmed in real time. Similar film's that come to mind are Antonioni's "Avventura,L" and Heneke's "Code Unknown" Although this film is super slow at times, I loved it. There is something that is gripping about it. It is very surreal and emotional. The scene where the villagers go crazy and raid a nursing home almost brought me to tears. The films musical score is so haunting, it will stay in your mind forever. Also director Gus Van Sant is highly influenced by the films of Bela Tarr and it's apparent in his more recent work like "Gerry" and "Elephant". "The Werckmeister Harmonies" is a masterpiece that's not for everyone. I recommend it for viewers who are extremely patient and are looking for something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let warnings of length turn you away from this movie. If you are incapable of sitting still for 2.5 hours and realizing the beauty of lengthy shots, don't see it. But if not, don't let reviews by those with short attention-spans keep you from seeing this film. It is one of the most beautifully and dramatically shot movies, with each shot lasting about 10 minutes. This allows for breathtaking camera movement that mixes perfectly with the sound track. Take a break from typical movies broken up by excessive shots and see this movie. It will blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weight of Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm a man with a huge world-view, surrounded by microbes." ? Woody Allen Bela Tarr directs "Werckmeister Harmonies". The plot? A circus act, consisting of a giant whale and a special guest called "The Prince", arrives at a small Hungarian town. With the circus comes a palpable sense of impending doom. Pretty soon, local townsfolk kick-start a violent uprising. They seem compelled by invisible, magical forces. One man, Janos Valuska, observes these mysterious proceedings with fascination. A figure of innocence and perhaps naivety, Janos watches as the circus causes violent gangs to form, some taking advantage of the situation and seizing power, others attempts to restore "order and cleanliness".The film begins with a beautiful sequence. Janos enters a bar and persuades a group of drunks to create a model of the solar system. Dancing in circles the gang reenact a solar eclipse, a ballet which is beautiful until one looks closely. The participants are all drunk and in a state of mental confusion, readily believing Janos' apocalyptic description of a solar eclipse. To Janos, an eclipse is not a scientific event, but a quasi-religious one which heralds the end of mankind. Instead of rational explanation, Janos and his congregation thus cling to irrationality and superstition. Later, when Janos sees the giant whale up close, he attributes its presence to God; surely only a powerful, supernatural being could create such a funny creature.Tarr then uses the whale as a metaphor for a kind of irrational, medieval superstition akin to blind, fascist obedience. No one in the film even considers taking a closer look at the whale, for if they had they would have noticed "The Prince" hidden behind it, a shadowy leader who represents nothing but an image onto which anyone can project whatever ideals they wish.Midway in the film, Janos overhears his uncle talking about Andreas Werckmeister, a musician famous for dividing the octave into twelve half-step tones. Werckmeister believed that maths, music and astronomy were linked manifestations of the harmony of the universe, a view held by Pythagoras, who argued that most euphonious harmonies resulted from tones that reflected the proportions of simple integers (2:1, 3:2 etc). But basing musical scales on simple ratios leads to contradictions and octaves that aren't true, which led to people like Werckmeister (and others) seeking to find an "equal temperament" or some form of "new musical system".By adopting this new system, Janos' uncle believes that mankind has deprived musical instruments of their divine tuning, replacing it with an artificial system which is nothing but an illusion; an illusion which western music is based on. Werckmeister is thus a sort of Promethian figure, taking the gift of knowledge/music away from God and handing it down to men.Janos' uncle thus believes that music, and by extension life itself, was better when it belonged solely to God. He longs for a simpler universe ruled by a sovereign Master Figure, and fails to acknowledge the vast achievements developed under the Werckmeister scale. As a musicologist he fails to appreciate the higher level of organisation and harmonies which "man's creation" has led to.The film's treatment of "order", "chaos", "anarchy" and "civilization", are thus reduced to musical terms; a three-way battle between order and symmetry (the unified world-view of classical Greece and the Middle Ages), superstition and mysticism and a more nuanced blending of the two. Consider again the first scene, in which Janos attempts to create heavenly order using the drunken bums. The bums fumble about, irregular in their movements, always falling out of position...and yet they are supremely beautiful, spinning in circles whilst the camera pulls back and the music swells. For Tarr, all quests for perfection must take into consideration humanity's imperfections; harmony depends on imprecision and compromise.But Tarr makes a larger point. Late in the film we're introduced to a gun waving police chief, his dictatorial children and his lover, a woman who seeks to use the escalating chaos of the village to acquire more power. Using these characters, and various symbolic sequences, Tarr then sketches a political allegory about the fascist's quest for order, and fascism's unstoppable tilt toward collapse.Hungary became a "Communist" (or rather, state capitalist) state after World War 2, the Soviet Union maintaining a military presence and enforcing Stalinist principles. This led to a revolt in 1956, which helped to topple authoritarianism and give birth to a kind of mixed ideology Socialism, a greatly liberalised approach to communism that lasted until 1989 (upon which democratic government and capitalism became the norm). But the film is not a strict allegory of Hungarian history, rather it aims to show how one political ideology can replace another when an aimless populace irrationally follows a charismatic demagogue. It is about how reactionary opportunists exploit superstition to gain power in the name of order, how people obsessed with "order" have contributed to disturbing the harmonic "disorder" of things and how impotent members of the intelligentsia often sit on the sidelines whilst the world burns. Indeed, it's no surprise that the first thing the violent gang does in the film is to raid a hospital, destroying scientific equipment in a crazy rage. With science dead they become slaves to lies; an irrational force, an angry mob which is only halted by the sight of a naked old man. This man, his body frail, his bones protruding from his flesh, forces them to confront a mass of paradoxes. Humbled and disgusted, they retreat into the night. But the damage has already been done. The old order has been destroyed and a new era has begun, Janos, the boy who believed in apocalyptic whales and the mysterious beauty of god, ending the film in a sterile hospital ward, misdiagnosed by science and branded an insane criminal.8.9/10 ? Though comprised of only 39 shots, this is perhaps Tarr's most accessible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and gripping, a great European film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is as bleak a film as I have since for a long time. Seen mainly through the eyes of a 'holy fool', played by German Lars Rudolph, it may be allegorical, it may be a horror story or it might even be a distinctively Hungarian very black comedy.Bela Tarr's direction is stunning. The lighting is brilliant throughout, but none more so than when the circus comes to town in the middle of the night. The care and patience with which scenes are built greatly enhances the intensity of the most violent moments. The scene, for example, when a mob march down a long street before attacking a hospital matches the greatest moments of black-&amp;-white silent cinema.The film retains a disturbing ambiguity throughout, right up to its powerful ending. What is the significance of the whale and its owners? And is Valuska (Lars Rudolph) as innocent as it seems on the surface? The result is a long (140 minutes), gripping and exciting film that leaves more questions than answers at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rhythmical Harmonies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- A portrait of a small town in Hungary descending gradually into civil disorder - An extraordinarily brilliant movie. But this is not for everyone. Beautifully shot in black and white, the director bravely specialises in spectacularly lengthy shots which the viewer's brain will either become absorbed by or reject for tedium. An interesting dimension which can heighten involvement in these long shots (or annoy the hell out the unconvinced) is rhythmical sound - be it cranky machinery (reminiscent of Sergio Leone),walking, or an amazing scene where two kids are jumping up and down and banging on drums on the eve before a riot ensues. There is a detachment to the camera-work which reminded me of Kubrick. Again this is a technique which will alienate many viewers. But it works disturbingly well in particular during the penultimate riot scene at the hospital. I watched this followed by The Damnation on the current double-disc DVD edition available in the UK which is a superb issue and has an interview with the Director as a bonus feature. Interesting to note that he states quite categorically that he intends no allegorical/symbolic element to his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Melancholy of Resistance'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on the novel "The Melancholy of Resistance" by László Krasznahorkai. This story takes place in a small Hungarian provincial town in mid-winter. The event that starts to build up the atmosphere of suspicion and unrest is the arrival to town of a circus consisting of only one giant lorry containing a huge, maybe the largest in the world stuffed whale and a mysterious figure who is called the Prince, is never seen except as a shadow on a wall and who possesses the sinister powers of making people act like a mob. The circus is a challenge to the citizens to understand what its place in their small and familiar universe is. They see the circus as the dark shadow of the moon during the total eclipse that "grows bigger... and bigger. And as it covers more and more, slowly only a narrow crescent of the sun remains, a dazzling crescent. And at the next moment, the next moment - say that it's around one in the afternoon - a most dramatic turn of event occurs. At that moment the air suddenly turns cold. Can you feel it? The sky darkens, then goes all dark. The dogs howl, rabbits hunch down, the deer run in panic, run, stampede in fright. And in this awful, incomprehensible dusk, even the birds... the birds too are confused and go to roost. And then... Complete Silence. Everything that lives is still. Are the hills going to march off? Will heaven fall upon us? Will the Earth open under us? We don't know. We don't know, for a total eclipse has come upon us..." When there is a failure to understand, the fear may cause the descent into cruel and senseless violence and turn the decent people in the merciless monsters.As a director, Bela Tarr is extraordinary. A lot has been said about his camera work and long single take shots. His usage of only two colors - black and white is stunning, his sound works perfectly with the images adding to the building of the unbearable tension. His three main characters are played by the German actors Lars Rudolph, Peter Fitz, and Hanna Schygulla - the Fassbinder favorite actress, the star of his 23 films. Casting Lars Rudolf as a protagonist, the young man whose journey throughout the winter night on the streets of the town we follow step by step contributes to the movie's success. Rudolph looks like a cross between Prince Myshkin and a Rock Star, and he is actually Frontman of the group Stan Red Fox. Judging by the movie's ending, the comparison with Myshkin will sadly make sense, too. It will also bring to memory the final words of Anton Chekhov's "Ward #6" - "The whole world is Ward #6". You know, I would not say that everyone should run and find the film and watch it. I understand that it is not easy watching, it does require an active participation but I found it extremity rewarding because it introduced me to the master with the unique style, obvious talent and the interest to the eternal and difficult questions that may not have easy and immediate answers.I am skeptical when critics announce every new interesting Eastern European director "New Tarkovsky" but I should say Tarr is the closest to him I've seen so far. The plot and the story were a little too easy and too obvious for me to follow but Tarr's ability to create an unbearable tension and atmosphere without any special tricks is amazing."Werckmeister Harmonies" is a masterpiece of melancholic resistance. I was resistant to it first, but then, its melancholy overwhelmed me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say I'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies, I love Tarkowsky movies for example, Berghman is also a favorite.....but this? The positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is splendid, and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? I used to think so, but this one is a perfect example of one that (for me) doesn't make it.... maybe it's because I'm too dumb? possible, but I don't think so.... Tarkwosky for example also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and I mean just their heads, because in this movie there are a lot of those shots, but sometimes it IS effective), the general result is plainly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that, while intelligent, is above all very pedantic)you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but just to spare on budget....I'm very disappointed in this film, because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went on and on, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....While reading the very praising comments on this page, I also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty, it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does NOT make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself....an exercise that, in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, that owes much to Tarkowsky, but cab never equal it's level....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to engage emptiness, visually? This is the most tasking difficulty that I know of in film, for both the filmmaker and viewer. You cannot merely look - sitting still is not meditation - it needs to be a particularly sharpened but effortless way of looking. Seeing things without the person that sees obscuring the view.Only the Buddhist have adequately solved this to my mind, by tying into an actual practice of purging the self so that we got a work, a painting, poem or flower arrangement, that was itself an act of meditation. But they had centuries ahead of them to refine. In film, I can always count on Bela Tarr for a vision of formative emptiness, and ways to engage that emptiness as a space for contemplation. No doubt he has studied Mizoguchi for the 'mono no aware' of a transient sorrowful world, itself derived from the Buddhist eye. And even more Tarkovsky, in more explicitly adopting his omniscient camera for the reflections. The gloomy darkness he surrounds it with no doubt comes from Eastern Europe as churned from the broken machinery of decades old communism. It is implicit in everything he does, always iron cast in punishing ways. At least this part doesn't require any more comments I feel. The impressions of abstract horror are from a life lived.So it is a dark world rolling into the night that we are given here, from the memory of it, a kind of nightbound universe. How to struggle from our end? Why, most importantly, why even admire the great whale, if the whole is nothing?Of course, it is nothing less than simple honesty on Tarr's part for presenting a world as he does, as we know historically up to now. For the most, it is the Prince that humanity has been the most eager to hear, someone to incite change. There is no time to see the great whale whose body encompasses the world, the wonder of that emptiness that can generate form of such awesome beauty. The only thing that has power to halt the rampaging mob then is a vision of their own mortality.So in several ways, one is tempted to imagine a kinship between him and Trier; an encounter with the void, and human wretchedness in the face of that encounter. But I posit Tarr to be a wiser filmmaker, especially here.Look how he opens the film for example, a magnificent round-up even more pertinently addressing now, our microcosmic cycle mirrored from above, with humans dancing into position of the spheres. This is a filmmaker who understands. The only problem; the Nietzchean dismay he seems to have resigned himself to. The last bit of news is that he has decided to stop making films altogether. His worldview is a bleak one, no doubt.But it's an honest dismay, a way of confessing that he knows there will be light again in principle but can't seem to see any. It's a profoundly human despair, how he wearily examines the broken whale at the end. So the problem remains, one of embodying a world where, by simply existing, we are negations of that primal void. Isn't that what we're taught? So how to embrace the great whale then?The film ends here. It falls on us to see beyond the dark, and see if we can embrace the whale by seeing that the whole and nothing is the one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie when taken at face value is baffling and confusing. There is imagery that seems nonsensical if not downright weird, and there are scenes that seem to go on well past when they should have ended. You basically have two choices when faced with these long intervals allowed by the director. 1. Reject the movie, and this is easy to do, because its uncomfortable to sit there watching people walk with no talking for five minutes, or 2. Engage with the movie. By engaging with movie, I mean force yourself to think about what different symbols of the movie mean, and consider that everything in the movie is there for a reason. The key is to contemplate the two central metaphors or images of the film - The idea of the The Werkmeister's Harmonies, and the symbolism of the circus show, and to extend these interpretations to political organization and philosophy of science. The director himself has been elusive at explaining his imagery, and I think in a way this is the point. There are countless movies (Hollywood, and independent) that simply tell you what to think, leaving you the viewer as the passive receiver of information. This movie really forces you to engage with the story and bring your own interpretations and thoughts to it, in order to derive meaning. If you don't do this, the two and a half hours of the movie can be a miserable experience, but if you put the effort in, you will be amazed at how the movie continues to reward. Put it this way, my wife and I saw this movie and spent the next two hours in a coffee shop talking about nothing but the movie, and the conversation was of the exciting, "And what do you think that meant . . . and how did this fit with that part . . . oh yeah, that's great that works . . . or lets use this interpretation as a placeholder for now since we need to fill in some blanks." A great stimulating conversation. Name another movie of the past year that could inspire the same kind of conversation. Even if you can, if you're being honest, you would have to admit that movies like this one are very rare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prince, The Whale, and the Curious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) **** The film opens as the local pub is closing up. The barkeep orders the drunken townsfolk to leave, but they inform him that they must was for Janos to arrive so that he can explain the forthcoming eclipse. He arrives, and uses the drunks as his models for the planets and stars. He describes the eclipse in a vibrant story telling style ? "will the hills march off?" The barkeeper has enough and orders them to leave before the end. Janos walks off the camera in front of him backing away. He is immersed in light surrounded by darkness as he makes his way down the street to Mihaly Vig's mesmerizing score. This is all done in two shots, lasting around 11 minutes. As typical in a Tarr film, many if not most shots will last near ten minutes.The director, Bela Tarr is widely regarded as one of the greatest modern filmmakers, though (as noted by Roger Ebert) is more talked about than seen. This was the first film of Tarr's that I saw, and it caught me hook, line, and sinker. The beautiful black and white cinematography, incredibly long takes, and hauntingly sparse soundtrack creates a masterful atmosphere. The film revolves around Janos, who is well liked in his small village. He goes to great lengths to care for his ailing uncle, a music scholar, who spends all his time trying to readjust the mistakes of Andreas Werckmeister. A carnival comes to town under the cover of night, with the giant carcass of a whale, and a mysterious character called the Prince, who rumor has it has a devoted following of worshippers who follow his every word as he incites riots and stirs up violent sentiment. We overhear a conversation that describes how whole families are disappearing, and that good honest people are fearful to leave their houses. Janos becomes mystified by the whale and the humor of the lord for creating such a bizarre and huge creature after seeing it for himself.He is visited by his Auntie Tunde, the ex-wife of his uncle. She demands that he must get his uncle to persuade the town's citizens to sign up and donate to a fund so that she and the police chief may organize a group to restore order in the town. If his uncle fails to do so by 4pm that day, she will move back in. They follow her orders as the camera follows them around town. Tarr thinks nothing of simply watching someone walk for minutes at a time. Later that night, Janos will be asked to go down to the town square and see who was talking to whom and what is going on. He goes and finds that fires have been lit. He sneaks into the truck to see the whale again, and overhears the circus manager arguing with the Prince and his translator. He demands that the Prince must not be allowed out to destroy another town but he is powerless to stop him. He tells them that they are free from his services and he will not take responsibility anymore. Janos runs off as the camera paces in front of him, close up on his face, as we still hear the voice of the Prince. We hear riots break out behind him. He stops running and heads back.Much has been made to attempt to place symbolism on the film. Tarr has claimed however that his films contain none. Nevertheless, the film is filled with such metaphysical overtones and undertones that you don't have to look hard to suggest symbolism. The incredible, balletic organization of the shots works to create a dense and atmospheric mood. In all of Tarr's films there are extended shots of people doing mundane things. The task of eating is particularly present in his films, and long shots of people walking. There are many of these moments in Werckmeister Harmonies, one of which does come across as slightly trying and overreaching. Most however are incredibly hypnotic. Take for example a shot of the mob as they make their way to a hospital through the streets. The camera hovers above them, moving backwards for minutes, no dialog or music, just the sounds of footsteps in unison. The most complex shot of film comes as the mob ransacks the hospital beating patients. They come across a naked old man, standing, waiting to be attacked. The mob stops, as Vig's score sad score kicks in, and are brought back to reality as they leave in unison again, this time somberly. We discover that Janos has been watching them, or perhaps participating.Werckmeister Harmonies' beautiful compositions, deliberate lack of story telling and existential themes blend to create a film that is outside of time. All of Tarr's films create a specific and empty sense of atmosphere. He looks to plunge us into the world of his characters. The final shot of the film lands us back in the town square as Janos's uncle finally goes to see the whale his nephew has been begging him to see, the whale which lead to Janos's intrigue, what got him caught up in the events of spawned by the Prince. The truck it was in has been turned to rubble, the whale lies on the ground. He looks it in the eye, and walks off in sadness rather than fascination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Empire May Strike Back...But There's Always A New Hope (Isn't There?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many thoughtful and knowledgeable comments have preceded this one, I'll be (uncharacteristically) brief: It seems to me that the form and aesthetics of the film are so dominant, and the walloping capital-S symbolism of the whale, the helicopter, the Prince, etc. are so overt, that it's not much use to dwell on them yet again in a short review.(Also, I agree with those who think that the symbolism doesn't quite gel into a cohesive whole -- if we're trying to read a consistent symbolism structure under the plot, which maybe we just don't have to.)But it may be of some help to those who haven't seen the film, or those who have and seek a structure on which to hang their analyses, to mention some apparent influences or connections.Tarkovsky is an often-mentioned one. 'Tis slow, 'tis tracking shots, yes yes. But I wonder tho: is Tarkovsky brought up because of the starkness, the slowness, the Euroweirdness alone, or do Tarkovsky's ideas (whatever they may be; it's too much to go into here) also resonate? And if the influence is purely aesthetic, then what are the exciting ideas at work under the skin?Well, for the plot, I found Bergman a much more useful connection. The relationship between Unkie Gyory and his wife suggested numerous Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow relationships in Bergman -- tense, abused, exhausted, too-familiar, yet inextricably connected. (I don't believe "Harmonies" ever shows them in the same shot, by the way.) Even Jonas plays the next-generation counterpoint and intermediary that often pops up in Bergman's movies (as in "Saraband," for instance).But beyond these generalities, there's a specific and pretty decent reference: Bergman's "Shame," in which a pacific village is ripped open by the intrusion of war -- for no reason, to no end, and with profound effects on the lead characters. Tanks and helicopters feel upsettingly foreign. (Even though "Harmonies" doesn't pretend to occur in any era but our own, it's carefully presented in an antiqued and rarified manner until the coming of the "war".) There are probably many similar movies in which Eden is rent by sin, but "Shame" for me remains the most upsetting and direct -- and this movie more than any other captured the same jarring sense of intrusion and catastrophe.Also, on the same tack, I'm a bit surprised that no one (as far as I noticed) mentioned possible parallels to World War II: the sudden invasion of a foreign entity, the decimation of an innocent populace, the twisted "prince" (cf. Machiavelli, by the way) inciting destruction for its own sake (or perhaps some clandestine "final solution," perhaps having to do with the whale? suggests one townswoman), and numerous other scenes.Lastly, oh doom-n-gloom wooers, there is a sneaky final hope in the film -- though it's sneaky because it comes at the very beginning: though the sun's light may be eclipsed from the earth, and though a shadow shall fall over life and love, there will (we must believe!) come the sun again. Janos goes out of his way to make this point. Gyorgi will come again, tomorrow, at the usual hour. The circus has left town and the square is bare and the whale is flopped out for everyone to see. In short, despite all predictions of the apocalypse, tomorrow is another day after all.In some ways, "Harmonies" may be a far easier picture for some to understand once the thick smear of Artsiness (which, though very beautiful, could be pared a bit without any loss) is temporarily ignored for the sake of the traditional narrative in the film.And now I've certainly gone on far longer than my promise to be brief...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bela Tarr's Werckmeister Harmonies: Can human bodies take up heavenly relations?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The first is Hamlet's great formula, 'The time is out of joint.' Time is out of joint, time is unhinged. The hinges are the axis around which the door turns. Cardo, in Latin, designates the subordination of time to the cardinal points through which the periodical movements that it measures pass. As long as time remains on its hinges, it is subordinate to movement: it is the measure of movement, interval or number. This was the view of ancient philosophy. But time out of joint signifies the reversal of the movement-time relationship. It is now movement which is subordinate to time. Everything changes, including movement. We move from one labyrinth to another. The labyrinth is no longer a circle, or a spiral which would translate its complications, but a thread, a straight line, all the more mysterious for being simple, inexorable as Borges says, 'the labyrinth which is composed of a single straight line, and which is indivisible, incessant.' Time is no longer related to the movement which it measures, but movement is related to the time which conditions it: this is the first great Kantian reversal in the Critique of Pure Reason." Gilles Deleuze, Preface "On four poetic formulas which might summarize the Kantian philosophy", Kant's Critical Philosophy, vii. And might not the last sentence of this first paragraph in Deleuze's brilliant and brief study of Kant, be a statement about film? "Time is no longer related to the movement which it measures, but movement is related to the time which conditions it: this is the first great achievement of film..." Ever since film began to un-spool its own version of time at 24 frames per second, synthesizing it through simple optical illusion and the narrative innovations of montage (editing), film-makers have enjoyed the magic of imaginary time. And on occasion, a film- maker arrives who has an entirely different sense of time, a different breath, a gait out of step with the rhythms of time common to the moving picture. Bela Tarr is one of those film-makers. And while he is often compared with the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky (also a time-maker), Bela Tarr's temporalities are material, where Tarkovsky's are often symbolic and visual. Asked once why the scene of villagers marching towards the town square in Werckmeister Harmonies lasted as long as it did, the director answered, simply, "that's how long it took to get there." As simple as this is for an answer, there is something else at work in Tarr's camera work. Werckmeister Harmonies, at over 2 hours, contains only 39 shots. It took the director a day to edit together. But the effect of storytelling in so few shots is not just a reduction to the straightforward and direct capture of time. He is, I think, making film think with the body; and it is the body which, set in motion, resides in time. Werckmeister Harmonies opens with a shot of town drunks in a bar enacting the orbits of the planets. A lone bulb hangs from the ceiling as the men spin and tumble slowly about the room, their bodies taking up heavenly relations. And this is what they do throughout the rest of the film: bodies move and are moved, they plod along empty roads by night; they gather in tedious crowds; they assemble for a march on the town square; they pillage a hospital; they walk adjacent to one another (there is a two minute tracking shot for which the director laid down over 300m of rail). And as the villagers in Werckmeister Harmonies are set in motion, so too is the viewer. Tarr makes the viewer think his film, and live its time, with him. I have watched as friends adjust their seats during many a shot, their own physicality coming under the spell of Tarr's temporality. Can bodies think? Can minds think without bodies? Can we have social relations as heavenly as the relations among the heavenly bodies? Tarr's opening shot, in which we found the drunks losing themselves to vertiginal rotations, culminates with an eclipse. Tarr shows us an eclipse, an eclipse in the heavens, staged by village drunks. Light, obscured, is not darkness, as time, out of joint, is not motion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The whole is not quite greater than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts well enough, establishing a stark, gloomy atmosphere. We see the local postman Janos doing various things, in the process introducing us to some of the other characters in the story. Basically the story from here, in a nutshell, is that a sideshow consisting of a stuffed whale and a character known as 'the prince' (who we never see directly) arrives in the town square. The townsfolk start to gather in the square, becoming progressively more agitated as the film progresses, finally they go on some type of rampage, sacking the local hospital (it is implied that this is somehow at the behest of 'the prince'). It seems then the army moves in to round up the locals, and for some reason not fully explained, Janos is deposited in the local asylum. There are various small subplots which go nowhere (some type of local power play with Janos' relatives and some kind of musical analogy for the plot seems to be floated). This is more than enough for your average art film to hang its hat on, the problem more comes in the quality of ideas over the length of the movie. One can detect the influences of various directors, the most obvious being Tarkovsky and the long takes; at the start of the movie these long takes are full of movement and interest; however, as we progress, the motif becomes overused and dull. In the end, it seems the long takes of people walking take on an almost comic effect, with the director dragging it on just long enough to make you squirm before introducing a new element.One never really develops any empathy with any of the characters, most are only hastily drawn eastern European clichés, the main character starts to chew the scenery a little at the end, the actor seems somewhat unsure how Janos' mental state is meant to progress. Overall, it's as if the director spends a lot of time creating an interesting setting, then isn't quite sure what to do with it over the duration of the film. Werckmeister Harmonies is by no means a bad film, it just doesn't scale to the heights it so obviously aspires to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern day meditative masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small town. A drunk room; a rather dreary bar with two big lights hanging from the ceiling. Village simpletons falling all over the floor with an overdose of drinks. "You tubs of beer"..the bartender calls them! At closing time, a wide-eyed, gaunt, but seemingly popular young man walks in. He is Janos Valuska (Lars Rudolph). He uses the drunks at the bar as props and demonstrates the Solar Eclipse and the effects of this phenomenon on the behavior of the mortal beings of the earth. The scene lasts for the first 10-12 minutes and ends with a melancholic, haunting score by Mihaly Vig. This single scene is so beautiful, it sets the tone for what's to come.There is a shroud of ambiguity over Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr's "Werckmeister Harmonies" (co-directed by Ágnes Hranitzky). There is communication that is very vague. Things are spoken about something bad that happened before and something terrible that's perhaps about to happen. And in some towns, they say it has already begun. Is it the advent of the apocalypse? At the center of this mystery is a stuffed giant whale, a part of a "circus" that has arrived in town. This circus also features the enigmatic "Prince". With the coming of the whale and the Prince there is suddenly a 'lack of harmony' within the quietude of the town. Foreigners have started encroaching. There are stories that they have started rioting and looting. The whale is perhaps the reason. Most people seem to regard the whale as an abomination. Only Janos sees it as a bounty of nature, a miracle of God...Janos is clearly an optimist. Or is it the Prince who is behind all the turbulence? There are all kinds of stories. The dead whale and the Prince are somehow responsible for creating ripples in the otherwise still waters of the quiet little town. They have already spread their wings on other parts of the country. But are all these just urban legends? One of the main characters, György Eszter (Peter Fitz), speaks about how the musical intervals and harmonies as we know them over the centuries are "false" and the result of a huge scandal brought about by a certain Andreas Werckmeister. The title alludes to the harmonies or lack thereof owing to some funny business brought about by Werckmeister as a result of an "unhinged arrogance" that wished to take possession of the natural harmonies of the Gods! This one scene and the philosophy within has a strong connection with the overall theme of the film...lack of harmony and how it is brought about! Eszter's former wife Aunt Tunde (Hanna Schygulla) has an agenda of her own...she is out to initiate a "clean town" project with the help of her current lover, the Police Chief, for which she needs her former husband's help. "Our Janos" (as he is referred to by all townsfolk who like him) is entrusted the task of convincing Eszter to use his command and popularity to get support of the movement. Eszter reluctantly agrees. "I've paid for it and I may pay for it all my life", he says. But what exactly? Tarr doesn't think that is important. We never get to know. He clearly loves ambiguity.Tarr also loves extremely long takes, stark Black and White cinematography (beautiful at that), a somber mood, melancholic score, a languorous pace, bleak imagery and an overall sense of doom and despair. There are long philosophical monologues which are almost poetic and need to be heard at least twice to grasp. There is a distinct "meditative" feel to the proceedings. It is not difficult to spot the heavy Andrei Tarkovsky influence here, just as in other films of his. But Tarr's pictures are less abstract than those of the great Russian filmmaker. "Werckmeister Harmonies" is mostly materialism heavy but there certainly is some symbolism embedded in the narrative. The "Prince" who travels with the whale, for example, is a mysterious faceless creature who seems to have immense powers. A clock that was dead for years started ticking again as he went past! And he apparently also incites rioting. He doesn't believe in any greater power or authority either. Is he then the "Prince of darkness" with a thirst for destruction? Tarr demonstrates his ability to create a powerful impact through the marriage of visuals and sound. On one hand there is the scene in which Vig's soulful music accompanies, like Janos appreciating the whale and being awestruck by its enormity. And then there is the scene in a newspaper factory. Long monologues and ambient sounds serve as a background to Janos' mundane activities being filmed, and later the camera slowly pans to the person delivering the monologue! Then, of the several long tracking shots, a particular shot of Janos and Eszter walking adjacent to each other in an almost synchronized march of their feet (with only the sound of their feet and a lunch box providing the sound...carrying on for a good 2-3 minutes!) can't help but bring a smile on your face. Apparently, for one other scene, in which a lot of people are marching together to reach a destination, Tarr was asked why the scene is that long. Tarr simply answered "that's how long it took to get there!" "Werckmeister Harmonies", like any other Bela Tarr film, is surely not for the impatient viewer. It is for that segment of film lovers who love their films grave; and who don't mind the scenes playing out real time, with the editing process being allowed to take the back seat as long as the final product delivers. Suffice to say, Tarr manages to engulf the viewer under his spell and guarantees a hypnotic audiovisual experience, one that culminates into a powerful ending that leaves a lasting impact....Score: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this film appears to loose in its measured pace it makes up for in its multilayer's of meaning. Everything is symbolic, from the dousing of the stove in the opening shot foreshadowing the removal of warmth and comfort to come, to Janos walking from the light into darkness as he leaves the bar. Workmeister Harmonies is an in depth reworking of the police captain's speech in Satantango with particular emphasis on order. "The strange thing is there is nothing to fear about freedom... order, on the other hand, can often be frightening." This film explores both natural order and social order. Natural order in the motions of the planets giving explanations to the eclipse showing modern mans superior knowledge over the animal kingdom. The musical scale has imperfections. Harmonic intervals on a piano tuned perfectly in one key give discordant intervals in a different key. That is why Werkmeister modified the tuning of stringed instruments to give the best fit over a range of keys. The question then arises why a perfect God would create an imperfect system. This leads on to Eszter's statement that (the imperfections in the tonal scale) "Is a philosophical question?the tonal system has led us ultimately to a test of faith in which we ask on what do we base our belief? ?We have to speak of a deception." As with other Tarr films, things of significance happen in the by goings. When Janos collects his morning deliveries the woman in the sorting office is relieving her boredom by talking to herself and addressing the room in general. Here is where the link between natural order; social order and superstition occur. "If a family is ordered it disappears without explanation. The world has gone completely mad. Now it's not down here but up there where something's gone wrong. There is no coal and it is 17° below. There is a circus and a prince who makes a speech nobody understands and suddenly the broken church clock starts working and trees are split so their roots come out of the ground (A reference to the miracles of Jesus - perhaps). Nothing is sacred, statues are pulled down and gravestones stolen. How can you explain it in normal terms? People bolt their door and tremble dreading what is to come. It is certain something is to come." Janos never doubts his faith. "All is well in the cosmos", he says. The whale, I think, represents the unknown, and because his faith is intact he has no problem to look into its eye. There he sees only the wonder of the Lord's creation. Mr Eszter and those who gather in the town do not want to discover the unknown themselves but want others to see it for them.The fundamental question that was alluded to but never asked and therefore never answered was 'Why, when the temperature was minus 17°C was there no coal in the region'. Was it a failure of natural order or was it deliberately withheld to destabilise the social order? If it was the latter then the prince is an agent for those who have the social order under their control. If the prince is a false Messiah then that is why he says of his followers, "What they build and what they will build; what they do and what they will do is delusion and lies." "What they think and what they will think is ridiculous. They think because they are afraid and those who are afraid know nothing."The police chief cannot control his own children let alone the town. Aunty Tunde is not as benign as she appears and is there to organise the military. The military do her bidding so she is on the side of those who control the prince. Is it helpful in understanding this story if we change the name Gyorgy Eszter to that of Winston Smith? When he is pushed by Tunde into organising action against those who are gathering in the town he says "When the town is under threat we have amusements in chaos (compare to endless sport and reality TV). We need solidarity, common sense is important. We cannot remain passive; to retain order we have to take action." This is a prime example of what we often meet in modern life; attacking the symptoms of a problem and not its cause. If Eszter really wanted to cure the problem he would find a way of providing more coal, not just clearing the destitute out of the town. But this is just what he is charged with doing ? so that order can be restored but order for whom? Here, even the innocent are the guiltiest. As he says earlier, "We have to speak of a deception".What has changed between the beginning and the end of this story is that the civil administration has been replaced by a military one. "??Order on the other hand can often be frightening."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful opening set-up in an allegory that should make us uneasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening is one of the most intriguing I've come across. We're in a working class tavern in a small Hungarian village. It's closing time, but one of the drunks wants Janos (Lars Rudolph), the young mail carrier, to explain the cosmos again, and the meaning of a great eclipse. Soon Janos has these rough, staggering men shuffling around the one he has made the sun, one the earth, another the moon. Others join in, eyes unfocused, all caught up in something out of their understanding. "...and now," Janos says, "we'll have an explanation that simple folks like us can understand about immortality. All I ask is that you step with me into the boundlessness where constancy, quietude and peace, infinite emptiness reign. And just imagine that in this infinite sonorous silence everywhere is an impenetrable darkness." The temperature outside is 17 degrees below zero. It's cold to the bone, but without snow. And Janos says, "The sky darkens and then all goes dark. The dogs howl, rabbits hunch down, the deer run in panic, run, stampede in fright. And in this awful, incomprehensible dusk, even the birds, the birds, too, are confused and go to roost. And then...complete silence. Everything that lives is still. Are the hills going to march off? Will heaven fall upon us? Will the earth open under us? We don't know. We don't know." Bela Tarr's Werckmeister Harmonies seems to me to be a great combination of allegory about human beliefs, pessimism about human behavior and extraordinary movie making. The image of all these village drunks slowly shuffling and turning around one of their own, the sun, is pure cinema, original, striking and memorable. Late that night, when Janos is delivering mail, he sees a huge truck slowly driving past a row of buildings leading to the town square. The truck casts a shadow like a pitch-black cloak against the buildings, slowly putting them in such darkness that we can't see them. Inside the truck are the preserved remains of a giant whale and, a poster tells us, a "guest star, The Prince." Janos Valuska is one of life's innocents. He's "our Janos" to all he knows. For him, everyone is "Uncle" or "Auntie." He believes what people tell him. He does what they ask of him. He cares for them. He does no harm and much good. But now in the village strange things are rumored to happen...families have disappeared, headstones stolen, assaults, killings and burglaries. Rough men are coming to the town because of the whale and The Prince. "The mysterious unknown plagues are here," one woman says. " Great frozen mountains of refuse are everywhere. People bolt the door and tremble, dreading what is to come..." Some choose to prepare themselves by making lists of names. Much worse is going to happen. The natural harmony of God (or the gods) shouldn't be interfered with. Between the forces of anarchy and the forces of order, between faith and God, there's not much left for most of us, only a disordered and dangerous universe. Janos will no longer be one of life's innocents. With two minor caveats, I think this is one of the most significant films I've seen. The discussion of Andreas Werckmeister, whose theories of tonal harmonies is challenged by one of the characters, seems to me to be needlessly abstruse (That's probably because I'd never heard of the man and didn't have much of an idea of what the movie's character was going on about.) Surely this could have been developed in a less abstract way. And then there are Tarr's long, unbroken takes. At first I wasn't expecting this and was caught up with the time Tarr was quite willing to spend on a character's expression or action. Close to the beginning of the film, late at night, Janos visits an old man, an important character in the film, who is dozing in the cold parlor of his home. The camera follows Janos in the commonplace activities of helping the man to bed, folding the old man's trousers, helping to take off the socks and shaking and folding them. Pulling up the blanket. Going into the bathroom to bank down the wood-burning heater. Putting on a scarf and heavy coat and his mail pouch to go deliver letters. There was nothing special in these activities, but they were so naturally framed and conducted that they were interesting in themselves and illustrated the kind of well-meaning person Janos was. At the 90-minute mark, however, I found myself anticipating the scenes where Tarr would use this device. Some of those long takes began to seem very long. Small criticisms, really, considering how masterfully Tar composed this film and how deeply he looked into faith, evil and human behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bela Tarr.... let's think about some superficial things.. he's obviously not very fond of schematic films, he hates being awarded, he hates commercial critics and films... well not to blame. Bela's Werckmeister reflects above all a constant chaos between humans and universe order overall... with a great history logic, starting with the whole sort of saying, and ending with the instinct... The first sequence of which i'm proud since i made myself a remake out of it, came to be an excellent, beautiful piece of art, and incredible cinema demonstration... perfect and poetic camera movement, great acting work.. so natural, so perfect, to create a natural environment which will become as the films goes by, in an intense reality full of fascist symbols and wicked characters and situations.. all of them surrounded with a black and white cinematography, which in my believe creates these neo-world war 2- futuristic society...Dunno, Tarr's work has became for me, as an act of God... cinema as if it is God's eighth day on Earth art creation. The length of the camera movement lead us to a essay of time in cinema such as Tarkovsky or Jansko did early... Great master, great film... Great prove of what we have to do with a camera and a piece of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Village idiot / savant / errand boy János (Lars Rudolph, who has both the looks and the intensity of a young Klaus Kinski) sees strange things happening in his town: a road show has arrived, displaying the stuffed carcass of a huge whale, strangers start to assemble in the town square and a mysterious, faceless Prince travelling with the road show might harbor some apocalyptic plans.The story appears nonsensical and absurd at first but when it's concluded you realize it's really an allegorical retelling of Hungary's (and Europe's) recent history.Tarr films in a striking black-and-white cinematography, using takes that last for up to ten minutes, planned and executed with an often breathtaking virtuosity. It's a movie that channels Orson Welles in technique and Andrei Tarkovsky in mood and atmosphere. The resulting mix is all it's own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>29 days after September 11th</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film over the summer and it became one of my absolute favourites. It is a FILM - you cannot tell others about it in words. That's just wrong media. I mean there are so many layers in this film (layers of black, white and gray, light, dark, noises, body language, behaviour, meanings of words and so forth)!Nevertheless, I would not write a commentary (I've never done such a thing). However, after the tragedy that happened September 11th, this film has become very relevant in my mind. You see I am not religious at all but this film was the one that brought me closest to becoming a believer in God. To make it simpler than it is: according to the story of Werckmeister harmonies, the simple people of this small town are offered a choice of seeing one of God's perfect creatures - the giant whale -, or to follow someone - a weird, mystical little dwarf (?), the Duke -, who is spreading some rumours and agitating the people. So there is the problem of choice, distinguishing what is ultimately important. Then there is the problem of communications between people. Which does not really exist. And then there is this desire for being led by strong, aggressive men, who Know the Truth...Well, I hope I did not deter anyone from seeing the film, with my narrow interpretation of it. As I said, it is just one layer. If you like complex ideas, films that stay with you longer than the evening you've seen them, this one is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Knows What Evil Lurks in the Hearts of Men?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shadow knows." Let me first point out that this modern B&amp;W film is not for everybody. The slowly developing plot is conveyed through a series of lengthy takes. People are often seen standing motionless or performing mundane tasks, such as reading and eating bland meals. Most action scenes are nothing more than various perspectives of people walking, marching or running in silence. And, it is not until halfway through the film before the story actually becomes compelling. Events reach a frightening climax when a mob of angry citizens ransacks a hospital. However, the viewer must come to his/her own understanding of how or why the tragedy occurred.As for my interpretation, the film represents the Soviet takeover of Hungary during the post WWII era. It insinuates that the Soviets deliberately provoked social unrest so as to provide a justifiable context for a military takeover. Those who naively cooperated with the Soviets became puppets. Others who opposed the Soviets were either killed or ostracized. The big 'fish out of water' represents the elite members of society, who were rendered utterly powerless and useless.The story centers around János Valuska, who may reflect Béla Tarr's own misplaced youth. Undaunted by the solar eclipse that will soon overshadow the whole community, the artistically inspired János directs and narrates a performance for a motley crew of intoxicated misfits in a local bar. Trustworthy, caring and respectful, János enjoys a modest yet peaceful existence with his close knit, extended family. Uncle György is another idealist, living in the abstract world of his own musical imagination. Unlike his outgoing nephew, however, György is a reclusive reactionary. A respected pianist, György believes that music has somehow been corrupted by his predecessor, Andreas Werckmeister.A new exhibit has arrived in town, featuring a great whale and a foreign prince. Apparently, this public demonstration has already caused much commotion in neighboring towns, and once again trouble appears to be brewing. Aunt Tünde tries to organize a committee to restore order. György wants nothing to do with this 'media circus', but in order to avoid confronting his wife directly, he reluctantly agrees to be the chairman. János goes to see the whale and eventually realizes that the exhibit is indeed a diabolical threat to the community, but he still does not understand how or why. And, when all the smoke and debris has finally settled, he is left even more clueless than he had been to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating study of 20th century Central European rural character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie first while the memory of the 1999 total solar eclipse across Central Europe was still fresh in me. It is like the eclipse, both in its queer beauty and the chilling way it reveals nature's secrets.It also has its own pace. If you expect something to happen in a movie in every minute, don't watch this, you won't like it. However if you liked the slowness of Tarkovsky pictures for example, then this one is for you. This movie is a delight to the senses, a feast of fantastic pictures and music. And you're given time to enjoy it.It took me some thought to realize I actually know the town in which it was photographed, because they have omitted all the particular details, but they still retained what's common in all towns like Baja. The miniature society of this town is presented to the viewer with absolute clarity. There's not a single character and act in it without a role and a reason. Then the actions get out of control and they become history over the heads of its creators. There's one moment of magical hope in it though which stops the madness.The script of the movie is thoroughly self-referential, so let me sum it up with a line from it:"They also say... the whale's got no part in it. Then the next moment, that the whale is the cause of it all."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable and deeply poignant film, slight pity about that dubbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Béla Tarr's 2000 film "The Werckmeister Harmonies" deals with troubling events in a small town in Hungarian's eastern plains. After an opening scene showing simpleton postman János demonstrating to a bar full of drunks how the Earth and moon rotated around the sun with the help of three of the old geezers, he does his rounds in the early morning. Posters put up advertise the arrival of a giant whale with special guest, the Prince. This travelling circus, however, fills the townspeople not with eager anticipation but with dread. Indeed, when the Prince does appear, all hell breaks loose.Based on the novel "The Melancholy of Resistance" by László Krasznahorkai, the plot of this film is a transparent allegory for Hungary in the 1930s and 1940s: unable to keep its house in order, and falling for the demagoguery of fascism, Hungary brought on itself its long nightmare of Soviet domination. Tarr has curiously stated, however, that he is not offering us a historical allegory. By that I can only imagine that he is turning the allegory into a parable, using a reference to mid 20th-century Hungary as way of exploring more universal themes. Perhaps the central tension in the film is between a natural order, the ecstatic cooperation of free human beings, and an order dictated by a manipulative leader. I don't want to spoil anything that happens here, but Tarr's depiction of a mob let loose is harrowing.Tarr is truly the heir to Andrei Tarkovsky in treating filmmaking as "sculpting in time". "The Werckmeister Harmonies" was expertly filmed in 39 long, carefully composed shots. These carefully crafted visuals demand a high-definition release, though unfortunately one is not yet available as I write this.I was very moved by this film the first time I saw it, and on repeat viewings there has been much to appreciate. However, there is one painful flaw for me: Tarr's decision to use German actors for two main roles. Lars Rudolph, who plays János, and Fassbinder mainstay Hanna Schygulla as the sinister "auntie Tünde" give physically commanding performances, but they were presumably speaking in German while acting, and Tarr has had them clumsily dubbed into Hungarian, no synchronization between their mouths and the voices.However, if you are interested in auteur cinema, and certainly if you have enjoyed other films by this director, then I would recommend seeing "The Werckmeister Harmonies". There are scenes in this film that will remain with you as long as you live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poetic allegory on the disturbing shadows cast by political systems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you understand the allegory the story snaps into place it becomes a challenge to find the ideas hidden in the shadows.The theme is the eclipse of darkness cast over a people by an occupying government. At the time of this review there is turmoil in Ukraine with many similarities. Many reviewers start with the line that this is about a whale that comes to town, it is like saying Animal Farm is about a fat pig and his friends. Watch the film this way and you will be disappointed.This film is the most visually poetic films I have ever seen. The most powerful shot is the quiet sound of marching and rocking as rioters march to the hospital it is hypnotic and oddly beautiful. You almost become one of the rioters as you get swept up in this pointless crowd-think not knowing or caring where it is going. Social upheaval does not always need a reason. The sick helpless patents in the hospital are a mirror of the rioters themselves.A reoccurring theme is the transitions from darkness to light. In the opening scene the light represent the warm sun of self determination which transitions to the people thrown out through a door in to the dark of night. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. There is a wonderful poetic scene were the lead character walks in and out of the shadows .The film is in b&amp;w.Some of the themes of this film can be extracted in to our modern world. The rioting was similar to the rioting in London which appeared to be of nothing in particular and self-destructive. The whale, parallels large centralised government systems that leave citizens feeling powerless. The shadow of The Prince is the unseen PR machinery and lobby groups. At the end of the film János is drugged and silenced in a mental asylum for political dissidents this could be extended to the large scale use of drugs such as Ritain and SSRI's as well as a mind-numbing media being effective as a form of people management.György's utopian approach to music represents a flawed naive idealism that never can be achieved, it is not developed any further in the film or the book. It is just a statement that human governance will always be flawed. A less cryptic name for the film might be "The Inevitably Flawed Paradox of Human Governance" but that would destroy the enigma that this film is. It is an acknowledgement even when light of self government comes there will still be flaws because we are human.This is much more accessible than Andrei Tarkovsky's Mirror but not quite as rewarding perhaps because it is not so personal.This film reminds me how rewarding a film can be and it stands out from much of the inevitable popcorn that is numbing and drowning us every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And then...complete silence. Everything that lives is still. Are the hills going to march off? Will heaven fall upon is? Will the Earth open under us? We don't know. We don't know for a total eclipse has come upon us.I've often called Béla Tarr a director of the mundane. Not in a bad way ? after all, he's one of my favorite directors ? it's just that the guy can spend ten minutes focusing on a man peeling a potato, or on the back of a man walking down a dark street, or on a group of cows walking across a field. But he's also maybe the most magical director I can think of, both in the way he can find beauty in those mundane events and in creating wondrous, otherworldly moments light years away from the mundane. In Werckmeister Harmonies I count at least three moments of absolute movie magic.The first would be the stunning opening scene, in which our hero János gathers the drunken guests of the local bar and moves them around the dance floor to illustrate the solar system and the concept of an eclipse. Accompanied by Mihály Víg's gorgeous score it's just about the most beautiful thing ever, and it establishes the film's central theme of order and disorder, as well as János' part in it. János takes the disorderly bar room crowd and tries to implement a cosmic order, much like he throughout the film runs errands of various levels of importance for the purpose of either finding personal order in a society that no longer has order, or trying to make the world more orderly, like when he helps his aunt organize a group set out to clean up the town.The second moment takes place when János visits the giant whale that has come to town. Seeing him eye to eye with the beast is a truly fantastic moment. The whale serves many other purposes for the film. In his encounter with the whale, János is revealed to be a man of faith: "A giant whale has arrived. This mysterious creature from the sea has come from the far-off oceans. Most definitely you have to see it too [...] Just see what a gigantic animal the Lord can create! How mysterious is the lord that he amuses himself with such strange creatures." It's a lovely, genuine comment, but it also makes us think, if he sees the arrival and existence of this creature as a sign of god, does he not also blame god for the riots and apocalypse that come with it? Tarr seems to suggest the answer is yes; when the whale first arrives, it casts an ominous shadow ? like an eclipse ? on the town, and in his second encounter with the whale, Janos blames it for the troubles it brought, in effect blaming god's creation.The third work of magic comes when the town seems to have fully entered its state of disorder. The market square is on fire, and during a masterful, silent long take, the citizens raid a hospital, destroying everything and everyone in their path. Until they find a naked old man standing in the shower at the end of the hallway. In what might be the most humane and heartfelt moment I've seen, everyone just stops in their steps and walk out at the sight of the frail old man, as Vig's score emerges to underline the beauty of the scene.I recalled most of Tarr's movies being the mundane things I mentioned before; people walking and eating, but I was surprised to find Werckmeister so thematically rich. In addition to some things I brushed upon I like my friend's idea of the uncle as the artist and János as the viewer. In that light the ending, in János is committed and the uncle relieved of his responsibilities seems to have another layer of irony and cynicism. I'd be lying though if I didn't say Tarr's style was the main draw for me. There's plenty of substance and food for thought here but the stunning black-and-white cinematography, in the uninterrupted long takes, and those walking backs provide the main source of magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of Bella Tarr when I rented this one from the library about a year ago.I'm a fan of most types of film, and I love black and white as well as long contemplative takes.Needless to say, the opening 10 minute sequence in the bar was all it took for me to know I was in for a real treat. Shockingly original cinema from somewhere I wouldn't ever look.In fact, the opening scene had such an effect on me that I watched just that part 3 times before continuing with the rest of the film. The beauty of the images, the music and the way that dude was explaining how animals must feel during a total eclipse of the sun all combined with enough beauty and insight to force a flood of tears from my eyes.If subtitles, long camera shots and/or black and white films are not up your alley, you may want to pass.But if you thirst for something different, something that feels new and ancient at the same time, something that strikes at the melancholy root of humanity with scalpel like precision, then this film is not one to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Werckmeister Harmonies" tells a tale like no other in a way like no one else has ever done before. If you're ready for a very different kind of art, feel free to follow a humble paper boy with the sense for wonder on his rounds. He has a clear picture in mind of what makes the universe tick, a strong belief that everything follows its preordained order, is in eternal harmony, a concept the musicologist he's working for vehemently denies - or at least that man is capable to understand it. Signs and portents already make it clear that the times are achanging, and soon shadows engulf an unnamed town in the middle of nowhere, when a circus arrives with a monstrous fish to be exhibited. And thus the young János sets out to see a whale, but what he'll get is a glimpse of an alienating apocalyptical eclipse happening right before his eyes..."Werckmeister Harmonies" is another highly politically, philosophically, existentially, even religiously charged work, depending which way you want to see it, made by the visionary Hungarian director Béla Tarr. Based on the novel "The Melancholy of Resistance" written by long-time collaborator László Krasznahorkai it is as uncompromising as the original text and Tarr's previous cinematic works, and will bring your attention span to its limits due to its extremely slow, yet sublimely otherworldly pace. As always when Krasznahorkai and Tarr set out on a new project, the action is of profound metaphysical relevance with cosmological principles at war, but nevertheless deeply rooted in social realism, in which one can read Hungarian disenchanted life before and/or after the fall of communism, references to wars and uprisings, to false prophets, fools and opportunists pulling the strings from behind the curtain. What is apparent from the get-go is that the film defies conventions. Stylistically it is nothing less than a revelation, even for Tarr adepts, provided you admit to the created mood. Photography is in striking black and white, all around aesthetically superb essays in motion - and above all perfectly timed, an essential key element in shots that last several minutes. Every scene forms a visual unit in itself, composed meticulously, executed flawlessly, enhanced either by absolute silence, precise sound or Mihály Vig's incomparable melancholic music on the soundtrack. "Werckmeister Harmonies" is much more than a movie, a unique work of art that delves deep and stirs profoundly. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

Though, I would rather watch Stalker (I rated it 10/10) or The Mirror (rated it 10/10) any day over this black and white film.I don't know why make a black and white film in the year 2000? There is no artistic value in depriving a visual media such as film from color. In the same way that painting is generally not done in black and white, film shouldn't be generally done in black and white: color improves the expressiveness. I liked Tarkovsky's employment of black and white and color in different sections of the film, but make a film of over 2 hours of black and white in the year 2000? Please, artistic pretension doesn't equal artistic achievement.Another problem I had with the film were the slightly overlong takes of 3-4 minutes. I like slower paced films, such as Ozu's, but this is simply too much for me.Overall, the film was rewarding but costly and thus represents a work of serious art that deserves respect but I didn't find is the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mob fury, revolt of the masses, against privation and authority</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tells us the story of a riot, as seen through the eyes of an innocent postman, Janos, in an Hungarian town. The cause of the riot is privation and the failure of basic public services. Anger and fury well up among common workmen who come together in a mob that lashes out at the first institution of authority and public recognition that they encounter, which is a hospital. They only calm down when they encounter a helpless naked old man.The movie has no time reference. It could be speaking of the drabness and dreariness and hopelessness under communism, but it also can mean any time or place in which the public institutions and symbols of plenty are failing and their emptiness is realized by masses who think these institutions are beneficent gods and don't realize that everything stems from a complex coordination of their own labors.The authorities reassert themselves in the end with tanks and helicopters, and the aunt of Janos, who is a local figure representing authority and the public welfare, having tried to round up the town's leaders to do something about the misery, again goes hand in hand with the army to reassert authority. The revolt is only that. It's impermanent. Anger lasts but a short time and burns out. Apathy sets in.And this aunt is shown as something of a woman very hard to live with, having been kicked out by her husband.And the authority comes down on poor Janos, who ends up in a hospital. I could only think of how authority has a way of placing dissidents in psychiatric hospitals in order to control them. Authority is blind to distinctions when it's crushing revolt and rebellion.The story is an artistic warning of mayhem ahead when the burdens become too great on the masses and when the power structures fail them. They will lash out barbarously against whatever may be in their path.The masses are the whale, a very large beast that can crush if awakened. The mob collects around such a beast.Tarr is warning us that the basic harmonies of life have been disarranged in striving to reach every harmony by too much authority. It fails. He's certainly saying that this happened in the communist world. The western world is not immune by any means. The innocent like Janos can be chewed up and be viewed as mad or even go mad when the world goes mad around them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day the Circus Came Into Town...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Werckmeister Harmonies" is one of the most challenging films, with the greatest payoff, of any movie I've ever seen. A visually stunning adaptation of László Krasznahorkai's novel "The Melancholy of Resistance", this film tells the story of a sleepy Hungarian village over the course of about a day and a half when the circus rolls into town. With the circus come two main attractions: the body of a giant whale, and a 25-lb circus freak known only as "The Prince". These two attractions have profound, shocking effects on our hero Janos (excellently played by the boyish Lars Rudolph) and the inhabitants of the entire village, if not the entire country.The story presents a powerful allegory, every bit as biting and accusatory as Plato's "Allegory of the Cave", exposing the nature of human folly and the reason why society does, did, and always shall suck. I've found that the people who most enjoy this film are those who are moderately to extremely cynical; it shows us a very dark, nihilistic, nightmarish world similar to what we've seen in the classics "Brazil", Orson Welles' "The Trial" and basically every Herzog film ever made.But what makes this dark film enjoyable to watch is that doesn't just show us that humanity is flawed; it seeks to explain *why* humanity is flawed.I'll warn you up front, this is a very slow moving film with seemingly pointless, indulgent scenes of people silently walking down the street, eating a can of soup, or walking down the street in the opposite direction. Something to bear in mind is, just like in the epic "2001: A Space Odyssey" which has scenes of, say, an astronaut running on a giant hamster wheel for a painfully long time, these scenes are there to convey the monotony of existence. Even beyond that, these scenes are supposed to convey the comfort humans feel with tedious &amp; ritualistic behavior. Order vs. chaos.The second thing that might help is the meaning of the title "Werckmeister Harmonies" which is the key to understanding the film's message. It's explained in a scene near the beginning, but I'll try to explain it in simpler terms here. In western music, we have a particular tuning system for all instruments. This system was developed by Andreas Werckmeister around the year 1700, and centuries later we still use it. The problem is, in a nutshell, it's wrong. Werckmeister's "well tempered" tuning is a compromise that allows instruments to sound good in a variety of keys, but it sacrifices the purity of sounding perfect in any 1 particular key. Pure, "natural" instruments such as the recorder flute sound great but they are limited to 1 key, 7 notes per octave. When western music took on complex instruments like the piano &amp; guitar which play in every key, 12 notes per octave, a certain degree of fudging had to be made in their tuning. This is because in the natural world, the diverse frequencies of music don't add up to neatly repeating 12- note octaves as we want (for some reason we lose about 1/5 of a note every octave). Thus the music we know today, while not necessarily being unpleasant, is not as pure &amp; simple as true "naturally tuned" instruments of yesteryear.How does this relate to the movie? The movie is about humans' need to quantify the unquantifiable, our need to create artificial order that suits us, even though it may be an aberration of nature. If you grasp this idea, along with the metaphor of the Werckmeister tuning, as well as the creative story that unfolds in the film, all augmented with intelligent cinematography, you will adore this film.Congratulations, you have successfully read through the driest &amp; most boring IMDb review I have ever written. I have no doubt that you will enjoy solving the philosophical puzzle of the film "Werckmeister Harmonies".Similar, challenging films include: "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1969), "Aguirre the Wrath of God" (1972), or the more recent Coen brothers' philosophical "A Serious Man", or the brain-blasting Kaufman dark comedy/mindbender "Synecdoche, NY" (2008).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Bela boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't Bela Tarr's biggest fan after viewing The Turin Horse. A film which gathered rave reviews from the art-house crowd, about two of the most boring characters in the universe going about their boring daily business for a very boring week indeed. It made my life look like a thrill a minute! Although The Turin Horse was beautifully shot and magnificently directed, it had absolutely nothing in the way of characters or plot, which in my opinion are two of the most important things to engage an audience. However, I was willing to give Bela another chance. Werckmeister Harmonies was gaining some unbelievable reviews. People were saying that it changed their lives, it moved them to tears and that it was one of the most perfect films they'd ever seen. I put away my Turin Horse prejudices and was actually really looking forward to seeing it! Unfortunately, what I got was more of the same thing.Read any rave review for Werckmeister Harmonies and you won't see anyone commenting on the narrative or plot, they'll instead be commenting on the imagery and score, both of which are admittedly fabulous. I was drawn in from the opening 15 minutes which showed off some incredible camera-work with a 10 minute cut-free sequence explaining the universe with various German drunks. It must've been painstakingly rehearsed and taken an unholy amount of takes with the camera and actors moving around with great precision. I couldn't help but really appreciate this stark opening. And then we had the near-perfect shot of Janos walking down the dark street with a beautifully haunting score playing over it. I was swept in, buckled in and ready for the ride!However, just like The Turin Horse things quickly began to get tedious. The main problem is the characters. They're not exactly infused with life are they? The only thing interesting about the protagonist is his amusing name, Janos. None of the characters have any personality and they don't develop which makes it very difficult to engage with the story. I think it must be a Hungarian thing though, because every Hungarian film I've seen has featured stupidly boring characters. Hungary definitely isn't a place I'd want to visit or make a film about.The other big problem with Werckmeister is that it's quite simply, very boring. I love a long take as much as the next fat person but most of these long takes feel long for the sake of it. I don't need to see people walking for 5 minutes. You may say that it creates atmosphere and if you'd be right, but I'm not particularly keen on an atmosphere of boredom. Werckmeister Harmonies has barely enough plot to fill an 80 minute film, yet Bela decides to stretch it out to two and a half hours. Thank god he was never approached to adapt The Lord of the Rings!Much of the narrative is meandering around very dull characters. At one point Janos' aunty comes with her knickers in a twist about her ex-husband. The whole sequence is very dull and uninteresting, yet it takes up about 40 minutes of the film and adds nothing. At lot of people point towards a political allegory, which personally doesn't interest me at all, however Bela has even said in interviews that he had no political allegory in mind and was just shooting a story about a man meeting a whale. There could've been an interesting story if the most interesting characters weren't skimmed over. The Prince for example seemed like a fascinating fellow, but only his shadow is shown once! Obviously Bela didn't want to give his viewers a heart attack with too much excitement.Werckmeister Harmonies isn't all bad though. Just like The Turin Horse it is beautifully made, with some shots being nothing short of stunning. I must admit that the hospital sequence was also brilliant, even if the reasons behind the characters doing it are a little bemusing. The two scores that feature in the film are also incredible and actually quite moving. I'm not one of these people who cry at Mozart or anything, but I did find the music in this very powerful and it elevated some scenes (especially the hospital scene) wonderfully. For some strange reason I was almost moved to tears at the final scene! Now, I don't know if that was because I was so happy that my ordeal was over, or if the music was so haunting.I don't judge anyone for liking this film. It is undeniably beautiful to look at and directed with mesmerising precision and sometimes this is enough for people! Some of my favourite films put atmosphere first and characters/plot second such as: Eraserhead and more recently, Under the Skin. However, these films are interesting enough to engage me. Nothing about Werckmeister Harmonies interested me so I was never engaged or felt involved with what I was watching. I watched it in complete darkness and on a proper screen too to try and soak up the atmosphere, but I just couldn't feel it. Werckmeister Harmonies disappointed me massively and I've decided to give up on Bela Tarr. I almost fall asleep just thinking about his seven hour magnum-opus, Satantango!

		<shortDescription>test your attention span</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Béla Tarr's "Werckmeister harmóniák" ("Werckmeister Harmonies" in English) is not a movie that I can easily describe. Consisting of only 39 shots, some of them lasting several minutes, it focuses on the strange effects that a circus has on a Hungarian town. Seen through the eyes of one János Valuska (Lars Rudolph), we see the town become almost a different place, particularly in terms of people's relationships.I spent a lot of the movie wondering if it was trying to say something, or if the whale and the Prince were a metaphor. Whether or not it was, or whether or not they were a metaphor, you gotta admire what the makers put into the movie. A lot of the movie is an almost dreamlike state with little dialog or music. This is one movie that really tests your attention span. I understand that Tarr also directed a movie called "Sátántangó" which tests your attention span even more than this one. He says that "A torinói ló" ("The Turin Horse" in English) will be his final movie. I will have to see more of his movies.Also starring Peter Fitz and Hanna Schygulla.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hungarian screenwriter, producer and director Béla Tarr's seventh feature film which he co-directed with Hungarian film editor Ágnes Hranitzky, co-wrote with Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai and produced, is an adaptation of a novel from 1989 called "The Melancholy of Resistance" by László Krasznahorkai. It premiered in Hungary, was screened in the Masters section at the 25th Toronto International Film Festival in 2000, in the Forum section at the 51st Berlin International Film Festival in 2001 and is a Hungary-Italy-Germany-France co-production. It tells the story about a local postman named Janus who lives with his uncle in a Hungarian town where the residents are awaiting the upcoming arrival of a traveling circus which main attractions are a giant whale and a speaking figure called The Prince.Distinctly and precisely directed by Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a moving portrayal of a compassionate man whose faith is challenged when he begins to realize what is actually happening to the human kind he so firmly believes in. While notable for it's distinct milieu depictions, black-and-white cinematography by four cinematographers, production design, long monologues and use of time and sound, this character-driven story which bears a title that refers to a composer and musical theorist from the Baroque era named Andreas Werckmeister (1645-1706), depicts an in-depth study of character and contains a profound score by Hungarian poet, songwriter and composer Mihály Vig.This contemplative, somewhat surreal, existentialistic and heartrending drama which is set in a remote provincial town in Hungary and where a man walks through the streets of his hometown looking for signs that may confirm his believes, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle and distinct continuity, minimal humor, opening scene which is a striking example of the art of cinema, rare characters, atmosphere which becomes a character in itself and the brilliantly understated acting performance by German actor Lars Rudolph who expresses a wide range of emotions with his mysterious face. A cinematic, austere, incisive and humane mystery from the early 2000s by an accomplished and characteristic European filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werckmeister Harmóniák: Infinitely and Instantly Captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werckmeister Harmóniák is an interesting case. Like much of Bela Tarr's work, it comes enshrouded with a controversy in its native Hungary, its release considered difficult due to its political commentary.The simple plot, in line with the director's belief in the minimalisation of storyline, offers us a Hungarian village suspicious of a circus boasting a stuffed whale and a rebellious orator, known only as "The Prince". Happening upon this film just as it begun late one night on television, I was drawn into the wonders of the strange and mysterious film. I was instantly mesmerised and captured by the opening scene. The music, described almost unanimously as "hauntingly beautiful", plays no small part in this ensnaring effect. There is something deeply mysterious in this strange scene, Mihály Víg's incredible score mixing with the disharmonious movements of the drunken villagers as they, like the viewer, are drawn into the effulgence and mystique of our main character, Janós Valuska's explanation of our solar system, and the apocryphal beauty of the solar eclipse. Infinitely and instantly captivating, this scene sets the tone for the film, the concepts of doom and beauty, and their potential for intermingling, explored in incredible fashion by Tarr's camera work, and the fluidity of his direction. Quite simply, Werckmeister Harmóniák is a deeply beautiful and often moving film, many of its scenes steeped in mystery and allegorical explorations of themes, particularly the nature of humanity. Encompassed within the film is the most strangely evocative scene I have had the privilege of witnessing, the expatiation of which I shall refrain from to avoid spoiling its poignancy and striking power.My first viewing of the film, the accidental coincidence of its appearance on television and my watching, fascinated me sufficiently to facilitate its immediate purchase, and the subsequent purchase of Tarr's entire catalogue. It is a film I openly admit to not fully understanding, a factor I greatly appreciate, further viewings now made all the more anticipated and the opportunities for such eagerly awaited. Inexpressibly recommended to anybody open minded enough to not frown at the prospect of a 145 minute black and white Hungarian film, Werckmeister Harmóniák may well be the finest film I have yet seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truck is crossing the street!!!!!!! Oh my God, watch it before you die !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A circus attraction and a mysterious prince arrive very very (but very very!) slowly to a village where it is cold and the inhabitants are afraid of something. That's what you notice while you see how a very common sad guy commonly and sadly walks, commonly and sadly wanders, commonly and sadly eats, commonly and sadly works. He commonly and sadly looks after an old guy who is obsessed with the musical tempered systems that try to imitate the celestial harmonies: so hopefully, he says, all the tunings should be just, otherwise the Bach preludes sound badly, and blah, blah, blah.... That's the cultural stuff Bela Tarr found some day so he could use it in a new movie and look profound and exquisite. Because, if he finds that subject truly amazing, why does he use such an stupid piano new-age music for the first scene, that repulsive description of an eclipse with fake drunkards, so pedantic? Beeeeeeghhhhrpl.Apart from that evident evidence, Tarr shows you everything very slowly (unbereable the scene when the truck crosses a big street, at 5km/h). But that slowness has no justification: it is the exact mirror of the stupid American action movies ("Gladiator", "Transporter"...) that show you everything very very fast so you can have the feeling of "frenetic action", which is what it's "really cool", oh yeah! These slow movies are also done to make the director and the believers feel that same feeling: "we are slow, we are really cool!, oh yeah!, amen!". Because in this movie there is no reason for slowness: there are no details, the story doesn't change, the characters are uninteresting and are never seen in a different way during the film, there is no sense of humour... "I'm slow, so I'm special", that's all.It's in b/w and some people say it has a dream-like atmosphere. I think that in dreams the events don't happen so slowly, we don't need to dream every second that we are eating in the dream, or walking, and there is a kind of brutal presence of the unexpected, of elements that break the "artistic direction" of the dream, something that Mr.Tarr will surely not find "cool" enough.I didn't like it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciate the previous review explaining the movie's similarities to Buddhist emptiness and discussing Mizoguchi's influences but the incredibly slow pace of the movie and incredibly long takes made me press the FF button of my DVD player and believe me it happens extremely rarely. There are many other excellent artistic movies with a slow pace e.g. Institute Benjamenta but their "magic" makes us watch them with constant interest. OK, there is a rhythm in the Wreckmeister's long takes and there is a visual magnetism of black and white presentation of a poor little town but the monotonous film lasts for much too long- much too long- much too long- (and so on for 141 minutes). Well, no to be totally critical, there is a clear advantage of such movie structure- you can safely take a toilet break or bring a cup of tea from your kitchen and when you are back... they are still walking (and walking, and walking).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaze into the wonder of it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In modern cities, we're bombarded by sounds and images all the time, creating over-stimulation. As a result, we can't feel very strongly about any one thing we see. Werckmeister Harmonies takes place in a small Hungarian town, where not much ordinarily happens. The citizens are under-stimulated, and as a result, have the sacred ability to be moved to the core by small things. Bela Tarr wants us to be able to experience this with the townsfolk, and goes through great pains to do so. The film is made up of only 39 shots, each one spanning at least several minutes. As with Satantango, they chronicle the monotony of village life: long dreary walks, manually heating up water, the unhurried conversation.While I wouldn't say I found every moment of Werckmeister Harmonies riveting (perhaps the non-city dweller may fare better), I can easily say I did myself a favor by watching it. First of all, the imagery: Bela Tarr captures some of the most enchanting and unique images you'll ever see on film. The ambitious art direction and cinematography are perfectly realized, and the skill and artistry in the single-take scenes found here is astounding.The film's simple but beautiful soundtrack works well, and Tarr combines it masterfully with his imagery, creating a lot of memorable and powerful moments.My only complaint is that Bela Tarr hasn't mastered dialog to the extent that his predecessors have. Some of the dialog-driven scenes feel a bit stale, and serve to work against the wondrous tone that he painstakingly creates. But all is forgiven when the dialog fades and he is able to focus on poetic expression through imagery. Who else can make a circling helicopter appear so organic, and so strange?Also recommended: Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice and Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story sounds interesting enough. I may go check out the original novel and read. But this film.. It's so incredibly, Painfully SLOW. All I can say about this film is, if it was 100 min. long (instead of 145), perhaps I would be willing to give 8 or something. Usually I can enjoy most so-called artsy crafty films, but this time the style feels unreasonable and unjustifiable. For example, when two guys just walk to the next block without uttering a word, the director spends 2 minutes shooting this remarkable adventure. The director simply turned a promising concept into a torture (for most moviegoers, I am positive). After seeing this, I'd bet you realize the virtue of Hollywood's fast-paced style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is slow, it does take time, it does take patience. However, the pay-off is worth it. I felt at times, in a couple of moments, that the film could have been improved by cutting back on the time given to a shot, without compromising the integrity of the idea. However, this is not my film, and I must say that I came away with a feeling of deep inspiration and admiration, that such a project is still possible in this day and age. For those who are fans of Felinni, Antonionni or Bergman, you will find something here - I am not saying that the film is like the work of any of those filmmakers, but you will see certain similarities which will move you equally.Do take the time to watch it, but be prepared to concentrate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing modernism, but yeah, beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept thinking how it was a little surprising to see such a movie made in 2000. It reminded me, more than anything else, of Kafka or Dadaism; it was a story I would have expected to see written 80+ years ago. The Macbethish unleashing of unnatural horror by peering too deeply into or disturbing the natural realm (the uncle's microtonal explorations on the piano) forms a context for exploring fears of mass behavior and nihilistic demagogues during hard times, materialist disregard for divine mystery, etc. Not that those are bad things to talk about, but they just struck me as old news. I felt like a dumb American afterwards, scratching my head and saying "I guess it still sucks to live in Hungary these days?" Despite all this, or maybe because of how it's presented, the film is still beautiful, and very enjoyable if you like strange rides. I thought the absurdist elements were more prominent than did the previous reviewer, but to me this did not clash with the solemn beauty of it all. Still, let it be said that this movie takes you down a dark road and then leaves you there, an artistic idiom that may be a natural emotional reaction to modern horrors, but which now seems overused and philosophically outdated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD, put out by Facets Video, is a good one, qualitatively. But, it is utterly bare bones: no commentary, no trailer, no featurettes. Its only 'extra' is a small booklet with essays on Tarr and the specific film, However, when a film is this great, it doesn't really matter. The sound quality is very good, and the film is in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. There is one BIG negative, though, and that is the white subtitling Facets employs. I've often ripped on titles from The Criterion Collection for this flaw, but this particular Facets DVD is even worse, for not only are the subtitles white, but very thin. Also, there are several scenes where the extreme white in the cinematography (excellent by Medvigy Gábor, and supposedly composed of less than 40 actual shots in the film- claims range from 33-39, which, according to legend, allowed Tarr to edit the film in less than a day) almost totally blanches out what one can read. What the hell is wrong with the folks in the subtitles department? Is it too damned much to add a bit of gold, or even some black trim about the subtitles so that they can actually be read? It's bad enough DVD companies skimp on English language dubs, but illegible subtitles? The score (piano and violin), by Míhaly Vig, who played Irimias in Satantango, is spare, but highly effective, as any scoring should be, and its likely the best in the Tarr films I've seen, adding to the reality that this film is the most emotional of the films, as well. Some critics, however, have taken issue with the film's scoring, claiming that the film argues that music is an immanently flawed vehicle to base any sort of foundation upon, thus the film's score is at odds with its artistic claim. But, this is clearly wrong, since the film does not argue that music is immanently flawed, just one of its characters does- Eszter.Another error that many critics have made is calling Werckmeister Harmonies a minimalist film. It is not. It's amazing how many critical notions in art and life are flawed simply due to the critic's inability to understand the definitions of the very terms they use. Minimalism is when a work of art is reduced to its barest minimum- i.e.- some of the Absurdist plays of a Samuel Beckett, or some scenes in George Lucas's THX 1138 or some films of Carl Theodor Dreyer, come to mind. These critics conflate mere economy with strict minimalism, but there's a world of difference. Minimalism is not just a spare setting, but that spare setting with a singular focus, a character or two, and brevity in action. Economy can have multiple characters, themes, and plot points, but be told in broad, singular strokes. This far more fits the description of a Tarr film, including this one. The film is not larded down with symbolism, but the few moments of such are ripened and potent. The scenes with the whale, never seen in its entirety, when seen by Janos, but only in the final scene, with Eszter, is a good example; for when we see what has so enraptured Janos, in the daylight, it is not nearly as mysterious nor awe inspiring as when we see only glimpses of it in shadow. To paraphrase, the elephant that the seven blind men feel, in the old parable, will always be more interesting and exciting than if they could see the real beast. Werckmeister Harmonies is not minimalist; in fact, it's the exact opposite, it's loaded with meaning, detail, and subtlety. And the elephant also hearkens back to the ending of Federico Fellini's masterful La Dolce Vita, and its ending with the discovery of a manta ray's corpse, and its all seeing eye.Despite many of the critical misreadings, Werckmeister Harmonies is a truly great film; audacious in its depiction of reality, however askew, and even bolder in its plumb of human consciousness; especially in its relationship to things greater than the self. That it does not lay out all its cards on the table for immediate perusal is not a weakness, but a strength, in that it invites rewatches. If all films offered only a quarter of what this film does, cinema would be far better for it. But, when given a rare full plate, like this, it's OK to gorge between the famines. Grace is optional.</fullReview>

But there is plenty more in there to be discovered.What is it about? I guess its about the sadness and isolation that sensitive and artistic Eastern European men feel when they look at their less refined brethren and the political and social history in which they participate. It is their disappointment that the universe does not reflect the beauty that they see in themselves and their relationship with the cosmos. A very self indulgent lot...

		<fullReview>OK,since this is indeed a very unique and profound movie, I have got a lot to say about it. The first part of the movie is simply brilliant. Each scene is perfectly edited and the transition is flawless. The music at the beginning of the movie when the village drunks stood in a stupor is one of the most haunting melody I have ever heard, and it fit perfectly with the mood of the movie. My first viewing tells me that the part where an old man in a chair is talking about music and philosophy does not make any sense and should be cut, but my second viewing totally changed my opinion. It is a brilliant talk on the musical harmony and its relation to philosophy if you pay close attention to it. Of course one of the most moving scenes in this movie is the protagonist returning to his dilapidated home and cooking a very simply meal. I don't why but it speaks a lot to me. I wish there were more scenes like that that are down-to-earth and profound at the same time. As the movie gets to the second half, it starts to lose some of its potential and directions. The scene where the villagers lose control and start to march into the town to cause destructions is unjustifiably long. The hospital scene did not move me as it did to most viewers. I felt that the second half of the film kind of distances itself from the viewers and lose its accessibility. I understand the director strictly follows "art for art's sake," but the audience is also part of film-watching experience and should not be completely ignored.</fullReview>

So please don't tell me that this is supposed to be more philosophical than, say, Pascal.I don't mean to invite people not to go this this movie. I don't regret having seen it and I do intend to go see Satantango, which is now playing in Paris, and seems much more promising.I only want to say that it's really a dull film, even if you like slow, intellectual, maybe complicated movies (as do I).</fullReview>

Alas, the only reasonably accurate appraisal I've read of this dreary drek was the capsule review in "Time Out New York," a magazine that for my money nearly always hits the target right on with a minimum of words and pretentiousness when it comes to movies (forget the other reviews). This movie is strictly for hairshirt sadomasochists and those under heavy sedation. True, the scenes, each a long long chunk of real time, are evocative, conjuring associations and possible meanings; but the pay-off never comes. By the end the associations and possible meanings have evaporated, never coalesce, leaving one with the undeniable feeling of having been sucked in by the big monster Art. The apocalypse never comes, the sun never re-emerges after the eclipse; Jonah never learns his lesson inside the whale's belly; the Kafkaesque funhouse turns out to be a sham; there's only darkness, a dour prediction of human history we've heard countless times before, esp. from Eastern Europeans, who seem to relish their bitter misery and are only too eager to pass it on to the world.</fullReview>
