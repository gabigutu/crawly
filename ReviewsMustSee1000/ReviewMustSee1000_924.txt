		<shortDescription>Painfully realistic, great action and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen a crime movie with action more realistic than that in Brat. This movie emphasizes that when you get shot you can't run as fast as a cheetah unlike the Hollywood films even today. It was a breakthrough picture for Russia's film-making and, in my opinion, a picture that could take on most of American movies of the same or similar genre. You wanna see the way things were done in Russia five years ago? You wanna see cruel reality? You want to see the real criminal side of Russia? See Brat. It isn't only an amazing movie because it is so realistic, the acting is awesome and you won't get bored for sure. Brat 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a piece of Russia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were in S.Petersburgh in the early nineties, you feel this movie has been able to grab a cubic meter of air of the city at that time, pack it, and give it to its viewers to breathe. The effect is physical. I can feel the smell of the wet dusty roads, the moulded no man's land of stairways in post soviet blocks of flats and much more. Apart from this high accuracy in physical sensation, the movie is multi-layered (you can watch in it a "boevik" action movie, a social analysis of the period, even a Dostoevki-like study on the value of brotherhood and after all, a unique picture of what Russia is, was, and will be. Those who can enjoy it in original will find some tasty bits of Russian irony and humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, but necessarily so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a blockbuster hit in Russia, for many reasons that international viewers might not understand. "Brother" is a film that speaks directly to Russians (especially the urban population) about the time period directly following the fall of the Soviet Union. This was a lawless time, full of uncertainty about everything including whether your life would be ended by a random criminal on the street. It also suggests the Russian disillusionment with the Chechen War (well, the first one of the 1990s).Balabanov has created an intense crime drama that attempts to answer Dostoyevsky's "eternal question": what does one do in a lawless society? Danila, the hero, has lost his innocence during the war in Chechnya. In this way he really represents all of Russia in that he has lost his heritage and his identity, and now must make his way in the new Russia. Like many others at the time, Danila turns to crime in order to survive.The most heart-wrenching thing about "Brother" is that it has an incredible likeness to the reality of life in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s. Though on the surface it seems to be full of senseless violence, Danila's search for identity (that mirrors Russia's) calls for an honest picture of the hard life of the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, gritty....very modern Russian. Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It was a gangster crime movie, but in a totally different style than most American films. There was a good story and great visuals of Russia. I liked the fact that not everything had to be explained to the audience. The director assumed that we were able to think for ourselves, i.e.; the lead character's 'true' past in the army. I don't believe that he was "just a clerk at HQ". I saw the DVD version, and watched the interview with the director. The film is even more amazing considering the shoestring budget. He got his friends to perform some of the acting roles as well as write and play the music (which was quite good). This is a great gritty film. Its one of the more watchable movies from Russia that I have seen. I gave it a 7 out of 10. I plan to see 'Prisoner of the Mountain' next, can't wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a crime drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that some other reviewers failed to comment on is the way that you discover just who Danila is - he covers-up the fact that he saw action in Chechnya and always says he served far from combat. This story is really about the Russian crime situation LESS than about an entire generation of people who served in Afghanistan and Chechnya ('94-'96 and '99-present). This movie will be misunderstood by many Westerners (I am Russian myself) because it does not fit the traditional Hollywood screenplay style - and its characters do not behave themselves like most Hollywood characters would in a crime drama. There is a very Slavic quality in this film that I am VERY happy to see preserved and NOT Westernized. (You must see Brat2 to learn more about Brat.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dunno about great, but it's definitely a DIFFERENT Russian movie. A demobilized conscript turned hitman on the backdrop of new capitalist Russia and the music "progressive-rock" group Nautilus Pompilius. Product of the war in Chechnya Danila Bogrov is a young man who knows how to kill and practically nothing else, his relations with people he does not have to kill are the most difficult ones for him. There is a lot of violence but it happens either outside the screen or almost outside, here Brat reminds me of Fireworks by Takeshi Kitano. Good Stanislavsky school of acting so visible in old Soveit movies in this one does not exist (save maybe Kuznetsov) but camerawork is rather impressive. I'm not sure I like this movie but definitely it does not suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great Russian movie, made in a post-soviet Russia, which is looking for a new identity. It is new style Russian cinema, cheaply made due to lack of money, but therefore it has a very genuine feel of it. The story of Daniil that becomes more and more violent than his - already gruesome - brother, is very compelling and horrible at the same time. If you want to begin with a modern Russian movie, rent this one, it has that 'old ultra-violence' thing. It will definitely blow off your socks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie with alot of violence. Throughout the movie there are long stretches of Danila making explosives, sawing off a shot gun, and fashioning weapons, with Nau music playing. The rest of the movie consists mainly of him using these weapons at his job as a hitman. Make no mistake, there is depth to this film. It is more than an excuse to show violence.Danila is an interesting character. At the ame time he blows away people regularly with no remorse and little thought. Its his job, may as well do it well. I watched this as part of a film series at college in the original Russian, and the group of Russians sitting behind me laughed at many points. The laughter confused me a bit, but the second time I saw it was pretty funny, and not in the usual one liner sense of action movies. I especially liked the part where Danila asks if he can copy the director?s Nau CD.I highly recommend this film for people who either like random violence or can tolerate it for the sake of an interesting plot. The film has a distinctive feel to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will be marinated in Russian-ness after watching this gritty crime drama shot in St. Petersburg. Set in the early 1990s after the fall of Soviet communism, it's a movie whose co-star is the place. The crime and gunplay in the foreground, which cropped up after the collapse of stern authority, seems to perfectly match what we see in the background -- trash-strewn streets, grimy flats, drug-fueled nightclubs. Everyone is poor or barely getting by. Even the gangsters, who you'd think would have some Scarface-type perks, seem to live in squalor.One thing that will instantly strike you is how everyone in the movie looks like someone you know, not a Hollywood star. I want to call particular attention to Svetlana Pismichenko, the film's love interest, who plays the driver of a streetcar that hauls lumber (?). She's not pretty at all, but you see the love she is capable of and, all I can say is I wish she were my girlfriend. Her last scene is one of the most memorable portraits of heartbreak I have ever seen. She has incredible eyes.Sergei Bodrov plays the lead, a soldier just back from Chechnya who is drawn into his brother's gangland activities. We never see a flashback of what happened over there and, when asked by others in the film what he did, grins and said he was a clerk in HQ. As we come to see the fearlessness and ruthlessness he is capable of, it is obvious he is lying. This man is steel tempered in a furnace. His gangster enemies are no match for a man with his willingness to prepare for and face death.I've never been to Russia, but I lived in the Czech Republic for three years and I can testify to the authenticity of this movie's backdrop. When the Iron Curtain fell, it revealed decaying rust belt cities, but also a tough-minded population of attractive and spirited people who, somehow, found ways to be happy in tough times. I am American and half Polish, and this movie made me proud to be a Slav.A scene in the movie is a homage to Russian good cheer. It is a party in a Russian flat where a few dozen people are chatting, eating, smoking pot, drinking vodka, singing along to a guitar, shooting pool and having fun. They're all young people in their 20's. You'll wish you were at that party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personal and cultural connections in "Brat"--- Note: this contains possible spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the film "Brat", themes surrounding relationships and family take on broader meanings in Russian culture. The main character, Danila, returns to visit his brother Viktor at his mother's insistence. The relationship between the brothers is unlike what one would expect; Viktor even betrays Danila at one point. Danila does not make a real connection with anyone; by the end he has severed ties with everyone he had met. Interestingly, his actions form a parallel to Russia's attempts to leave behind the past and hint at possible attitudes toward other cultures.The title "Brother" itself indicates that the relationship between the brothers is the most important in the film. Viktor was much like a father to Danila in the past, indicating that their relationship, while always close, had changed over the years. Viktor's character represents the past: he is successful only because of his criminal dealings, as many were during the Soviet days. Danila is pulled into these dealings of the past because he has no other direction, just as the present Russia was still unsure of where it was going. The past is well known and understood, even if it is not the best course of action. Danila kills other gangsters, who are clearly part of this past world: he operates within the system in order to destroy it. In many instances he must kill these individuals out of defense, just as certain aspects of the old Soviet culture had to be destroyed or they would ruin the new way of life Even Sveta's situation represents the past. Danila tries to free her from her abusive relationship, yet she is disgusted with the way he tries to help her. Similarly, many people might not be willing to kill off or sever ties with the past; it is the only life they have known.Other people who Danila meets are similarly different forces acting on the culture; some of them could stand for foreign influences in Russia. The girl Ket exemplifies Western culture, particularly America: she likes to party and eat McDonalds. Ket's obsession with money also depicts the stereotypical American perspective. Danila eventually breaks off connection with her, giving her some money before leaving her. This attitude illustrates the fact that while the new Russia is open to the far western influence of America, the people do not necessarily want to accept this culture, nor is it a good idea for them to do so if they wish to maintain their own identity. Danila's relation to the German represents the general Russian relation to this western European country. Russia's relations with Germany have occasionally been somewhat tense, and the character points out "what is good for the Russian is death for the German." The German refuses the money that Danila offers him in the end, perhaps a statement that Germany (or maybe Europe in general) has no tolerance for the morally corrupt way of the old Soviet Union. Indeed, Danila brings the bodies to the graveyard where the German and others stay, urging him to give them a decent burial. It seems that the new Russia wants other Europeans to figuratively bury the past, and can not necessarily accomplish this task alone. However, the fact that Danila breaks off ties with the German shows a desire for Russia to deal with the past in its own way. Whether or not this will lead to trouble in the future is uncertain. Yet it seems that Danila is entirely capable of dealing with these problems on his own, even though the means by which he does so is not ideal in most eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While "Brat" may be a crackerjack crime drama, it is an ever better view of life in post-Soviet Russia. Mafiyas, consumerism, crumbling apartments, pretty young coke addicts, idiot American tourists who can't speak a word of Russian, ancient Volga Germans living in graveyards, crappy Russian art-rock bands, whacks after whacks after whacks...in the center of this is Danila, a Chechen War veteran whose endless violence is married to a childlike mien. This former Spetsnaznik is sent to St. Petersburg by his baggy mother to live with his John Malkovitch-like brother. She doesn't know he is a wannabe mobster, and Danila gets involved in a way of life more dangerious than the war. An interesting companion to the Moscow-based expat rag "the eXile."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic and bleak portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't understand why would anybody compare this movie with Tarantino's drivel. This is a realistic and bleak portrayal of post-communist Russia, before Putin's ascend to power. Desperate times usually bring the worst in people, and Russia in early 90's is no exception. The rigid communist structure collapsed and nothing replaced it for some time. The vacuum was filled with gangsters and thugs of all kinds. This is the time when young Danilo ( excellent late Sergei Bodrov) comes to St. Petersburg to find his fortune. He has a twisted code of morality, and at least in the beginning, he preys only on the bad guys.The bleakness of average people's lives in those harsh times is heartbreaking, and this movie is brilliant in that regard. This is not fake show-off like "Pulp Fiction", this is a slice of real life horrors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic movie about criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had a similar lawless period in Bulgaria (the closest satellite to ex-USSR), so I believe that the film is fully correct in this aspect. More important, however, is that of the thousands of films about crimes and criminals, only a few are more or less realistic; my work is closely related to the judicial system, so I know what I'm talking about. Even the real-crime TV shows lie somewhat, their cases carefully selected - always fully resolved, always black and white. For that, and for that alone, Brother deserves a 10/10.Note that in Russia, "kavkazian" (caucasian) stands for immigrants from the southern ex-USSR republics, mostly muslims, a fair share of them involved in criminal activities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broken ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sad story about Russo-Chechen war and post-perestroika time. In fact, the war was not demonstrated, just referred. Young Danila (dim. from Danil/Daniil) returned from war with plainly simple perception: "killing can solve the problem" without even realising that it will cause other problems.Other aspects of ethics are fragmentarily gathered from official honesty, modesty, labour valour of soviet times and practical slyness and insubordination of soviet times. Add brotherhood here.And with this fragmented ethics and credo he encounters criminal world of Russia in 199x.Highly probably other cultures would not understand these inner Russian problems, as I did not understand problems of Columbia in Márquez's «Cien a?os de soledad». And the film really was not destined for outer world.Many people believe that Danila could be an etalon of purity and the right decisions about criminals (kind of Robin Hood's romantics for spectators). I suppose that those people are angry at life without possibility to change it, therefore saluting ultimate methods of J. Stalin.Personally, I think it's about broken youth of these war boys that made them not quite social, though honest.For those who did not understand it yet, Sveta pronounces this key-problem in plain Russian, at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is what makes BRAT real masterpiece of the film-making - it looks real to the last shot. Every moment is a true history of Post Soviet Russia. Even Ukraine was of that kind. We are kinda different now but not in 1990's. All the atmosphere is real - I was not very adult then but I remember everything of the 1990's clearly - I was 17 when the movie was made and this movie was a call of reality for everyone here. You don't have to say it is impossible - we had people killed like that... Sergey Bodrov is a good actor and all the actors in the movie are great. The music of Nautilus makes the atmosphere of being there just at the moment of the story development. This band was on the top of it's popularity at the moment of the middle 1990's. There are a lot of people here allover the Post Soviet places who are fans of the band.Any way - this movie is about some real aspects of real Post Soviet history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brother review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danila is a prime example of a young Russian who has been tainted by war; but he also represents hope for post-Soviet Russia. In many reviews he is described as a 'cold blooded killer' and as 'showing no remorse'- which is sometimes true, however he is so honest and good at the same time. He never once in the movie betrays a promise, and he helps anyone in trouble that crosses his path. Although he seems to find it easy shooting and killing other mafia killers, he puts himself in the 'hero' role on the streets: protecting innocent people from harm such as the German and the ticket collector on the bus.His taste in music reflects aspects of his personality- his disdain for American and European dance music mirrors his views on these countries, and how the army has built in an unnecessary, unreasonable bitterness for certain types of people (i.e. Jews)into his mind, without him really understanding why he feels this way. He says 'whats the difference?' when referring to Jews and Germans, and Americans and French people- showing his lack of real experience with people of these nations, and thus his ignorance.His relationship with the battered wife, I think, represents his need to do good, perhaps out of guilt for all the wrong he has done. The casting of her as a blatantly unattractive woman who is much older than Danila and who's character has absolutely nothing in common with him is important: in front of him is not a woman he is in love with, but someone who is in dire need of a hero, and of something positive in her life. Thus he does his best to make her happy, only failing (in my view) because the relationship is not real- the passion isn't really there.Unlike most people, i enjoyed Brother more than the sequel to it- it is understated, but says a lot about society and about relationships. There is so much to say about it, yet so little time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music saves Danila more than once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Brother, the hero, Danila, has two different sides to his personality: his creative, peaceful inner life that comes with his music versus his desire to get more powerful, making more money by killing, and climbing the ladder of success with rapid steps. Danila loves music very much. Music is like a gateway to his inner peaceful life. He buys new CDs and keeps listening them on his compact disc player when is strolling around the streets of St. Petersburg. We listen to the songs that he listens to, and we can sometimes understand the mood of the moment. Also Danila does not act selfish when he gets money in his hands, even though he worked hard to earn it by risking his life and killing people. However he is not selfish and shares the money he gets with his friends, and especially the two women in the movie Sveta and Kat is concerned he does not hesitate to share his money with them. He wants Sveta to enjoy his music hoping that she would be able to share his inner life. He buys a VCR and together with Sveta they watch some music clips.Throughout the movie Danila gets richer and more comfortable with the city. He keeps buying more CDs to listen to, and we see him walking around the city more and more. One time while he was listening to music and strolling, a man comes out from the corner and shoots Danila, at the same time Danila shoots him. Both of them get hit, the assassin dies, but Danila was hit on compact disc player which breaks down, but Danila is unharmed. This is actually an important event in the movie. The breaking of the compact disc player would mean that Danila would no longer be able to listen to music. Yet for one last time the music literally protects him. Further more, he would not be able to get in touch with his inner life, and he does not get another compact disc player. Also, from another point of view, this event could be considered as the end of Danila's peaceful inner life. It could be interpreted that the city has weakened him, and took away some part of him, although he might be still powerful with a shotgun, and with his skills. He thinks there is more action, more money and more power in Moscow, so he is going there.</fullReview>

I remember my elder brother telling me to give it a try sometime around 2000, but it took me a further 15 years to get round to doing that.'Brat' has so much to offer in its 100 minutes of running time that it leaves a viewer breathless. An incredible portrayal of a Russia that is no more, excellent acting, a few rare moments of very dark (and very funny) Russian humour, fascinating drab landscapes of late-1990s Saint Petersburg, some of the best use of music I've ever seen in any film and a perfect ending. And lots, lots to think about once the closing credits start rolling.It's like a Russian response to 'The Godfather', made with a budget of $10,000. What an unforgettable film.

		<shortDescription>Allegorical THawing Russian Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance Brat, (Brother), comes across as a grim and humorless portrayal of post-Cold War Russia, but beneath the surface it is a strong critique of the dangerous wounded animal that the country has become: mass poverty, crime, alienation of the youth and failing family structure all act as dramatic catalysts in the system, adding to the problems and attitudes of 1990s Russia. Our vantage point revolves around the young Danila and follows through with his reintroduction to life outside the military, into the city. Although Danila is surrounded by the gloom and doom of the Communist aftermath where social structures are collapsing into near anarchy, he remains an allegorical symbol of the state of Russia's acute sense of right and wrong and offers hope for a brighter future and some semblance of a moral code.In St. Petersburg Viktor is successful, but we find that it is at being a hit-man for the Russian mafia, which is also making him paranoid. After tying up Dani in a scheme to take out a competitive Chechen mob boss in his stead while simultaneously usurping the Russians, Dani is now in over his head with the mob, and becomes a killer. Meanwhile each character Danila meets represents a different aspect of Russian culture and institutional disillusionment. He begins with Kat, a disaffected youth who only cares for him only for the money he has to buy acid and go raving. Later in the film, Dani goes out with Kat to do just that, and finds himself at a house party telling fellow inebriated foreigners, "Soon all of your America will kick the bucket!" When Kat tells him to stop badgering them because they're French, he replies with "It's all the same." Clearly, there is no thawing of Western resentment, even in the youth, daily indoctrinated by their seniors. It is only when Russians seek to find their own identity, not to emulate the capitalist West as Yeltsin's failed attempt of economic shock therapy sought to do, that there is a renewed sense of nationalistic pride. We see this again when two American tourists ask Danila for directions to a nearby club and he is disapprovingly silent. Danila's moral compass takes on some unorthodox manifestations as is not unlike the general occurrences of the city. On a public bus, a ticket-taker asks two men to either supply a ticket or provide the fee. As they disrespectfully hassle the official to leave them alone, Dani makes them pay at gunpoint. Here the impoverished Dani has the chance to take all of the contents of the man's wallet, which contains much more than the $7 fee, but he takes only the fee amount and tells them to beat it. Shortly after, a thug is hassling a street trinket-seller for "taxes" and threatens to take his goods. Danila swiftly knocks the thug out and makes friends with the man named Nemets, a homeless German. When his nationality comes up later, Danila says he has no problems with Germans, only Americans and Jews (Westerners). Nemets remains Danila's kindest friend throughout, and moral anchor, constantly supplying the wisdom of the film. Ironically, the most foolish character is the Russian Mob boss, who speaks in rhyming proverbs, but is driven by greed and power. Another disillusionment comes in the form of a brief love interest named Sveta, whose husband is an abusive drunk. This failing family mirrors the situation all over the city, as Nemets so sagely says, "The city is an evil force. The strong come and become feeble. The city takes the strength away. And now you've fallen." Even Dani's bitter old landlord speaks to everyone threateningly as though it is still WWII unless he is intoxicated. Nemets' words weigh heavily on Danila. In the climax moment when his brother (unbeknownst to Dani) has him cover his position in a heist suspected to be a trap, some innocent people get mixed up in the hit, one of them being the frontman of his favorite band. Danila makes a promise to save an innocent and turns on the two mob thugs when they finish their hit and start killing the witnesses.Danila has come to a realisation that his life is becoming the very substance he is fighting against, but that is not the end of his criminal lifestyle. The mob learns of this and take his brother in for beating and questioning. Then they discover Danila's address and rape and beat Sveta while he is away. Dani gets prepared to liberate the community of the mob and rescue his brother simultaneously. As he is made known to the front guard, in an act of mercy he gives him his word to spare his life if he remains quiet, which he follows up with after killing the rest of the gangsters. As Danila makes amends with the ultimate betrayal (his brother's) he takes the mob money and seeks to say goodbye to each of his acquaintances, to which he offers the only reparation he knows--money. Sveta has lost interest and seeks to reunite with her estranged husband, Kat passively accepts Dani's farewell and cash and Nemet follows up with his words of wisdom once more, "what's good for the Russian is death for the German," a message contrary to his earlier mantra.Brother was Russia's big contemporary crime thriller. But besides being a low-budget blockbuster, it carries an important story of the resurfacing of morals in a fallen world, serving as a message for its Russian audience. The film ends with Danila hitching a ride to Moscow in a red (Russian) truck amidst the white backdrop of a road and forest blanketed with snow, symbolising the new beginning for Russia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a picture of 90s. Unlike latest post-Soviet never-ending dumb movies and serials about "brigades", "bratki" and the same garbage, "Brat" is more or less realistic. Of course, I mean the spirit of those times, not that everyone had gun and shot bad guys on the streets. The feeling of hopelessness and deadlock. Freaks, poverty, "new Russians", former intelligentsia who had to stand on the streets or markets and sell all kinds of things - all that really happened in 90s. And "Brother" reflects that quite true. Bodrov (R.I.P.) is right for his character. Also there is no romanticizing of criminals, no stupid "cop"-propaganda (we can see the both clichés in the above mentioned modern Russian potboilers)? just a piece of a contemporary's life even though it is obvious grotesque. Weak point: some episodes are too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorial to Russia's anarchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A memorial to Russia's anarchy during the late president Yeltsin times, shot in sepia colors, just like some other Balabanov movies. The film is focusing on the simple Russian lad (played by late Bodrov-Jr.) who's just got demobilized from the army. Everything's new to him in the big city of St. Petersburg where he comes to see his hit-man brother: Russian cult band Nautilus, mores of the new Russia, hectic imitation of the Western lifestyle, foreigners, drugs, and even the new Russian slang. He cannot tell the difference between English and French, doesn't like Jews and filmmakers. He tells everybody he was just a scribe at the headquarters, but definitely lies, demonstrating brilliant skills of a hit-man, quite surpassing those of his older ne'er-do-well cowardly brother (and doing jobs for him). A spectator of this movie from outside Russia, especially the one who doesn't hail from the Soviet Union, may think of Medieval Dark Ages into which Russia of the 90's was immersed. The "mysterious Russian soul" interlaced with interesting contemporary Russian rock legends soundtrack goes on to be depicted in "Brat 2", focusing on the same character Danila's adventures in the US, further emphasizing the difference of Russia's and America's mindsets. In 2005, Same filmmaker Aleksei Balabanov shot "Zhmurki" ("Blind Man's Bluff") further mocking Russia's 90's period and further emphasizing the difference between that interim period Russia and and cold-blooded modern Russian Federation where same crimes are done in much slicker way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may not qualify to be a great movie, but it is surely a very good one, and quite an impressive portrait of the post-communist Russian society. Oh yea, the main character Danila is quite a "character." A very likable guy (though he "dislikes jews and film directors," not to mention America and anyone from the Caucases, but he is cool with Germans - go figure), likes Nautilus Pompilius, very kind too (when he has the money, he is always ready to share), somewhat dimwitted but at the same time very prompt and knows what's cooking. He obviously was in Chechen war but always dodges the questions about his army experience because, er, it's repugnant to him. So he is all that and he is also a cold blooded killer with no remorse. Man, Dostoyevskiy must be turning in his grave! But can you really judge Danila? He embodies a significant part of Russian society. A good thing about the movie is that director Aleksei Balabanov doesn't try to do it either, but lets the viewer decide on his/her own. Among other things the movie also boasts a unique St. Petersburgh atmosphere, an image of a self-sacrificing Russian woman (Danila's lover), a villain who constantly uses saying and proverbs in his speech, and, of course, a brief appearance by Mr. Butusov of Nautilus Pompilius fame. And let us not forget Danila's spiritual advisor of sort - the intellectual bum Nemetz, who definitely knew what he was talking about when he called the city an "evil force." I could go further with this review, but why don't you just see this movie for yourself...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a crime movie with action more realistic than is, and can guarantee you that neither have you.This movie emphasizes that when you get shot you can't run as fast as a cheetah unlike the Hollywood films portray every day. The movie is multi-layered (you can watch in as an action movie), a social analysis of the period, even a Dostoevsky-like study on the value of brotherhood and after all, a unique picture of what Russia is, was, and will be.The story is told brilliantly the main character Danila, doesn't tell or brag about his past, he actually makes himself out to be a humble guy, instead of saying he served in the hot spot in the war and was given recognition and bravery award for saving his platoon members, he often reminds people that he was far from combat, he is passionate and caring and not aggressive at all.If you were in S. Petersburgh in the early nineties, you feel this movie has been able to grab a cubic meter of air of the city at that time, pack it, and give it to its viewers to breathe.filled with excellent performances, especially by Sergei Bodrov III and Yuri Kutznetsov. I was swept away by the story and characters, thrown into their world. I'd have to say it's a MUST SEE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Russian culture film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brother" managed to do many things to me through my first viewing. It confused me thoroughly, but through a little studying, and also through some reviews here on this site and others, it all became rather clear.This film comments on much of Russian culture, and being American, it can be hard to swallow without a background. The recent conflicts that so many Russian conscripts had joined, and had come back from, the state of the city Danila visits, the crime, the broken families, the Russian youth he meets that symbolize a sort of separated youth, and even his general attitude throughout the film. He acts nothing like any lead I've seen, often seeming aloof or distracted, and then seems to fall back on his military ways. The running joke of the film, from the very beginning, is that he is "just a clerk". It is very obvious that he is NOT.The film says much about Russian culture, and I won't bore anyone with technical details about direction or editing, as I know nothing about it, but as a film, as a dynamic, it works incredibly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting, dark, grim, noirish thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in St. Petersburg, where the fall of communism has led to a sort of wild west anarchy between competing sections of the Russian mafia. Into this steps a young man fresh out of Army service, who comes to stay with his older brother who (as it turns out) is himself a hit man. Before long, the younger brother has taken over for the older, and is coolly and efficiently killing off targets and double crossing bosses alike. Sort of a combination art film and gangster action film, this never does much more than entertain, and there's a certain phony James Bond quality to some of the violence. But it's never dull, and has some nice subtle touches, wry comments on the ruthlessness of capitalism and the 'free market' taken to the extreme, and solid performances.</fullReview>

However, the directing and acting makes watching it an enjoyable experience.Violence was done in right doses - hey, this is a gangster film - and Danila, the main character, evoked respect and endorsement as a young killer with heart.Too bad there does not seem to be a sequel.

		<fullReview>My Russian friends told me to avoid this film, that it wasn't good. But I tend to trust IMDb ratings over word of mouth or what friends think. I should have listened. I've only seen a few Russian movies, but this one is by far the only one that has been terrible thus far. There are too many technical flaws to over look. The editing is bad and the characters don't react in a way they should. It seems their actions and dialogue are the product of simply serving the main character's message and reputation. Ironically, many of the Russian films I have seen from the 80's and 70's are way ahead of their time. Good acting, good writing, good story telling. Fast forward 20 years and watch &#x431;&#x440;&#x430;&#x442; and you wonder if film making in Russia regressed 35 years over night. It simply does not hold up. The film is less than 2 hours, but it felt like 2 days. Do yourself a favor and pass. There are much much better Russian films out there.</fullReview>

A realistic description of society and vain search of its sense, slice of social confusion and justice beyond the rules.The values are essential problem. Music, social shadows, competition between organized crime ethnic groups, week brother and the experience of Chechen war, the gray vision about existence and life as fight, image of mother and disillusions of great town are parts of self definition.Danila Bagrov is only actor of a cruel game and the Russian realities are other part of war facts. After missions, gifts or fugitive relation, hope and small illusions, desire to be ordinary young man, pieces of success and end of myth, he is not surviver but judge of a deep crisis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new generation of Russian movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best action-crime films I have ever seen. It is Russian, which makes it more believeable and it is low budget but non of the less, a great picture. This movie shows a portrait of Danila, a Russian war veteran that comes back home. Probably more than anybody, he knows how unfair the world really is because he has been there and can do something about it. He has a brother i St.Petersburg that's a hitman and he is not the brother Danila can trust. But then Danila's brother gets in trouble with the local maffia, so Danila does something about it and saves his brother. Danila's brother is the back-stabber sort because the life and the environment made him change but Danila still helps him because he is family.The great thing about this movie is Danila a quite, calm, stays out of trouble and always appears as this harmless, usual young man. He is but he was in the war and that had an effect on him. He can turn ruthless without anybody predicting and kill without emotion. This way, he helps his brother and kills all evil men to find justice and truth in the world. This movie is incredibly stylish, with superb music and all I can say that this is an OUTSTANDING MOVIE! See it, if you want to get a break from the usual American "bang-bang-blood-blood" type of movie. Watch this movie to see the reality in crime, maffia, power, money, truth and justice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A street-level view of the underside of St Petersburg. It was apparently, and looks as though it was, made on the cheap. However, given the seamy nature of the subject matter, this isn't a bad thing. One standout scene, which is deliciously surreal, involves the younger brother speaking Russian to a French guy about American techno music whilst both of them are stoned._Brat_ gives the viewer a broad look at contemporary Russian society as well as a gradual exposition of the reality of the strength of character of the two brothers. It is this shift in power that provided, for me, the greatest interest in the film. Along the way, there is an interesting sense of "pecking order" between various social and racial groups within Petersburg, similar to the racial undertones of _Kamikaze Taxi_ and _9 Millimeter_. Not necessarily a great film, but certainly a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brother courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what may have been Sergei Bodrov Jr's most famous role before his untimely death - he got killed in a landslide while filming a movie in 2002 - he plays an outcast from a small Russian town who moves to St. Petersburg, where he becomes a hit-man. "Brat" (the Russian word for brother) has some pretty ugly imagery, but nothing gratuitous. The scenes in which Danila goes to McDonald's represent his life: it's fast food, and he lives fast. The streetcar represents the fleeting nature of his love life. The scene where he washes his hands in the water suggests that he is washing away his sins (although he will probably never be able to fully escape his actions during his time in St. Pete).I certainly recommend this movie. Partially a look at conditions in post-Soviet Russia*, it pulls no punches. You'll likely want to avoid it if you're the squeamish type. There was a sequel, but it apparently wasn't worth seeing.*People in Moscow have told me that under Yeltsin, nothing worked right in Russia, and so they like that Putin and Medvedev at least fixed that aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie aimed at a youthful Russian audience with rock music drugs sex and a hero who knocks off Russian Gangsters and makes hoods pay for their tram fares. It shows the new underworld fast lane of Russia in 1997--with its shocking decadence (to Russian audiences).I enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so of it as it is so different and the action was pretty exciting. But then it begins to drag...it needed some editing and a clearer explanation of the story line. What happened exactly during the first killing? Who were the people in the Volvo? Why did his brother turn on him? I suppose if you watched it 2 or 3 times you could catch the story but who wants to see those party scenes again and the skeleton trolley (what function does such a trolley serve?--kind of neat image) going up and down the street and a lot of other excess baggage....just some editing is all that is needed.Also it is filmed in a sepia that is also something you might not want to put yourself through again.Lots of potential.. I am sure it was popular and more versions of this hero will follow--the hero is headed for Moscow in the last scene. But am not sure I want to sign on....this one was fun will look for more from this director rather than sequels.The music kind of makes this thing work but am not interested in purchasing the sound track any more than watching this thing twice.Reading on the internet I discovered Bodrov the protagonist is the son of Bodrov Sr. the director; he is now deceased from an avalanche accident...so there will be no more sequels starring him.

Its tale of betrayal is reminiscent of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, and Danila is also very much like The Man With No Name, a motiveless stranger pitting two enemies against each other until they are wiped out. The opening sequence (sparse forest, castle, robed woman, intimations of S&amp;M) suggest Gothic,as does a certain burial sequence, but, try as we might, we cannot get away from the sheer amoral banality: a gloriously unneurotic hero, a sweet boy who does everything people of his age should (loitering, discman, drugs, concerts, parties etc.) and just happens to be handy with a gun (he is also the only worker in this former worker's paradise).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One could view this movie in several different ways: Russia's cry for its lost position of superpower, a rise of a superhero that takes care of evil forces and someone who Russian younglings can finally relate to, or simply as an entertaining action movie about mafia. The last one appeals to me most of all. Despite a fair amount of xenophobia in the movie, it is still nothing but a typical, at times subpar, superhero tale that has been recreated many times by Hollywood studios. In Hollywood, this movie would be nothing special, but since it's produced by Russian cinema it is put on a pedestal by Russian viewers who are not yet used to great films produced by their country. Xenophobic comments like "kirdyk Amerike" aimed towards a guy who is not even American, but clearly non-English speaking European adds up to non-significance of whatever is supposed to be symbolic in this movie. On the contrary, the music in this movie, performed by Russian cult band Nautilus Pompilius, deserves the highest notes, it's simply awesome. 'Brat 2' is next on my list, I heard it's better than the first one.</fullReview>

And I suppose you could say that the violence in the film is more realistic rather than stylised that one might find in a 'hollywood' film. But that doesn't save this film.From a technical stand point, the film is bad. There parts of the film that have no place, such as Dani's running in and out of music shops. Some of the sequences make you wonder if they should have been cut out, and the the fade outs of all the scenes look very amateur. There are a few sequences that could have been nice with better editing, like where Danil is making weapons, but ultimately they fall flat. The music was absolutely terrible. Worst music ever used in a movie. Some of the characters were interesting, though we don't spend enough time with most of them, and our main character is a dimwit, and possibly a sociopath.Why make a movie in which no character is worth sympathizing with, and score it with terrible music?

Also a subplot involving a mesmerisingly awful synth rock band called Nautulis seems beamed in from another planet.Viktor Sukhorukov, who would prove so effortlessly sinister in Balabanov's next project, "Of Freaks and Men" (where his character would again share his real name) is a skeletal, leering caricature, and the less said of Sergei Bodrov in the lead the better. Visually, the film seems lost in a colourless sludge.Be kind to yourself: see "Of Freaks and Men" instead and forget that this film exists.</fullReview>

If you expect to get a glimpse of much feared and tallked about Russian mob....well, it's not here . We don't call every gang banger from South Site a mobster, don't we?
