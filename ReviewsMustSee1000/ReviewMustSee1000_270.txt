		<shortDescription>Aaaaaaaaaaalriiiiiiiighty Then!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm guessing that everybody knows the story of this movie by now, but for those who might not have had the opportunity to see this great movie, it's quite a simple formula. The Miami Dolphins mascot is stolen and by word-of-mouth advertising Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is called into manic action. His job is to find the dolphin and return it before The Miami Dolphins' crucial game.Jim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. This is surely Carrey's best work, even now. OK, Dumb and Dumber and The Mask are very funny movies too, but this takes the biscuit. Everything Ace does made me laugh, from whipping football player's with a towel to get a ring imprint to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self.100 laughs per hour, if you have a sense of humour, then this movie is for you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sure, this is cheeseball comedy, but Jim Carrey makes it memorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura is the kind of comedy that stems directly from a TV show, and in this case, that show was probably In Living Color, where Carrey got most of his publicity before he became famous as a movie actor. A quick look through Carrey's filmography will prove that Ace Ventura is the film that really acted as a springboard for his career. He had a few small roles in films previous to Ace Ventura, the largest of which was probably his role as one of the aliens in the awful film Earth Girls Are Easy, but after Ace Ventura, his career skyrocketed. The Mask (hey, he's still new, give the guy a break), Dumb &amp; Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself &amp; Irene, The Grinch, and there's no end in sight.Sure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There's something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn't care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic!And, of course, it only gets better with Ace's dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1994, a year that gave us Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, Morgan Creek Productions and Warner Bros. Pictures came out with the funniest film of the decade, err, 1994, with the Jim Carrey super-vehicle, ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.Right off the bat, it is a Jim Carrey showcase: chasing missing albino pigeons, rescuing a pampered shiatsu, and making high speed getaways, this all works because it is Ace Ventura, a hilarious, live-action cartoon character who spouts one-liners like an M-16.The premise of the film is that the Miami Dolphin's team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin, has been captured and needs to be found in time for the Super Bowl. Ace is hired and the sexy Courtney Cox is made his partner until the dolphin is recovered. With an assortment of funny situations like Ace falling into a great white shark tank (!), a montage of Ace searching for a missing jewel, Ace head banging in a CANNIBAL CORPSE concert, it's all gold, and as you have read, Ace is what drives this film into comedy genius! It was a busy and successful year for Jim Carrey, as he came out with another pair of comedy blockbusters, the LOOSELY translated Dark Horse comic THE MASK, and his hilarious buddy comedy with Jeff Daniels, DUMB and DUMBER.Thanks to Tom Shadyac for letting Carrey out of the bag and letting this damn funny Canadian strut his lanky stuff.It has some offensive, adult-oriented material, but if caught on television, this is nearly perfect family entertainment: as long as you don't mind your kids talking from their a$$es for the next couple months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Carrey's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While his later films are good, Ace Ventura is the best of all. Jim Carrey brings his now famous style of acting to the screen. Ace is the kind of guy who you never know what he's going to do next, and that is what makes him so funny. The plot is not the best one out there and the actors in this one are not the best, but this movie is not for intelligent plots and famous actors. It's a whacky comedy that made Jim Carrey a star. The movie is not bad, not at all. Why people think that is just odd and strange. Guess there is no appreciation for good movies these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>star-making performance for Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undeniably juvenile, but funny and entertaining comedy stars Carrey?in his breakthrough role?as a goofy, wildly eccentric pet detective hired to find the missing Miami Dolphins mascot. He's the right man for the job but his childish idiosyncrasies, uncanny bond with animals, and aberrant investigative techniques cause outsiders to question whether or not he can actually make good on his word. Aimed mostly at fans who really enjoy silly humor, others will quickly find it tiresome. There are some amusing cameos by real Dolphin football players (including an engaging Dan Marino) but this film belongs to Carrey and his constant outrageousness. Sure-fire entertainment for fans of this genre. **?</fullReview>

I could go on for hours about how great it is. I could watch it every day! I would give it a perfect 10! The acting in his movie was great. And Courtney Cox did an amazing job as Melissa! She's such an talented and amazing actress!One of the funniest lines: Melissa: Did you have any trouble getting in? Ace Ventura: No, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We saw "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" right after "The Mask" came out. We could not have possibly predicted how wacky it would be. At the moment when Jim Carrey started butt-talking, my dad shouted out: "Lee, he's crazy!" And believe you me, he really was. Anyone who knows anything about the movie probably knows that Carrey plays the title character, who has to find the Miami Dolphins' mascot. But mostly, the whole movie is an excuse for him to be silly. And of course, the woman who played reporter Melissa (Courtney Cox) went on to play the reporter in the "Scream" trilogy.Well anyway, Ace Ventura really is a master of disguise, and it's almost hard to believe that after almost ten years of stagnation in comedy, this movie came and changed the way that we think about humor. Hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie carried by you-know-who...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, these movies can't be taken too seriously. The storyline is silly, the dialog is silly and the concept is silly, with one extraordinary exception: Jim Carrey, who, in contrast, uses his extremely intelligent wit and hugely humorous body actions to make this movie what it is, hilarious.The fact is, this mans arguably a genius, he made a possibly average, run-of-the-mill, 'straight to TV' comedy into an all-time classic. You can switch your brain off and literally laugh yourself to tears watching the scenes in which he acts in. He CARRIES this movie, no doubt and his performance in this is extremely underrated. Being one of his first major roles and to actually manage to single-handedly make this movie what it is with his sheer brilliance at being a comedian-actor, well, it should not be overlooked.But of course, it has it's flaws. The fact is, the scenes without Carrey (Albeit, they're not many of them) really just shows this movie doesn't have much else going for it besides the man himself. Many of the other actors/actresses (Including Courtney Cox) just aren't funny. But this movie, in my opinion, deserves an 8, because it's just really showcasing Jim Carreys excellence. Watch it and believe me, you'll get hooked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey At His Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a wonder actor. His performance in the box-office blockbuster 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is worth immense praise. The Golden-Globe Award Winner delivers hilariously in this slapstick-comedy, that is full of double-meaning jokes &amp; over-the-top sequences. As a film, it works and manages some truly funny moments, but it's Carrey who makes this film a must watch.'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective': Synopsis: A goofy detective specializing in animals, goes in search of a missing dolphin mascot of a football team. 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is meant for those who like slapstick-comedies. This cult-classic is not meant for the pseudo intellectuals at all. Reason? The Over-The-Top sequences, and the unexpected digs at transsexuals, will surely not attract them. I, how-ever, had a good laugh and I mainly credit Carrey for it. He is fantastic as the Ace Ventura and in many ways, he immortalizes him. In terms of screenplay, there is not much to say, apart from the fact, that it is true to the genre it follows. Tom Shadyac's Direction captures Ace Ventura's journey, most convincingly. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design &amp; Costume Design, are worth a mention. On the whole, Watch it, but only, if you have the stomach for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pet Detective is in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let it be known that Jim Carrey is a comic madman. He may not be the smartest cat on the stage, but there's no question that his act, especially in "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," is the real deal.Director Tom Shadyac saw fit to put the Man with the Rubber Face, later The Man on the Moon, in his own starring vehicle with this comedy hit from 1994. I've never laughed so hard in my life; that was from the first time I saw it. I saw "Shaun of the Dead" 10 years after Carrey's vehicle; that was another time when I laughed myself silly.Sure, the humor is immature from time to time. But that's part of Carrey's act, as the colorful gumshoe of the title, who takes on the case of retrieving the Miami Dolphins' prized mascot, Snowflake, after it's stolen from its tank one night. Of course, as the title would lead you to believe, Ace Ventura is no ordinary detective. "I don't do humans," he asserts to us. His specialty is pets. It's hard out there for pet detectives, since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously, except Ace, that is. So when he gets the call for duty, he's all over the case.His investigation pairs him with Melissa Robinson ("Friends" Courteney Cox), and the two uncover some startling details about the Miami team's history, and one of its most controversial players, who missed the field goal kick at the 1984 Super Bowl that would have won the game and blames Dan Marino for the whole thing. That player hasn't been seen since. Meanwhile, Ace runs afoul of Miami police department lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who seriously needs to take a chill pill and is hiding something more than just a gun under her skirt."Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is a comic tour de force. Of course Carrey has done plenty of better things since this flick, but for commercial purposes, so let's just leave that in the future. Ace Ventura is something that only he could have done, and made it work. Sure his methods are "unusual," but hey, he gets the job done.I wonder if this flick helped to spark interest in a new law enforcement field?10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine example of Carrey at his zany best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the kidnapping of ?Miami Dolphins' mascot `Snowflake' Melissa (Courteney Cox) hires Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) to track the dolphin down before Superbowl Sunday.The Nineties were generally good for Jim Carrey and ?Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is a shining example of sheer Carrey hilarity! Jim Carrey plays his character with his typical, undoubtedly unrivalled, madcap charisma that has now become so famous throughout the world, yet this movie probably remains the greatest example of just how outlandish a Carrey movie can be. The plot is so thin that it becomes obvious that the story was made to suit Carrey's style rather than vice versa and surprisingly succeeds well. Carrey's extremely arrogant and oddball ?Ace Ventura' character is unexpectedly likeable and continuously places the viewer in a fit of hysterics with the increasingly wacky scenarios he finds himself in. Carrey's off the wall antics are what made this film and direct attention away well from the flaws that the movie has.It is safe to say that Carrey was the star and provided all the highlights of this movie and while Sean Young (playing Lt. Lois Einhorn) and Courteney Cox in some ways aided the movie they simply came off as bit-part characters rather than stars as Carrey stole the entire show. Capable direction from Tom Shadyac is a further high spot in this movie and recognition should also be given to Jack Bernstein who co-wrote an astoundingly funny script with Jim Carrey.?Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is certainly one of the finest comedies Jim Carrey has offered the world so far and despite missing the more heart-warming moments that later films such as ?Liar Liar' (1997) offered, is a good movie in it's own right. However, as humour is viewer dependant it would be unfair of me to say I recommend this movie to everyone. Those people who dislike many of the Jim Carrey movies will probably not enjoy this one and I can understand why some would condemn this movie as being puerile nonsense. Many of the jokes do border on bad taste and much of the movie has an atmosphere of schoolyard humour to it. I am aware that some people will not find Carrey's zany antics and silly noises funny at all. That being said I personally do enjoy this movie and feel that fans of Jim Carrey and many other people will find this entertaining fun. To sum up ? I feel this is an enjoyable movie for teenagers, young adults and probably for the more open-minded older audience despite being somewhat childish and risqué. Not for everyone though. My rating for ?Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' ? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura is one of my favourite Jim Carrey movies and I after watching this have been anxious to see Jim Carrey movies ever since. It is an hilarious movie and most of the jokes they have in the movie work really well. This movie has pretty much nothing wrong with and it just keeps the silliness going like with bits like the shark in the tank and the bit where he chews up the cigarette the lady asks if he wants an astray and he replies with "no I do not smoke it is a filthy habit" are just a tiny portion of things that are hilarious and if this movie was any more funny it would not be called a movie anymore but I do not know something bigger so I will not say what it would. Overall I will rate this movie 93% for being a damn funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey saves an otherwise mediocre flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way before Carrey started his Academy Award quest with movies such as Man On The Moon, The Majestic or the recent Eternal Sunshine, goofiness was what the man was about. Now, in this first 'Ace Ventura' movie, Carrey needs to do little more.Carrey is Ace Ventura, a pet detective (duh) who's called in to find a stolen dolphin who's a mascot for a major football team (as one might expect: The Dolphins). While the police do their job to find it as well, Carrey proves his investigating skills while a young Courteney Cox helps along as Melissa Robinson, who works at the Dolphins (as what I don't remember. Oh well, who cares?).The story provides some funny moments (the 'coming out' at the end, and in particular the scene in which Carrey snoops around the huge mansion of the cocky billionaire), but it's mostly Carrey's facial expressions and moves that saves this movie. Whenever you feel like the movie's getting more stupid by the minutes, he comes in and bags yet another scene. I'm gonna tell you, that guy is pretty damn funny.If you feel like you can need an incredibly goofy movie, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective might just be your thing. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious stuff from funny man Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey.This guy sure has a thing for making us all laugh. 1994 was the year he made A lot of films from The Mask,Dumb &amp; Dumber and of course this film Ace Ventura Pet Detective. As well as doing the screenplay for this film he also stars in it too. In this 1994 comedy he plays a guy named Ace Ventura(hence the title)who is a pet detective who is solving a mystery on the whereabouts of a dolphin named Snowflake who apparently gets abducted by some former Rugby player called Ray Finkle who is out to get revenge on Dan Morino(playing himself). So its up to Ace to solve the mystery and discover who was the culprit behind it. Meanwhile there is a new Lieutenant in charge at the police station named Lori Elenhorn(played by Sean Young) who is a no nonsense chick who doesn't like Ace Ventura,BUT is she all what she seems to be?Bottom line if you are a die hard fan of Jim Carrey's than this is for you,as there is a lot of slapstick humor going on in this film and also Jim Carrey making funny faces and acting like all daft and crazy throughout the film. Also stars a very young Courtney Cox as the love interest,this film is thoroughly entertaining stuff.I haven't seen this film in a very long time and I was lucky to get the box set of Ace Ventura in HMV a few days ago. Overall its a 6.5/10 and out of 5 stars I give it 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those hilarious Jim Carrey films, where he plays an idiot savant. It comes so naturally to him, I worry. In fact, this was the film that launched a thousand laughs, followed the next year by its sequel, ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS (1995). It was not only Nature but audiences who called, and thus history was made. Would Jim Carrey by any chance be an exhibitionist? No, surely not! Not since the days of silent films has there been someone so outrageously funny who can make us laugh just by slightly altering his facial expression, and Jim Carrey really is one of those phenomena of Nature, like volcanoes, which keep going relentlessly. In this early work of his, there are so many excellent sight gags and so many brilliant lines that it is a comedy classic. We might describe Carrey as 'the man with four cheeks', due to his very rude habit of talking with his buttocks. But I suppose putting buttocks to good use like that is better than just sitting on them. He must be lovable because animals crowd round him, birds sit on him, pretty girls kiss him, squirrels and otters adore him, and we pay money to watch him being the smartest fool that ever was. His style goes back to the days of court jesters. In this film he is pitted against the intimidating Sean Young. Now as for Sean Young, we have there a true glamour gal. She was sensational in NO WAY OUT (1987) and countless other films. Here she has to play a tough cop who is suspected of being a man. If you can imagine Sean Young being a man, then you are ready to be taken away by the men in white coats. The scene where Jim Carrey strips her clothes off her intending to reveal a different anatomy than might be expected show us some of the reasons why Sean Young is so alluring, and they have nothing to do with being a guy. This film is so hilariously over the top that it is impossible to describe, just as Carrey himself is impossible to describe. No one who has never seen him can possibly imagine him. Courteney Cox does an excellent job of taking him seriously, as every Groucho needs a Marguerite Dumont, although in this case she is a delightful cutie rather than a matron. The film features real-life football quarterback Dan Marino playing himself, as the story concerns the Miami Dolphins, an American football team who breathe air while they swim round a large bowl known as the Super Bowl. Also playing himself is manic comic Carrey, bless his wobbling buttocks. This kind of crazed comedic insanity is something that only comes out of the good ole U. S. of A., the only country in the world that could ever produce a Jim Carrey (oops, I forgot, he is really Canadian, but Canadians are honorary Americans, aren't they?). I long to see him play a major Washington politician. Can you imagine letting him loose in the corridors of power? I recommend him for Secretary of State because that would sort out American foreign policy in no time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that launched Jim Carrey into orbit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one crazy comedy that is totally being carried by Jim Carrey's performance.Sort of the problem with comedies though is its simple written story. It's as if the best writers don't want to touch the comedy genre with an 10-feet pole and they are above the genre, which is sort of understandable since comedies simply never have been amongst the most appreciated or high class movies. But than again on the other hand comedies also shouldn't ever be too complicated, or else they wouldn't be really comedies. But at least you should always trow in some originality. Basically the only thing that makes this movie truly original is Jim Carrey.You can say that this is really the movie that launched Carrey's comedy career. Shortly after this he got parts in movies such as "Dumb &amp; Dumber", "The Mask" and "The Truman Show". It's as if director these days keep him more on a short leach but in this early movie from him there is no holding back and he goes totally over-the-top with his Ace Ventura character. This is perhaps also the very same reason why Ace Ventura has grown out into a well known comical character. It's really Carrey that makes this movie and its humor work out so well, since lets face it; the movie its script really doesn't provide the movie with that much comical material to work with. I really can't imaging how this movie would had been without Jim Carrey in it.The movie further more also has a good supporting cast with fine actors such as Courteney Cox, Sean Young, Udo Kier, Troy Evans, John Capodice and more.No it's not its directing or overall style that makes this really a special comedy to watch. It has a very typical style in directing, character treatment, it's music and other little things such as this. The '90's just wasn't the best decade for movies in terms of style and its way of film-making. You didn't really realized it at the time but looking back at it now, the '90's is perhaps the decade of movies with the least distinctive- and stylish style.Luckily Jim Carrey's presence compensates for basically everything. He makes the movie a real worthwhile one, although the eventual movie still is just not as classic as its main character is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ace Ventura:Pet Detective" does not have a script that could win an Oscar. There are no amazing visuals, but what the film has is Jim Carrey. His performance is without a doubt one of the single funniest in any movie, and that alone makes this film worth watching. Carrey plays Ace Ventura, who investigates the disappearance of Snowflake, the mascot for the Miami Dolphins. As Ace begins to figure out who's behind it all, Dan Marino is kidnapped, and Ace must race the clock to rescue Dan and Snowflake in time for the Super Bowl. From beginning to end, the film is full of opportunities for Carrey, and he takes full advantage of them in the film that propelled him to stardom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet detective is a film that very little appreciate. Besides me of course. I laugh every time I see it because it's so funny. I know it's pretty silly, but Carrey just works in everything he is in. Very few people appreciate Carrey's films, but I appreciate his films because Carrey is my favorite actor. Now, I will come out and say this... but i've never seen Eternal Sunshine of a spotless mind. alright, quit throwing the trash. I've always wanted to see it but I never rented it or anything, so, sorry. Ace Ventura is a popular film with people but not with critics. Ace Ventura: Pet detective is hilarious. Ace is so immature, he talks out of his ass(No literally). I think that Ace Ventura is funny in every scene. Do I think it's Carrey's best film? No. But I think in the future if they were ever to make a third film, they need to bring back Jim Carrey. Look at how Evan Almighty, Dumb and Dumberer, and Son of the Mask turned out. Besides Evan Almighty, which I thought was okay, they all sucked. Just be sure not to make a sequel excluding Jim Carrey and you may be in good hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Carrey comedy out there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Jim's first major movie and it was released the same year as another one of his greats, The Mask. The film centres around the Miami Dolphins mascot, Snowflake the dolphin, being kidnapped. The authorities put Ace on the Case. As well as Snowflake being kidnapped, Football star, Dan Marino is also kidnapped and therefore the police (who are against Ace) work on it. There are numerous hilarious scenes for example, i love it when Ace is trying to find out who's ring he found in Snowflake's tank and goes round harassing football stars- brilliant! Also at a rich guy's party when he almost gets eaten by a shark in a tank looking for snowflake and of course the part when he finds out that Ray Finkle, a fallen football star, kidnapped them both and goes to a mental asylum to find more info, he then finds that the police lieutenant Lois Einhorn, was a missing hiker. He finds the document with it on in Finkle's box at the asylum, how are they connected? This is simply great, I'm a huge fan of this and the sequel, but this is far,far better. Also, The cartoon show relates a lot to this film and is also great. Watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey: Comedic Dynamo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey burst into the movie scene with his trademark manic delivery in this mock detective story. There are no other real comedic talents in the movie, but it doesn't matter, Carrey is so forceful that he dominates the screen whenever he is in the picture with his big hair and wild Hawaiian shirts. The story itself is simply a detectives story with the detective more interested in his menagerie of pets than in the quarterback who is missing. That is one of the great scenes, watching the ever growing number of animals flock to Carrey as he lets out a wailing note as is the scene where he searches a bunch of Football players and personal with his head, a lighter, and a bottle of chloroform. The best has to the last scene where he battles Sean Young before unmasking her "little" secret. Along with Liar Liar, this is Carrey at his craziest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a way to kick off a Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where it all began for the man we all know as Jim Carrey. Yes he was on "In Living Color", but this where people began to take notice of him. JIm started his career off with a bang, with not only this, but two other movies that followed: The Mask and then Dumb &amp; Dumber. What made this movie work was Jim and the way his costars worked off of him: Courteney Cox, Sean Young and Dan Marino. Cox has stated in past interviews that she had a great time working with Jim. In fact, Cox was one of the reasons her "Friends" co-star Jennifer Aniston decided to sign on to Bruce Almighty. Look at how Sean and Dan worked off of Jim. The director Tom Shadyac, has mentioned many times that Jim loves to ad-lib which would result in laughs or other ad-libs from his costars. If you want a good laugh/good time, this is the movie to go with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moon 168 Readback: Strive for porpoise crays polly mer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura Pet Detective is an amusing film. Actor Jim Carrey makes this movie work. A critic said that this movie did well at the box office because it was the only comedy in the theaters at a time when people needed a good laugh. Director Shadyac does a competent job especially with the shark tank scene. Ordinarily that kind of encounter would be scary but somehow the Ventura character makes it look humorous. In my cryptic title Cray is slang for supercomputers even though the Cray company is not around anymore and the NSA uses Japanese Yottaflop speed computers. Apparently there are porpoises on Moon 168 Artevan as well as primates. Wow thats a big moon when you you consider that some moons are only 6 miles in diameter. The Creators Moonfleet is impressive and I am glad to be the skipper of Moon 168. You'd be surprised how many meal variations you can make with wheat, corn, potatoes, and chickens for the Humans and leaves for the other primates on Moon 168. I am still trying to determine if there is a dairy on board although there probably is. The number of smaller spacecraft and missiles is apparently classified, but if you think that the Creator of Humans is in three galaxies, the Triangulum, Anromeda and the Milky Way Galaxies and has been around for tens of billions of years through big bangs and big crunches it is reasonable to assume that there is a lot of diversity to Moon 168. I think that the deer, wolves and dogs are on another moon in answer to an American Government question. Faq4HGlf. The sequel movie when nature calls is also worth watching although not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's funniest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. I have loved it ever since I first saw it the year it came out. I think this is his funniest film to date. I mean, the films he has made lately are funny, but this one just makes me laugh all the way through, whereas the latest films have not. This movie and "Dumb and Dumber" are Jim Carrey's two funniest films. This is one of my favorite movies. I literally know every word that comes out of Jim's mouth in this movie. I know this movie by heart. There are so many memorable lines and scenes in this movie. I also liked Courtney Cox in her pre-Friends days. Sean Young was great as Lt. Einhorn/Ray Finkle. The scene where Jim is stripping her down trying to prove to everyone that she is a man is classic. "She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!" I love this movie so much and it is definitely a classc. This is humor at it's best. The sequel was funny, but not as funny as this one. Ace Ventura : Pet Detective rules!

		<fullReview>I am eighteen years old, and I remember this film as one of the funniest movies of my elementary school career. When it first came to video my siblings and I watched it so many times that the tape wore out.The real surprise, though, was putting the film in a couple of weekends ago for the first time in years. It is still hilarious. I laughed just as hard as I did when I was eleven. I also got a lot more of the humor. It is stupid, but dang it, it is funny. Carrey is a genius. The physical comedy in this movie is outstanding, stuff like Carrey dancing around in a tootoo and hiding in a box. Classic.With films like the Majestic and the Truman Show demonstrating Carrey's impressive and worthy dramatic talent, it was refreshing to look back at where he got his start. I don't care if he ever gets an Oscar, the best performances of Jim Carrey's career were Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Dumb and Dumber.</fullReview>

Ok, so it is immature foolish comedy...BUT...why can't people lighten up once in a while. Even the most serious people need to enjoy some stupid humour here and there, and this is the perfect film for it. Carrey's facial expressions and great delivery make it hilarious and fast paced, so the time flies. In my opinion, this is one of Jim's best films, along with Liar Liar. His more serious stuff, like the Truman Show and now The Majestic don't suit him. I understand he is trying to mature and do new types of films as he developes as an actor, but I think this is classic Carrey- what he does best. A Brilliant comedy.

All a crazy comedy needs to be considered terrific is that it is FUNNY, right? I laughed just about through the whole movie. It is true, that a movie like this does not give too good a picture of Mr.Carrey's acting ability, but this sure shows that he's an exceptional comedian.

		<shortDescription>The Essence of Ace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about the character of Ace Ventura I find appealing, and it's not Jim Carrey's over-the-top delivery which can be brilliant but, in all honesty, can also be trying a time or two. The root of Ventura's likability is his genuine affection and obligation to protect all animals - it's almost as if he's an animal himself born in a human being's body, using his super powers to help his innocent peers and making the sacrifice of dealing with other humans at the same time. Ace's services are needed when Snowflake, the dolphin mascot to the Miami Dolphins, is stolen from his tank before the Super Bowl (Snowflake is scheduled to perform for the halftime show). As long as he gets to work by his own social and professional rules, Ace proves to be a more effective detective than the rest of the investigation department. My favorite scene is when Ace goes undercover at a mental institution disguised as a nucking futs football fan; if this sequence doesn't capture the essence of Carrey's own brand of humor, I don't know what does. While the film has a pretty thin plot and its fair share of preposterous moments (bullet-catching teeth, talking butts, so forth), it proved to be an excellent vehicle to launch Carrey into superstardom. Some - no, many skeptics of Carrey were also created with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, but he went on to have a long, illustrious, still continuing career. Sorry skeptics, but you have been had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost a perfect comedy is Ace Ventura Pet detective simply because it was Jim Carrey in his prime.Jim Carrey plays probably the most outrageously funny character in his entire career as the bizarre animal lover hired to locate a stolen dolphin.The story give the film so much potential and it lives right up to it because of Jim Carrey.Ace is probably the goofiest,stupidest,weirdest,most annoying character ever yet that is why i love this film.The fact that Carrey plays such a good freak and delivers every classic line with pure comedic genius is enough to make this a classic.The acting is top notch as is the cast which includes Courtney Cox and Dan Marino.Despite the impossibly unbelievable situations Ace gets himself into the movie can be as silly as it wants because it is a silly movie.No movie has gone as over the top physical comedy as Ace Ventura and it's not humourless Americas Funniest Home Videos physical comedy it's how awkward and how uncoordinated Carrey contorts his face and body when delivering a line such as "Alrighty Then".Sadly Jim Carrey has decided to get into less goofy comedy's like Bruce Almighty,Fun With Dick and Jane and other snore fests that don't even compare to his earlier work.If you enjoy stuff like Family Guy,Mad T.v or anything over the top like that i deeply request Ace Ventura.Guaranteed to make you burst with laughter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, in my opinion, is a gut-busting blockbuster. I laughed really hard when Ace (Jim Carrey) talked with his behind. As a matter of fact, I laughed at just about every funny thing he did. In addition, I have a lot of favorite parts of this movie, especially when Ace mocked people and laughed like he used to do on "IN LIVING COLOR." If you ask me, Einhorn (Sean Young) was sort of snobby. It's hard to explain why without spoiling anything. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you're going to see this movie, prepare to laugh until it hurts!" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this gut-busting blockbuster to those of you who are Jim Carrey fans or like gut-busting laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alllrighty then? Like a ballistic missile launched from the irreverent camp of "In Living Color" (of which he was the odd-white-man-out alumnus), Jim Carrey's first starring role remains a watershed performance of mega-ultra-outré singularity.Shadyac's straightforward direction leaves Carrey, as the eponymous hero, the much-needed space to run amok like a force of nature that few comedians before him have commanded (notably, early Jerry Lewis).The plot of the Pet Detective recovering a kidnapped dolphin mascot is almost irrelevant, as scenery-chewing is taken to oxygen-depleting levels whenever Carrey inhabits more than one-tenth of the screen frame, in a frenetic story that takes Ace from football fields to Southern backwaters, to infiltrating a mental asylum and swimming with sharks.Sophisticates and art-house elitists whine over Carrey's Method, but his execution is unquestionably adept and engineered for maximum impact. Compared to the exhausted shtick of the Adam Sandlers and Pauly Shores, this is a Bergman Festival. With loud Hawaiian shirts.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is the film that made Jim Carrey. The Miami Dolphins mascot has gone missing. The only person now is Animal Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey). But standing in his way are both the police under Lt. Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) and Miami Dolphin worker Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) who eventually Ace will woo with his off-beat charm. His goal will lead him from rural Florida to a shark tank inside a millionaire's mansion. But in the end his goal of solving the missing dolphin must be achieved.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is not exactly a great film. It's strange, it's mostly stupid, and Carrey is a complete idiot, but it works in its own unique way. You'll laugh a lot and examine Carrey in his earlier role. Just sit back, stop thinking, and have a good time.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Starring: Jim Carrey, Courtney Cox, Sean Young, and Dan Marino.3 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

These films utilize slapstick/absurdist humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his a**.

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective shouldn't really be as funny as it is. It's random, head scratching and just deeply juvenile, and happens to be one of the funniest films ever made. Why? Jim Carrey. The man is spun gold on camera, and he sells every outlandish minute of this gonzo Looney Toons goofball of a flick. It really wouldn't work without him. I mean, could you imagine, say, Dustin Hoffman, or John Travolta trying to pull of this kind of malarkey? OK, I did just laugh really hard picturing that, so it would be funny, but only in an embarrassing way. No, it had to be Carrey, and he's an engine of unbridled comic mania the entire way through. One acting technique involves basing your performance off of the mannerisms of an animal, and I've heard that he chose a cockatoo as the blueprint for Ace. The head bobs, squirrelly movements and that epic, instantly recognizable ocean crest of a hairdo. Makes sense, and I couldn't unsee it after hearing that. Ace is probably the most eccentric, beloved character Carrey has ever fashioned, and for good reason. He's like a cannon loaded with jokes, quips, pop culture references, personal space invading antics, a complete lack of inhibitions, a treasure trove of rubber faced muckery and a deep love for any and all creatures of the animal kingdom. Those are pretty much all of the qualities one should look for in a human being. I say that now, but I feel like after spending ten minutes with the guy I'd look for the nearest exit. Ace is on the case, when he's not goofing off, which is always. Somehow he finds time to search for the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins, an actual dolphin named Snowflake. The story dimly unfolds in the background of all his tomfoolery, and includes Dan Marino, a suspicious billionaire (Udo Kier, whose exasperation at Carrey's behaviour looks very un-faked), and an ice queen of a Police Chief played by Sean Young, with an arc that goes to some pretty disturbing places for this kind of light fare. He also finds time to have hot jungle love with Courtney Cox, and speak to people through his asshole like a deranged Muppet, among many other things that will have you questioning why you're watching it, only to realize it's like your twentieth viewing and you have no plans to ever stop. It's Carrey's show, and he takes it into orbit, never letting the mania subside for a nanosecond. He's borderline certifiable, which comes in handy when he has to infiltrate a mental facility, because the guy halfway to belonging there anyway. There's just so many cherished little moments, mannerisms and scenes that don't ever get old, for those of us that love this character. Carrey shaped the landscape of comedy a lot during this portion of his career, and the mile markers that he released stand tall and undiminished to this day, bringing hilarity to all. The sequel is genius too, and one of those rare follow ups that is just as solid as the first.</fullReview>

The plot itself Is a little lackluster In development and originality but that's to be expected with this kind of a comedy, so It's really not that big of a minus. Also, It has to be said that other than Jim Carrey and possibly Courtney Cox, the entirety of the supporting cast could have been played by literally anyone that could walk into the studios on the right day. Overall Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is funny as hell, but without much depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey's breakout role, Ace Ventura is one of the funniest films of the 1990s. Written by the former In Living Color writer himself, the film centers around an oddball kook of a lead character who investigates missing pets. If you enjoy Jim Carrey's brand of humor (and it's not for everyone), then you'll love Ace Ventura. On a personal level I find this film to be a true legendary performance, entertaining from start to finish. However, Jim is an acquired taste and not everyone will be amused with the childish antics.The plot is a cracking one involving him tracking down a kidnapped dolphin and has great chemistry with Courtney Cox and a great couple of scenes with beautiful Sean Young (until he learns her secret) which makes up a brilliant last half an hour and some of the funniest moments happen in the finale. Unlike some of his poorer films that used ad-hoc excuses to show Carrey's slapstick style, here his humor is cleverly deployed to enhance scenes within the story-line. His demonstration with the double glazed patio doors, his slow-play interpretation of a super-bowl move, these are things that very few people can do, and even fewer can do as amusingly. Watch out for former pro American Football player Dan Marino playing himself. A masterpiece comedy film and the start of a Hollywood genius's career.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this with my kid yesterday, even though you can see on the film quality that it is from 1994, the humor and story still holds up and gives everyone a lot of laughs, Jim Carrey is still my number one comedy hero of all times :)There is just something about the humor of the time, it is still fun, the faces, the moves, the weird voices, the characters, well everything is just working for comedies of these times and keeps on working. Maybe I enjoyed it a bit more because I have seen it countless times already, but it looked like my son was very happy about this comedy classic :)I have plans of showing him all the great Jim Carrey films, but this and the Mask was the ones that got me hooked on him and I have been ever since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1994, "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" stars Jim Carrey as the titular detective investing the case of the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot. Courteney Cox plays Ace's girlfriend while Sean Young plays the chief of police who's at odds with Ventura. Dan Marino plays himself.I rank this with my all-time favorite movies simply because Jim Carrey's outrageous goofiness makes me laugh so much. And isn't that the ultimate purpose of a comedy? A great example is when Ace mimics speaking to a dolphin as he addresses snooping reporters. The second half isn't as funny, but it remains compelling as Ventura zeroes-in on the culprit. There are a couple of vulgar scenes that I could do without, but otherwise this is a great comedy where Carrey and the other filmmakers went all-out to entertain and succeeded with spades.The movie runs 86 minutes and was shot in Miami and Virginia Key, Florida.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood favorite comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie a lot as a kid, I still love it but not as much as I used to. It is one of those comedies that are worth watching over and over again. I thought I would get tired of the silly jokes and its silliness, but it still makes me laugh, it even still gives me tears of laughter. The movie itself is crap and would have fitted better as a cartoon material, but it is because of Jim Carrey the movie is so fun to watch. I just simply can't imagine another actor do what Jim Carrey did in this movie. I find it impossible to find another actor who can imitate him and still not overact. Jim Carrey was unbelievably enough a natural. There is a comedian in Greenland who imitate Jim Carrey, but he is just simply silly and not fun. Some Greenlanders even refer to him as "The Greenlandic Jim Carrey".But anyway, it is such a silly comedy that it can get unbearable to watch sometimes where it borders on just being silly instead of fun. But Jim Carrey made the movie fun. Courteney Cox was good too, but she was kind of overshadowed by Jim Carrey in this movie. But they both made the movie watchable, even though it had such a cartoon-ish approach. It is campy and childish and it seems like a 10 year-old directed the movie (not to insult the director, he actually did a good job considering the material). It is one of those movies that would have failed completely but it turned into a comedy which has loyal fans and, I am one of them.I give the movie 7/10.</fullReview>

Right from the first time we meet Ace Ventura you know that this is character is going to be a laugh a minute, and you know that this film was going to be amazing. Ace Ventura would make a great pet detective if he was real (of course!). My favourite seen has to be when he is in the mental institute in a pink tutu trying to be a footballer a very memorable and funny scene. If you like Jim Carrey or if you just like animals then this film is just for you. This has become one of Jim Carrey's classic movies and I believe it will stay that way forever (Sqeual is also amazing. It's All RIGHTTTY THENNNN.</fullReview>

My father first introduced me to Jim in Once Bitten and immediately I realized at how talented he truly is. This movie is so great I went out and bought it on DVD when our VHS version was warped. I believe my favorite part of this film is the mascot fight at the very end. It was just perfectly timed! This movie is a classic of Jim Carrey's. The second though, not so much! I really enjoyed the film and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend that you do because it is pretty hilarious. I give this film a 9 out of 10 because there are some things that I wished had more scenes at the mental hospital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey works wonders in this movie. Less animals in this movie I am disappointed to say in a film that is supposed to be about animals. The movie was a huge hit in the 90's but as time goes by the humour has soured.Ace Ventura Pet Detective is a funny movie as you would expect from a comedy with Carrey in it. The story is about a missing Dolphin and how to rescue him from an evil Transgender. A movie that would probably annoy the hell out of PETA and the Politically Correct crowd.Despite the obvious laugh at the expense of those groups in society the movie is light hearted and what I would describe as silly. The film kind of appears like a Charlie Chaplin of the modern age. While Chaplin made fun of Hitler and authoritarian government Jim Carrey acts like an idiot on screen and we see him humiliating the Police Department the exact same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning of Jim Carrey's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to see a comedy, most of us expect to see something so unusual that we will burst out laughing. Many times it's to the point of where you start getting cramps in your stomach. That's what I got when I first saw this film and I still do every time I watch it! Jim Carrey's first starring role as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective may seem obnoxious to some but to others, he is the definition of a living cartoon. Much of Carrey's humor is relied on body movements which does an excellent job at keeping the audience curious to what he really is doing.Although the character of Ace Ventura is quite rude; it's a kind rudeness because of his knowledge as a detective. There are so many parts of the film where people put down Ventura as a loser who really doesn't have an occupation because he IS the only pet detective. But he uses this to his advantage because he is also very smart aside from his wise cracks. For those people in the movie that chastise Ventura's actions, they are all proved wrong by his wit and reason.Director Tom Shadyac is brilliant for picking Carrey. It almost seems like Carrey was just told by Shadyac to "do whatever you feel like doing on screen". Everything looks genuine on film and nothing looks like it was really directed. This is good though because this is how Carrey's character worked. It focused more on impulse than directionality.Co-starring with Carrey is Courtney Cox. She acts her part out well too and of course because of Carrey's antics, Cox's character and many others are forced to always be a step behind. This is what makes Ace Ventura's character so effective. To think that Ace Ventura was written into the script as just a stupid character that has no idea of what he's doing would be a complete folly. Instead of a comedy having dumb fun, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective has smart fun.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective may seem silly, but it is packed with intelligent dialog and unforeseen humor that no one will ever experience until being introduced to this film. From funny motions to clever conversations, Jim Carrey lays on heavy slap-stick to create multiple laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey hilariously mugs his way through his break through role in this screwy comedy / mystery that wouldn't be as memorable as it is without an actor of his intense energy. Jim plays the title role, a hip, macho, wild kind of guy written and played as basically a cartoon character come to life; it's no surprise that the character would eventually get an actual animated series. The mystery element is handled pretty seriously, and everybody else here basically plays the straight man (or woman, or whatever, as it were) to his in-your-face antics. Ace is hired by the Miami Dolphins football team to retrieve their purloined mascot, the beloved Snowflake; soon he must rescue star quarterback Dan Marino (playing himself) as well. Ace is set up very well right from the start, intentionally bashing the hell out of a package that he delivers to a big ugly bruiser (Randall "Tex" Cobb, in a priceless cameo) as a cover while he really intends to take the man's dog and return it to its rightful owner. Not all of Carrey's catch phrases may have caught on, but some of them ("Allllrighty then!", "Liiiike a glove!", etc.) would quickly come to be quoted, particularly by kids who delighted in a character who goes so far as to "talk out of his ass" at one point. Some of Carrey's highlight sequences include his 'Mission: Impossible' spoof, which leads to the show stopping "Do NOT go in there!" moment, the send-up of "The Crying Game", the trip to the home of disgraced place kicker Ray Finkle ("I'm in Psycho Town, and Finkle's the mayor!"), and Ace's determined attempts to find one member of the Dolphins organization missing a stone from their championship ring. Carrey is surrounded by lots of familiar faces, with Courteney Cox, who had yet to achieve her greatest fame on 'Friends' at that time, Sean Young, truly a good sport considering the nature of her role, rap star Tone Loc, and Marino himself who is quite engaging and willingly makes fun of the whole Isotoner Gloves thing; rock solid character actors fill out supporting roles, such as Noble Willingham, Raynor Scheine (talk about a great name!), Troy Evans, Udo Kier, Frank Adonis, Tiny Ron, Bill Zuckert, Mark Margolis, John Capodice, and David Margulies. Alice Drummond deserves special mention for playing a sweet, loving, yet not-all- there mother who still finds the time to utter another of the movie's more show stopping lines, which you'll know when you hear it. Debuting movie director Tom Shadyac, who reworked Jack Bernstein's original screenplay with Carrey, is good at really keeping the pace going, managing to create great moments throughout. Originally intended as a less wild story, which had Rick Moranis attached to it, it became what it is today once Shadyac and Carrey got involved, and has created something of a brand name, with Carrey returning in one sequel, the aforementioned animated series, and a more recent direct to home video sequel with Josh Flitter playing Ace's son. True enough that it's crude, silly, and maybe too politically incorrect for some folks, but it still does today what it did 17 years ago, and that's consistently deliver the laughs. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie..so I must be part of that cult following it has gained (since the critics panned it in 1994). This movie is best watched with children in the room (if you don't have kids, go invite your neighbors!). Sure, there's a tad bit of violence (car windows being busted up with a bat) but the kids' laughter in the room is so refreshing. I am not a fan of fart and barf humor (not a fan of Dumb and Dumber) but this movie is SMART! And the factor of having cute animals in the film just gives it so much more charm (the monkey scene is adorable). Have you ever watched children at play as they make up stories and act out situations and characters?? That's Jim Carrey in this film. The imagination run wild, unfettered, in full bloom! Amazing. Have yet to see anything equal to it since...Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey's breakout role was as Ace Ventura Pet Detective who goes out looking for the missing pets that are an epidemic on our society today. he is hired by the Miami Dolphins football team to look for their missing mascot so it can be returned in time for the super bowl. Carrey is a master of disguise and he does a good job in this one. Their is a good well known cast supporting him in Courtney Cox (pre scream and Friends, I believe) and Sean Young, who almost steals this movie believe it or not. Of course, it is a dumb movie and one that you leave your brain at home. But it is also a dumb movie that makes you laugh and has some great bits to it but not enough to last the whole movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look at Jim Carrey's career, he had been around for nearly 15 years before Ace Ventura came along, doing voice and small featured parts. Ace Ventura was his first solo lead. It was also the first opportunity for him to go into zaniness overdrive, mixing a wide variety of outrageousnesses into his performance - costume, dialogue, delivery, hair, body language, and face pulling (or "gurning" as we call it here in the UK).Credit where credit is due - it worked brilliantly. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is an immensely entertaining film, and I am happy to recommend it highly. It has a decent story, and a bravura (and very funny) performance from Carrey.It put Carrey on the map. Not a bad thing. What it also did was make him the go-to guy for zany face-pulling parts. This worked a treat as far as The Mask (Carrey's immediate follow-up) was concerned: this was an even better vehicle for his brand of physical outrageousness. Dumb And Dumber followed, upping the ante even more.But then Carrey delivered a similarly mannered performance in Batman Forever, and it was the wrong performance in the wrong film. Three further movies followed cut from the same cloth, with diminishing returns (Liar, Liar wasn't bad). It wasn't until the straight role in The Truman Show that Carrey shook loose of the Ace Ventura legacy.Don't let that stop you seeing Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie came out in 1994. I saw this when it came out and I was 8 years old. Even at that time I understood the silly/adult humour. This movie is far greater than When Nature Calls.Again, this movie in my opinion was Jim Carrey when he was fresh. His oogly googaly faces were still new to me and the world ( I think the Mask was prior to this movie). This movie is like I stated silly but fun. It has a very interesting case for which Jim needs to unravel. I thought it was well planned out. I especially liked Einhorns character. She's a great villain.While it is a detective-esquire film it doesn't take itself too serious. It leaves you with just enough curiosity to stick around and see what happens next and Jim's character keeps you enticed. It has some action scenes but not like James Bond or the Die Hard series. It has suspense but its not too overbearing that makes you scratch your head. Its a friendly middle of the road filmIs it made for kids to watch? Not to sure, but regardless its a movie to put on for the laughs and such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny film that lives and dies with your response to Carrey's antics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways Jim Carrey is like Will Ferrell, both came from skit based comedy shows where they played reasonably bit roles and were generally found to be quite funny in moderation.Both somehow managed to wangle that into starring roles and survived and thrived largely on their wacky antics to short term stardom. This is where their career paths diverged? Ferrell still makes the same stupid film over, and over, and over again. "Look! I'm Will Ferrell making fun of an occupation by playing it dead seriously and yelling a lot when the situation probably doesn't require it! Look! I make increasingly unfunny comments and get nearly nude a lot." That's showing your range Will. Now go and invent some new "ad-libs" to crack the low IQs up when you spout them as you "improvise" on your next sh*tfest.Carrey branched out and did different things. (OK I admit that was just to allow me another cheap shot at Will Ferrell the most overrated "Star" in cinema today.) But for a while even while he was totally one-note and relying on his shtick to get laughs there was no denying it? Carrey's shtick was good.Carrey has a pretty unique, look and is willing to make himself look stupid at the drop of a hat, a key advantage in comedy. He has exaggerated features, elastic limbs and an incredibly flexible face capable of seemingly everything short of turning itself inside out ? and don't think he wouldn't have tried it for a laugh.Carrey can also come up with quotable one-liners and put downs with seemingly effortless ease.In Ace Ventura someone pointed the camera at him and said go nuts and he did just that. Without Carrey Ace Ventura 1 &amp; 2 would've been lousy, he is an explosion of comedic elements, trying literally everything including talking out of his arse for a laugh, and as this was so new and different at the time most of it worked.Ace Ventura is a pet detective given the case of finding the mascot of the Miami Dolphins NFL team just days before they appear in the Superbowl. His search is aided by Dolphins staff member Courteney Cox and slowed down by Police Chief Sean Young, who it must be said looks very ordinary in this role (if this was deliberate it was genius).When the clues lead all the way towards NFL greats the situation becomes admittedly ludicrous, but in a pretty inspired and creatively daring way, much better than a "silly" comedy might ordinarily deserve.But the plot is merely a coathanger for Carrey to drape his improvisational genius on; a shoe to jam his awkward mannerisms and throwaway jokes into; a garage for him to drive his bit characters and random shrieks into? I don't know where I'm going with this.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. A funny film that lives and dies with your response to Carrey's antics. I like him in small doses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the movie was only called Ace Ventura, than I guess it would be a spoiler, to talk about Jim Careys job/character in this movie. But since it's pretty obvious what he does, I won't be taking too much away. Not that that is really possible, because the story is pretty thin as it is.But Jim Carey (who alongside "The Mask") got pretty popular with this movie, has an energy that is really breath taking. Even if you don't really like his attitude or his characters, you can't deny his dedication to "milk" (no pun intended) the most out of everything he does. And the same goes here, where he acts pretty ridiculous, but while others might have had a safe routine, he dares to do things, you wouldn't expect to see ... And while the movie has it's flaws, it's a pretty enjoyable watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Carrey steals cracking comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pet detective Ace Ventura (Carrey) is assigned to track down Snowflake, the mascot of football team The Dolphins before the Superbowl.Jim Carrey, the man. Whether you love him or hate him you cannot deny his comic talent. In this 1994 crime comedy he plays a smart crazy pet detective who has the best catchphrases of any character, of any comedy, of any film, of anyone, ever.Opening with a delivery man kicking a package and destroying it with every step he takes and you feel as if you know this person and you simply have to love him for it. His character never slackens, always entertains and gets funnier with every scene. He is a comic master and he is this film.Carrey's performance does take the shine off a well written plot. The script is a great incentive for Ventura to be wacky and spontaneous.The pursuit of a missing dolphin is interesting, if not quite as intense as it should be. We see Ventura using his 'skill' and his 'charm' to give the older viewers plenty of laughs where the slapstick moments are undoubtedly aimed towards younger generations, however years on it is still as funny as when I was young. The sarcastic yet sophisticated undertones still remain classic.Flowing all the way through, this nineties comedy follows the mad detective in an intriguing investigation. There are lapses in the majority of modern comedies where the stereotypical hero has to redeem himself to find the answer and everything is super come the final piece but there are many twists and turns and a difference in the comic formulaic style here which gives the film a uniqueness that required Carrey's special touch. No clichés, stereotypes or cringing romance sequences that don't shine off the plot, unless you count the atrocious made for money sequel.The supporting cast are good enough to add some extra laughs but they are always standing in Carrey's superior shadow.Sharp, witty and exceptionally funny, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective justifies the genre and is worth watching whatever age you may be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that I had seen way back during schooldays and had rolled on the floor with laughter. The histrionics of Jim Carrey who was at his peak with movies such as Mask, Dumb and Dumber among others are amazing and memorable. Fourteen years after its release, I still enjoy the movie with the enthusiasm as I did then. As the name of the movie goes, Ace Ventura is a pet detective and an animal lover.Living in the house of a landlady who doesn&#x2019;t really like pets, Ace has a way to hide them. The scene where he enters a seemingly peaceful house and invites all animals unto him is so neatly done and adorable. Ace gets down to serious business when he is hired to investigate a missing dolphin called Snowflake, a mascot of a local Miami Dolphins which is believed to have been kidnapped before the next Super Bowl match.Ace finds a piece of stone from rings the 1984 champions wore and stars to find his target from a picture of that winning team. After exhausting the list, the lone one left is Ray Finkle who missed to hit the winning kick years ago and was later thrown out. Ace tells Lieutenant Einhorn that it has to be Finkle who kidnapped Snowflake because the dolphin got the former&#x2019;s jersey number 5 which did not amuse to the former footballer.While investigating Finkle&#x2019;s past, his dog sits on the Finkle&#x2019;s face with hair all over. Ace realizes that Einhorn is actually Finkle and that he kissed a man. The scene of Ace puking into a commode and brushing his mouth till his throat have inspired many comical scenes back in India too. And then, there is a final showdown in a dock warehouse where the good guy beats the bad guy. The funny moments are simply amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>film for the 12 yr old acted by someone as if he's a 12 yr old. Well, maybe a 14 yr old. And Carrey is good - if you're into these silly outrageous gags. Even Courteney Cox can't hold herself in some of the scenes.Carey is just plain silly to the max in this one. And the amount of one liners and comebacks is enough to be a book. The story, while convoluted, is kind of alright. Sean Young has a delicious part. But it does drag a bit and it does age well (comedy IS difficult). Even Dan Marino got in on the act.Funniest part to me is the slow mo-rewind. Hey, but that's only me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so hilarious... to think i thought it would be crap! Even from the start when he was destroying a box full of glass i thought it was great! Ace Ventura combines humour with animals... and gay men with football players. A very original concept with a very original storyline. I think they mean the same thing but anyway. I've always wanted to be able to do his hilarious hehehe laugh thingy but i just can't! Obviously i just suck at cool noises. A particularly funny bit i thought was when he kept opening and closing the sliding door while he was singing/screaming/making obnoxious loud noises A great movie. If you haven't seen it, then you should see it immediately, even if it means you'll be punished terribly afterwards somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey gets an excuse to be silly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film , as funny as it is, is just downright silly beginning to end. The director must have wanted to showcase Mr. Carrey's talent at being goofy and fill the screen up with as many sight-gags as possible. Ace (Jim Carrey) who is a Pet Detective (good laugh right there) summons himself to become the one man army that will find the Miami Dolphins Mascot 'Snowflake' (who has been kidnapped) and bring the Dolphins kidnappers to justice (the Ace Ventura way of course!). Courtney Cox joins the ride as Venturas info booth and main squeeze throughout the film, while the rest of the characters (Even Tone Loc!) are subjected to be at the butt of Mr. Venturas slew of anarchanistic humor. Yes the assorted bits in the film are funny but after a couple viewings the humor and content therein tends to grow off of you rather than on to you. The wonderful Dan Marino makes a rare appearance as himself, and there is quite a unique twist in the plot towards the end of the film so don't say I didn't warn you! Definitely better installment than the second film 'When Nature Calls' but still it loses its funniness after a few viewings. For Die-hard Jim Carrey fans or people who love sight gags by the bundle! 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irony, Exaggerated Humor, and Jim Carrey strike gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey turns a typical underdeveloped script into a comedic masterpiece with his absolute brilliance for comedic timing and his obvious love for the screen. If you do not like movies that are highly imaginative, over-the-top in body language and humor, and just a joy, this is not the movie for you. Ace Ventura is a character who is so strongly developed that his tone, body movement, and hairstyle are immediately identifiable by anyone who has seen the film. With countless quotable one-liners, it is a film that can be watched again and again. You'll capture something new each time. Would I recommend the film? Yes. To whom? Everyone. This film is an absolute A with no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jim Carrey classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies. It's an instant classic. I was laughing through the whole thing. Some people (and critics) say that Carrey acts too goofy in this. Almost like a live action cartoon character. I would agree that he plays it over the top, but it works. It's not like "Bruce Almighty" where it seemed, at least to me, that Jim was trying too hard for the laughs. And in Bruce, it didn't work. I read the critic reviews and, of course, most of them didn't like it. But how can you not like a movie with great memorable scenes like Ace getting into a fight with a mascot or Ace sneaking around to the "Mission Impossible" theme. It's just good stuff. This movie also has a good supporting cast. It has a really good story as well. Most critics said that the plot was thin, but at a closer look you can see the complex plot. Lots of layers. Of course I'm exaggerating a bit, but to say that the plot's thin is an under statement. I mean there's a double kidnapping, murder, plot twist, it has it all. I know now I'm over selling it, but it's really a good movie. It's also the first time Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac team up. They would go on later to do "Liar Liar" (which is another good Carrey movie) and, the movie mentioned earlier, "Bruce Almighty". So if you want to see a comedy classic, check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey makes it big with a comedy classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey's trademark manic comic style was implemented brilliantly in his first big screen hit. One of my favourite films of the nineties, Carrey is allowed to shine thanks to an excellent script by Jack Bernstein; Tom Shadyac, a director who knows how to control Carrey's talent and superb supporting performances from Courtney Cox and Sean Young. None of which Carrey had in the lamentable sequel 'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls'. Carrey's character, the eponymous Ace Ventura, works as 'pet detective' (finding lost pets) and is employed to find the dolphin mascot of the Miami Dolphins football team after it is kidnapped. Ace is portrayed as a kind of zany Doctor Dolittle who is far better at dealing with animals than people. In the words of Ace himself: "I don't do humans". The movie doesn't get too deep in terms of plot or character; it is principally concerned with arranging comic set-pieces for Carrey to strut his stuff. The pace of the movie never lets up with scene after scene almost tailor-made to show off Carrey's comic abilities. Though I personally don't think this is Carrey's best work, thirteen years later, this movie is just as funny as it ever was. Owain Bevan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I prefer the sequel to this movie, however, it is noteworthy as it is the film that started Jim Carrey on the fast road of success. Still, I am surprised he made it after this flick. I think it is okay, and that the humor is funny for the most part, however, at times Carrey goes so over the top that it almost gets embarrassing to watch. Throw in the fact that Dan Marino is my favorite quarterback of all time and seeing him in this is also painful. Still, it has its moments as Ave Ventura is a pet detective as the title implies and gets wrapped up with a missing Dolphin, the team mascot of the Dolphins no doubt. So that is all there is to it, or is there more. Funny revelations and some surprising scenes near the end make this movie for me in the end as does Carrey's performance in parts of the film. If only he were not so over the top in some scenes this film would have rated a higher score from me. Still, it was neat watching my Dolphins go to the Super Bowl, a feat that only the movies seem capable of making happen these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey is GOD!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(r#45)There are so many reasons for why I loved the nineties as a decade for movies, and Jim Carrey is one of those reasons. He created so much fantastic comedy during his raging box office career 1994-1999, it was inevitable that his works from 2000 and onward would be a bit of a disappointment. Now I'm not saying Bruce Almighty, The Grinch, Lemony Snicket or Me, Myself and Irene were bad (far from it, in fact), but none of them can hold a candle to his absolutely ingenious stuff from the nineties, Liar Liar, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Batman Forever, and Cable Guy (yes, the Cable guy! You can smite me all you want!) Now I've finally seen the movie that jump-started Carrey's career, Ace Ventura. Ironically I saw almost all of his later comedies before this, which could have been bad. In some cases a comedian doesn't find his ground until he's made a few movies to "warm up". Not so with Carrey! This is arguably his best performance, and it gives him some of the most iconic lines of his entire career. "Alriiiiighty then", would seem like the most obvious mention, but there's also "Looo-hoooo-ser", "Reeaaaa-lly", "If I'm not back in five minutes - just wait longer", "To capture ze dolphin you must zhink like ze dolphin!!", and I'm sure a lot more which I've forgot at the moment.To put it bluntly, Ace Ventura is possibly the funniest movie you will ever see. And I mean it. Tom Shadyac, who also worked with Carrey on the box office smashes Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar, as well as Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor, knows what the audience wants to see (Hint: it's not extensive character development!), and makes sure that Jim is never off screen for too long, never wasting too much time on the plot (which is of course redundant in these sort of films). No, as much screen time as possible is devoted to Jim shouting, babbling, wailing, coughing, barking, quoting Star Trek and Frankenstein, talking out of his ass, breaking things, and creating as much havoc as possible to the dismay of the more normal characters around him. And damn does it pay off! Totally devoid of the cheesy Hollywood "drama" that plagued Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty, and without the pointless subplots in The Mask that no one cared about anyway, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is precisely what it should be: Pure, unadulterated Carrey madness from beginning to end!A definite must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing a trailer for this on a video rental before it was released in the cinema and when I saw it, I knew it was going to be good. Jim Carrey stars as Ace Ventura a Pet Detective alas the name of the film. Its a simple story really, the Miami dolphins mascot (a dolphin) is stolen before the Super Bowl and Ace is hired to try and catch the crooks and rescue Snowflake (the dolphin).I saw this first when it came out in the cinema so I was quite young which meant some jokes I didn't quite get but still didn't take away from the fun. When I watched it several years later, it was great cause now I got all the jokes which made me even like it more. Rather like a Simpsons episode, watched when your younger compared to when your older.This film has all out Jim Carrey antics so there is never a dull moment. Highly recommended for everyone unless of course you can't stand Jim Carrey. After watching though please don't go around doing Jim Carrey impressions, Alllrighty then....8* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Carrey comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess movies like this are the ones that established Jim Carrey, and secured him a good, long career. It's definitely one of the more easily remembered of his films, and one of those that made him known as the comical genius that he is. The script allows for plenty of facial expressions and sounds by Carrey, and he makes the most of every second that he's on-screen. He is the very center of most of the comedy, and that's exactly the way it should be in his movies. The plot is pretty good, it allows for many entertaining scenes, and the mystery in it is pretty good, too. The film is primarily carried by the comedy, but the plot is carried forward by the mystery, which isn't a bad idea at all. The acting is all fairly good, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Carrey, of course, steals the show as the eccentric but smart pet detective, by the name of Ace Ventura. The characters are well-written, though admittedly not terribly deep. The film has a lot of crude jokes and gags, but they work well, as the same joke is rarely repeated, like it is in many other crude comedies(Scary Movie 2, various Adam Sandler films). The comedy is pretty good, very few jokes fall flat, and many gags will have you rolling around on the floor laughing, as well as Carrey's facial expressions and eccentric behavior throughout the film. All in all, a pretty good, typical Carrey comedy, but I guess it isn't anything special or unique. I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey, and fans of comedies in general. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura is a series of funny slapstick and gives us Jim Carrey, who assures reliance for a good laugh or twelve. With a rarity in witty humor, Ventura certainly provide some in the story of Ace (Carrey) called upon to retrieve the kidnapped Miami Dolphin mascot, the dolphin. What makes this original (besides the fact that rapper Tone Loc is in it, a class which only other students are All Dogs Go To Heaven I and II) is Carrey was the first person to work as hard as he good for a laugh, some attempts failing, most working. He has a style somewhat mimmicked by Will Ferrel, Ben Stiller and other so-so comedians. This movie takes a neat idea, and spins a goofy, disarming story around it.VERDICT: *** of **** Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the movie that made Jim Carrey a star.Jim plays the title character, a manic, overly energetic odd ball who goes around finding people's pets for a living (pet bounty hunter is more like it). When the Miami Dolphins mascot is kidnapped (dolphin napped?) Ace is hired by a pre-Friends fame Courteney Cox to find the missing mammal of the deep blue sea, and discovers a horrific conspiracy in which the local Miami tough girl police chief played by Sean Young is revealed to be a deranged ex-football player who had a sex change as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino (who plays himself) for a Super Bowl mishap back in 1984.Crude and undeniably funny, Jim does just about everything from talking with his rear end to impersonating Captain Kirk (which he did on "In Living Color" more than once) to stalking real life Miami football players to battling and exposing Sean Young, a talented actress who's once promising career has hit the skids ("Stripes" must be one of the few films where she gets to play a regular human being). The TV version deletes Jim's love scene with Courteney but also restores some deleted scenes where Jim is in the home town of the film's villain. I prefer "The Mask" though. More restraint on Jim's part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely Jim Carrey's BEST! My brother and I say it, and we both laughed non-stop! He really put the other police officers to shame when he found out the man's death was murder, not suicide. Knowing Ace Ventura was going to be good at cracking animal cases, no one else can top him. My favorite scene of the movie was the part when Ace came out the bathroom and telling everyone: "DO NOT GO IN THERE!" "WHOOOO!" That was a riot! Then all the policemen spits when they find out that Lois Einhorn was the disgraced Dolphin player Ray Finkle.

		<shortDescription>Young Carrey and his Magical Vehicle To Stardom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to watch Ace Ventura, Jim Carrey's breakthrough flick, in 2003, after seeing him in a lot of other movies. It is very clear that Jim Carrey has learned a lot of acting during his movie career. Watching him in, say, "Bruce Almighty" shows us a Jim Carrey who pulls physical comedy and mugs for the camera once in a while, but he's primarily an actor. In "Ace Ventura", he's nothing of the sort: he is a stand-up, physical comedian on 35mm film. The worst part is that it actually works. If Jim Carrey hadn't starred in this movie, it would most certainly have been condemned to be a bargain bin comedy, watched by almost nobody and forgotten by all of them. The story in itself is poorly written, tries to fit itself into a farcical version of a murder mystery framework, but the narrative is complex, overworked and deadeningly confusing. Jim Carrey manages to do a rare thing in cinema: he simultaneously drags the film's merits down and perks them up. This film ONLY works because Jim Carrey is kind enough to point out that this movie is SO dumb, even the main character can't take it seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura:Pet Detective is a fantastic movie which was a breath of fresh air in the relatively boring 1994 (1994 was boring for films in my opinion).Jim Carrey excels here as the pet detective on the case to find the Miami Dolphins mascot (a dolphin obviously). Throughout the film, we are treated (or tortured depending on your view) to Jim Carrey's constant noises and silly faces and goody body language. Whilst it seems Carrey does go over the top at times, it is still enjoyable enough if you're in the right mood.Courtney Cox and Sean Young are also here and play their roles well. But Carrey steals the show and did make an impact in 1994. I remember coming out of the cinema in 1994 and seeing loads of kids emulating Ace Ventura.All in all, a good film but one question has been on my mind since-are there any real pet detectives out there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Made Jim Carrey A Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this film was released, I was familiar with Jim Carrey. I used to be a loyal viewer of the TV series, "In Living Color" where he had joined the rest of the cast in sketch comedy shenanigans. The sketches with Carrey were among my favorite ones on the show so naturally I was optimistic about seeing this film. Eight years later, I can still laugh at several of its scenes. Carrey is appropriately cast as the title character, a Miami police detective who chooses to solve animal kidnappings rather than murder cases. His latest case has him seeking out the Miami Dolphins' kidnapped dolphin mascot and he has only until the Super Bowl to do it. The team's former quarterback, Dan Marino has an amusing cameo as himself and the supporting cast (especially rapper Tone Loc as Ace's cop friend) holds up extremely well. After this film's surprising success, a neverending stream of follow up offers (including an "Ace Ventura" sequel the following year) came through for sudden overnight star Carrey. However, none have reached the comedic heights of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]Yes. Ace Ventura is a detective. A very unusual detective. He takes a detective job with Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox), who wants him to find the Miami Dolphins mascot, with only two weeks remaining until the Super-bowl.Ace (Carrey), figures out it is someone wanting revenge on the now kidnapped Dan Marino (Himself), Ray Finkle. But Ray can't be found. So, he determines that Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), is not Lois Einhorn because she is a dead hiker, but in fact Lois Einhorn is indeed Ray Finkle.He gets the mascot and Dan Marino back, just in time for the Super-bowl. And he ends up kicking the fire out of the New York Jets mascot.This is not good -- not bad -- but it is a hell of a lot better then part two.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Jim Carrey, this is the movie for you. However, if you find that Jim Carrey's humour is irritating, don't bother!Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura will leave Jim Carrey fans laughing for ages. It certainly left me laughing. First, the idea of a 'Pet Detective' is interesting. As the tagline says - he's the only one there is. And as the only one there is, he does a great job.It's the typical Jim Carrey humour - the funny faces, the wild jokes, and of course, in this movie, there's the crazy hairstyle that must have kept Jim Carrey in Hair and Makeup for hours.Probably the best scene in the movie is when Ace asks Melissa (played by Courtney Cox) to pretend that she's having him comitted to a mental institution in order to sneak into the storage room to look through old junk for clues. This is the scene where he gets even wilder(not to mention his hair), dressed in boots and a ballerina outfit, acting like a professional football player - trust me, it will have you in stitches!Also look out for Dan Marino that makes an appearance as himself.Even if you're not a Jim Carrey fan, you'll understand why this was the movie that got Jim Carrey known and brought him to where he is today.I give this movie 8/10 - Jim Carrey fans can't miss it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and loved it all over again. I have to admit, I had to see the 'old' Carrey after watching 'The Majestic'. He did a great job in both, but I just need to see him 'rubber' his face up once in a while.Just as the first time I watched this film, I laughed and laughed and laughed through the whole thing. A class act as in 'The Majestic' but in his whacky fun and hilarious way I'm used to.Whether its timing. Originality. Funny faces. Or noises and impersonations. This film will have you laughing out loud like you never have before. Or if you've seen it, laughing out loud like you used to.Lastly, I almost had forgotten that Courtney Cox was in this one. It was a pleasant recalling to see her adorable albeit muted character next to Carrey's antics. They compliment each other greatly.10/10 for making me laugh again. thank you.</fullReview>

But make no mistake, without the overdone, but truly effective, acting by this comic genius the movie wouldn't be given the attention it did. If there were an Oscar for best acting in a comedy, Carrey would get it without a doubt in my mind. But hey, judge for yourself. A movie I'd recommend to anyone. Even if you don't like facial comedy you'll have to admit that it truly is a funny movie.The only downside to this one is a weak ending, but hey, is there a comedy without it? Funny, absolutely stuffed with memorable scenes and let's not forget about Carrey, a truly talented actor, may it be this comedies or deeply touching movies that make you want to linch the Oscar people.An unmissable experience. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would definitely have to say that this film is not for everyone, because if you don't like Jim Carrey's nuttiness, then you probably won't like the film. "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is just that, Jim Carrey acting like a nut throughout the whole movie. There are so many unforgettable lines and scenes in this movie that you can recite and have a good time with your buddies.If you haven't seen this movie, then you may not want to keep reading. But if you have seen this movie, read on!The opening sequence to this film is probably the funniest opening sequence I've EVER seen in a movie. I'll never forget how hard I laughed during the scene. If you watch this opening sequence and don't at least chuckle a little, then you must have some serious problems!The only complaint I have about the movie is the ending, I thought it was just a bit too bizarre for me. And by this I mean (MAJOR SPOILER) that Einhorn IS Finkle! That is just too weird for me, but it still is funny the way they explained it.If you get a chance watch the commentary on the DVD, it's got some really cool information in there. Well, that's all I'd like to say about the movie, thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>standard Carrey comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most likely one of the funnier Carrey movies of this lifetime, Ace Ventura puts itself on the shelf next to his other greats like Liar Liar. The movie centers around the kidnapping of the Miami Dolphin's mascot, Snowball. Carrey constantly displays his typical sense of humor, some times silly, sometimes ridiculous, yet always decently funny. His surrounding cast makes for great play and return jokes.I also noticed that there was a scene edited from the release. The movie's case says "contains scenes not shown in theaters,' but I never saw it in theaters, so I don't know which scenes those are. However, when I saw it on TV edit, the one scene accompanied by that oh-so familiar music was cut, and replaced by one in which Ventura goes into a small bar in Ray Finkle's hometown and almost gets in barfight. It was this scene that is not on the cassette. If anybody can venture any ideas, feel free to put them forward in an email.Overall, a good movie with standard Carrey comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Gave Jim A Career He Could Easily Carrey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Jim Carrey is a man who can do anything. He's one very funny comedian and he is hilarious in whatever he does. Why is he now doing series films? Just to get an award? Well more power to you, Jim.This is the film that started it all! Jim used to be on In Living Color with the Wayans brothers. In Ace Ventura, Jim plays Ace, a pet detective. One day he goes undercover as an HDS delivery man and hilariously carries a package up to Randall "Tex" Cobb, who's got a shih tzu. Ace is fond of the dog. He has Randall sign then leaves. It doesn't take Randall too long to find out his dog was replaced with a fake one. See that dog was kidnapped by him. Ace hid him in his jacket and they jumped in Ace's car, which had trouble starting. Randall "Tex" Cobb popped up and began smashing it with a bat. The car started up and left Cobb in the dust. The dog was returned to its owner. That night, Snowflake, a prized dolphin belonging to the Miami Dolphins is kidnapped, so Ace is on the case. He goes about his work in a hilarious way. He meets Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) and Lt. Einhorn (Sean Young). Einhorn doesn't take kindly to Ace. Ace can even talk out of his ass; he get's some insider information from Woodstock, his information friend. One night, Melissa's partner, Roger Podacter is murdered. They said it was suicide: jumping from a high rise. Ace investigates the case himself and thinks otherwise; Ace and Melissa go to her rich friend, Camp's party one night. Ace goes looking in a giant fish tank for Snowflake. Instead, he finds a man-eating shark; Ace also comes to the conclusion that Snowflake was kidnapped by a Miami Dolphin. He finds this out when he finds part of it in the fish tank, so he must match it up with it's twin. He checks the ring fingers of everyone, but comes up empty. Then one night, Ace discovers an unknown player named Ray Finkle. He joined the game late so Ace becomes suspicious of him, so he travels to Ray's home town and meets Ray's parents. Mom bakes Ace cookies "they're little footballs!" and Dad who greeted Ace with a shot gun barrel to the head. Ace also learns that Ray Finkle had lost the big game and blamed it on Dan Marino and wanted deadly revenge. It said so all over his room. Ace soon learns that Ray was put in an institution. Soin cognito as a nut, he goes on the grounds and discovers a connection between Finkle and Lt. Einhorn. It takes a while but he soon learns the devastating truth! Finkle has become Einhorn! Dan Marino has also been kidnapped, so Ace goes to rescue him and Snowflake. He engages in battle with Einhorn and shows everyone the truth. So Ace Ventura has saved the day! At the football game, Ace saw a rare Albino pigeon worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He's been looking for it forever, but a guy in an eagle costume made it fly away, so Ace beats him up. And there you have it. It's a good movie. It's got comedy and mystery. It was followed by Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, where the animal saving dunderhead travels to Africa on a case to save a bat. That one wasn't as good.--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey? Isn't that the "white guy" from In Living Color? That's what America said when they sat down in the cinema to watch Ace Ventura. A movie full of A- actors. No "big" name leading the bunch. Jim Carrey, a television star in both Canada and the U.S., hadn't done a big movie since Once Bitten and Earth Girls are Easy. Now, he was the lead actor in a summer comedy that had no limits. To his advantage, Carrey took it and pushed it to the limit. It would be the film that launched his career into movie stardom. Your classic detective story line, it plays off from a Thin Man kind of plot into a 90's screw ball comedy. A great story none the less, a terrific supporting cast and a great ending. A laugh out loud comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is better than you think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by: Tom Shadyac. Written by: Jack Bernstein, Jim Carrey, and Tom Shadyac. Starring: Jim Carrey. Co-Starring: Courtney Cox, Sean Young, Tone Loc and Dan Marino.Favorite line: "If I'd been drinking out of the toilet I might have been killed."*******WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead*******Believe it or not, but Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is one of the pinnacle movies of the 90s. It launched Jim Carrey's career and was the first "gross-out/moron" comedy to hit it big, both of which have went on to make millions. Personally, I can't even remember any hype when Ace came out in the theatres, but through strong word-of-mouth, we finally went and saw it in, I think, its fifth week of release. I had never laughed so hard in a theatre before (and wouldn't for another five years). Each scene was so off-the-wall and so outrageous you couldn't help but laugh. The movie was chalk-full of silly lines and catchphrases that they were just as funny when you repeated them later in similar situations (in fact I still say lines out of this movie when the situation presents itself). What's more, for those of us who were in the know and up until the sequel, Ace was a pop icon. At the time there was a uniqueness about this film, even after Dumb and Dumber and its more outrageous scenes came out later that year, Ace Ventura was still the fan favorite because it was the first and (still is) the most genuine.Plot/Story: The plot is paper thin. This is usually a bad thing, but making something complex out of a movie like this would have been counterproductive and could very easily have ruined it. The plot serves as a central point to keep the movie going, while still allowing Carrey run rampant all over the screen. Unlike most of the copycats since, you didn't have to believe something like Dan Marino and Snowflake could (or would) be kidnapped two weeks before the Super Bowl. Shadyac and Carrey weren't trying to insult your intelligence, they were trying to entertain you and in that respect the plot served its purpose.Acting: You wanna know why Carrey made $20 million for his movies? Because he nailed his character here and you couldn't have asked for a better performance from anyone. That said, the only other notable performance came from Tone Loc (of all people), as Emilio. Sean Young and Courtney Cox did what they needed too, but they didn't do anything I couldn't do. Dan Marino was acting as "himself," and while it's funny to watch, the reality is he sucked... unless of course he was supposed to look like he sucked in which case he was brilliant. Just kidding, he sucked, otherwise Hollywood would have been kicking his door down.Characters: Because of its genre, this category is often overlooked, but THIS is what really made the movie for me, the characters. As outrageous as many of them were, I've always had a feeling that these were realistic portrayals. I know that sounds crazy, but tell me after watching Ace destroy the UPS package in the beginning of the movie, that everything he did after that seemed normal for him. Sure the stuff he did was nuts, and it likely shocked you, but that was Ace and that's how he did things. What really worked, though, is this: out of all the "moron" films since, how many of the morons were just misunderstood geniuses? None, not a damn one, that's why Ace was fun and the movie was great, because he wasn't stupid, just strange. Everyone in the movie was a character, even Dan Marino who was playing "himself." The reason a lot of the characters worked was because they were all extensions of the real person playing them (although I doubt Sean Young was ever a man...). You don't notice that in most films... it was as though Bernstein wrote each character to fit the actor.Effects/Setting: Seeing scenes of Miami for two hours is never a bad thing, I can't think of a better place. The sun was always out, keeping the film light and upbeat. There's not much else to say, the location was a perfect fit with the movie's misfit style.Score/Soundtrack: Same deal as the setting, it worked because there wasn't anything wrong with it. The Mission: Impossible theme and "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" spoofs were great fun. These two categories are what typically do "it" for other films, but Ace Ventura's tech people did their jobs and got out of Carrey's way.Many will say out of all the movies in 1994, why did you pick Ace Ventura, what was wrong Forest Gump or The Lion King or Pulp Fiction? They were critically acclaimed and audiences loved them. My answer is they were no fun. Forest Gump is touching, but hardly stacks against the real tearjerkers, The Lion King is not Aladdin and never will be, and Pulp Fiction makes my head hurt, I still don't get the purpose of not knowing what's going on for two hours until the very end. P*** on all that, audiences clamored to see those because they were supposed too. If you ever get a chance to read the reviews on Ace you'll hear the critics complain about the sexual innuendos and the toilet humor, yet you'll notice the film was rated PG. By today's standards (like There's Something About Mary which, ironically, got great reviews), Ace Ventura is tame, hell the only thing Ace had in his hair was gel... I may not seem grown up for liking this film, but so what, a true intellectual doesn't watch movies, he reads books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the first time I was going to watch this movie I thought it would be one of the dumbest movies ever made. Boy, I was wrong. This movie has some of the best one-liners I've ever heard and one of the best comedians of all time in my opinion. That would be the one and only Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey has the funniest hair style I have ever seen. This movie has a good plot too. It has a real detective plot, but it's the mystery of a missing dolphin. This movie is hilarious though. The plot is basically this: Ace Ventura is detective for animals. He is very good at what he does. Meanwhile a rare dolphin is stolen during superbowl week. This dolphin by the name of Snowflake is the mascot for the Miami dolphins. Ace (Carrey) is hired to find the dolphin just in time for the superbowl. Other strange stuff happen during this time, but as you're watching this movie have a fun time laughing you're head off. Ace Ventura will do some of the wackiest things to solve a mystery. I'm sure you'll have fun when he goes in to the mental institution. Ace Ventura gets 10/10. Already than, take care now bye bye than!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Jim Carrey for a long time. Ever since "In Living Color". I used to watch that show when I was young just to see his face and laugh at his humor. In Ace Ventura, he plays a goofy and overly comedic pet detective who is sent to save Dan Marino (who has a cameo in this) and the Miami Dolphins mascot: a whale. I have and always will adore the comic genius of Jim Carrey. The funniest scenes were when he was driving and one of the evil henchmen shoots at him and Ace catches the bullet with his teeth! And when he tried to feed a whale some fish and comes out with his clothes practically ripped up! I liked the rock concert scene where we see Ace dancing to the music! And when he was running around in the mental hospital wearing a ballet tutu, and when he was closing and opening a glass door screaming! The funniest line in the movie was, "I'm in Psychoville! And Ray Finkle is the mayor!" This movie gets my laughing every time! Jim Carrey has a lot of potential to be funny and to please his public! That's why he is the advanced, colorful, and impeccable comedian that he is today! He makes the only-can-play-one-role Adam Sandler and the perverted Rob Schidner look like talentless nobodies. Heck, Jim Carrey is like Moe, Larry, Curly and Shemp combined in one! So if you really want to see Jim Carrey shine, rent Ace Ventura parts 1 and 2 and some of his other works as well. And the best thing is that even though this movie is a little bit vulgar, the vulgarity isn't even taken over the top like it was in Dumb and Dumber! Rent it today! Long live Jim Carrey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in which Jim Carret brokeout. It made me laugh the first times I saw it then each time got worse. Carrey is the zany pet detective that goes in search of the Miami Dolphins missing mascot. The catchphrases and gestures were very popular and inspired every kid that thought they were funny to act like Jim Carrey. Ace has some laughs but gets old quick. The sequel is worse. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's Best Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is my all-time favorite Jim Carrey movie. It has to be one of his funniest films ever! The story centers around the Miami Dolphins and that their prize mascot, Snowflake, has been stolen! Ace Ventura: Pet Detective must search through all of Miami looking for clues and motives on the kidnapping and makes a complete fool of himself at the same time! He's the best man for the job, actually he's the only man for the job! If you wanted to see Jim Carrey before he was the Grinch then this is the movie to see! Courtney Cox is also in the movie, playing an executive of the Dolphins named Melissa Robinson, Ace's love interest in the movie. Emilio (Tone Loc) is Carrey's police friend and Dan Marino (my favorite quarterback) has a role too! Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) is the bad cop in the movie, always belittling Ace for everything with the big fat cop guy, Aguado (John Capodice).It's also funny because nobody takes Ace Ventura seriously because he is a pet detective. However, he is extremely intelligent and makes fools out of the Florida police on several occasions.The cast of the film is great and it includes a cameo of former Miami coach, Don Shula. It has a much better cast than the second (and last) Ace Ventura film.Some might say Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a horrible movie. The plot may be a bit unusual, but I assure you this is a hilarious movie with an interesting (albeit bizzare) twist. You will actually enjoy yourself watching a movie which is quite hard to do with most of the crap that has come out this year!I recommend this on VHS or DVD, both are readily available. For the true hardcore fans of the film, you will be slightly disappointed like me. The NBC TV version of this film contains additional scenes that weren't on the DVD or VHS :(. The DVD is one of the older ones with no special features. Unless you consider the trailer and director comments to be special. I don't. However, if you're a Carrey fan then get it!P.S. Some of the scenes removed include a scene with Ace singing on stage, Ace going into a bar looking for Ray Finkle, talking to Melissa Robinson in a car, and other little extensions on scenes. Let's just hope one day there will be a director's cut!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Carrey's manic brand of humour, you're golden.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt a one man show. Cast most other actors in the lead role and the movie may well have sunk without trace, but with Carrey as "Ace", you've got the makings of a comedy classic. The humour is definitely not for everybody, and if you express your love for the film I guarantee that some people will think you nuts. Nevertheless, if absurdity's your bag, you will almost certainly enjoy this. Other actors fade into insignificance when confronted by Carrey's comic genius. The one person who almost manages to keep pace with him is Sean Young, who displays a hitherto untapped flair for comedy in a VERY strange role. Then again, the entire movie can be seen as 'strange'. The football players also do well. There is little attempt to make the 'plot' at all logical, but that hardly matters when you can't stop laughing. Critical dissection of this film is totally inappropriate; you either love it or hate it. Frankly, I love it. Kudos to Hollywood for putting money into such an odd idea and making the then-unknown Carrey into an international star. This is a gem.BEST LINE: "Be sure that you {get the plumbing checked}. If I'd been drinking out of the toilet, I might've been killed."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey at his damn funniest! Here, Jim uses his wacky sense of humour to bring to life the character of Ace Ventura, the world's only pet detective. Ace, with the help of gorgeous brunette Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox-Arquette, pre-Friends era) try to solve a mystery about the whereabouts of a dolphin, and also, Ray Finkle.With so many catch-phrases (like 'Reheheally?', 'Looohoooseerrrrr' and 'Do *NOT* go in there!) and Jim's awesome style of in-yer-face comedy, 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective' is one of Jim's biggest money-makers (despite not even having a million-dollar pay check), and shows Jim at his best.Courteney Cox (then, without the -Arquette attached)'s performance of Melissa is good, but not exactly great. But that's only because, she's had better characters in other projects, (namely Monica Gellar on NBC's 'Friends' and Wes Craven's 'Scream' Trilogy's bitchy anchor woman, Gale Weathers. )All-in-all, this movie is great for little kids, and little kids at heart, and will no doubt put a smile on your face. Rent it out (again) now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember what a big hit this movie was when it came out. I took the kids and was ok with most of it, (kids loved it of course) but I'm surprised nobody has objected to the homophobic programming which is the central joke of the whole movie.Think about it. About 10 million kids in the first two weeks got permanently imprinted with the inescapable idea that it is better to lick out a toilet bowl than for two men to touch lips. In fact, the toilet bowl plunger is presented as the cure. And the entire police force vomits in unison when they learn this horrible secret. With propaganda like this, who needs Jesse Helms?No question its a great sight gag (Carrey with the plunger). But suppose it had been discovered that instead of a penis the female police lieutenant had two african parents? (Say some recessive gene left her skin white.) Leave the rest of the movie the same, and what would you think then?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Alive. It's Alive! Jim Carrey's roadway to superstar status begins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994 when Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was released many in the acting establishment felt the film to be unacceptable. And yet millions of people including myself and Jim Carrey still can't stop laughing. Clearly one of the hits of 1994, Jim Carrey gives a brilliant and funny performance that helped launch his superstar career. You have it Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) simply is the best there is. In fact, he's the only one there is! Pet Detective (Jim Carrey) ventures out to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot after it is kidnapped from team headquarters just a week before the Super Bowl, to worsen matters dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is abducted. Along the way the good and the bad happen first a meeting with dolphin secretary Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) leads to a blast-off bed moving romance! Great acting by Cox hey she's got talent. I must say that Courteney Cox is a great piece of eye candy! Literally speaking Courteney is my chocolate delight! Plus Ace goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, and his investigation of the Miami Dolphins team simply woos everyone as the persistent search for the missing mascot continues with a clue that is linked to a missing AFC Championship Ring from 1984. Boy does the fun begin then all starting with Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (A.K.A. Ray Finkle), when Ace takes a trip to nearby Collier County to meet with Finkle's parents he discovers the revenge and hate Finkle had for Marino and the dolphins after missing that critical field goal in the Super Bowl. I must mention to all you researchers, archivists, and investigators that have interest in The Florida Skunk Ape which is said to actually roam the woods of Collier County never fear you should hire a professional that being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective! I know the movie may see or spell it Culler County, but they actually mean Collier county and I feel Collier is more suitable. I just felt that a Skunk Ape mention was a nice little note to add to my Pet Detective comment! Now finally Ventura learns the horrible truth that Einhorn is really Finkle and is also guilty of the kidnapping of both Marino and the dolphin. Can you believe Einhorn a man! Better late than never Marino and the dolphin mascot back for the second half of the Super Bowl! All great performances from Carrey, Cox, Sean Young, and Tone Loc. So if you haven't watched, please do but I'm sure your like the millions who have watched Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Plenty of laughs plus enjoy the film that really made Jim Carrey a star. This is much better than some of Carrey's more overrated works like Liar Liar and The Truman Show.</fullReview>

He has shown us his skills in drama (Truman Show, Man on the Moon) and has made us cover our faces in slight disgust (Dumb and Dumber) but in Ace Venura (which I have to admit, I avoided seeing for quite some time) he showed us how capable he was with writing the screen play mostly himself and going out for more than cheap laughs. Besides Carrey, however, the acting was not incredibly. With cameos from Tone Loc and others, the cast was to say at least an interesting bunch and I give this movie a B+.</fullReview>

But also the storyline is not bad for a comedy, there are really some cool twists in the story. Don't get me wrong, it's not worth an Oscar for best screenplay, but it's pretty enjoyable. Besides The Truman Show, I think this is Jim Carreys best work (haven't seen Man On The Moon yet).

		<fullReview>I like Jim Carrey's later stuff. MAN ON THE MOON was good, LIAR LAIR was good, and apparently THE TRUMAN SHOW (never saw it) was good, but I didn't care so much for his early stuff. I think ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE was OK, but nothing great. It's certainly better than DUMB AND DUMBER, anyway.Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is an eccentric detective who only takes cases about animals. When the Dolphins mascot is kidnapped a few days before the Superbowl, he comes in to investigate. Many of the police, including Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) don't approve of Ace Ventura, but he won't let them get to him. He also starts to fall in love with Dolphin employee Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox).The plot is actually better than I would have expected in such a movie, which isn't too much. There are quite a few funny parts, but there are some jokes and gags that don't work. The acting is OK, even though Jim Carrey overacts way too much at this stage in his career. Courtney Cox, I think, did the best acting job in the movie.It's worth watching if on TV, but I wouldn't say it's worth buying or renting. Jim Carrey fans will, of course, love this movie and probably not MAN ON THE MOON. For me, it's the other way around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, if it wasn't for Jim Carrey, this film would have died and had no chance of survival. The plot of a football mascot, the dolphin snowflake, is one of the most potentially uninteresting ideas ever written for film. Also, the acting and lines aren't all that red hot, especially Sean Young's "list pet dick. How would you like me to make your life a living hell?". However, Jim Carrey saves the day with his craziest, funniest comic creation to date, Ace Ventura! Jim Carrey's creative comic genius takes full control of the situation and has the audience in stitches! I'll never forget the "I'd like to ass you a few questions" bit, or when he comes out of the bathroom sopping wet and says "Do not go in there. WHOOOO!". Man oh man, Jim Carrey really does know how to make a person laugh, and here, he proves he can do it to the fullest of his abilities, regardless of the intelligence or quality of the script.</fullReview>

This film spawned a whole bunch of look-a-likes for carrey, and it wasn't until Cable Guy came out, that I figured out he was seriously a good actor. This effort is funny, to a certain extent, the butt talking, etc. can be enjoyable. But, after a little while it gets a little tiresome.

		<fullReview>The title of this comment is how I describe Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Why? It proves that low-brow humor isn't dead, and you don't have to be ashamed of laughing at it. Like "Home Alone," four years earlier it was slammed by the critics,and admired by the fans. Unlike "Home Alone," none of the critics ever changed their minds. When I first saw it, I thought it may have had a few good laughs, but instead, the laughs never stopped. The scene where Ace catches a bullet in his teeth was a bit overblown, but then so was the rest of the movie, and it worked, so I'm not complaining. On the other hand, the sequel wasn't so hot, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon Spin-Off based on this comedy classic suffers from the same problems as most Saturday Morning Cartoons based on successful movies...endless repetition of notable catch-phrases. Every so often, Citadel Press publishes a series of books compiling notable films of each decade. If the publish a "Films of the Nineties" book, they would be foolish to exclude "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie never ceases to make me laugh. It may not be the best comedy in terms of photography and storyline, but it has it where it counts, the snappy dialog, smart-ass comebacks and truly bizarre sub-characters.I must say if you aren't amused by some 'elementary school' level humor, this may not be the film for you. But if you enjoy Tommy Boy, Austin Powers, South Park or want a break from seroius filmmaking, you will thoroughly laugh your tail off. The countless quirks that Jim Carrey creates throughout this film are a joy to watch. His ability to uses the physical space, his body, voice and his expressions are unmatched by anyone I've seen in years. His character Ace Ventura is so off the wall, that virtually anything is possible on screen. It makes me wonder how much of the characters actions and expressions were directed, and how much was Carrey letting himself go and seeing where it ends up.Since this film, Carrey has shown he really has some range as an actor. Specifically Truman Show and the soon to be released Andy Kaufman story. But to me, this is one picture that may not be his best, but will always be one of the funniest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't watch this film only once and instantly judge it to be bad because I'm sorry to say I made that mistake. When I first saw "Ace Ventura" in my friend's house, it seemed to be absolutely terrible. I guess it was because at that time I just didn't like Jim Carrey's brainless and ridiculous overacting. He's crazy-looking rubber face didn't have a single normal expression during the film. When I watched it again, I loved it. Somehow I saw the light... Carrey's acting (the one thing I used to despise) turned out to be the big key of the film. It was something different, it was personal, peculiar and simply brilliant. I was happy to notice that sequel is just as hilarious as this one. Jim Carrey is a gifted comedian but I still think "Dumb and dumber" was a total waste of he's talents. Still, "Liar, Liar" and "The Cable guy" are much better comedies than "Ace Ventura" and the best Carrey movie so far is the magnificent "Truman show". I'm looking forward to see more of that more serious stuff, because Jim really knows how to handle it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two 'Ace Ventura' movies are some of the most funny movies around. This one, in particular, probably made Jim Carrey famous. It is very funny, with facial expressions, the hair-do, the jokes, it is all very funny. The start, especially, I thought was extremely funny. A detective who specializes in animals, is sent to fine the mascot of the Miami Dolphins, and he has a great way of doing it. I am a big fan of Jim Carrey's, and if you are too, this film will definitely not disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this isn't the best comedy performance this decade, I don't know what is. The thing is, in this movie Carrey's best moments don't come from his facial exhibitions, like they usually do, but from some hilarious jokes. Character of Ace Ventura is brilliant, and, if you ask me, truly somebody to look up to (intellingent, funny and wacko!). It's unfortunate that the Legend of Ace was later spoilt with the unfunny sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's crazy antics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pet Detective Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is the man you call when crimes happen to animals. When Miami Dolphins' mascot dolphin Snowflake is stolen from its watertank, team official Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox) must ask Ace Ventura to investigate. Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) hates the brash pet detective, but he always seems to be out-think everyone.Jim Carrey has made a virtue of going over the top. And he is extremely virtuous in this movie. He's at his rubbery best playing with animals and talking thru his butt. It's shocking at first. Then it gets cute. Then it gets a bit tired but the movie ends before it became annoying. For some, the movie probably didn't end soon enough.The antics get tiring. It just doesn't end. Although the final reveal is hilarious. The movie is just good enough to be fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of The First Jim Carrey !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good comedy. Back then (Jim Carrey) was just another comedian who wants to make his first big hit. Actually his unique talent is so visible here; you've got to notice that this is a guy how was living his whole life in front of the TV. He owed so much to classic movies, TV shows and programs, even the cartoon. (Carrey) is the perfect comedian of the 1990s where all the legacy of Hollywood can be viewed through TV reruns, or VHS. So he assimilated all of that finely then represented it with mad personal touch to an extent made him a walking spoof machine, or a live episode of SNL.Still too much of something is bad enough, as after his big breakthrough here, the producers will leave him make what he wants, the way he wants, and that just really created absolute unbearable (Carrey)'s riot on screen. You can feel that easily in (Dumb &amp; Dumber - 1994), (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls - 1995), and then its climax in (The Cable Guy - 1996). They were all too rude, disgusting, and wildly nasty. So, at the time we were asking "What this rubbery face is going to do next ?!!". But the man proved that he can be more than loud screams or frat jokes. After that, the more sane and serious Carry had been born : (The Truman Show - 1998), (Man on the Moon - 1999), and (The Majestic - 2001). Then he managed to be comic and somehow sane in later movies like (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events - 2004), (Fun with Dick and Jane - 2005), and (Horton Hears a Who! - 2008).Despite couple of freely disgusting lines, and the long scene of talking out of the butt, I must admit that (Ace Ventura Pet Detective) is even more laughable than (Carrey)'s next hit and my cult classic favorite (The Mask - 1994). There are too many too good moments. I still love the bit where he parodied being in dangerous (while there isn't any !) on the music of (Mission: Impossible), also the way he plays himself in slow motion, I think these are things can't be written in a script. Moreover, notice the way (Carrey) delivers his lines; that's confident, hot, and exceptional. Not to mention the outrageous plot twist, and the scene of stripping down (Sean Young) to her underwear, although I'm not by any chance a fan of her, but for sure I'm a fan of her in this moment !At last, one piece of advice : run as fast as you can from the sequel, it's one of the ugliest movies ever made, where there is nothing but the largest amount of spit, excrements, and horrible images that force you to vomit not to smile at all !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ace is a little bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura-Pet Detective is about a detective named Ace who is trying to retrieve stolen items that were stolen from the Miami Dolphins. I thought that Jim Carrey was too weird for his part. Yes, he was funny, but some things go too far. Courtney Cox was amazing in this film, but that's about it. The plot was mediocre and the script was fairly weak. But, Cox and sometimes Carrey kept me watching this film. The best part of this film was the ending(a very good ending). My mouth dropped open when Lois Einhorn was actually Ray Finkle. Overall, this movie is sub par, but Carrey kicked off his career somewhat decent. This film is not as good as The Mask or Liar Liar. But if you like Carrey and his acting, you should check this film out. My rating is 6/10.</fullReview>

In my case the third time was not the charm and the movie was not funny and really hasn't been since. However, just for the history and the possibility of really deep laughs you should give Ace a shot.Maybe Jimbo will pull an Ace out of his sleeve and revive the character in the future as really the laughs stop here. The sequel should be skipped and really we shouldn't have hopes for any form of revival.Heck, the movie has Dan Marino in it and a pot shot at the Dolphins. So why not check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but lacking in plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that really kick-started the careers of Jim Carrey and, to a lesser extent, Courteney Cox although it is Carrey who makes this movie all his own by his wild and energetic performance as a half-insane Pet Detective. In case you're wondering that's a detective who tracks down missing animals. Ace is a great character, with his wacky clothes, groovy swagger, wild hair (LOVE that do) and unpredictable behaviour. He's a page right out of Howlin' Mad Murdock's biography.Courteney Cox plays a boss for the Miami Dolphins who hires Ace to find their missing cetacean mascot Snowflake. They can't play without having their mascot y' know. It's paper thin and despite lasting about 85 minutes, it is stretched too far.What could have been a half decent plot soon descends into lame-brain juvenile humor as Ace does his class clown bit, offends many people and uncovers stupid and unfunny 'plot' twists. Tom Shadyac tries his best to make the film look colorful and vivid and, for the most part, succeeds but sometimes the production design looks a bit shoddy and I have no idea who allowed Sean Young to be in this movie. She's a terrible actress and makes every scene damn painful to watch. However, she is quite a MILF these days. Not in this movie though.There are some funny scenes and easy to see why Carrey went on to become such a big star but compared to the rest of Carrey's career it's a bit of an insult to his talent. I prefer the sequel, even though Ace is a full blown lunatic in it and appears a tiny bit more normal and human in this one.A fun movie to watch once in a long while. Not something to rely on for never-ending appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Jim Carrey, I think the man is extremely talented. This film, however is not so talented. Its a little bit strange for starters, and not in the strange genius of Jim Carrey strange, just... weird. The plot is bearable, its crazy, but i can deal with crazy. However, after a while it does descend into absolute weirdness. The film features a sadistic ex-football player who is now a transvestite posing as the Lt. of the local Miami police for example- not funny, just weird. Courteney Cox is also annoying, but then she annoys me anyway. At the end of the day, don't bother, the only good thing about this film really is Jim Carrey himself but if you want to see classic Jim Carrey see Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, its far funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1994 box-office hit that turned comedy maniac Jim Carrey into Hollywood's first $20-million man, this gag-filled no-brainier stars Carrey as the titular rubber-faced gumshoe who tracks down lost pets for his heartbroken clients. Ace's latest case involves the apparent kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins' team mascot, Snowflake the dolphin (natch). His investigation is a source of constant aggravation for Miami police lieutenant Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), who turns out to be packing more than a pistol under her skirt. Friends fans will appreciate the presence of Courtney Cox, who remains admirably straight-faced as the Dolphins' publicist and Ace's would-be girlfriend, but of course it's Carrey who steals the show with shameless abandon. One viewing may suffice for a lot of people, but Carrey's hyper antics have made Ace Ventura: Pet Detective one of the bestselling videos of the 1990s.</fullReview>

Ace Ventura is far from perfect, but it is still great fun to watch and has plenty of over the top lunacy and laughs to please most comedy lovers.Sadly this is still one of Carrey's weaker movies, but for Carrey fans everywhere; this is worthy of recognition.6/10</fullReview>

The film has a decent enough plot, and delivers enough laughs to coincide with the running time. It is obvious that Jim Carrey carries the film from start to finish and that it looks like the film was composed for him. Jim Carrey is excellent as the flimsy bodied man, who has to retrieve lost pets, but the film could've avoided such tedious plot twists, namely one. The ending is very poor and doesn't live up to the liveliness that was contrived throughout the preponderance of the film.

Really, a movie that an actor makes a fool out of himself to make people laugh. Most any comedy now is just this. I really got out of this in my 20's. I do not see it really funny any more or Jim Carrey at all. Its just dumb, like the title Dumb and Dumber.Being dumb is actually not funny. You will never really grow up by being dumb, and people learn to be dumb, by watching these kind of movies, thinking it is the coolest thing to try what they do to make people laugh. OK, that really makes no sense at all, but people will do it. Might as well, go get plastered from drinking, and make people laugh too. That is exactly the same thing people do as Jim Carrey does. He is probably drunk when he does his movies.I am hesitant on seeing Kick Ass 2, because he is in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the world has progressed over the 20 years since 1994, this movie has become a prime example of transphobia in Hollywood, and media in general. The pinnacle of the story is the complete and utter ridicule of a transgender woman where she is stripped of all her self worth and dignity.The scene where Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) rolls over in disgust when he realises he kissed a transgender woman is not only deeply rooted in homophobia, but represents a reaction towards trans* people that in the real world far too often results in murder.Society in 1994 might be excused for being ignorant about these issues, but as the world progresses the deep bigotry weaved into the plot of this movie should be recognised for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of Jim Carey's more irritating movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people swear by this movie; I swear at it. I do not particularly like this movie. It is crass, funny in parts, and in other parts down right disgusting (just as discovering Mr Winkle on Sean Young). This movie is about evil transvestites, homosexuality, jealousy, being a sore loser, refusing to take the blame for one's actions, and generally other things that I don't particularly want to watch. The mascot for the Miami Dolphins has been kidnapped and a secretary recommends a pet detective named Ace Ventura (Jim Carey) to solve the case. Ace discovers that somebody involved with the Dolphins kidnapped the dolphin and his trail leads to a player that missed a field goal and cost the Dolphins the grand final a few years back. This player has received a lot of hate mail from psychotic fans, and you start to feel sorry for him; that is until you learn that he blames somebody else. Thus he has created an elaborate ploy, in which he becomes a woman so as to get back at the Dolphins for his humiliating defeat. My main criticism about this movie is the character of Ace Ventura; I don't think that it suits the movie. In a way he is disgusting, the most horrid character Carey has played. Now I don't mind Jim Carey, his comedy style is a little over the top, but generally he is a reasonable actor. It is just that this movie really puts me off him. It seems that the character of Ace and the plot of the movie clash and doesn't work. The plot is not that important though because it is Carey's character that people come to see. This is not what I watch a movie for, and as such this causes problems with the movie itself. Adlibbing: Carey probably did a bit of this in the movie, and if done properly then it can come out well. I think ad libbed lines are best when the actor has the gift of doing it, and Carey probably has. Eddie Murphy is a dream at it, but then Murphy is one of my favourite comic actors. Carey on the other hand is reasonable. I think he has done some fine movie, but Ace Ventura is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to make this short and sweet: If you value your brain cells, don't watch "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." Maybe it's funny to little kids, or to highly immature adolescents, but it shouldn't be funny to any self-respecting adult.Jim Carrey acts like an absolute idiot the entire film, and it's very irritating to watch. I can't believe the movie got a sequel. That says a lot about society, and that fact scares me. This movie, and its sequel, pander to the lowest common denominator and that's a problem. There should be higher standards for what movies get the "green light" in Hollywood than this.I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, and recently a friend asked me to watch it again, thinking I'd have a different opinion of it now. Well, nothing's changed. I still think the movie sucks?and so should you! The plot is so stupid. Jim Carrey is a pet detective who gets called in to help investigate the disappearance of Miami Dolphins' mascot, Snowflake, a rare bottle-nosed dolphin. Come to find out that the individual responsible for stealing the dolphin is the police captain who just so happens to be a man dressed in drag, although played by a woman, who used to be a disgraced field goal kicker for the Miami Dolphins. What? What a waste of time! What an insult to the intelligence. I can't believe this is the movie that catapulted Jim Carrey to superstardom.That's not to say I have anything against Jim Carrey, I do like some of his movies, "Liar, Liar" in particular, but this movie just plain sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid it like the flu. If you don't, you just might find yourself exhibiting similar symptoms?nausea.</fullReview>

He seeks income by finding lost animals. Hes a self-proclaimed animal lover that has an amusing relationship with his mass amount of pets that he 'knows the way they think'.The story circulates Ace going to find a lost dolphin that happens to be a mascot of a big American football that was stolen a week before the super bowl. Which is disastrous! Jim Carrey has pulled off an extremely funny performance that had me laughing excessively. Ace's outrageousness is unparalled to any other character of all time. Carrey is simply the king of physical comedy and he was my idol as a child and will continue to be.However, the humour in the film is goofy, bizarre and very eccentric. Therefore, some people may not get the humour and discard the film and Carrey's performance.Get the humour or not, Carrey's fearlessness towards his roles in film has made him one of the most unique comedians of all time and he should be praised for that.I give this film 5/10 because although it was very funny, the story was very weak and the acting other than Carrey was very mediocre which brought the film down.I wont tell you any of the gags just watch it with a bunch of friends and enjoy yourself! 5/10</fullReview>

The mascot of the Miami Dolphins "Snowflake the Dolphin" has been kidnapped. It is Ace's job to find this dolphin. He has help from Courney Cox (Arquette) and Sean Young who has a funny but sick story towards the end. There is also an appearance by legendary Miami Dolphin player Dan Marino (as himself). A hilarious film with wonderful slapstick and cuddly animals thrown in. The best part for me is seeing Ace being thrown about by a shark! Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls followed.

It is a very decent detective story with some truly dramatic and I daresay tragic moments buried underneath a third-rate comedy about an obnoxious pet detective. It isn't that original ? Cherry Falls, for one, is based on a very similar premise ? but it could have been a great psychological thriller if given center stage and developed properly. Instead, center stage is given to Jim Carrey, who redefines obnoxious and over-the-top. I don't even know what kind of audience the comedy portion is aimed at; it is obviously not for kids, but I can't imagine who else would find it even remotely funny (well, aside from the part where Jim Carrey fights a mascot at the end, that's pretty hilarious). The movie is certainly memorable, but Jim Carrey has nothing to do with it. I give it 5 stars for the Finkle/Einhorn subplot and 0 for everything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected big things from this film. Everyone I know who has seen Ace Ventura raves on about how it is a "Must See Movie'. Is it though? Well, sorta. The film is VERY funny, but nearly all of the comedy stems from one man, Jim Carrey. Thankfully, and unsurprisingly, Carrey's performance is spot on. Like always, his unique comic style makes us laugh, and his incredible and over-the-top performance makes this film. Jim Carrey is the strongest presence on the screen, and thats not a bad thing, but it does overshadow the rest of the characters. What makes this film good is Jim Carrey, and that's the problem. The Story doesn't stand out on its own, and is hindered by a fair few outrageous plot devices, which is only saved by Carrey's equally as outrageous body language. None of the other characters made me laugh, and in a comedy that is a problem. Its not like the rest of the actors do a poor job, but there average performance is buried under loads and loads of Carrey's insane dialogue. However, Jim Carrey is still widely entertaining and hilarious. I genuinely laughed throughout this film, and would defiantly rate it much better then many other comedies out there. This might as well be a Jim Carrey solo performance, but at least he is funny enough and has a strong enough stage presence to really make this movie laugh-out-loud good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about sports that struggles to translate into movies. Like video games, sports movies are often hackneyed affairs filled with fading A-listers, wannabe TV stars hoping for a big break and endless clichés. And as if by magic, along comes "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to prove my point! Except this has the added bonus of being an early Jim Carrey comedy which means there's added goofing around on show too! Having been told to scrub it off my List Of Shame immediately by work colleagues, I'm struggling to see what the fuss was about. Nostalgia can be a tricky mistress and having missed it the first time around, this immature movie simply doesn't do anything for me.Carrey plays Ace Ventura, an eccentric pet detective working in Miami so if any dogs get kidnapped or rare birds fly the nest, he's your man. Desperate to pay his overdue rent, the mother of all cases lands on his lap when Snowflake, a mascot belonging to the Miami Dolphins, gets kidnapped. Along with the Dolphins' chief publicist Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox), Ace must track Snowflake down as the forthcoming Superbowl approaches. Despite the sneering interference from Lt. Einhorn (Sean Young), Ace deduces that a former player must be involved somehow and must work fast when the Dolphins' quarterback (Dan Marino) is also kidnapped.It may be as dumb as sticking a fork in a toaster but the film's lead actor is just as energetic. Carrey is a force of nature, stretching his face into all sorts of weird shapes and contorting his body as much as his dialogue. As he goofs his way through the material, the rest of the cast haven't a hope in hell of keeping up with him (is it a coincidence that Carrey would play "The Mask" the same year?). As a long-time fan of the Fins, it was good to see the likes of Marino (who struggles to act as himself) and the legendary Don Shula involved but they all have a slight hint of embarrassment at proceedings. Either it was the script which is a few pages short of a chapter anyway or maybe it was Carrey pretending to literally talk through his ass. Speaking of embarrassment, can someone tell me why women found Ace irresistible because most of the time, he comes across a some sort of insufferable man-child like Robin Williams used to play? Unless you're a young child or an absolute Dolphin nut, I can't see what viewers new to "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" would get out of it. It has its moments but it lacks conviction, as though it expects Carrey being a manic ball of fire to be enough to carry the film. It isn't - a true comedy relies on more than crudity, gurning and silliness. Jokes would be a start - for all the energy on screen, I'm at a loss to replay any genuine belly laughs I may have had watching. If you like your puerile drivel then you'll probably enjoy it much more than I did. I knew there was a reason I missed it the first time around...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey's best performance? AAAAAALRIGHTY THEN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a binge movie watcher and a huge, huge Jim Carrey fan, this is my absolute favorite movie of all time. Jim Carrey maintains his humorous, perverted, rubbery face self, with this movie highlighting all of it to full extent.So basically, this movie features the amazing Jim Carrey as an extremely sassy pet detective (a person who finds People's animals and pets) with super hair and a Hawaiian shirt. Extremely promising beginning and a blast of laughs the whole way through. It gives you the "the character's a jerk, but I'll still root for him because he's awesome" feeling because throughout the film he does upset quite a number of people, but makes even more people, including you and I happy and full of laughs.Many find this movie to be a classic cheesy football comedy, and technically it is, but it is packed with stupid jokes we all need once in a while, it's like a classic version of iFunny in a movie, very entertaining. Personally I've seen it a dozen times and whether I get a lousy grade or a close family member dies, it can always knock 1 hr 26 mins of sadness outta my day, and provide me with unlimited laughs after wards and also at all time (even if we're trying to take a test and I do burst out in laughter for no absolute reason at all) WARNING: I'm still stuck replying "alrighty then" to everything, but it truly is worth the watch multiple times, a very fun group movie for a small party with friends to a fancy business movie party. Maybe it's just because I'm a Carrey fan, but I think it's quite a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this title, as well as many others of course, to be quite under-rated. Sure, it might not have the very best story, but I cannot seem to find any mere mistakes regarding that matter either.What I strongly appreciate about the story is that everything actually makes sense; all the clues are stacking up, and the criminal 'aura' adds quite a lot of suspense to it - considering this is a comedy movie anyways.Another thing I would like to add: What I have written above these lines should not make you believe this is some 'real crime movie' or whatever, no, this movie and its actors (or much rather Jim Carrey in particular) do not quite seem to be taking their job seriously. 'Ace Ventura' is indeed a comedy movie and should not be viewed as anything else. The ending reminded me much rather of a James Bond movie, though.This movie made me laugh a lot and I was not disappointed by its plot. Well-spent 86 minutes for sure!

		<fullReview>Wacky 1990s comedy with Jim Carrey in the title role?a portrayal that is inarguably one of his most classic characters?a pet detective searching for a stolen dolphin that serves as the mascot for the Miami Dolphins, and clues indicate that the thief may have something to do with the upcoming Super Bowl. Definitely a film that put Carrey on the map, and is one of those movies that continues to be funny no matter how many times you've seen it. Unfortunately, the plot holes really start to show with age, so you might want to avoid replay too frequently?though restored footage found on TV-versions of the film help piece things together better. Level-headed Courteney Cox, believe it or not, pairs really well with the out-of-control Carrey. Dan Marino can't act? not even when he's portraying himself?*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story/Plot - Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a slightly crazy yet lovable character. He has a love for animals and detection. Ace Ventura is able to think like an animal and also think like a criminal. This giving him the edge over the real police.Starting off by rescuing a stolen dog from a very angry man by posing as a courier right through to then end by rescuing the beloved mascot of an American Football team, a dolphin. Ace is pure comedy and still manages to win the heart of Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox).My verdict - If you want to spend over an hour laughing your head off and in suspense then I fully recommend you watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective. You will definitely not be disappointed with this film.Outstanding screen play by Jim Carrey who moulds into his character extremely well, he is accompanied by a fine performance by the lovely Courteney Cox, who I must say looks fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura is a pet detective. The job is to investigate various missing or abused animals and return them to their rightful owners. His big case is when Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake (an actual dolphin) get's stolen. Melissa (Courtney Cox) who works with the Dolphins is there to help Ace on the case, and along the way they fall in love. Ace eventually realizes that it is a bitter former player named Ray Finkle who has kidnapped Snowflake, and it's up to him to find Ray and retrieve the mammal before Superbowl Sunday.I liked this one a lot. There are quite a lot of funny moments, one's that stick out are; Ace making a fool of himself at a fancy party for rich people, Ace pretending to be insane at a mental institution, and Ace's various scenes at the police station. I can see why some people might find the character Ace annoying, I started too as it went along. But it is necessary for the character to be obnoxious/loud, and Jim Carrey plays over the top so well. The rest of the actors were good as well including Courtney Cox and Sean Young as "Lois" the police detective with a secret..I enjoyed the mystery aspect of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', having to first find Ray Finkle and then find out who Ray Finkle really is. Lot's of comedic moments and an interesting plot equals good in my books7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a comedy film starring Jim Carrey,who plays the title role. It was developed by the film's original writer, Jack Bernstein, and co-producer, Bob Israel. It co-stars Courteney Cox, Tone L&#x14d;c, Sean Young and former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.Ace Ventura is a low-rent private eye who specializes in recovering lost animals, so when Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' aquatic mascot, is kidnapped, team representative Melissa Robinson puts Ace on the case. However, Snowflake isn't the only Miami Dolphin who has gone missing; several key members of the team also disappear, including quarterback Dan Marino, who is spirited away while filming a TV commercial. With the Super Bowl only two weeks away, will Ace be able to find Snowflake and the missing athletes in time to salvage the big game?Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the "Ace" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional cop show plotting.But nevertheless,this is a perfect platform for Jim Carrey to showcase his physical comedy skills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was typical Jim Carrey fare, where he mugs and stretches his way thru the entire movie with plenty of sight gags and funny lines. It was a great vehicle for him. It starts off with him getting a dog back from a guy in a hilarious scene, and that pretty much sets the tone. Later, the Miami Dolphins' mascot and quarterback (Dan Marino) both get kidnapped, and the team, headed up by Courtney Cox (in a good performance), hire him to get them back. Marino proves to be a better athlete and commentator than actor, but he does provide a decent "straight man" performance to Carrey's antics during the rescue scenes.

		<fullReview>Sure, Ace Ventura does not compare to half of these movies, and is clearly more on the side of the bone-headed comedy that he was doing on In Living Color, but his talent is unmistakable. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it. There's something about seeing a slob at a tremendously rich party who just doesn't care about the etiquette of the rich people. Did anyone not laugh when he was 'testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him? That whole scene at that party is classic! And, of course, it only gets better with Ace's dealings with Lois Einhorn. The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994. This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies. Way to go, Jim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) Review: This is what made Jim Carrey a star. No surprises here. Ace Ventura is more than a comedy and let me tell you why.Ace Ventura is a pet detective who will not stop till he is done. We see Carrey's excellent and wacky charisma light up the screen. He indeed has a nice level of charm. What really helps this film is that it is intelligent. Hear me out, Ace, despite his comedic and witty attitude is rather smart. He gets hired on a case of a missing dolphin. He seems rather jovial, but is very bright. He is not a dumb ass comedy figure, he is a wise-cracking, clever detective. That gives this movie some depth. Ace is nobody's fool.Carrey is entertaining as Ace. We also get a good plot as well. This movie is a little smart. Many viewers may not notice due to the hilarity that is constant here, but this is a clever movie.One more thing, kudos to Cannibal Corpse for the cameo. Death Metal mayhem always helps.The Last Word: Good movie. It's no wonder Jim Carrey became a star after this. He has excellent comedic charisma. Get the popcorn and have fun.</fullReview>

The plot could have been better, and maybe just take the acting up a notch, and even though this isn't as good as the other movies Jim has acted in, it's still one of the funniest movies of all time.

		<fullReview>About half a year ago, I saw "Ace Venture: When Nature Calls" for the first time and I didn't really like it (to put it nicely). But because this was a sequel and because I already had seen "Ace Venture: Pet Detective" before and liked it back then, I decided to give it another try. And I must say, it may not be his best movie, but it sure was a lot better than the sequel...Ace Venture is the only existing pet detective and he's good at what he does. He's not only able to understand the criminal's mind, he also understands the animals. When a dolphin, the mascot of a football team, is stolen just before the Superbowl, Ace Ventura is put on the case. And despite the fact that everybody laughs with him, he's capable of finding out who would want to steal this dolphin and why...If you are looking for a subtle comedy, than you better don't start watching this movie. What you get in this movie is the typical Jim Carrey with the absurd humor and weird faces. A good story or a surprising ending? You'll not find it in this one. But when you just want to have some brainless fun, than this one certainly is worth a try. Even though not all the jokes made me laugh, I still had a good time with it. Especially with the man-eating shark, I was very amused.Even though this is far from a perfect movie, I must say that I've already seen much worse. It's not the best comedy ever, but it offers some decent fun and that's why I still give it a rating in between 6/10 and 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carrey's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to issue this warning: This movie is not for everybody (especially if you were raised with morals).Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is a self-described "pet detective" who works to return stolen animals in a variety of bizarre and unorthodox methods. In this case, he gets hired by the Miami Dolphins to find their kidnapped mascot, Snowflake. Ace quickly delves into the case and from here, all sanity and decency go south.I originally saw this movie as a little kid and laughed my ass off. I saw it again as a teenager and I laughed even harder.Most of the humor here is crude and obnoxious, though not in the teenage "American Pie-esquire" way. Carrey, with his uniquely entertaining sense of humor, performs in various eccentric and somewhat disturbing scenes that most actors probably would refuse out of dignity (In one scene for example, Carrey portrays a mentally disturbed football player, complete with slow-motion "instant-replay" moves. In another, he demands information from a cop. When his request is refused, he proceeds to literally "ass" a few questions until the cop finally concedes out of annoyance). Though there is little plot to the movie, the jokes are probably enough to keep you entertained.Perhaps the only downside to this film is the rather mediocre performances of the supporting characters (with the exception of Sean Young, who employs a stern, cold, and unemotional foil to Carrey's laid-back, comical lunacy). But of course, Ace Ventura is a rather big character so I guess that it was better this way to make him the only spotlight.Also, for any death metal fans out there, Cannibal Corpse (who are apparently Jim Carrey's favorite band) also make a short (and hilarious) cameo in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene is the most important. It's the introduction to movie audiences of Jim Carrey. What we see then is what Jim Carrey has become. It shows Carrey carrying a UPS-type package down the street, destroying it with every step he takes. We see how this relatively unknown actor can turn a box into a gag, and is the highlight of the first half of the movie. The movie is essentially a who-dunnit murder caper led by a pet detective. That's not to say it's a bad movie, it is funny, especially the further into the movie it goes. Most of the first half of the film is full of immature humor, but I found as the movie went along, the laughs were actually earned, not products of toilet jokes. I found Dan Marino to be particularly funny in a cameo role, and as an Eagles fan, it was nice to see them finally make the Super Bowl, though it did remind me that this was indeed Hollywood. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a flawed comedy, but I liked it enough to not be too hard on it, especially with how funny the second half of the movie is when compared to the first half. It was like we were seeing the maturation process of Jim Carrey over the hour and a half that the movie lasts.</fullReview>

Did anyone else notice this change?The sparkle and personality that is Courteney clearly comes through in this performance. Her eyes shine, she becomes her character, and immerses the viewer with joy.

(It isn't, it's a brilliant black comedy). I also saw the supposedly inferior sequel to this first, and enjoyed it more than this, the original. So there you go, make of that what you will.In 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' Carrey is much funnier that the paper thin material he has to work with. He is always entertaining to watch, but for me there was only about four big laughs in the whole movie, which is not a very good sign for a comedy. Personally I got more chuckles at his cameo as a coked out rock star miming to Guns And Roses in 'The Dead Pool'.'Blade Runner' nut that I am it was nice to see Sean Young in this, and the involvement of living legend Udo Kier ('Suspiria', 'Flesh For Frankenstein', 'Johnny Mnemonic',etc.etc.) was an added bonus, even if his screen time was limited. Overall a major disappointment. For rabid Carrey fans only.</fullReview>

It was funny the first time I saw it, but the second time it wasn't funny at all. My friends have made me watch it on television like one hundred times and I hate it more and more each time.

		<shortDescription>Not Worth Paying to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is the film that made Jim Carrey a star. After seeing this movie, it is kind of hard to see why it did. While Ace Ventura does have it's moments, the movie for the most part is not that funny. At times, Carrey does show the comedic brilliance that has made one of the biggest box office stars today. However, the movie was not worth paying to see in the theaters, nor, is it worth renting on home video. This is a movie that you only watch when it is on television and there is nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy 20th Anniversary... NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did those who've written glowing reviews of Ace Ventura see the same movie I did? Jim Carrey has done some great movies, but this is not one of them. Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. But it&amp;'s an astounding dumb film, and a complete waste of celluloid, IMO. Understand, "nostalgic" doesn't mean "better" - it just means you're more attached to it. It boggles my mind that Carrey is one of the highest paid actors out there. This movie, and the one he appeared in following it ("Dumb &amp; Dumber"), are unbelievably awful &amp; overrated. These films utilize slapstick/absurdest humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his butt. Plus, him dressing up in a tutu is NOT FUNNY!Oftentimes I felt like saying, "What the &amp;%$#@? are you doing???" The character of Ace Ventura is sure no "ace".Even if you liked Carrey's brand of humor, wouldn't it get old after 30 minutes or so??? My advice, go watch Jim Carrey's "The Grinch" - he plays a much more convincing &amp; less annoying character than in this. The makeup he got to wear was REALLY well-done, and it was the first Jim Carrey movie I ever saw.But this film film was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. The story as a whole was difficult to follow, due to Jim acting like a distracting fool most of the film. This movie is about evil transvestites, bad language, abuse for women, homosexuality, jealousy, being a sore loser, refusing to take the blame for one's actions, and generally other things that I particularly don't want to watch. Long story short, "The Mask" was the only "good" Jim Carrey film that came out in 1994.I'm all-round so glad I didn't grow up with this flick, because likely, I would've lost HALF OF MY BRAIN if I did! I just to have my memory erased for acknowledging it exists!Overall, this one is a real dud in my opinion, I give it 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tom Shadyac went on to work with Jim Carrey on two more films, but this puerile comedy is the best. Essentially it's a vehicle for Jim Carrey's energetic, gurning brand of childish slapstick - Courtney Cox, Udo Kier et al wisely play it dead straight and allow the obnoxious pet detective to poke fun at them. It makes for often hilarious viewing: the vigour with which Carrey throws himself into his endless caricatures is freakishly fascinating to watch.Regardless of one's overall opinion of the inimitable Mr Carrey, what's undeniable is his uniqueness as a physical comedian - and nowhere are those talents given a freer reign than here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thoroughly silly slapstick vehicle for a big-screen-novelty Jim Carrey. Producers would have been forgiven for thinking that it looked radioactive on paper with its modern, wisecracking Doctor Doolittle with little more than direction notes for lines and sleb-incorporating plot.The whole thing is not only galvanised but transformed by Carrey. His facial acrobatics, accurate mimicry and clever understanding of how the camera sees him means that one has to suspend one's disbelief of this being some sort of post-produced animation (it didn't stop there - apparently Carrey is responsible for improvising lines as well). Dan Marino and Simon Callow are rather clunky support, as you might, or perhaps might not expect. Courtney Cox is very good as a straight guy, clearly understanding but not using her small-screen comic timing. Daft but fascinating. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is Jim Carrey's first foray into being the leading man. And do not be mistaken, this is his movie and no one else's.The plot is worthless to a movie of this kind. It is merely a tool for people to showcase their comedic talents or in this case, one person.Anyway, we follow Ace trying to track down the missing Miami Dolphins mascot before the Super Bowl. But you know what, who cares?Jim Carrey will make you burst out laughing in this movie at least once. The most memorable moment is when Ace goes undercover at a rest home for the mentally impaired.Yes, some of the humor here is crude, childish, immature, and could've been left out. But for the most part "Ace Ventura" is a good exercise in slap stick comedy.The biggest fault is probably that the movie is really just one long stand up comedy routine and the likes of Courteney Cox, Sean Young, and the rest of the cast are basically left with nothing to do except draw a paycheck.So, if you want some inane, stupid humor that will release you from having to think about anything, I would suggest this one. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Along the way, Ace encounters many strange things and stranger suspects, when he isn't dodging angry pet kidnappers or hungry sharks... Carrey's broad(with a capital "B") comedy antics are an acquired taste, and though there are some undeniably funny bits, most of this is just idiotic and scatter-shot, if not downright stupid. Still, seeing Ace imitate "Star Trek" characters or using a plunger on his face may provide some fleeting laughs.</fullReview>

The overall storyline is quite poor though about the kidnapping of the Miami dolphin mascot by an ex-football washout in order to gain revenge, with a cameo appearance of Dan Marino. What this film is all about is Jim Carrey's portrayal as Ace Ventura, no one watches this film for any other reason.Jim Carreys is at his best for what he does in this film, despite the Razzie nomination. His overall energy keeps the film going with his loony appearance, humorous gags and quick wit. With some of the best catch phrases to emerge,at times though there was a little too much of this.The overall plot was very poor though, especially the outcome you find out that the ex-football player decides to have a sex change, take the place of the chief of police and do this all for revenge.

		<shortDescription>Well, It Gave Carrey His Start...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jim Carrey's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was first released, I couldn't understand what on Earth had other people my age in absolute hysterics (I was 15). Five years older and wiser, I can see why it had them in such a state and why it still does nothing but annoy me: it's classic Carrey, all right, but it's not the Carrey that I've come to love as an actor. That isn't to say that Jim Carrey is not funny: he is dreadfully funny when properly directed and controlled. The Farrely Brothers Dumb and Dumber was a hilarious film, and though it's jokes were only a few levels above Ace Ventura's, it certainly clicked better thanks to their direction. Liar, Liar had me in hysterics, but only because Shadyac this time around exercised restraint over Carrey.Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is basically Jim Carrey's chance to go all-out and engage in whatever sophomoric act he wants to, the most infamous, of course, is talking out of his ass. Certainly only for die-hard fans of Jim Carrey's brand of hijinks, this ultra-silly, thin-plotted, and gag-driven movie's only good point is that it gave Carrey his start. But hey, you gotta crack a few bad jokes to make a Truman Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey plays Ace Ventura a man who will find your lost pets for you. When the Miami Dolphins mascot (a real dolphin, as if you couldn't guess) is dolphin napped he is hired and must get to the bottom of it and find out where it is, who has it and why they took it.I watched this years ago a couple of times and I was younger, and even then this movie did nothing for me. It is way over the top cheesy and just not my thing. I never liked the kind of comedy that uses stupid antics and characters to make you laugh. I mightve laughed or grinned at best a few times while watching this film, but I think it is stupid.I like Jim Carrey and think he's a funny person and love his old stand up, but his early movies like this and Mask were just too cheesy for me. I see a movie like this being good for kids, only they try to aim it at adults and make it PG-13 which kills the young kid audience from seeing it and to me they are the only ones who would get it and actually find it funny.Carrey is a good actor but does nothing for me here, Courtney Cox is a dry boring actress too. Tone Loc was still able to get work back then and he was thrown in the cast, but does nothing for me. Dan Marino can't act and sports figures shouldn't try, Sean young sucks and the casting was bad. I loved tiny roles featuring the great Randall Tex Cobb and Alice Drummond. The directing was crap as well as all production values.. I did love that Carrey insisted on having his favorite band Cannibal Corpse involved in the movie.. They are great.I don't find this film offers anything. Stupid over the top acting by Carrey and just way too childish, its bad. 1/10 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming from nowhere, a hand is grabbing his shoulder, and a voice says in a very ominous tone: "Mr. Ventura?" to which the character of the same name replies: "Yes ? (brief pause) Satan?" The chances for such jokes to work only depend on the believability of its lead character even as a comical protagonist, but it's Jim Carrey who carries the film, and for some magical reason, he turns a very wacky script (in a simple-minded way) into a funny, and sometimes hilarious, comedy. Granted it's not the most elegant or sophisticated one, but I liked it, I liked it so much I could watch it again, and still laugh at the lousiest jokes.Now, that's still a tough review to give, because as much as I have the deepest respect for such distinguished critics as Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, it would be a lie if I said that I didn't laugh at "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". They're right that the film had a kind of immature appeal and uses a character that plays the same one-note nerdy twisted geek all along; still, it made me laugh. Maybe it's the most primary and raunchy level of humor, maybe I shouldn't even be entitled to judge another film, let alone a comedy, if I was capable to appreciate Tom Shadyak's film. But I guess I would be more to blame if I was pretending not to love it just to look smart. Hell, I don't even know why I'm feeling sorry to love the film, I really do, and too bad some people couldn't laugh at it."Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" is so straightforward in its approach to comedy that it's nearly impossible to find it unfunny. Even when the jokes don't work and actually, I can't think of one (well, I didn't like the performance of the kidnapped athlete but never mind?), you have Jim Carrey who saves the day by playing the most obnoxious cinematic character ever. Two things I don't get by the way: how could he ever get a Razzie nomination for his performance and how could Roger Ebert hate the character for what was his most defining characteristic? It's precisely because he was obnoxious that Ace Ventura was funny, think about it, a man who loves animals so much that he hates human. Does it make sense? What's the matter, as long as it makes laugh?And the opening scene of the couldn't have set the tone any better, Ventura carries a sort of fragile bag with such carelessness, any clairvoyant mind would automatically wonder if there is some fragile stuff inside or if it's just an undercover. The whole opening credits consists on showing him mistreating the little case, just in case we forgot that. Tom Shadyak, who directed "Dumb and Dumber" the same year, directs the film as if he was exaggeratedly taking his viewers for dumb people. But seriously, I don't mind having my intelligence insulted when it's done for humorous purpose, and when it starts being funny, it becomes most intelligent than any traditional gag. Let me explain this better: just because it's Jim Carrey, the movie can get away with everything. Really? Like he would "Re-he-he-he- heaaaally?" (And I laughed at that line, too)So, Ace enters the houses, gives the case and take the kidnapped dog back, the chase scene that follows is so over the top, especially when Ventura finally starts the car and screaming "it's alive", Shadyak gives the final deathblow to any expectation of a "serious comedy" and to the last skeptical minds, you have Ventura's award from the little dog's mistress. What can I say about this part? Well, Mel Brooks said once that "The Producers" 'rose below vulgarity', "Ace Ventura" is probably the comedy that comes the closest to that definition. Indeed, "Ace Ventura" belongs to a special kind of comedies, dumb enough to be funny, without being annoying, and smart enough to ? nah, it's not that smart, or maybe it's smart in the way it's funny when it shouldn't normally be. Bad acting? Over-the-top situations? Don't ask me why but in the very context of Ace Ventura, they all work. The plot? The Miami football team's mascot, a dolphin, has been stolen and Ace Ventura must find it, he meets the beautiful Courteney Cox and two of them make a strange pair. We know how it would end between them but then again, it's handled in an over-the-top comical way. It's outrageous, raunchy, but how about when Jim Carrey is looking for one of the ex-football team champions, and has to check if they have a ring in their fingers. At one point, he's looking at one athlete in the toilet with a strange eye, and this is not even the funniest gag. There is one scene where he realized that one person he's just kissed isn't a woman and his reaction is priceless and for very gutsy when you think of it. Some would say it's homophobic but it mocks more the homophobic attitude than homosexuality. And if people can't get that, no wonder they would find the rest of the film unfunny.Dolphins, football, a cruel and tough but beautiful police inspector played by Sean Young, the beautiful Courteney Cox, and Jim Carrey teasing people, being nerdy, obnoxious, calling them ugly, talking with his ass, you almost have the feeling, it's a one-note performance, but it takes some great acting skills to carry one film alone like Carrey does. With "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura" (all of them in the Top 10 highest-grossing films), 1994 was the breakthrough year of Jim Carrey, that launched his career and put him in the Hall of Fame of the greatest comedic performers. And you have to give credit to Jim Carrey, especially because he played three different characters ? and he's just too damn funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Ace Ventura:Pet Detective is not my favourite of Jim Carrey's movie, it is a lot of fun. It may be a tad too short, and some of the silliness is overdone. But even with any problems, that still doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed this film immensely. The film looks good with the cinematography and scenery top notch. The script is incredibly funny and I like to quote it too. The story is quite silly, but it is a nice one too, and the film is also very snappily paced. Tom Shadyac's direction is also very energetic and imaginative. This was the film that made Jim Carrey an overnight sensation and a fine one it is too to receive that honour. He is excellent in this film, his style of humour mayn't be for everybody, but when he is at his best he is funny or nicely understated as he is in his dramas. All in all, fast, furious and fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1994 was a beneficial year for Jim Carrey for three movies revealed him to the general public and lined his pockets: "the Mask", "Dunb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura". At the level of quality, "Ace Ventura" finds itself between the two movies. It is better than the "dumb" movie made by the Farrelly brothers although it doesn't match the success of "the Mask". And precisely, in France, unlike the USA "Ace Ventura" was released after "the Mask" consequently to the commercial triumph of the latter and probably in order to arouse the public's interest for Jim Carrey. Having watched the hare-brained sequel, "Ace Ventura: when nature calls" (1995) before the present movie, I was able to compare the two movies and it is arguably the first one which is superior. Tom Shadyac isn't a renowned film-maker but in "Ace Ventura", he shows his ability in bringing a story to a successful conclusion while keeping an eye on his main actor's acting. The main difference with "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls" lies in the fact that the detective story isn't too spoiled by Carrey's grimaces and his bombastic gestures. In another extent, the humor verges on bad taste, but fortunately, rarely. And there are some good gags without vulgarity which make honestly laugh."Ace Ventura" is more bearable and slightly higher the average of comedies in which Carrey acted. A last thing: if your favorite pet, one day goes missing, you've got someone to bring it back as fast as possible in your home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid silly comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey stars in the movie that made him a star.. as a pet detective who hunts for missing pets..his latest mystery leads him into high society when he looks for Snowflake, the mascot for the Miami Dolphins football team. Several Dolphins, including Dan Marino make cameos in this film. Carrey does well incorporating all his skills that make him famous..and while the humor is crude, you still find yourself laughing and going along with the ridiculous plot..on a scale of one to ten..5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is better that it's sequel. However that doesn't say that much. Ace Ventura is a stupid movie with a surprizingly annoying character, and the very few funny scenes don't even come close to making that stuff up. Movies like this make Jim Carrey look like bad comedian actors like Poly Shore and Adam Sandler. I loved Jim Carrey in Liar, Liar and The Truman Show, but this one, his first major role, is not a good movie. *1/2 out of **** for Ace Ventura.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointment. It seemed like they got a great cast of actors and the Miami Dolphins pro football team together to make a comedy, then realized that they needed to write a funny script and had writer's block. Jim Carrey is his usual silly goof and his humorist brilliance does show through but the story is rather lame, stupid and painful to watch. The story is also not child friendly as in the opening scene there is a oral sex joke and there is s sprinkling of adult humor throughout the movie. Cringe alert. Parents beware, this is a case of Hollywood being out of touch with the mainstream. Carrey's follow on movies "the Mask" and "Bruce Almighty" are much better but you can't use their success to judge this film. It is just not as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe-It-Or-Not, This Was A Hit Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw this movie one and one-third times. The "third" was the second viewing where it hit me that this was going to go from "fairly funny" to "incredibly stupid" in one viewing, so why continue? This kind of lame-brain humor is tolerable one time, is all I am saying.Carrey is good at what he does, and he's far better than the script. I can enjoy moronic humor many times, but this takes it to another level! How I sat through this the first time makes me shake my head in wonder, except that I was with a friend at the theater so was a big Miami Dolphins fan and wanted to see how quarterback Dan Marino acted in here. The story revolves around the pro football team's dolphin mascot being stolen. "Ace" may be weird and a bit stupid, but he has a good heart and that's why he make a likable character.Carrey can be funny with the stupid characters he plays - which includes this film - but he also be extremely annoying and wear thin fast. This is a great example of that. It's also an example of crude humor insert into what - on the surface - looks to be a "cute animal picture." This is not a kids' film - certainly not appropriate. It isn't much an adult film, either, but it sure served Carrey well and it helped catapult him into stardom.Apparently, a lot of folks like this movie because it spawned a sequel. If you thought this film was bad, don't see the sequel. It makes this movie look like "Citizen Kane."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um, yeah, pretty funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing I have never heard about Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. How funny it was and that this was the true movie that kicked off Jim Carrey's career. So, naturally, being a fan of his, I figured despite some annoying trailers for this flick, I'd watch it. While it had some funny jokes, Jim was just actually as weird as it sounds, too hyper for my taste in this movie. I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved the ending and the humor played into the villain. I loved more than a few scenes, especially the first scene where Jim is kicking around the "fragile" box and him trying to catch the albino bird was also great. Over all, I mean, I thought it was a funny movie, just not my favorite Jim Carrey flick. I'd rather watch Liar Liar or The Mask.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thin story saved by Carrey from back when he could do no wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura was actually only a direct-to-video release at the time The Mask was in theaters and therefore I would probably never have rented it if I hadn't seen "The Mask" first. Although Carrey gives it his all, I still think this is the lesser of the two. The storyline is so weak that it should have been just a series of Carrey's mannerisms which made the final cut. All the supporting players are just reciting lines. We don't feel they are at all interested in being in this movie, except maybe Sean Young. She has expressed her gratitude to Carrey for recommending her to play this rather tasteless character back when she was blacklisted by many directors and producers. Courtney Cox is just smiling and looking embarrassed and what can be said about Dan Marino other than thank god he didn't choose acting as a living.The whole plot about the Dolphin's mascot is boring. It could just as easily have been a missing kitten. The thing that keeps the film going is Carrey and he has a field day with catch phrases that would live long into the end of the 90's. It's also funny to think that he essentially started his career in movies as being the straight guy (eg. Once Bitten, Peggy Sue got married). If he hadn't been discovered in "In Living Color" he probably still would have played those roles. Like so many comedians he also tried out for Saturday Night Live and he probably would have risen to stardom much faster if he had been accepted there. But will we ever see him doing this kind of movie again? Very doubtful and that's not a big loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flimsy excuse for Carrey's relentless mugging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not exactly burdened with a subtle nature, is Jim Carrey?Here he carries a sledgehammer and a talking ass into every scene as his mugging becomes a contest between him, who can do it 24/7, and you, who might not be able to tolerate it that long. Its all so continous that it comes as a shock when he actually says a line straight!He is given the task of finding the Miami Dolphins mascot, which happens to be a dolphin named Snowflake. They need the mascot back because the Super Bowl is two days away, and the poor animal was taught some tricks to do at half-time. The only real laughs come when Ace visits the local police station for some info and gets his chops busted by the cops who don't admire his chosen profession. Not the overacting, they like that just fine, because it gave them a job in his movie. They just don't respect a pet detective. Sean Young screws up virtually every single line she delivers. I think she must have been determined to get a least one laugh so she tries too hard to upstage her manic leading man. Not a chance! He really does have to get not just a laugh, and will do anything to get it, but every laugh.I did laugh a couple of times. I really like Jim Carrey but he was stuck in his 'all-righty then' stage and maybe because I know how much he's grown as an actor, its a little distressing to know he had to do all that to get where he is now. He COULD have been slightly more generous with everyone else in the movie. Probably he's learned to be less selfish, too.Lastly, casting Udo Kier as a Euro-trash millionaire is as original as casting Dan Marino as Dan Marino. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can somebody please tell me what is so special about this movie that it even made Jim Carrey such a big star. I think since this movie he's proved his talent, but what was so special about this stupid and outrageous comedy. I must admit I even laughed a few times here and there, but it's just not worth the time it takes to watch a movie to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allll Righty Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a great actor. He carries this movie completely. That said, it still ain't a funny movie.This is kiddie humor but involves adult themes, mostly the sex part of it. Not something I would recommend for anyone above about fifteen years old to see.Still, it's a good "tweener" movie; not quite a teenager and a bit past a child. The story follows this guy called Ace Ventura who, as you might have guessed, is a pet detective. What does this mean? He solves cases dealing with pets. And he's the only one of his kind.When Snowflake, the Dolphins' mascot, is kidnapped, Ace is called in by Courtney Cox. He slowly solves the case while making stupid jokes. Not a movie I recommend, but Sean Young and Courtney Cox are still hot.Bud-a-bing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carrey's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is classic comedy with rubberface Jim Carrey making his breakthrough performance to stardom. His antics kept me rolling in the isles and have always given me a laugh when the film is on TV. Kudos to Carrey and everyone else who worked on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birth of the Idiot Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take one simple plot, give it to an obnoxious idiot comic (Jim Carey), throw him a beautiful woman to act as his foil (Courtney Cox), plenty of chances to become an even bigger idiot, elaborate the plot with nonsense and inexplicable incidents that don't make sense and then convince everyone it's a comedy. Ace Ventura is one of the self-proclaimed successes of Jim Carey, but its only fans seem to be teenagers who confuse stupid and funny. The only reason I watched it was for Courtney Cox; I've had a crush on her since "Misfits of Science." Unfortunately, it's painful to watch her suffer through this movie dealing with Carey trying to prove to her why he's considered a comic. Truth be told, Carey does better drama than his flailing loose-limb antics, but he's no Robin Williams or Benny Hill when it comes to turning into a cartoon. What this movie proves and shows is that you can be embarrassed for the characters in the movie and groan at the nonsense in front of you. The biggest mystery is how in the world did this movie get a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This A Family Comedy ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to worry about how some producers market a movie . ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE is a case in point . It's about a detective who loves animals , he keeps all sorts of furry and feathered friends in his house and there's nothing more family friendly than a movie featuring lovely animals , you can just see the little ones begging mom and dad to take them to the cinema to see this movie . Just to hammer the point home the main plot centres around a dolphin mascot being kidnapped and there's nothing more heartbreaking to a family audience than a dolphin in peril So with got a set up and plot that Walt Disney would have been proud of and what do the producers do ? They decide to inject lots of crude humour into it . I was going to write " Crude adult humour " but it's not even sophisticated enough to reach the standards of adult . Are there any adults who think references to veneral disease are funny ? Will children get the in jokes to THE CRYING GAME ? I should hope not . Bizarrely the BBC decided to show this earlier today at a traditional family slot in the early evening which proves the BBC know as little about movies as the average Hollywood producer That's bad enough but what really disgusted me is that ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE turned Jim Carrey into a film star . Now that is unforgivable</fullReview>
