		<shortDescription>Arguably superior to De Palma's remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many purists would jump at this as being the definitive "Sacrface," but so much had changed in the fifty-one years between the two movies that it is nearly impossible. Whereas the Al Pacino cult classic spanned close to three hours and included almost every imaginable cause of death, this version is a mere hour and a half, give or take a few minutes, and unlike the remake, takes place entirely in Chicago.Made as an anti-gangster film, with a message buried under the many bodies that pile up, this is a surprisingly brutal movie for its time, and got a reputation as such. This was just before the so-called "Golden Age" of cinema, and in a time like that, chances are a movie this unapologetic wouldn't get made. But it is a masterful gangster film.Paul Muni is Tony Camonte, a pseudo-Capone psycho who believes in doing the dirty work himself, is a sleazebag. He talks in a lisp that holds him apart from the gangsters of Cagney and Bogart as a man who, even then, seems ethnic. To boot, his "secretary" is an immigrant who is only semi-literate and can't hear people well on the phone. Boris Karloff shows up as an Irish gangster, Gaffney, who falls under Camonte's gun. Aside from an entire segment where Camonte goes seemingly from point A to point B with the same tommy gun and kills off the competition, this is a brilliant milestone in the gangster genre, and probably the best of the era. Even now, it proves what people could accomplish by mere suggestion, sparing much of the language that is in movies (and, indeed, used in real life) today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the best gangster films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film chronicles the rise and fall of Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) an ugly, stupid and violent gangster.This film was originally shot in 1930 but was held from release until 1932 because the censor demanded cuts. Watching it, I can only imagine how bad the missing material was. The film is full of shootouts and gun fights--they're quick, violent and just incredible. The body count has to be in the triple digits. The best scene has Boris Karloff as a gangster (!!!) shot to death in a bowling alley. As incredible as the violence is, the film condemns it--they make it clear that Scarface and his gang are cold-blooded killers and nothing more.Also the film has PLENTY of sexual innuendo. Ann Dvorak plays Scarface's sister and it is made clear that she and her brother are VERY interested in each other. Also she does a very sexy dance in front of George Raft which is more than a little suggestive. I'm surprised that the censors let all this get by! The acting is superb. Muni plays Scarface as dumb, stupid, violent and ugly--and, in a way, very sexy. When he shoots down people it seems that he's actually getting a sexual charge from it! Also Muni, a very handsome man, was purposely made to look ugly. He looks more like an ape than human. George Raft as his best friend is also good--cold-blooded and heartless. Dvorak overplays it a bit but she is incredibly sexy. Hell, even Karloff is good as a gangster! The film is very well-directed by Hoaward Hawks--he pulls no punches. The script is quick and intelligent--it never stops moving.After it was released (to great acclaim) in 1932 it was abruptly pulled--many people said glamorized gangsters (which is just ridiculous). It didn't surface until 1979 (Francis Ford Coppola helped get it re-released) and it was finally recognized for the classic it is.Quite simply a GREAT film. Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preferred far more than the remake; Hawks, Hecht, and Muni are first-rate here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an attempt to try and snap some sense into the public and the government about the crime wave (mostly in due to Al Capone, who was a major inspiration for Tony Camonte), Howard Hughes and Howard Hawks brought to the screen one of the landmark early gangster pictures. It's a film that does take its subject seriously (while on one hand one argues that the film is an indictment of crime and peoples responses, one could also argue that it's a subtle indictment of the prohibition), however it's also an exciting, and sometimes wickedly funny, take on a genre that would flourish in the thirties and forties. What comes most surprising (and I mean that as a big compliment) is how it hasn't lost much of its vitality in seventy years. The implied violence in the film is, in fact, shocking in places, and while it lacks the blood content and major shocks of the De Palma remake, it doesn't compromise to showing the (slightly Hollywood-ized) truth of the matter- crime doesn't pay, but sometimes it's all people know.Tony Camonte is played by Paul Muni, in a performance that wonderfully ranges from angry to sarcastic, funny to romantic, and just down-right crazy; it's no wonder that Pacino was inspired by his performance to take on Tony Montana in the remake (though one could argue that Muni's bravura presence and delivery in this film out-ranks Pacino's in the later). He is surrounded by supporting players that also give very good work as well, with the story being told in various threads that work perfectly. There's one semi-comic story around one of Camonte's assistants who is rather illiterate and slow (though it's also a subtle commentary on the lack of prospects for immigrants at the time). Another (which was given much prominence in the remake) involves the power-struggle between Tony and his younger sister. And then there's the good-old mixture of solid, fascinating bits with the cops and other criminals, not to mention a boss that has to control Tony's manic ideals of taking over the city (and, perhaps, the world).I once heard Quentin Tarantino in an interview say that Howard Hawks is the 'single greatest storyteller in the history of cinema'. Although that could be a heavily debatable statement, with this film Hawks proves that he definitely can do so very well, and of the few I've seen of his so far, this is my favorite. On the technical side of things, some of the technique is very straight-forward, but then there is also proof that Hawks was a step-ahead of the crowd that would bloom out in the film-noir period a decade later. Shadows used with a fine flair; great over-head and dead-on shots of cars riding and shooting; a couple of really keen close-ups. Add to that a script from Hecht that doesn't go too deep into character for too long, and you got your basic powerhouse gangster picture. And, believe me, it's a must-see if you're into the genre, or if you'd like to have a comparison test with the highly revered remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say Hello to the Original Scarred Madman...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 1930's produced a whirlwind of mobster films, commenting on the real-life problem of organized crime throughout Prohibition America. LITTLE CAESAR and PUBLIC ENEMY were the first significant films of the genre, but not until Howard Hawks tour-de-force smash, SCARFACE, did the public get to see what was going on. Hawks' film came out in 1932 and has been a mainstay in filmmaker's minds and fans alike ever since. Scorsese, Coppola, and especially De Palma, have all drawn inspiration (and the '83 remake) from Hawks and Ben Hecht, the picture's screenwriter. Paul Muni was loosely based on Al Capone, and SCARFACE begins with yet another message to the government telling them to get off their butts and rid the country of Tony Carmontes everywhere. I think the picture works more as brutal, realistic entertainment than moral message. In hindsight, SCARFACE made it all look fun.This searing flick looks so spooky and dark, you truly get the feeling of the real "underworld" and how uncompromising it was and still is. Some brilliant images grace the screen: the passage of dates on a calendar by machine gun; Muni's gruesome scar; an opening murder scene done with such subtly the mere sound of Muni's whistle triggers doom; a sideshow of possible incest between "Tony" and his tortured sister. No joke. It appears almost blatantly in varying scenes of building jealousy and murder. Many of the elements show up in De Palma's remake, such as the sister, her relationship with Tony's best friend, and his disapproving mother. The original packs more substance into a shorter film and is clearly better than the flashy remake (which I also loved).This was one of Howard Hawks' 1st films and he continued to make pictures that differed so completely, one after the other. SCARFACE is his landmark film, a must-see that was considered by many to be unreleasable to the audiences of 1932. It is a predictable rise and fall portrait of a brooding goon, however the techniques and blunt force of the film make you come back for more. Watch it before the Pacino remake and see what you think. They are excellent representatives of Hollywood storytelling then and now. Keep an eye out for a svelte Boris Karloff in civilian clothing (a rarity) as a sinister enemy of the scarred one. He rolls quite a memorable strike in a bowling alley. A masterpiece of character, story, mood, and bullets flying.RATING: 10 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sensational film! What an actor Paul Muni!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best directors ever makes one of the best films ever: Howard Hawks makes "Scarface". Everything is outstanding in this masterpiece of cinema, the exciting, neatly told story of the raise and fall of Tony Camonte (Al Capone's alter-ego). Powerful script, magnificent black and white photography, excellent camera-work, an important and courageous social message, just four years after the St. Valentine's massacre.Great action and great psychological design of the characters are perfectly woven into the story. One brilliant, innovative idea follows another. An example is the not-shown-scene of the St. Valentine's massacre. Another beautiful intuition: a key-point of the story is the arrival on the scene of the machine guns, destined to bring the gang-wars to an unheard-of level of violence. Look at Tony's scaring bliss when he handles the terrible weapon for the first time... The montage is extraordinary. Take the celebrated bowling-hall scene: we have a dozen of distinct, splendid shots, perfectly tied together. "Scarface" has a pace impressive for intensity. Not a single second is wasted in its narration.The cinematic language attains its highest level. Look how Guino Rinaldo (the great George Raft) is introduced. A man is reading a newspaper in a barber shop. The approaching siren of a police-car is heard. Without even leaving his chair, the man throws his gun in the basket of towels, and, impassive, he restarts to read. In few seconds we have got a precise hint of the personality of Guino: smart, cool-headed, laconic, professional. Soon we will see that in fact he is the cornerstone of Tony's power and success in crime.Another gem of cinematic language. Tony and his boss Lovo in the chamber of Poppy, Lovo's girl-friend. Poppy is doing her make-up. Tony tries to chat with her. Poppy doesn't pay attention. She is even rude with him. Her dressing-gown has slipped, showing Poppy's legs. Tony peeps at them. Poppy clearly notes it and she DOES NOT fix the dressing-gown...George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Karen Morley (Poppy), Osgood Perkins (the spine-less boss Lovo) make a fantastic job. And then there is Paul Muni as Tony Camonte... how good an actor he is could only be eye-witnessed, words can't describe the power of his performance. Tony is cruel, loathsome, brutal, hideous: we all hate him. Tony's clash with Lovo, with the sadistic suspense he deliberately creates, is a really ghastly scene. Nonetheless, Muni succeeds to be even touching, when Tony shows his childish enthusiasm for bad-taste "expensive" stuff, ties, silk shirts, luxury restaurants etc. Tony's final nervous breakdown is essential for the moral message of "Scarface", but it could have been a weakness of the film. Yet Muni is so great, so intense, that he can render Tony's disgusting sudden cowardice in a smooth, realistic way, and without provoking in the audience any sympathy for the gangster (an important aim for the film-makers).A crucial theme of the movie is Tony's morbid affection (to say the least) toward his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak). Well... "Scarface" would deserve a book, not just a comment. Let me skip this important motive of "brotherly love", which is extremely difficult to judge correctly, in my opinion.How can a comic character like the illiterate "gangster-secretary", who never gets the name at the telephone, fit so well in the tragic, action-packed story of "Scarface"? The answer is: Hawks' artistic genius."Scarface", Muni, Hawks... That is great Art of Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do It First, Do It Yourself, And Keep On Doing It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson in their career making roles as gangsters, Paul Muni after Scarface was able to avoid being typecast for his career. Only rarely did Muni return to a gangster part in his career.It must not have been easy for him because Muni is absolutely mesmerizing as the totally amoral Tony Camonte. After Scarface was released Muni was inundated with offers to play gangsters which he rejected. Interesting because without knowing it another of the cast in Scarface, Boris Karloff, would be ultimately trapped in the horror film genre. Muni assuredly avoided Karloff's fate.Another cast member, George Raft, got his big film break playing Muni's right hand man. For Raft this was art imitating life, these were the people who were his pallies in real life, there was never any acting involved. Raft never really had too many acclaimed performances away from the gangster/big city genre.Camonte is the ultimate killing machine. He knows only one law the law of the jungle. He'll rise by any means possible, use anyone it takes, kill anyone who gets in his way. He has only two weaknesses, an obsession that borders on incestuous desires for his sister Ann Dvorak and a kind of affection for his factotum Vince Barnett. That's the kind of affection you have for a pet.Barnett who usually played drunks and hangers-on got his career role out of Scarface. What comic relief there is in the film he provides. He's got some good moments as a 'secretary' trying to take a phone message with bullets flying all around him. Had he been not dispatched to take the message the machine gun bullets would have found their mark easily in the taller Muni.Scarface is also art that imitates life. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of the history of gangland war in the Chicago of the Twenties will recognize Muni as Capone, Boris Karloff as Bugs Moran, and Osgood Perkins as Johnny Torio. Capone could have sued, but right about then he was having much bigger problems with Internal Revenue.We can't forget Karen Morley who played Poppy the girl who likes to go with a winner. She shifts from Perkins to Muni and away from Muni when it becomes necessary. In her own way, she's as amoral as Muni.Scarface along with Public Enemy and Little Caesar set the standard for gangster films. The updated 1983 remake with Al Pacino in Muni's part is a good film itself and got a lot of its audience with some really gory scenes.Muni did it with talent alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead Of Its Time, Action-Wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action-wise, this movie was 60 years ahead of its time, at least in terms of the amount of action in it. I think it's safe to say most classic films, including the crime movies, are much slower in pace than today's fare. Not this one.Since they didn't show much blood in these old films, it isn't gory but it is action- packed with few lulls. Paul Muni, as "Tony Camonte," the head gangster, is compelling and fun to watch. He's tough-as-nails until the end. The women n here - Ann Dvoark and Karen Morely - are interesting, too, as is one of Muni's sidekicks, a big dumb guy who was funny. Don't be fooled by the billing of George Raft and Boris Karloff. They got it because they turned out to be big names later. In this film, they have very small roles.This is Muni's show, though, all the way and few actors could ham it up in his day like him. It's a wild ride for the full 93 minutes.p.s. To anyone misreading my opening remarks: more action doesn't always mean more interesting. Some times it does; some times it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise and fall of a power hungry mobster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks directs this harsh and frank and sometimes humorous look at a small time gangster's(Paul Muni) taste of success before his mob world crumbles around him. This is one of the best gangster movies of the 1930's. Very well written and full of terrific characters. Fast paced and free flowing story line. My favorite scene is when the Muni character first gets his hands on a machine gun. This arrogant, violence driven mobster becomes child like with a brand new toy. Others in this fine crime drama are Osgood Perkins, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Boris Karloff and C. Henry Gordon. Also notable are Karen Morley and Edwin Maxwell as the Chief of Detectives.Ambition, greed and pride come before a fall. The mob way or no way is a tough way to live. Excellent flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Scarface" is most often brought up in discussions on the gangster movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarface" is the film of the Thirties which is most often brought up in discussions on the gangster movie? According to Hawks, he directed "Scarface" with the idea of telling the story of the Capone family as if they were the Borgias living in Chicago in the Twenties.... This may well be- true? At the time, however, there was much publicity to suggest that "Scarface" was the Capone story ? which it certainly wasn't? It was a very good, exciting gangster film, and it stands up well when viewed today, more than 70 years on? Paul Muni gave a great performance as Tony Camonte, the scarred gang-leader, but it bears little resemblance to Capone as he really was? Camonte is tough, ruthless, a handy man with a gun and ? at the end ? a figure hysterically afraid of death as he battles it out with police from his steel-shuttered fortress? Capone was certainly tough and ruthless, but he tried to avoid gunplay himself and employed others to do his dirty work? He was not cowardly, and he did not die in battle? "Scarface"should be seen and remembered as a film devised to exploit the Chicago of its day ? and it must be remembered that Chicago gang wars made front-page banner headlines all over the world? It is the story of a battle for power between two gangster figures: Tony Camonte and Gaffney, played by Boris Karloff? A secondary plot hinges on Camonte's strength of feeling for his sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak), and the romance between Cesca and Camonte's henchman, Guino Rinaldo (George Raft).Eventually Camonte kills Rinaldo in the belief that he has violated Cesca ? though the pair are actually married? This is the famous scene in which Rinaldo, whose trademark throughout the picture is his constant flipping and catching of a gold coin, drops out of picture as he dies... and the coin this time falls to the floor? Gaffney, the rival gang-leader, is sometimes likened to Edward "Spike" O'Donnell, with whom Capone fought a war for control of the Chicago South Side? In the film, however, the Gaffney character is totally unlike the real Spike, who was a rough-and-ready criminal of Irish descent with a tendency towards practical jokes? He and his three brothers, Steve, Walter and Tommy, did just about everything in their time, from bank robberies to strike-breaking, with a little pick-pocketing on the side? "Spike" was a devout Catholic who attended services regularly... yet his most-quoted remark is: "When arguments fail ? use a black-jack."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rat-rat-a-tat goes Hawks's direction, opening and closing with a bang, and what's in between is pretty sensational, too. Muni, who could be an awful ham, is just right here -- slick and sexy and a little stupid, a hot-tempered paisano unable to control his ambitions or passions. The incest subplot, never overtly stated but always close to the surface, makes the movie seem startlingly modern. And the dialogue goes snap, snap, snap. The only place the movie stumbles is in a civics-lesson scene where the self-important newspaper editor spells out exactly what's wrong with the criminal justice system of 1932 and delivers his dull speech straight to the camera, like a high school lecture. It's the briefest of lulls in one of the most exciting early talkies, and certainly one of the greatest of all gangster flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muni, Robinson and Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably, Scarface will be compared with the near-contemporary gangster films, Little Caesar and Public Enemy, and Paul Muni with their stars Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. What does it tell us about that era: that all three careers took off with portrayals of gang leaders? The three performances significantly differ. Robinson rises to the top by the use of a crafty intelligence as well as violence; Cagney by a type of shrewdness and personal charisma. Paul Muni's Tony Comonte is neither intelligent nor personable; his manners are crude; and at times he is almost childlike in his behavior: for instance, when he is enjoying a play and is interrupted after the second act, summoned to do another killing,and leaves a henchman behind, who can tell him later how it came out, then is delighted to hear that the "guy with the collar" didn't get the girl; rather, the rougher suitor. He can be described as cunning and animistic: a young wolf who eliminates any rival who stands in his way; finally the leader of the pack One can be moved by Robinson's last words, "Is this the end of Little Caesar?" or by Cagney's body falling through the open door of his family home, he having been killed off-screen. Comonte's death is that of a trapped or cornered animal, wordless in a beautifully staged sequence,as brutal as his life, depicted for the audience in every detail. Of the three portrayals, Muni's comes across to me as the most chilling, in its enactment of instinctive evil. How ironic that He would later win his greatest fame for his performances as Emile Zola and Louis Pasteur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monster Who Whistles Opera Arias</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to a book about the films that Howard Hughes produced, while SCARFACE was being produced in Hollywood, the director Howard Hawkes got a visit from two rather unfriendly gentlemen. They had been sent by their employer, one Alphonse Capone of Chicago, to find out the truth that the movie Hawkes was directing was about him and his career. Hawkes assured them that it wasn't, as everyone knew what a smart man Mr. Capone was, while the central figure in this film ended up dead. Somehow Hawkes' reassurances worked, and the great director did not find his career ended prematurely with a "cement kimono" or a severe case of lead poisoning. How he was able to get away with this I can't figure out. Capone was known (behind his back) as "scarface" because of a knifing scar which was given to him (and which he well earned) when he insulted the knife wielder's sister in the Red Hook area of Brooklyn in the late teens of the 20th Century. The name of the anti-hero at the center of the film is "Tony Carmonte", which sounds vaguely like "Capone". He is brought to the city to bump off the old boss by Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), just like Capone was brought to Chicago by his uncle Johnny Torrio to kill Torrio's friend and boss "Big Jim Colosimo" in 1920. Maybe various incidents are not precisely like those Capone did, but enough were left in to leave little doubt. SCARFACE is to Capone as ALL THE KING'S MEN is to Huey Long and CITIZEN KANE is to William Randolph Hearst.SCARFACE has frequently been put into a select group of gangster films that popped up between 1930 and 1932 (LITTLE CAESAR and THE PUBLIC ENEMY are the other two that are grouped with it). Each has elements of real violence in it, and it is amazing that Paul Muni, Eddie Robinson, and Jimmy Cagney all became stars from these three performances. This is not to knock their performances (they are all great ones), but the acceptance of the three stars as stars for portraying such anti-social types is incredible. My guess is the growing disillusionment of the public with federal and state and local government in the depression may have affected the audience's low threshold of normal tolerance for the gangsters in society. Suddenly they were supermen who knew how to get things done and how to force their views on society.Muni's performance has been likened to that of an "ape" or "gorilla" man, as his body movements are not very gentle bur forceful and all threatening. He is only capable of feeding his own desires at everyone else's expense. Yet Muni does manage to leaven this monster's habits. First, most of the people he deals with are little better. Lovo is not as obviously murderous as Carmonte, but he brought him to Chicago, and (until Tony starts muscling Lovo out of his center of power and his relationship with Poppy - Karen Morley) he turns very nasty. George Raft's Rinaldo is loyal to Tony (until he romances and marries Tony's sister Cesca - Ann Dvorak), but he is a merciless killer to all of Tony's enemies. Tony's habit of whistling an air from an opera before he shows his vicious streak is mirrored by Rinaldo's now celebrated coin flipping. Vince Barnett's Angelo is the type of low-live hanger-on that services these criminals. We tend to like Angelo because he is so stupid at times (and his death scene is a pathetically sad one) but he is not a good citizen. As for the opponents of Carmonte in the underworld, a typical one is Boris Karloff's Gaffney (a British criminal? - possibly based on Owney Madden, the English born, New York criminal). He is not only vicious when his gang was active, but his Gaffney mirrors Carmonte when he is in hiding, trembling about being bumped off (as Tony does at the end).Tony does have some cultural pretensions (unlike Capone, who openly preferred sports like baseball and boxing). Not only his whistling habits, he also enjoys plays - we see him watching a production of RAIN by Somerset Maugham. He likes the character of Sadie Thompson and he even notes how the production keeps a steady stream of rain going on stage. But it is pure veneer. He leaves the theater to commit a murder.He also shows a degree of incestuous interest towards Cesca. It leads to a growing series of confrontations with his sister over her behavior with men (he wants her to remain pure, at home). He even kills the loyal Rinaldi before he learns the latter married Cesca. Yet it is a curious relationship - Cesca is the last loyal member of his mob, and dies for him at the end.As a study of uncontrolled brutality run amok, SCARFACE is still powerful. One might say that Muni's performance goes over the top, with lines about allowing his machine gun to "spit". But so did Al Pacino in the remake, introducing his enemies to "his little friend."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must-see seminal gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul, George and Boris get it started.Anyone who has seen the wide array of gangster films over the past 80 years will find so many images originating with this gritty tale mixing portions of Al Capone's story with the Borgias. Viewers who know just the basics of Capone can identify most of the characters by their real-life names. This is so much more than simply the original version of the Al Pacino cult flick. Paul Muni, a brilliant and flexible actor, is the lowest of low-lifes, base and amoral with incestuous leanings. There isn't a hint of respect for human life. There is nothing glamorous in his portrayal of Tony or in the film at all. As repellent as he is, Muni is riveting.Of huge importance in the long-range scope of crime film is George Raft's image here. Though his Guino "Little Boy" Rinaldo is a still man with few lines, he leaves a whammy of an impression. His constant flipping of a coin - suggested by Howard Hawks - created a prototype for nearly all gangster films and spoofs to follow. It was also an inside joke in "Some Like It Hot." Every gangster film needs a sharp-dressing wise-guy coin flipper - and you'll even see it in softies like "Singin' in the Rain," "Guys and Dolls" and even the weasels in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" This is where it started. When other gangster film stars got a "break-through," it was in a starring role. Raft's came here, as a killer and ladykiller hovering in the background with a face the camera loved like a woman. It helped that he was surrounded by plain and ugly thugs.Like the cinematic use of the X's, Hawks used the coin flip as a signal of death. And there are a lot of deaths. Such imagery by cinematographer Lee Garmes contributes significantly to the power of this film. By the time Raft meets his stunningly restrained end, the audience has already had the warning of it telegraphed through these images. While this is a very black, violent film there is also bleak humor, such as Boris Karloff's fate in a bowling alley. And the added scenes sternly disclaiming the adulation of such criminals can also provoke a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...And never lets go of it's frantic pace. Howard Hawks 'Scarface' is an amazing product of the 30's, a Pre-Code gangster film that broke many, many boundaries.Muni's Tony Camonte is an ugly, ape-like figure who is supposed to represent Capone (scarred cheek and all). Camonte is psychotic, primitive, volatile and ambitious, ardently believing in a sign that beams 'The World Is Yours'. His Napoleonic delusions and drive lead him to break more than a few vital 'mob rules', and he quickly goes from being the hunter to the hunted as he rises in power.The first time I viewed Muni in the role I thought he wasn't very good at all, with over-the-top gesturing and crude attempts at psychology...then I re-watched. Now I believe that Muni's performance is one of the best you'll find in in the gangster/crime genre. So, why the change of heart? Well, at the time I wasn't very exposed to early 30's (talkie) acting styles, so I thought he was overblown. Then I realised how convincingly brutal and animalistic Muni is in the role, and I was bowled over with his skill. Needless to say, I'm a Muni fan now.This film is Pre-Code and has, to put it bluntly, a lot of sex in it. Most of the women we see in the film are prostitutes like Poppy, scantily clad tart who Muni leers over. But the most interesting sexual element is the incest angle. Muni may make a play for Poppy, but it's blatantly obvious that it's his kid sister Cesca, who he lusts after and truly loves. Their encounters are raw and brutal, but tinged with a steamy, very sexual element. In one encounter, Muni rips off half of Dvorak's dress, revealing her bra, in anger and jealousy. In another, he shoots down Cesca's lover/husband Guino Rinaldo because he believes that Guino has violated her (what Tony wishes to do to her himself?). Strong stuff.Dvorak is quite good in her role, nailing most of her scenes with an effective manner. She overacts a little, but her last scene with Muni is great. She's also sexy. George Raft seems to be doing little more than coin-flipping in his role, and it does bug you after a while. But he has a strong screen presence despite his lack of dialogue, so he comes out of it OK. Karloff even portrays a gangster! I'm not too sure whether it comes off that good, but it's an interesting role for him and he does get the best death sequence in the film.This is a very fast paced movie; the action never lets up. Hawks made a name for himself with this film, and his direction is a credit to the film's success. The only thing I wonder about is the material that would have been left on the cutting room floor...Hawks is having a lot of fun here with Camonte. The film is very entertaining, and one gets the sense that the moralizing typed prologue is only half-hearted, slipped in occasionally to appease film executives who couldn't possibly be seen to be glorifying the mafia (How times have changed- look at Penn's 1967 effort 'Bonnie And Clyde').The expressionistic lighting and sets would contribute to the noir genre that took off in the 40's.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?What are you going to do about it?' Hawks' question begins this film along with a claim that it is ?an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government'. This film is not an indictment against organized crime and crooked politicians but rather an entertaining rise and fall story of an ambitious and arrogant gangster wrapped around an impossible unrequited love for his own sister. Loosely based on the life of Al Capone, it is wanting to know when this wild cannon will get mowed down in gunfire as he continuously ups the stake to increase his power, that keeps me riveted, not the depiction of a wronged society.Pocked with symbolism and shadowy cinematography, Howard Hawks takes us right into the underworld of the gangster through the life of Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), the rough but charming gangster whose goal is to take total control of the bootleg beer business, with the help of machine guns. Realistic car chases, crashes, rat-tat-tat drive by shooting and plenty of violence are shown to us as part of this gangster's working day. While it follows the Classical Hollywood Style and low-key lighting for the stark dark world of crime, the film runs at a steady building pace. This gangster life is exciting ? it comes with girls, silk robes and fancy cars, but it is always choked with danger from enemies, a double-crossing boss to police who are keen to do final judgment on the spot. But it is this danger that increases the urgency of Tony Camonte to ?take over the world' and with this urgency is the chance that he will make a mistake - and we wait for this mistake. Each scene tops the last in terms of the stakes and danger. He does make a mistake and that is revealed in a slow build up with warning signs splattered as often as machine gun fire. All of his actions up to that was part of a strategy to gain complete control of the booze empire; once he crosses a sacred line, he is doomed.In the life of Scarface, we see his personal life as the only son in a poor fatherless broken home with a reproachful mother and fun loving sister whom he protects violently. We see his career life with his smart Brutus style crime. He is a keen strategist with a strong grip on reality. He can clearly spot weaknesses in his bosses and his enemies and then quickly take advantage of them. Camera close-ups to his steely looks let us know he is always on the verge of violence or a joke but you never know which. He disregards authority but recognizes the power of the gun. His strategy is made clear when he points to the machine gun in his hand ?There is only one thing that gets orders and gives orders and this is it'. In an earlier scene he tells his right hand man Guino ?Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doing it'. This clearly shows how he intends to go about his goal. However, what does he really want? This is symbolized in an obvious way by the neon sign for a travel agency outside his apartment window ? The World is Yours' But why does he want it? This is hinted throughout the film as we jump into both his personal and 'business' life and spot his own weakness.Though Tony seeks the pretty girl the real girl he wants is his sister, There are several examples in the film where the relationship was less than squeaky clean - see if you can spot them, but look at the poster for this film shows Tony going for his Sister in a lecherous way with her in a skimpy dress. No sign of supposed love interest, Poppy the platinum blonde. This relationship with his sister certainly makes the movie more interesting and is a theme often copied in more difficult American showpieces such as in Arthur Miller's play ? A View from the Bridge' (1960) . The production code was not in full use until 1934 but the censors had plenty to say about the indecent relationship between the two, requesting that some scenes be reshot. His sister is quite a cookie; passionate, sexy and has designs on the opposite sex. ?I have adult ideas' she tells Guino.The film makes plentiful use of symbols. The X for death is used liberally, I spotted 5 scenes with the X, see how many you can find. This X seems to symbolize the fatalistic nature surrounding Tony; when he decides someone is to die, death itself comes and helps him out. Other techniques such as a man whistling every time someone is killed is copied in more recent movies like Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction when Jules recites Ezekiel from the bible before killing people.The film opens with a statement of purpose as an ?indictment' against gangsters. But the film clearly is no such thing. There are however, several scenes where this opening statement ties in and each scene has it's own purpose though they definitely distracts us from the ?full' life of the gangster we are connected to and I wonder why they are really there. The police chief, symbolizing the good solid American, elucidates what is wrong with gangsters, lawyers and politicians. The ruling-class meetings discuss the problem and decide that it is the lack of gun laws and illegal immigration that supports the gangsters. These topical issues are cited as root cause. Whether they are or not is irrelevant, what is important is that they incite public reaction. The opening statements only purpose is to get the viewer even more riled up about the film. Hawks cared less about society's gangster problem than his film as he rejected censors requests for inclusion of changed scenes.The movie's dark substance is complemented with humor and romance. There is a running joke throughout the film where Scar face's secretary can't answer the phone properly until the very end, which is funny. Sexual humor surrounds Scar face's ambition to claim Poppy. In an early scene she is bent over with her rear to the camera and says ?Why don't you do it' (in reference to sending flowers), the next shot is of him giving a protracted gaze in the direction of her butt only to be moved on by Johnny Lovo.?What are you going to do about it?' Well, enjoy this well made, fast paced gangster flick! A great show of tough monkeys, sultry dames and great car chases. A film about blind ambition for an impossible love.Scarface was one of Howard Hawks most famous movies and is the standard for the gangster genre, influencing future directors such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Though Scarface was not the first gangster movie, similarities and copycats followed quickly and often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not just that SCARFACE is far superior to the remake; it's also the fact that it was one of the most daring and controversial movies of its era (though there were compromises: the scene in the editor's office, where the "moral" is spelled out, was added after the film was completed, to appease the various censor boards), and it's still a fast, often startlingly funny, and vicious gangster movie. It doesn't ask you to feel sorry for the characters: rather, the movie assumes that you're fascinated because these characters live fast, hard, dangerous lives. Paul Muni was never better than in this movie (certainly, it's one of his toughest, most direct, least mannered pieces of work), and he's matched by a wonderful supporting cast, especially Ann Dvorak's sly, insinuating performance as his sister. Howard Hawks's direction is amazingly kinetic, and Lee Garmes's cinematography is dazzling (as layered and beautiful as his work for von Sternberg). Simply one of the great American classics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not flawless, but still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched "Scarface" for the 3rd or 4th time, and was surprised to find out that I no longer find it utterly perfect. Vince Barnett's vaudevillian comic bits are too long, and the constant underscoring of the film's anti-violence "message" is awkward. But I still think the film has a lot of great things in it, and I would definitely recommend it. As everyone else mentioned, Paul Muni is excellent as dopey gangster Tony Camonte, and this time I was knocked out by Karen Morley's performance as a no-nonsense moll; I hope I can find some other films of hers. I'm not sure the movie works as the anti-violence film it claims to be: Although Tony Camonte has a lot of faults, the non-gangster characters are mostly undeveloped and dull, if not downright problematic, like the police inspector who apparently likes to beat up arrestees. Edwin Maxwell's tough-talking Chief of Detectives has the right idea about the "lice" who shoot innocent bystanders during their crime sprees, but his character is a bit too one-note to compete with Paul Muni and George Raft. In fact, I think George Raft's character is subtly made into the hero of the film, despite all the illegal things he does. Interestingly, the film is probably just as violent as many modern pictures--there are an awful lot of gunshot victims--but because it's in black and white, and each killing goes by quickly, audiences of today might find it rather tame. But Hawks makes excellent use of sound to try and convey the horror of some of the crimes: a woman screams chillingly, a dog barks in the distance. Did this film help rouse the public against Prohibition-era gangsters, or did it just continue the public's romance with them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise and fall of a gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of the movie the filmmakers offer these words as a sort of preface: "This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and our liberty. Every incident in this picture is a reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government, 'What are you going to do about it?' The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it?" Having asserted some sort of moral value to their depiction of organized crime, the story proceeds. It's the story of Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), who rises through the ranks of bootlegging and enforcing until he runs his outfit, but only after he escalates the territorial wars and ups the violence level. He supplants his boss and patron and takes his girl, Poppy (Karen Morley), and furnishes his apartment with steel shutters. His two closest companions are the quintessentially cool Rinaldo (George Raft), small, well dressed and barbered, stoical of expression, and much given to flipping a coin over and over, and the comic henchman Angelo (Vince Barnett), with his big ears, ill-fitting dandy's hat, poor grasp of the language, and dogged loyalty. Tony also has a family, which he bullies, especially his little sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak). Boris Karloff plays a gaunt rival gang leader, Gaffney. The whole city is under siege, and in the one false note of the movie a newspaper publisher indulges in a demagogic set speech along the lines of the preface, calling for martial law if necessary. But the story must have its sad end. Cesca marries Rinaldo while Tony is out of town, and Tony, misunderstanding, shoots him. The police come down on Tony for the murder, and Cesca plans to kill him in revenge for her husband's death, but can't. First the loyal Angelo dies in the siege, and then Cesca, and then Tony makes a dash out the front door to die in a hail of bullets. So much of the style of the gangster ethos seems to be set here, the calm, the swagger, the maniacal edge, the long periods of quiet and the explosive violence, the edge of menace. Raft is brilliant at all this, so much so that he almost steals every scene, except that he just stands there and waits. Very cool. Chilling. Muni is brilliant too, even though the part calls for him to be a little slow on the uptake, perhaps, and practically demented in the final scenes. His goofy courtship of Poppy and the running joke about his taste for the garish and expensive shouldn't work, but it does. And his Italianate gestures?the toss of the hair, the sardonic touching the rim of the hat, the grin and nod?all seem to be the prototype for countless later actors who follow Muni in portraying Italian criminals with style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it" Tony Camonte</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as gangster movies go, "Scarface", together with "Little Caesar", and "Public Enemy" are at the top of the best of this genre. Director Howard Hawks showed a tremendous courage in getting involved in this project. which had the subtitle "Shame of a Nation", when it was first released. Ben Hecht, one of the best screen writers of all times shows why he was a genius the way his screen play unfolds on the screen. It also help to have had Lee Garmes, one of the best cinematographers of the time placing his cameras at angles that enhance the film in unexpected and original ways.This is the story that follows the rise and fall of Tony Camonte, who loosely resembled Al Capone in the story. Tony Camonte, a poor kid from Chicago had the ambition and the wherewithal to go far, as he proves in the story. Tony, in addition, was ruthless to his enemies. His lucky break comes in the person of Johnny Lovo, a higher up in the crime family of the "Roaring 20s". Tony, who has an eye for Johnny's paramour, Poppy, was a man that clearly understood what to do to make it in the underworld.It's interesting to watch how Howard Hawks inserts the symbolism in the letter X, as Tony and his men keep on eliminating the opposing factions. Tony's sister, Cesca, gets involved with his right hand man, Guino Rinaldo. The deception proved to be too much for Camonte. The film served, perhaps, as a cautionary tale to an impoverish nation that was going through that black period of its history during The Great Depression.Paul Muni, an actor that came from the theater, tended to overact in much of his work. This side of him served to emphasize that Tony was an awkward man without much sophistication. George Raft, another actor who played enough gangsters during his career, makes a wonderful contribution to the success of the film playing most of his scenes opposite Paul Muni. Ann Dvorak is seen as the rebellious Cesca, who fell in love with Guino Rinaldo in one of her best roles. Oswood Perkins plays Johnny Lovo with his usual style. Boris Karloff has some good opportunities with his Gaffney, Tony Camonte's rival. Karen Morley, C. Henry Barnett, and the rest of the cast do excellent work for Mr. Hawks."Scarface" is a classic movie that shows a great director, Howard Hawks, at his best. The remake by Brian DePalma pales in comparison with this enormously entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual for HH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As other have accurately pointed out, this is an unusual film for Hawks. For one thing, there really is no hero. Muni looks rather anthropoid in this movie. He seems to live in a dump and is content to let his mother and sister live in a similar dump. He throws his mother around too, the swine. There is little of the male solidarity we've come to expect from Hawks. Everyone in the film seems manipulative.There are a couple of other uncharacteristic features here. Some fancy editing takes place as a chattering tommy gun seems to blow away the pages of a calendar. And the later Hawks would have considered the symbolic use of all those Xs to be pretentious. (Hawks claimed he got the idea from a photo in a tabloid newspaper of a murder scene after the body had been removed, but an X was entered into the pic to denote the body's position.) Of course many of his characters had little quirks, rubbing their noses with a finger or whatever, but they were behavioral touches rather than artifactual. After this film he seems to have given up on built-in symbolic oddities and gone with George Raft's coin flipping instead. But, the main plot aside, Tony Camonte's attitude towards his sister, a characteristically non-obedient babe with melanic eye rings like a panda's, is straightforwardly covert. I've never been sure he knew exactly what he was doing with forbidden impulses like incest or homosexuality. I mean, the guy was from Goshen, Indiana! He didn't know from Freud. As he once put it in an interview, "They attribute all these things to me. . . . It's completely unconscious." Ann Dvorak, as the sister, does a mean kootchy kootchy for Raft in the nightclub vestibule, by the way. This is definitely worth catching, although it doesn't seem to be shown much on TV. It belongs with Little Caesar and Public Enemy as one of the films to establish an entire genre.</fullReview>

Yes it is a gangland classic and it a good movie but they way it was made was so bad, i couldn't believe that they stretched it to 3 hours long with a plot twist of him going after michelle pfeiffer. There are time where Scarface 2 can get rather dull and lose its oh my god feeling. The original made in 1932 keeps you going what the hell this is 1932. The car stunts for the time are amazing and Paul Muni does an unforgettable performance. I never got bored watching the original and i was 16 so that tells you that i kinda know what I'm talking about. There's no blood for the effect but thats about all the sacrifice to be made.

		<fullReview>This is a magnificent film. No, this is a ground breaking, earth shattering, trail blazing masterpiece. This film is nothing less than an epoch. Some will try to pretend that the gangster film genre truly existed before Howard Hawks' 1932 gem, but it didn't. This is the first film that can and should be taken seriously as a gangster film. Hawks did for the gangster genre with this film what Hitchcock did for suspense. Scarface has maturity, depth, scope, it is multifaceted. The script by Ben Hecht is wonderful. There are a number of magnificent lines throughout the film such as Tony Camonte saying you do it first, yourself and keep doing it. The character is revealed immediately and he is paradoxically both attractive and grotesque. The film is a broad canvas that frames all of America's ills. The romanticism of violence, the lust for success on any level, and an absolute appetite for blood.Extraordinarily disturbing is the films finale. Camonte doesn't parish so much because of the depth of his immorality, but because he shows weakness, his tough exterior has failed him, just like the bulletproof shutters he has put on his windows.It's very bizarre to me to to think that this film would ever be in need of rescuing, but unfortunately film like history when it comes to the general population has a very short memory. Today audiences are more likely to be familiar with and in reverence of De Palma's 1983 version. A virtual rip off that changes a few elements, and sure it is not the same movie, but so much material is lifted and no credit is given. This is an outrage. More than half the script for the 83 version comes from this film. No matter what anyone says that is outright theft, but it is overlooked because we are talking about film and not literature. Sure Mr. De Palma pays homage to Howard Hawks, but wouldn't you if you had basically plagiarized his film with a few alterations to modernize the story.Ironically, as in Hawks visionary story integrity, truth, validity, morality have all been obscured and we live in a society where it is not only okay to steal and butcher, but it pays. Whoever said crime doesn't pay?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An uncharacteristic film for Howard Hawks because its one of the few films by him to have no heroic characters at all. Does not have the same kind of male bonding that is part of the director's resume. Scarface(1932) is the film that put Howard Hawks name on the film map. Its Hawks excellent take on the gangster genre made popular in the 1930s.Scarface(1932) was made during the pre code era before the Hays Office began a tough censorship campaign that lasted three decades. Scarface(1932) was very violent in its time and was one of the movies that was targeted by the Hays Code. For thirty plus years films and movie makers were squeezed out of any artistic freedom due to the tyrant rule of the Hays Office. Many of the pre code films took chances with subject ideas that were considered very taboo in the early 1930s.Scarface(1932) was scandalous because of the incestuous obsession of Tony Camonte for his little sister, Cesca. For this reason and many others the film was way ahead of its time. The incest angle is the most daring and gutsiest aspect of Howard Hawks Scarface(1932). Foreshadows a similar relationship seventeen years later in White Heat(1949).The letter X is a dominating motif of Scarface that appears thougout the motion picture. X in this case does not mark the spot but does mark death. X appears whenever someone is about to be killed. X seems to have another meaning that meant something to the director.Tony Camonte is loosely based on the famous Prohibition mob boss, Al Capone. In fact, Scarface(1932) was inspired by the career and life of the notorious Al Capone. The film takes its title from the nickname Al Capone received as a young man after receiving a scar around his face. On a humorous note Al Capone was such a big of a movie with a character that was loosely patterened after him.My favorite part of the movie are the coin flipping antic of George Raft. No other film has made flipping a coin look so cool. Its the trademark of Tony Camonte's best friend and right hand man, Guino Rinaldo. This type of stylization made a star out of supporting actor, George Raft.One difference between the Howard Hawks and Brian De Palma versions are the big illegal activity of thier time period. Also, Tony Montana is Cuban while Tony Camonte is Italian. Another difference between the 32 and 83 version is that Violence in the former is implicit for the most part while mostly explicit in the latter. Last but not least, the 83 remake shows a little more sympathy towards its main character than the 32 version.There are three reasons why the Howard Hawks original is better than the Brian De Palma remake. First, the acting, direction, and writing are top rate. Second, the incest sub plot is not played with an over the top relish like in the remake. Third, Paul Muni makes a more convining Italian than Al Pacino does as a Cuban.Ben Hecht did an excellent job in writing the screenplay for the motion picture. The characters are developed in a realistic manner and the violent scenes are brutally descriptive. Scarface(1932) would be the beginning of a long fruitful director-writer relationship between Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. Ben Hecht fills the story with interesting sub plots and memorable moments.Scarface(1932) is a motion picture in need of an appearence on DVD. Scarface(1932) was Howard Hawks second foray into the gangster genre a year after the release of his first, The Criminal Code(1931). Boris Karloff gives a terrific performance in a rare non horror picture appearence. Scarface(1932) is still as powerful and tough in 2001 as it was in 1932.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, Mile-a-Minute, Kinetic Gangster Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original version of Scarface, gratuitous disclaimers and all, is a great film for its time due to Howard Hawks's witty, mile-a-minute style which produces great moments like a man being shot in a bowling alley, the camera indifferently following his bowling ball down the lane where it makes a strike. Big Louis Costillo, last of the old-style gang leaders is slain, and his former bodyguard is taken into custody. He is Tony Camonte, given so much engrossing dimension and profound distinctions which make him memorable, everything from the true lack of any redeeming values in him as a character to how his sweaty, greasy bowl haircut swings to one side when he's pumping a machine gun. Since Costillo's body has never been discovered, the police have to release him. Tony begins taking over the rackets in town with murderous, bullet- pilfered insistence, and he becomes a danger to the other bosses unless they work for him. In the meantime, Tony's sister wants to be more independent and a life of her own, but finds herself smothered and victimized by her brother's jealous and controlling hold. The frustration of the other bosses and the unyielding pursuit of the police push Tony towards a major confrontation.Hawks's kinesis makes this film what it is. The manner of telling the story is very much like a 93-minute montage of speeding cars, the endless sound of machine gun fire, and arguing police and politicians. There are countless moments of terrific film-making even by today's standards, such as when Tony and George Raft's Rinaldo, Tony's quiet and loyal sidekick, while in a restaurant being destroyed by machine guns from the street, are so indifferent to the violence that they begin talking about the Tommy gun Tony picks up from a dead shooter and what a neat gun it is.After having watched Little Caesar, I see just how much more capable a good filmmaker was in the early days of talking pictures. Perhaps one always has to take a 1930s movie into consideration due to its time, as it is inevitably very dated. Nonetheless, Scarface is worthy of frequent viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People forget that 1930 was the onset of the great depression when cynicism ruled the land. Everybody was poor, it seemed. While that was not the case, the brutal fact is that our nation was in a two-tiered society of haves and have-nots, the overwhelming majority falling into that latter category. Add to the that, the 18th amendment was still in effect and bootlegging was rampant. At no time in our nation's history was the law of the land so ignored and broken. The bootlegger became a dark hero, fighting a perceived unjust, bringing forbidden fruits to those willing to pay for it and living an enviable lifestyle. Glorifying gangsters wasn't the theme of this film, albeit that was seemingly the attitude of the censors, it was playing to a widely held model of the Robin Hood archetype of the one flaunting authority. Everyone hates that tax collectors and whoever is seen as stealing from them is worthy of praise. Muni's archetype as the cloddish yet admirably simplistic gangster differs little from a swaggering US president who has declared, "Bring 'em on." The image of the tough leader who takes what he wants, usurps the weak and still is basically a "simple guy" at heart forms the cardboard cutout of the dark hero. This theme is diminished greatly in the Al Pacino remake, casting the dark hero as an antihero ex-patriot Cuban. The latter film is just as bloody and with the sexual overtones explicit instead of implicit. Raft and Muni made a great pair and are the two most memorable characters in the film. C. Henry Gordon and Vince Barnett, two great character actors, provide some contrast and comic relief while the gorgeous and under-appreciated Ann Dvorak flashes her gorgeous eyes emotively. Raft's coin flipping Guino opened the door for a whole number of gunsels in later films and Muni's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. This old film has legs and when you allow for the time in which it was made under the guidance of Howard Hughes and Howard Hawks, it is both terrible and enjoyable but always intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic gangster film and massively influential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen this film's 1983 remake before seeing the original, so many of the plot details were already spoiled for me ahead of time. That ended up not mattering too much though, because this film is quite enjoyable in its own right. Its also shockingly violent, at least for its time. Only before the Hayes Code could classic Hollywood get away with this much gun battles (not to mention some unsubtle subtexts about incest, which were also explored in the remake). I can picture this causing the uproar about violence in cinema that its remake did in the 80s. Sure, this isn't anything shocking when viewed nowadays, but "Scarface" is still a punchy and effective gangster film that was massively influential for a reason - its really that great. In fact, I'd say this is even better than the remake.Howard Hawks was always one of Hollywood's finest directors, and his skills are on full display here. He tells a story incredibly well, keeps it consistently tense, and makes sure everything moves at a lightning quick pace. However, as great as his direction is, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective without Paul Muni in the title role. Hes appropriately slimy yet not without sympathy. After seeing him in this and "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang", I'm convinced hes one of the most incredibly underrated actors ever and possibly the greatest of the early sound era. Don't be fooled by the fact there's some other big names billed (such as Boris Karloff and George Raft) - this is Muni's show through and through. Ann Dvorak is terrific as well as Muni's sister - shes very cool and seems intent on getting away with as much sexual undercurrents as an actress could at the time.The only flaw with the film is that there's one sequence inserted about halfway through where a committee questions a newspaper man about glorifying the gangster. Its rather awkwardly inserted, and comes across as very preachy and even laughable. It was probably added as the film wouldn't be accused of the same thing. Still, thats a minor quibble for what is otherwise a great film. The original "Scarface" is just as exciting and action-packed today as when it came out. A true must see for any self-respecting film buff. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The World Is Yours Cook's ToursThis about sums up the movie for me. As I am sure is the same with most people, I saw the Al Pachino 1983 remake first, and also - as I am sure is the same with most people - I wasn't even aware there was an original movie.I got hold of this movie a few months ago, and feared watching it. If it was bad, it'd possibly ruin the remake for me. If it was good it'd possibly ruin the remake for me. I decided to think of it as a totally different movie, considering the scenario is dissimilar and the style is different.This worked out pretty well for me, throughout most of the movie it is nothing like the remake, the best scenes totally make you forget there is a remake. But every time you are relaxed enjoying this "new" old movie suddenly a familiar scene creeps in. One of the earlier ones is Tony looking out the window talking about the sign that states "The World Is Yours, Cook's Tours". Not only does this scene remind you of the remake, but it gives meaning and reason behind why this phrase is important. There are a few other scenes that are similar to scenes in the remake, one or two are almost exact copies. So not only do I feel that I have enjoyed this as a separate, clever and enjoyable (and sometimes funny (the secretary is genius)) gangster movie, but I also feel as though I have more history and reason for the remake.If you (like me) have seen the remake and you are debating seeing the original, then I say do it. Not only will you enjoy it from the remake's perspective, but you will also enjoy this brilliant classic gangster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last of the big three gangster films of the early 30s, Howard Hawks' Scarface is the one that has best stood the test of time. Little Caesar and Public Enemy, both great films, always feel as if they are accidental classics, forged more by the central performances than by any greatness inherent in the script or direction. With this film, the continuously inventive touches give ample evidence of the talent at work behind the camera. Hawks is one of Hollywood's best ever directors, Ben Hecht is a legendary screenwriter and WR Burnett had already proved his worth as the original author of the novel on which Little Caesar was based the previous year. It's obvious that a lot of thought went into this tale ? certainly more than the average production-line flicks the studios were churning out in the early thirties. Each murder that takes place is signified by the appearance of an X (the mark left by police to indicate where a body lay at the scene of a death) somewhere on the screen, whether a shadow on a wall or the number on a hotel door), and cinematographer Lee Garmes makes great use of light and shadow to hint at the madness that slowly envelopes Camonte's soul as he rushes toward his fate.Paul Muni in his breakthrough role gives a kinetic performance as Tony Camonte (a figure closely modelled on Al Capone), managing to convey at a moment's notice the cold heart that beats inside the sometimes buffoonish exterior. His character is deceptively complex for an early movie, with more than a hint of incestuous desire for his vampish sister (Ann Dvorak) and the suggestion of an insecure shell of a man cowering beneath the bravado. George Raft, in the role that made him, doesn't really have a lot to do other than flick his coin and look cool as Camonte's sidekick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless gangster classic loses none of its excitement over the years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni is the only actor to give Rod Steiger serious competition in the portrayal of the near mythic Al Capone. Since Muni is playing a character based on Capone, but not so literally as Steiger, he has more freedom to let the ambitious Tony Camonte show many sides of his personality. So much of Muni's performance is deliberately and perversely funny, his slow descent into madness and self destruction by the end of the picture has a surprising power. The gallows humor that pervades the film feels like an accurate picture of the Twenties' underside and the national mood of cynicism about Prohibition. It is obvious where the preachy interludes denouncing the gangsters were inserted to satisfy the Hayes office, as they are totally out of sync with the black comedy of the rest of the movie. The sequence in which the fuming editor meets with a citizens' committee,and declares that martial law should be declared if necessary ,is typical of the right wing attitude found in a lot of early Thirties pictures. The movie has so many outrageous scenes and characters ,that it's almost impossible to do justice to it in words.SPOILERS AHEAD: The sheer delight in seeing the lean, hawk-faced Boris Karloff unpacking a crate full of tommy guns, and speaking in his British upper class accent about getting rid of Camonte, is priceless. The movie is full of wonderful, unexpected moments like that. One of the funniest sequences depicts Camonte, his buddy Guino (George Raft), and a tiny hoodlum known as "Dope" setting out to persuade speakeasy proprietors to buy their brand of beer instead of their competitors' . The Dope ( Vince Barnett) has only a rudimentary grasp of English , and when asked by Camonte for a pencil, borrows one from their boss's pocket and sharpens it between his teeth. Later, when the urgent assassination of a rival takes precedence over seeing the end of a play, Camonte makes the Dope stay behind to find out how the drama ends. The casual brutality of the gangsters is offset by a bleak humor that seems an essential part of the atmosphere they live in. Written by newspaperman Ben Hecht with a cynical, knowing attitude, the movie is totally convincing in its straightforward depiction of these fast and dangerous living gangsters. A great many of the violent episodes are slightly disguised versions of real events that would have been familiar to the 1932 audience. The St. Valentine's Day Massacre is one; the coldblooded gangland murder of seven men at once had made headlines just three years before Hawks' Scarface was released. This is a classic that should be seen by Howard Hawks fans, gangster history buffs and gangster movie fans, as well as any viewer who appreciates excellent movie-making from Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the gangster film was born...still stunning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SCARFACE set the style for all the Warner gangster films to follow, gritty, fast-paced and full of violence. It was a cycle that seemed to come to a fitting conclusion with Cagney's WHITE HEAT seventeen years later.Aside from Howard Hawks' brisk, no nonsense direction, the biggest asset of SCARFACE is PAUL MUNI, with the swarthy actor riveting in the role of the merciless gangster who gets his comeuppance in the final scene, squealing like a cornered rat so that the pre-code censorship would be satisfied by a crime doesn't pay sort of ending.A close second to Muni is GEORGE RAFT, flipping that coin in true gangster movie style, and doing nicely in a secondary plot that features his attraction to Muni's teen-aged sister, ANN DVORAK, who appears to have a close relationship with her obsessed brother.Hawks and Howard Hughes apparently had many censorship angles to soften before the film could be released but this is still pre-code stuff that has a sharp enough edge to make it watchable today.Interesting to note that the actor who plays a double-crossing crime boss is played by Osgood Perkins, father of the late Anthony Perkins. He bears no resemblance to his famous son. As an opportunistic gangster's moll, Karen Morley is stunning as Muni's love interest.Other gangster films of this era were just as effective--films like LITTLE CAESAR and PUBLIC ENEMY--but this one ranks among the most memorable of the early thirties.If you like gangster films, this is one you can't afford to miss.Trivia note: Interesting to note the scarcity of background music throughout. It would take awhile before this would change drastically, especially at studios like Warner Bros. where Max Steiner flourished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best gangster movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is right up there with classics like "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas".The story for "Scarface" is absolutely brilliant and has many interesting different sidetracks and story lines. The way the story is told is absolutely great and the movie features some classic and original scene's and moments. Especially the ending is a memorable one.Paul Muni's performance as Tony Camonte is really great. OK he ain't no Al Pacino but he still plays the character with lots of passion and profession. Paul Muni is really an underrated actor, I mean this guy has been nominated for an Oscar 6 times and won one of those but yet he is unknown to the most of us. Another fine role is played by George Raft as a typical stereotype gangster that loves to flip coins (and killing people of course). The atmosphere is perfectly 'dark' like you would expect from a good gangster movie. Although the movie is pretty violent it isn't a heavy movie to watch, mainly because there also is room for some (at times misplaced) almost slapstick like comedy. Further more there is some good action with lot's of machine guns and spectacular crashing cars.A bit outdated here and there but especially for the fan of gangster movies this is a must see. You'll notice how much this movie influenced later gangster movies. Also perfectly watchable and recommendable if you're a fan of the 1983 remake with Al Pacino.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't that what Muni, as Tony Camonte, says the lawyers got him and Guino sprung on, a writ of Hocus Pocus? Muni looks like an giant ape as he walks the streets, his neck barely showing and his head swiveling slowly. How could such a beast have such a pretty sister? These are the original wise-guys, flipping the coins and being sure they have it all figured out. What a great film! One can almost feel Hawks thinking that every so often he'd better throw in a few shots of the law and order crowd to pacify the censors, but I believe this was made before the Production Code. These little bits are almost embarrassing, like having an anti-drug message pop up in the 1983 one star remake. Note too the lit sign outside the window of Camonte's last stand. It reminds me of Cody Jarrett's oil tank every time I see it. I wanted to see Muni climb it and be gunned down from there.I saw another Muni film the other night in which he is a gangster killed prematurely and sent back to earth to set it right. Made after WWII, but featuring the same Camonte accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to watching this movie I had very high expectations for it and assumed that I would love it because of its obvious reputation of fueling the big gangster film era of the 1930s and because, after watching "I am a Refugee from a Chain Gang", I find Paul Muni to be a fantastic actor of his time. However, after the movie, I felt disappointed by the film and no matter how hard I tried I could not find it to be exceptionally extraordinary or thought provoking. I can't say that I did not appreciated all of the cinematography and the fantastic acting of the lead roles (especially Karen Morley, I thought that she was completely brilliant in this film and I probably enjoyed the scenes that she was in the most), but I felt like there was something vital missing in the film that I cant quite put my finger on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original "Scarface"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I wasn't aware of there being an original Scarface from 1932 when I first saw the 1983 remake starring Pacino. Only later after I saw the special edition DVD of the 1983 film, I realized that it is, in fact, a remake! Al Pacino is interviewed in one of the features and he mentions about Paul Muni's performance. Some footage from the original is also shown.I've been wanting to see this original 'Scarface' ever since. It was a strange but satisfying experience seeing Paul Muni do way back then in 1932, what Pacino did in the 1983 remake! The story, loosely based on the life of real-life gangster Al Capone, is pretty much the same for all those who are familiar with the remake. Some of the key scenes, characters and even some lines of dialog in the remake are a direct lift from this film! Only the setting has been changed of course. The business is booze, not drugs. The central character is not a Cuban refugee, but an Italian gangster! The time is the 30s, not 80s..and so on! Paul Muni stars as Antonio 'Tony' Camonte who starts under Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) who has taken over the South Side to carry on with his illegal booze trade, after he gets rid of the leading South Side mob boss, Costillo. But little does he know that Tony is a power-hungry, ambitious young mobster who will stop at nothing for a quick rise right up to the top. He is a man who won't take orders from a boss for very long and wants to do something of his own. So then it begins. Tony sets out on a murderous rampage and spreads his wings like wildfire across all the parts of the city, killing anyone who comes in the way. He even refuses to follow the orders of Johnny Lovo at a point of time. All the while by his side he has his loyal buddy Guino Ronaldo (George Raft) and a bumbling Angelo (Vince Barnett) as his secretary.The fast-paced machine-gun mayhem in this film almost never lets up in the crisp 90 minutes running time of the film.Parallely, there are the story angles of Tony's overprotective and seemingly incestuous demeanor towards his sister Francesca (Ann Dvorak), and that of his own pursuit of Johnny Lovo's girlfriend, Poppy (Karen Morley).Great acting skills displayed by most of the cast apart from Paul Muni, of course, who is wildly over-the-top, almost to the extent of hilarity, but in a positive sense! He is an absolute pleasure to watch as he hogs the screen. He has clearly had a lot of fun portraying this character, just as Pacino did in the remake.Penned by Ben Hecht and superbly directed by Howard Hawks,"Scarface" is a landmark in the gangster film genre.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime Doesn't Pay - forget the obvious lesson, enjoy the work of a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film where you really have to talk about the beginning, at the beginning, as it sets the stage both formally and narratively in many ways. A street sign - a striking, brief pan past an obviously artificial, oddly angled and heavily Expressionistic street-alley, and then past a restaurant employee bringing in a sign for the night, into the restaurant and to rest on a group of men talking loudly, the remains of a party around them. The loudest man is Big Louie - he talks in a thick Italian accent about "having enough" and how satisfied he is...but his buddies tell him that, Johnny Lovo, apparently wants more; maybe he'll have to do something about that. We haven't been told that these men are mobsters, but we get the gist; they're fat and happy in the midst of the Depression, drinking the forbidden liquor that they doubtless control - but Johnny and more importantly his top lieutenant Tony Camonte want more, as Big Louie quickly finds out to his chagrin, gunned down as he tries to make a phone call, the sound of whistling as the camera pans from the silhouette of his assassin down to his dead body. One fantastic shot - I'd say one of the most impressive opening shots I've ever seen - lasting about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, giving us a prologue of much that's to come: the casual brutality of the whistling murderer, the lust for the good life, the impossibility of letting anybody else have a part of the pie.Tony is played by Paul Muni in a ferocious yet rather pathetic way - he's tough, ambitious, street-smart, quick on his feet, yet so blinded by his emotions and passions that he dooms all of those around him and cannot stop, cannot ever have enough. Shortly after taking out Big Louie, he sets his sites on the north side gangsters, including Boris Karloff's wonderfully cynical Gaffney, and then it's only his own big boss himself, Johnny Lovo, standing in the way of him taking the town (Chicago, obviously, and in many ways Tony is Al Capone). We get the St. Valentine's day massacre, a half-dozen drive-by machine-gunnings...all the while Tony is becoming a big shot, scaring everybody, romancing Lovo's girl Poppy (Karen Morley), while trying to keep his younger and very anxious sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) away from any man but...himself? The undercurrent of incest is powerful throughout the film; I suppose one could try to come up with a psychological reading as to why Tony's forbidden desires turn him mad and towards a life of crime - there's no father in the picture and his mother though stern is completely ineffective - but I'm not sure it's really there. In any case, his "protection" of his sister is so extreme as to eventually cost him his best friend, Guino (a very charming, low key George Raft), and it's emblematic of the madness that never allows him to stop, seeming to ignore any possibility that he can ever be overthrown.The film seems to alternate visually between the dark expressionism that we're introduced to in that first shot: the crazy action scenes which really are something for a film from that period, machine guns blasting and cars crashing rapid-fire for several minutes at a time, most memorably in the rat-ta-tat that accompanies months of dates in a calendar flying - and a brighter, smoother camera-work for a couple of ballroom scenes. Even in opulent surroundings at last, Tony is never sated. Even if you've never seen the film or it's dubious "remake", it's not hard to guess the fate that's in store for him, and the genius of the film is that though we may not be able to feel much for Tony, who is never anything close to sympathetic, we can at least care a little for those who surround him like moths near the flame. His "secretary", the illiterate Angelo (Vince Barnett) who brings the film down a little with some ill-judged and draggy humor that sounds straight out of the Marx brothers, even manages a touching death - faithful to the last.This struck me as in some ways atypical of director Howard Hawks - at least, it differs from his later work in that the male relationships are nearly all antagonistic rather than comradely; this is a film revolving really around one man who is always alone in his obsessive need to rule and dominate, a man who never has equals in his mind, and at the end has no one but the sister whose life he ruined, and then...the only fate a gangster could have in a film that tries to be both sensationalistic (succeeding well) and moralizing (not really). The DVD offers the alternate ending as well, so you can see Tony both shot to death and hanged. Did you learn your lesson? With the caveats of the obvious and unnecessary "message" being pushed on the audience (really only overt at the very beginning and ending) and those lame bits of vaudevillian humor, this is pretty damn impressive and probably my favorite of the early 30s gangster cycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface (1932) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, controversial discussions are really starting to crop up at this time, and this one may be another. I finally obtained the single DVD of this Howard Hawks film, and to tell you the truth, though I liked it, I think I enjoy the DePalma 1983 re-do with Al Pacino a bit more. Some thoughts...I have often lashed out against the idea of remakes, and finally I think I've come across the perfect single film example of why right here with SCARFACE (1932). Because there's always the possibility that a newer version can "replace" the old and become more popular, perhaps even more definitive. For me, I saw Pacino's SCARFACE in the theater in 1983 when I was 21, and I really had a great time with it. To me, this was "Scarface". But I also love old movies, and especially the 1930s ( I bought Warner's Gangster DVD Collection, and I loved every film in the set) ... so I was excited about seeing this Paul Muni classic at long last - and all the while I found it necessary to keep in mind what period the movie was made, and how powerful and important it was for its day. I had to review it within its proper perspective.As a 40-something today it's very rare, if ever, that I am able to step inside the shoes in the sense of how a young kid might feel today when watching "old black and white movies", and yet that's exactly how I felt a lot of the time while watching the 1932 film! It was definitely exciting, full of over the top action and gunplay, and I'd imagine quite a shock for its day! But at the same time, I couldn't help remembering how I felt in the theater 25 years ago thrilling to DePalma's "epic". It seemed like the 1983 version really enhanced and yup, even improved on certain aspects of this now somewhat "dated" (and I hate that term) 1932 classic.Some of the acting here was really way-out theatrical style. I often had to struggle to try and understand what Paul Muni was saying, and sometimes the really fast-talking old gangster dialogue, "see", kind of eluded me. Much as I love Boris Karloff, he's just not very convincing to me as a gangster this time, and I think here was another example where it looks to me like he's "acting", and it doesn't come off as natural. I thought all the scenes with Tony's "young" (she sure as hell didn't seem so young!) sister were pretty poor, and I think they were bested in the '83 film (although some of them at the end of the Pacino film bordered on absurdity too!).When Muni angrily "offs" his friend, I didn't get anywhere near the emotional jolt I felt in the '83 movie; it just didn't seem to me that their friendship had been played up long enough or deeply enough to feel the anguish of the lead character. Which brings me to the feeling that, in general, most of the characterizations in the DePalma movie were more realized, better drawn.Now, I am a believer in trying to judge a movie as its own entity... but now and then there is no denying that this type of situation arises where a remake, a sequel, or whatever else you'd care to use as an example, comes along and "spoils" the full intended impact of an original earlier classic, depending on when you've seen it. It's a rarity for me, I've found; this is not something which happens to me with any degree of regularity. It happened with the 1978 version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (I caught the '78 remake first, and then the '56 original seemed trite by comparison). Other than this, I can't recall a single other example... I recall liking the 1991 CAPE FEAR, but when I saw the 1962 original it was still strong (owing greatly to Robert Mitchum).One last thing for now -- I haven't seen the Pacino SCARFACE in several years now, but the last time I did it didn't even hold up as well as I'd remembered either ... I thought it had become kind of like a parody or satire, in a way. Sometimes my rating on movies may change, and I think the last time I saw the 1983 version I gave it three stars, too - just like I am giving the Paul Muni movie (I'd have to revisit the DePalma film to be certain). Be that as it may, two movies can get the same amount of stars but yet one can still be "preferred" over the other. It's not that I didn't enjoy this Howard Hawks film; it's just that I couldn't help thinking I would have loved it much more had I never seen the 1983 one. I know this isn't really fair, in a way, but our reviews are at least partly a reflection of ourselves and our past experiences and influences. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawk's gangster movie has become something of a legend and deservedly so. It's dated and it's often crudely made and some of the supporting performances are pretty terrible but it has an energy, a real feeling for the period and a great central performance from Paul Muni and Hawks handles the set-pieces superbly, (the climax, in which Muni kills his kid sister's husband and is overcome by remorse as the police close in, is a tremendous sequence). The film is an explicit indictment of mob rule, much more so than Brian De Palma's remake, and as such it was a brave movie for it's time, (it was originally sub-titled 'the shame of a nation' and Tony was obviously modeled on Al Capone). However, the high moral tone it sometimes adopts is the weakest thing about it. It's at it's best in the scenes of prolonged violence and in Muni's extraordinary almost simian performance. It's also remarkably explicit in its treatment of Muni's close to incestuous feelings for his sister. This was pre-Hays code and it didn't mince words. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scarface,' produced by Howard Hughes and Howards Hawks, and directed by the latter, was completed in 1930, but was deemed too controversial by the censers, who declared that the film glorified the gangster life and portrayed too much violence. It was demanded that several scenes must be edited, an alternate ending added and the subtitle 'The Shame of the Nation' tacked onto the end of the title. However, Hawks disowned this new version of his film, and it was created without him. Fortunately, the version that most people see nowadays is Hawks' original vision, complete with excessive violence (for its time) and the bitter, bloody downfall of Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) at the hands of police.The film, without a doubt, was an attempt to make a political statement. It opens with title cards declaring, "This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and our liberty. Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government: 'What are you going to do about it?' The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it?""This is followed by a scene in the middle of the film, in which the newspaper publisher proclaims ? somewhat uncharacteristically- that the blame for these gang wars should not be placed on the police, but firmly upon the government, and the civilians who do not speak out against them. After all this is out of the way, however, we are allowed back into the fantastic story of Tony Camonte's rise and downfall, and we can forgive the filmmakers' now-dated political motives.Tony Camonte, played perfectly by Paul Muni, is a smug, insatiably-violent gangster who is dismissive of authority, both in the police force and in his own criminal organization. He operates under the orders of Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), whom he neither respects nor really listens to, and his loyal friend and bodyguard is Guino Rinaldo (George Raft), whom Camonte knows would never betray him. Feared by his own mother for years, Camonte is also fiercely protective of his eighteen-year-old sister, Francesca (Ann Dvorak). Despite her insistence that she is now old enough to take care of herself, Camonte reacts violently whenever he spies a man giving his sister the least bit of attention, and he offers Francesca money so she can enjoy herself through other means. Camonte's influence, however, inevitably turns Francesca into what he most feared: himself.At the end of the film, as power, greed and arrogance have torn Camonte's world apart, he stumbles weakly down the staircase to his home, and a bullet hurls the weapon from his grasp. A pathetic mess, the once-powerful Tony Camonte begs for mercy from the police, fruitlessly trying to justify his actions. The police offer him an opportunity to surrender, but Camonte makes a final break for freedom, and police weapons blaze him down like a piece of vermin. Peppered with bullet wounds, Camonte's deceased body hits the hard ground, the camera slowly rising to reveal the sign near which he died, ironically reading: "The World Is Yours."</fullReview>

In this case, it most definitely is better. I was not very familiar with George Raft or Paul Muni, but their talents are very much on display in this classic.

		<fullReview>Given the era and budget this film had it could be classed as far superior to the 83 Scarface. I for one believe they are both on a par with each other. Paul Muni's portrayal of an up and coming gangster is by far his best performance ever closely followed by I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang. This Scarface set out the plot for the 82 Scarface and deals with all the elements the 82 one does. The overprotective sister, the silent (or not so silent in the 82 version) partner, the double crossing boss, and the inevitable downfall.Muni's Tony Camonte is as funny as Pacino's, with lines that should not be funny but are such as "This guy got ideas I don't like", very reminiscent of a cocky James Cagney.The style of film is a wonderful example of film noir and showcases a directorial talent with adventurous camera positioning and subtle touches such as the X's in every death scene and using things such as shadows and bowling pins to symbolise death.The story is fun and this is a film even the teenagers of today could not deny liking.Wonderful. Absolutely enjoyable, and always brings a smile to my face.</fullReview>

Not taking anything away from Tony Montana, everyone should watch the original film that is the obvious foundation for every other gangsta film that has followed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, wait, that's the remake, that craptastic 1980s film by Brian de Palma. I'm here to talk about the original, which was directed by the great Howard Hawks in 1932. And, man, is it great. Hawks' direction is amazing, with a lot of great style. I'd bet that this film boasts the highest body count in any movie before the 1980s, for God's sake! Almost everything about it is perfect. The only thing I could do without are all the lame jokes about the secretary who speaks English poorly and is illiterate. Those scenes are somewhat embarrassing and a blemish on the film. However, Scarface survives and more than surpasses those three or four scenes. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilerIt's a format we've seen in gangster films a zillion times. Street hood climbs the criminal corporate ladder. It seems fun at first. Lots of wild action, being able to act tough, plenty of dames. But then, it gets ugly. SCARFACE was one the first films to use this format. It leaves contemporary gangster classics (LITTLE CAESER and PUBLIC ENEMY) in the dust! We are riveted to the screen by Paul Muni's wacked title role performance. Usually in a Howard Hawks film, the characters are likeable, people we want to be around, but not Muni's Tony Camonte. That's what makes SCARFACE so amazingly fascinating! We can safely observe Camonte's violent and ugly world without participating! The centerpiece of the film is the gang war that explodes over control of a cities booze racket. To signify a hit is to take place, or is in the process of taking place, an X is prominently in the scene. It's either a crossbeam, the Roman Numeral "Ten" on a door, looking down at an intersection street sign. The most brillaint use of this is on a bowling scorecard. We see Boris Karloff get his during a bowling game. He is the final target amongst Camonte's rivals. The camera leaves him as bullets tear into him. He is about to bowl a strike. The camera follows the ball as it hits the pins, except for one, that takes forever to spin and topple. This is what film is all about- the visual presentation.Easily one of the ten best pre-World War II films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface is one of the first great mob movies. Paul Muni plays Tony Camonte in a performance that never feels dated or boring; it bursts with sick energy. He makes these strange gestures, which he probably learned on the stage, to entice the other characters to play along with him; like he'll start making popping sounds, as he plucks his hand off his temple. He also shifts his emotions very abruptly, and you cannot really predict when he'll lose his temper, or when he'll act charming and witty. There is a scene when he directly implies to Poppy (Karen Morley) that he wants to have sex, and you can really see his great comic timing. His performance is ten times better than any other Cagney-mobster performance; so why am I the only one that knows it. Howard Hawkes directs with great vision and excellence. He made this into a very violent film for its time, but he also made some great visuals on the screen. Such as his use of the "X" every time someone is about to die or after they die. And who could forget that scene where the machine gun blasts the dates away on the calender. I think he was still learning how to make a movie, because some of the scenes just don't seem like they should be in this one. It never grows to the stature of "The Godfather," or "Goodfellas," but I think it's right behind them. And those films probably would have never been made if it wasn't for "Scarface."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Unoubtaly the best of the depression era gangster movies that came out of Hollywood in the 1930's "Scarface" was so chilling and effective that it had it's director Howard Hawks, who owed the film,lock up all the prints and take the movie out of circulation back in 1932 the year it was released. It wasn't until two years after Hawks death in December 1977 that "Scarface" was ever seen by the public again. Spinning off a remake in 1983 staring Al Pacino the original that's well over 70 years old still eclipses the later, made in color and with far more graphic sex and violence, by a country mile.Vicious and brazen Tony Camonte, Paul Muni, has big plans for himself in getting to the top of the heap in the criminal underworld in 1920's Chicago. Being "Big Louie" Costello's (Harry J. Vejar), the mob boss of Chicago's first district, bodyguard Tony blows him away after the party thrown for him is over and everyone left. Getting on board with the South Side's top mobster and bootlegger Johnny Lovo, Osgood Perkins, Tony's brutal and uncompromising strong-arming of the local illegal bars and speakeasy's have Lovo gain complete control of the South Side of Chicago's lucrative booze business. But Tony has bigger plans not for his boss Johnny Lovo but for himself. Having the Irish boss O'Hara of the powerful North Side Mob knocked off, against Johnny Lovo's, orders turns Chicago into a full-fledged war zone. With hundreds of automatic sub-machine guns imported into the city from out of state and used in dozens of deadly shoot-outs. This results in scores of innocent persons, as well as mobsters, getting killed and wounded. Tony's unrelenting ruthlessness has the North Side Mob on the run and just about finishes them off in a bloody wear-house massacre, on Valentine Day, with seven members of the gang machine gunned to death. Gaffney, Boris Karloff, O'Hara's North Side Mob replacement is now a marked man with him just escaping Tony's Valentine Day killing. With his gang now no longer a factor in the crime scene in Chicago has Gaffney just waiting for the inevitable to happen. The end comes in a bowling alley where it turns out Gaffney plays his last game of ten pins. It's when Tony finally reaches the top that he loses his edge in keeping his crime organization together and where his paranoia takes over. Feeling that his boss, what a laugh, Johnny Lovo is trying to knock him off after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on him Tony pay's Johnny a visit with his trusted friend and fellow hoodlum Gino "Flip" Rinaldo, George Raft,and blows him away. Meanwhile the local police working together with the Federal Government gather all the information that they could to get enough evidence to put Tony away for a long time. Ironically it's Tony himself that gives them all the rope that they need to hang him.Finding out that his chorusing 18 year-old sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak), whom he tried to keep to himself and away from any suitors, moved out of her parents house Tony finds where she lives in the city and pays Cesca a surprise visit. Seeing his life-long friend Gino answer the door and Cesca in a nightgown flips Tony out and before he can think blasts Gino away. It turned out that both Gino and Cesca were married while Tony was away in Florida and wanted to surprise him with the "good" new! But the shoot first and ask questions later Tony Camonte didn't bother to wait around to hear it. Broken and abandoned Tony is now left all alone at his reinforced bunker-like apartment with no one but Cesca by his side as he waits for the police to assault and storm it. The only hope he has now is to go down fighting and not be taken alive. They don't make them, gangster films, any better then "Scarface" and it's amazing to watch the movie now and see how ahead of it's time it really was. In fact it's time, and modern day gangster/crime films, still hasn't caught up with it. P.S Unlike in action/gangster movies made today the shooting scenes in "Scarface" had real bullets used in it's the films action sequences! Hollywood studios didn't have gunfire special effects back then in 1932 like they do now and had to use,live bullets, whatever was available to them. It's said that actor Paul Muni was so shocked by the negative reaction he got from the pubic, in his role as gangster Tony Camonte in the movie, that for almost 15 years he refused to take another gangster role. Even though Muni-in a way- finally gave in and played one in the life-after-death comedy/drama "Angel on my Shoulder" in 1946.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardcore film noir. Ain't nothing like the real thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface (1932) was a gangster/film noir picture loosely based upon real life gangster Al Capone. The movie takes place during the height ofprohibition, instead of drugs, the biggest money maker back in the day was Beer and hard alcohol. Yes, people were killing each other over bootlegkegs of beer. Paul Muni plays the lead, an up and coming street thug who'lldo anything to get to the top. Shot on a low budget and a tight filmingschedule, the film became a classic none the less.Tony is a hardcore gangster, rubbing out people in their hospital beds,inside of pay phones or a simple drive by, innocents and intended targets(drive by's did not just begin in the 80's people). Along with his right hand man (George Raft), the two quickly ascend to the top of the local crimeworld. But as with all gangsters the fast rising ones always fall the hardest. Filled with ultraviolence and old school tough guy dialogue, Scarface is oneof the best of the genre.Highly recommended.A+P.S.Fifty years later, hollywood decided to remake this gangster classic. Scarface Redux became a hit and a part of american pop culture. Everyone from Big Audio Dynamite to The Geto Boys have used, referenced orsampled parts of the remake in their songs.</fullReview>

This film has attitude and a strong, real arm, with just enough melodrama to justify the extreme violence (this movie is more violent than any other pre-60s gangster movie I've seen). Muni's performance is startlingly like a Chaney performance, even down to his physicaly overbearing mannerisms and flashing white eyeballs. Raft is also excellent as the strongarm henchman, a role he would mostly replay for the rest of his life in movies and TV. Hawks acquits himself well with some obviously well thought out structure.</fullReview>

Paul Muni plays s Tony a gangster who although is working under someone else is determined to rise to the top and control where people are buying their booze from. The rise to the top is a long violent road and Tony doesn't reach his goal without some blood shed along the way, even from some of the people closest to him. Overall Paul Muni plays an excellent gangster and somehow manages to persuade the audience into cheering for him on his rise to the top.</fullReview>

This film is pre-code so there is no limit on the violence that can ensue, and it does not disappoint. Paul Muni is an excellent actor, he makes the film. His role of the conflicted anti-hero is very likable and leads to a good connection between him and the audience. He is a ruthless killer but he also has a sensitive side, especially with his sister. This movie is very tight. The editing feels smooth a seamless, and the cinematography is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon started this film I was greeted by a message I really just had no memory of from my first viewing. A very striking message that gives all the violence and brutality in this film (especially for the 30s) a powerful impact. This message declares "This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and our liberty. Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government: 'What are you going to do about it?' The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it?" This gives the film a significant historical context. The people of this era lived with the horrific violence portrayed in the film. It wasn't just a film for the viewers of the time. These were the actions that made this era's gangsters thrive. I've always known Scarface was based on the crimes committed by Al Capone, but being given a reminder in the film's opening credits makes its portrayal chilling. The destruction and collateral damage Tony was able to wreak upon Chicago with his Thompson? The children that ended up getting "bellies full of lead"? All included in the film to illuminate a truth. This made the film very hard to stomach, but the passion it gave to its writers, directors, and outstanding lead Paul Muni just make it all the more excellent. If you love gangster movies or American history like I do, this is an absolute must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Gangster Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before Brian De Palma directed his '83 masterpiece, there was an original Tony looking to grab the American dream, whatever the cost. Made in 1932, this version of "Scarface" made quite a stir in its day, due to its boldness and refusal to sugarcoat the brutal reality of the gang warfare of the times. Like its '83 counterpart, the movie follows the rise and fall of a hood named Tony. Instead of the seedy, decadent Miami of the 80's, though, this Tony's era is 1920's Chicago, where prohibition is in full swing and the streets are ever flowing with blood. It's in this setting that we first meet Antonio "Tony" Camonte (Paul Muni in a tour de force performance) aka Scarface. Tough, ambitious, ruthless, and slightly crazed (Especially when it comes to the love for his sister), Tony is determined to reach the top of the Chicago underworld by murdering his boss, "Big" Louis Costillo and subsequently going behind the back of his new one, Johnny Lovo, for the sake of greater profits and to have Johnny's girl for himself. Soon though, Tony's actions spark a gang war with the North Side gang and from there it's nothing short of a barrage of shootings, bombings, and murders. Eventually, Tony has everything he could possibly want and more. But just like Al Pacino, his madness and lust threaten to bring everything he's built down the drain.Filmed in eerie black and white, the film still holds up well after all these years. Part of this would be due to the brilliant direction of Howard Hawks, who takes a simple gangster picture and manages to make it into something more with his creative camera shots and ominous cues when someone is about to die (watch for the Xs and don't be near Tony when he's whistling!). Another is its boldness in not cutting away when someone gets shot up. While the violence in this film is no where near as graphic as that you see today (its '83 counterpart included) it was very controversial for the time and I would argue still goes a long way in showing how wild and violent the days of prohibition really were. And of course, what good would a gangster film be if you didn't have the right actor for the job and on that note, Paul Muni delivers. With his zeal and energy, Muni dives right into the part of Tony, becoming him even, and forever ingraining in our minds one of the most ruthless gangsters in cinema ever. It also helps that writer Ben Hecht was able to draw on his experiences of a Chicago reporter during the 1920's and as such, some of the events and characters in the film will appear very familiar to those who know their Chicago gang history (The big fellow himself, Al Capone, was said to love this film so much he had his own print of it, probably because he saw a lot of himself in Tony!). But above all, the film still packs a punch due to the fact that despite the number of years since this picture was made, there are still plenty of would be Tonys out there looking to get their hands on the American dream, regardless of the cost. So with all that said, find a comfortable chair, close the shades, and check out this American classic. Just be careful of the Tommy guns though! Also starring George Raft, Ann Dovak, and before he was Frankenstein's monster, Boris Karloff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Get out of my way, Johnny. I'm gonna spit!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic film about the rise and fall of Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), a violent gangster with an unhealthy relationship with his younger sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak). Tony shoots his way to the top of the underworld but when he discovers his best friend (George Raft) is having a relationship with Cesca, he loses control and everything begins to unravel.One of the trio of gangster classics, along with Little Caesar and Public Enemy, that defined the genre. This is the only one of the three that wasn't made by Warner Bros. It cries out for a music score at times, as early talkies often do. But Howard Hawks' excellent direction, a first-rate script by Ben Hecht, and some dynamic acting keeps you from ever getting bored. Great turns from Paul Muni and Ann Dvorak. First big role for George Raft, who does a fine job. Boris Karloff has a fun part as a rival gangster. Vince Barnett provides the movie's only laughs as Tony's secretary who has a humorous way of taking messages. A wonderful, exciting film that's a must-see for fans of gangster movies. Hard to compare to the popular 1983 remake, given the decades separating the two. I would recommend them both, though.</fullReview>

The Movie is Rapidly Violent with some Artistic Touches of Expressionistic Mayhem. The Machine Gun Calendar, the Crashing Car Chases, the St. Valentines Garage, the Bowling Alley and More.A Good Supporting Cast all are in the Shadow of Muni's Shenanigans and the Ben Hecht Script has some Fun with the Colorful Players. Some of it may seem Dated now, but Not Much and the Movie has an Edge about it from the Beginning and Never Seems to Compromise One Bit.An Entertaining, Visceral, and Great Action Movie with Characters that Spit, and have a Feel of Surreal, Sadistic, Glee. It is a Non-Stop Ride of a Gangster Movie when the Genre was being Born and this Bad Seed is still Spawning Evil Cousins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's just due to the fact that I'm not the biggest fan on gangster movies, but I didn't enjoy this film as much as I hoped I would. My favorite performance of the film was Ann Dvorak. She gave an incredible performance as Tony's sister. He was always trying to tell her what to do and telling her how to live and throughout the film, she was always going against his word, until the end when she was helping Tony load machinery and she gets hit by a polices bullet. Even there, her acting is so believable and I just really liked her character. Muni also gives a great performance. Also, the man (a bodyguard of Tony's) in the bar, who is on the phone when it is getting shot up, who keeps repeating "You're going to have to speak louder, I can't hear you" was hilarious. I found his part in the film to be appropriate offering some sort of comic relief. However, there were so many things going on throughout the film that it confused me. The scenes would change and then Tony would be talking to someone who I couldn't remember the significance of. I also had a bit of trouble following along with which gang was doing the shooting each time there would be a drive by. Many of the characters became a big blur to me. Also, some of the dialogue got muffled under sounds or was so fast and muttered that I would have rewind it and listen again. I did like the use of shadows throughout the film. Whenever they were present, it made it really interesting to see how they were going to use them. I thought it was effective in almost keeping these people that were killed semi-anonymous and it also made the creeping around shots really neat to watch. All in all, it was a decent film. The ending ties everything together really effectively and that was probably my favorite part of the film. It was a solid ending.</fullReview>

It's all about greed and power. It's seems so predictable. There wasn't much of a soundtrack besides the intro. With out the soundtrack the movie moved very slowly. It lacked the emotional highs and lows that music usually brings to a film. The best part of the film was the last 12 minutes. When Toni takes out his sisters husband. In the background there's a nice big shadow of an X telling us things are going to be pretty bad Toni from here on out. Toni wanted to and own it all "The world is yours". At one point he probably did have it all but went to far and lost it all. His kind are never satisfied!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface definitely kept the audience awake whether you wanted to pay attention or not; there were so many loud noises it was hard not to watch. In my opinion the story itself was not that impressive because it was clouded with violence and gun shots, and was not supported with much background information or detail. I believe the director was to eager when it came to the violence and gun shots; it was something new in the film business and he got caught up in this new fad and forgot to illustrate a story line to follow all the noise and commotion. On top of a poor story I don't think the acting was all the great either. The actors all seemed to have one emotion and when they attempted to portray another it appeared to be forced and out of place. The sister was the worst of them all in my opinion; she was too loud, over dramatic, and unconvincing. Most of the mobsters over played their role and tried too hard to be someone that they weren't. That might have been the under lying problem for the acting; none of these men knew how to be mobsters because there wasn't much background information on how to act like a real "mobster" so they tried their best, but in the end majority of them were unable to pull off a convincing role. In conclusion the movie lacked two key aspects in order to be considered anything close to remarkable; this could be a main reason why the movie was remade in the 1980s. With more focus put into the story and an improved acting crew the remake was indeed a success. Howard Hawks had the right idea, just not the right techniques in order to pull off an unforgettable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that, for its time, this movie was probably very popular because it emulated what was really going on it big cities, especially Chicago. It was during the prohibition era and it probably was very accurate as to some of the activities that were going on.The one thing that I did enjoy very much was how contrasty the film was. It helped give it a sort of dangerous feel when needed(which also helps being in black and white). Its clear that Tony (main character) and his gang are all about killing to get to where they want and to gain more power in their trade. There are a lot of violent gun fights and shot outs in the film, which just show you how ruthless a lot of the gangs back then were.All in all, I feel that it was a pretty good film and I would recommend you watch it, as well as the remake of it with Al Pacino, to get the different feel of what gangs were like in different eras.</fullReview>

It was very hard to here what the actors were saying at times because of how fast they were talking and the overall quality of sound.

I am not saying that it was done badly, just blandly. The story is interesting, but I grew tired of it. I am not sure if it was because it was truly tiresome or just because I am comparing it to the Al Pacino remake. (Which wasn't that spectacular either.) I had a few problems with the sound, but that may just be a problem with the particular copy I got at the library, so I won't judge it too harshly. The editing is another story. It too quickly cuts off people talking and then immediately rushes into someone else talking in the next scene. It was a huge pacing issue.As with many films of the era, it was beautifully lit.

It was unheard of at this time for a movie to be so vulgar. Scarface in a way changed film entertainment forever by being the first to do something revolutionary. Tony's "do the dirty work myself" attitude earned him respect in the crime world, similar to the way it was for Al Capone. This director has a reputaion for being able to tell a great story, and this movie is example number 1.

There is plenty of foreshadowing throughout the film, such as when a man is shot down in front of "Undertaker" Street or when the row of men are gunned down under a bunch of "X's". This film has a lot of style and flair. The characters have become the models for every gangster movie since. Paul Muni's Scarface has the same, almost weird accent that Pacino's Scarface carries. Also, Muni's Scarface sounds just like the character in the fictitious mob movie featured in Home Alone.There are so many pieces of this movie that are reflected in today's films. For this reason alone, this film is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Scarface is the original gangster film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni is brilliant as Tony Camonte, a ruthless unforgiving gangster with little care for the people around him. Muni did a great job of playing a gangster and really seemed to fall in love with his role. The Cigarette smoking and the nice suits and nice cars are a accurate depiction of what the Gang era was in America. A very key part of the movie was a scene when Tony gets his hand on a Tommy Gun for the first time. The Tommy Gun represented Violence and a new power in the North side of town. The Tommy Gun would mark a new time for the gangster's and a more dangerous one at that. Muni's laughter after this moment depicts how sick and deranged the golden age of gangs were and how fun they actually had causing trouble for everyone around them. Also,Like in I am a fugitive of a chain gang(in which Paul Muni also stars) they made sure to show the gangsters or fugitives in the films would face a bad ending just as in real life,if you ever were involved in gangs or crimes that were bad for society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the original gangster films, "Scarface" is a truly thrilling, gritty tale. It is amazing how compelling Tony is. He is the quintessential awful human being. He is violent, perverted, and animalistic. He is everything you hate about humanity but everything you love about this movie. His incestuous love for his sister further adds to this perplexing character.Maybe we all love this movie because it is a glimpse into a world that we will never personally know. Watching this movie is like living our fantasy through Tony. We cannot help but look away into his dangerous world of the bootleg beer trade. We even begin to respect Tony's ambition to succeed and stay on top, disregarding his awful ways of going about this. Tony is a multidimensional human-being. We get a glimpse into his personal life and his 'business' life. He is extremely flawed but we don't seem to care much.The director plays a big role in making 'Scarface' the timeless success that it is. The lighting is one of the more notable features. The whole movie is dark and shadowy, adding to the whole forbidden nature of this world of crime. In this fast-paced movie, dull moments are a rarity. The realistic car chases and the never ending bloodbath, keep you transfixed. You pick your favorite scene and are surprised when the next scene tops the previous one. Close-up shots of Tony let the audience know that he is always up to something?most of the time on the verge of violence. 'Scarface' makes good use of symbolism. 'X' marks the spot of death, so to say. All in all, this movie proves to be the classic that it is. This never ending display of sex, violence, and wicked human beings is so bad that it is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni wants to take you for a ride. You better get in.Muni is Tony Camonte, a scarfaced goon from the tough Five Points section of New York who comes to Chicago with his coin-flipping comrade Guino (George Raft) for torpedo work with a top crime boss. Next thing you know, he's making eyes for the boss's moll Poppy (Karen Morley) and the North Side racket run by a rival gang. Everything's roses for Tony, at least until his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak) finds herself a guy...I think you could have a long bull session with '30s film fans talking up which of the "Big Three" early gangster films was the best. "Scarface" came out later than the other two films, "Little Caesar" and "Public Enemy", but was made at the same time. What held it up was the fact it hit much closer to the bone, using the real story of Al "Scarface" Capone" to underscore its plot and pushing sex and violence onto the screen in a way big studios would avoid for decades.The most important argument in "Scarface's" favor is Muni. That despite the fact the stars of the other two films are far better known and had more interesting careers. Muni's performance is riveting, a mixture of tough-guy bravado, merry quips, and bat-guano crazy. His first scene sets the tone, when he sizes up a scowling lawman who has come to take him in - then lights his match on the cop's badge.The neon sign across the street from Tony's apartment drives him on. "The World Is Yours" it reads. "Someday I look at that sign and I say: 'Okay, she's mine.'" Camonte's smugness as he says this sells it; we're right there with Poppy loving and hating him at the same time.The film bends over backwards to present a social message that I think is genuinely meant but rather ham-handedly delivered, especially in one scene by a newspaper editor who looks as if he had a few before shooting. The comedy relief is weaker than it should be; too much of Tony's flunky Angelo (Vince Barnett) having trouble answering a telephone because of his poor English.But the film doesn't leave you a lot of time to dwell on its flaws. With Howard Hawks at his best as an action-film director, "Scarface" zips from setpiece to setpiece. One moment Tony's at a dance slugging a guy for dancing too close to his sister. Then he's in an armor-plated sedan chased by tommy-gunners in a roadster. Then he's confronting his boss about a set-up. Ninety-three minutes fly by, but never feel rushed. Writer Ben Hecht knew the gangster world, and fills in the lulls with dialogue that still sounds fresh and real."Costillo slowed down too much, yeah. And now he come to a dead stop."About that sister... I'm not sure it's exactly incestuous feelings that drives Tony as much as his possessiveness. He's too buggy a guy to let others do what they want, because all he knows is what he wants. It's a fatal flaw, and plays out in a finale that perversely celebrates the bond between Tony and Cesca. "You're me, and I'm you," she says. "It's always been that way."Given how gangster films come and go, it's perhaps not strange how the earliest ones are among the most enduring. "Scarface" stands comfortably on its pedestal 80 years on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does Art Imitate Life or does Life Imitate Art? That is a clich-ongoing-thought provoking question that this film actually made me ask. Out of any of the films we watched in class so far, Scarface- The Shame of a Nation strikes me as the most gloriously violent. Although Sunrise had very violent elements such as marital murder, Scarface represented murder as a means to rise to the top. And I thought only 50 Cent was on that tip. Anyway, the film was fantastic. I cannot comment superbly on the cinematic techniques, aside from the use of lighting to highlight specific moments, however the theme's and plot line of the movie are timeless-and the get rich or die trying mentality of Tony is slowly becoming the mentality of a hip-hop generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the portrayal of police intervention in gang activity in New York. I related personally to this film because my grandfather was a first grade detective in New York City and would tell me stories of murder and investigation, involving his work on the Gotti case and his play in the downfall of Son of Sam. This movie gave a personal relationship with the "bad guys", and even though the main character Tony was a cold-blooded murderer who caused inter-gang and family conflict, I found myself reacting fondly towards him; he had a sense of humanity. The scene where he kills his boss is very powerful. He punches the glass with the name printed on it out of the door, letting him know there will soon be someone to take his place. Tony then whistles as he walks away, something he did in the very beginning of the movie, before gunshots are heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing I'm a Fugitive From a Chain gain, I was ready for some more of Paul Muni. He is a wonderful actor, though I have only seen two of his films, he has already left an impression on me. The evil behind the character he is portraying comes out in full force.I have been a huge Brian De Palma fan for many years, and I truly love his version of the 1932 film. I had never seen the original until a few weeks ago and it was tough for me to watch it with an open mind. Being so familiar with the 1983 version I already had a vision of the story that I was comfortable with. But the nice thing about this is that I could enjoy the older version as if I was watching a remake of the newer version, it sounds silly but this is how I watched it.It is also interesting watching these pre-code era films. With the censors not yet in full action, the grittiness of the story can come to life more than if it was made lets say 10 years later. I am somewhat looking forward to seeing the new Michael Mann film Public Enemies only because it deals with the same era of crime and gangsters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most classic mob movies I have seen yet!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This with out a doubt is my favorite Howard Hawk films that I have ever seen. Being a HUGE fan of the 1983 Scarface, I thought this was just as amazing. There was such great imaging throughout the whole film. In the beginning when you could see the shadow of the man, but not actually see him. Since prohibition was going on throughout the time the movie was made (Prohibition was from 1919-1933) (The movie was made in 1932 towards the end of prohibition) it was great how Tony bullied the different stores and shops into selling his beer to the people and making them buy much much more than they needed. Classic mob movie in every way. My favorite was how any thing Tony wanted, Tony got. The world really was his! I am happy they ended the movie with the scene of Tony getting shot up by the police as opposed to the second ending they were going to put into it. I think if the ending was different it would have changed the whole movie. We wouldn't have thought of Tony as the gangster he really was if the cops had come and taken him to jail. The whole movie was a steady pace from scene to scene, well directed, well though out, well executed, all together this was a major movie. Even though the remake of this movie is just as amazing, I am happy when the remake was done, it was just like the original. Both amazing, I think if you have seen the 83' version, the 32' is a must see! I would watch this movie again any time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with Edward G. Robinson's "Little Caesar" and Jimmy Cagney's "The Public Enemy", "Scarface" helped usher in the big time gangster era in film of the early 1930's. Universal Pictures took a page from the Warner brothers play book with an opening indictment of gang rule and crime in America, slamming the government's seeming indifference and inability to stop it. The picture itself is a fast paced and brutal affair, accentuated by the rapid staccato machine gun fire set to a flourish of riffling calendar dates, a very nice touch. By contrast, Paul Muni's first appearance as mobster Tony Camonte is appropriately low key, emerging from beneath the hot towels of a neighborhood barber shop. I found it a bit unusual actually, that Camonte 'took it' from Detective Guarino (C. Henry Gordon) in that brief encounter; I was waiting the rest of the picture to see if Tony got a measure of personal revenge.There was another scene that caught my eye, primarily in it's presaging a similar situation in 1972's "The Godfather". When Tony and pal Guino Rinaldi (George Raft) come to learn that gang rival Meehan wasn't killed in a mob ambush, they go back to the hospital to finish the job. That was interesting from another perspective as well, highlighting as it does the virtual impossibility of era newspapers to cover events in real time the way they often did in film. By the time Camonte explains to Johnny Lovo that Meehan and Bardini were hit 'an hour ago', it was already a headline!I was curious enough about some of the reviews on this board regarding Tony's relationship with his sister that I went back and watched the picture again immediately the next day. For those insisting on something more going on there, I'm just not buying it. To understand, I think you'd have to have known or been friends with a hot headed Italian like the college roommate I had. If he was any kind of example, one would know that Italian men are fiercely protective of family, defending mother and sisters with equal abandon. Camonte's obsession with protecting Cesca (Ann Dvorak) had all to do with his personal code of defending her honor against all men, since he knew what they were capable of. Besides, he couldn't view Cesca the same way he himself could look at Poppy (Karen Morley), someone he could relate to at some street level kind of way.Some other observations - I couldn't help notice the resemblance between Paul Muni's characterization here with that of Charles Bronson - both had a similar build to go with their mannerisms. It was also cool to see Boris Karloff in a gangster role, even if he didn't last very long in the story.Interestingly, the DVD presentation of "Scarface" I viewed also offered the alternate ending in which Tony was captured instead of being gunned down. Because the scenes were filmed after the movie was already completed, Paul Muni doesn't appear in the scenes where Camonte is found guilty by a jury and is sentenced to death for his crimes. Had that been the official theater release, I think the film might not have survived with the same reputation it has now. There's no replacing the inherent idea that a top shelf movie mobster has to go out in a blaze of glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface: The Shame of the Nation told a tale of the rise in power and it's inevitable down fall. Tony Camonte climbs the ladder to absolute power where he meets a life filled with crime and murder. The violence showed in the film took the gangster crime genre to new level making it significant in the development of all gangster crime movies thereafter. The film made a bold statement about gangster crime and showed how corrupt it really is. At one point in the movie Tony got his hands on an automatic gun and things got completely out of control. It was now easier for him to attack the North side and these new guns caused much more damage on his enemy. The more people Tony killed, the more powerful he became because he turned into a threat. Tony finally reached the top of the power ladder only to have it all end in tragedy. The power corrupted him and essentially resulted in his down fall. That being said, I think the corruption of power is one of the formal issues director Howard Hawks was trying to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hughs' Direction Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface: The Shame of the Nation, directed by Howard Hughs is an excellent film that depicts so well the evolution of film from the silents of the mid-twenties to the sound films of the 30s. It is apparent that Hughs was simply ahead of his time as a director. He creates sequences with very few cuts and a moving camera, something that Hollywood directors weren't doing at the time. Perhaps it had to do with Hughs' OCD disorder, or his strive for constant perfection, but the direction Scarface stands out like no other. The acting in Scarface also stands out, Paul Muni and Ann Dvorak help the film along beautifully. The acting and direction is so well done in this film that it could be a silent one and the message would have come across just as well. One criticism would be the lighting used throughout the movie, it seems that with all the 'fancy' new technology of the day and sound, Hughs forgot about a key element of film making, lighting. In other films like, Sunrise, for example, the director (F.W. Murnau) isn't burdened with the idea of sound, therefore he focused more on lighting, cinematography and film effects. For moments in the film I felt as though Hughs got carried away with the idea of making a blockbuster film with full sound. Otherwise Scarface is a brilliant film, Hughs brings a real world feel into the theater with solid cinematography and long, moving shots. The direction is what makes this film shine as one of the best of the thirties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accent Man Paul Muni Goes Italian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be outdone by Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, that hammiest of hammy 30s actors, Paul Muni, tossed his hat into the gangster ring to play Tony "Scarface" Camonte, polishing off a nice little trilogy of gangster movies from the early 1930s that includes "The Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar." The result lands squarely between the other two films in my affection. "Scarface" doesn't have the ability to knock the wind out of you the way "The Public Enemy" does, but it's better than the somewhat limp "Little Caesar." And say what you will about Paul Muni's overacting, he certainly knows how to hold a screen. He gives a fascinating performance as Tony Camonte, even if he can't hold on to his Italian accent to save his life. Ann Dvorak lands the role of Tony's sister, and it's their strange relationship, one that takes the picture in a surprising direction toward its climax, that lends the film its novelty in the otherwise fairly formulaic gangster genre.Howard Hawks helmed this one, and earned his salary by his creative direction of the opening sequence alone.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by this. It's very entertaining. Paul Muni plays Camonte as a meathead, usually in an animal-like stupor, or with boyish enthusiasm. You have to give credit to a movie that lets a character use the word "effeminate" in 1931 (and in a terrific Hechtian joke). A little moral message pasted on the front end at the insistence of the cultures moral guardians, can't come near the shocks the movie provides.The movie offers a barrage of gunfire every few minutes. Regardless of whether characters are indoors or outdoors, in high society or in their club headquarters. Cars are crashing into public property. It must have been a shocker in 1931. It's still awfully stimulating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film directed by Howard Hawks movie with Richard Rosson, is the film adaptation of the novel "Scarface" (1930) by Armitage Trail (pseudonym of Maurice Coons). It was filmed in the United Artists Studios (Hollywood). Produced by Howard Hughes and Howard Hawks, premiered on 9-IV-1932.The action takes place in Chicago between 1928 and 1930. It tells the story of the rise and fall of mobster "Tony Camonte" (Paul Muni), an Italian immigrant, came to America in 1920 with his parents and younger sister. Becomes part of the criminal gang "Luigi Costillo," which becomes her bodyguard. After killing him coldly, his new boss, "Johnny Lovo" (Osgood Perkins) lifts the enormous envy the luxury of your home and the beauty of his mistress, "Poppy" (Karen Moley). After the murder of "Lovo" and other crime bosses, became the master of Chicago, until the urge to dominate his sister "Francesca" (Ann Dvorak) cause its decline and downfall.It is the paradigm of the genre of gangster, ranks among the top 3 productions from the golden age of the genre (early 30), along with "Little Caesar" (1931) and "The Public Enemy" (1931). Possibly the best of 3. It contains many facts related to the figure of Al Capone, as the nickname "Scarface", the slaughter of Valentine's Day (14-II-1929), the murder of Big Jim Colosino and others, but not his biopic. "Tony" run a terrible race of murder, driven by ambition to get money and power in the city of crime and corruption, which marks a qualitative leap in the use of consistent automatic rifles, with a capacity of 300 rounds per minute . The ancient incidents become selective massacres, running with impunity from cars running the race. The work, extreme violence, including between 26 and 28 murders, a censure under more tolerant than that applied from 1934 (Hayes Code). "Tony" contemptible and fascinating at the same time, power-hungry and eager for wealth and domination, has similarities with "Macbeth." Compulsive exercising control over the sister has a hint of incestuous love. It was the subject of a "remake", "Scarface" (1983).The music combines jazz, dance melodies and environmental clubs, with a beautiful song sung by a soloist. Photography, eminently expressionist creates images of great beauty in composition and drawing. It makes use of superb sequence shots, frequent ellipsis and off-field scenes, reinforcing the tragic dimension of the story. The script adds to violence strokes black humor sometimes and occasionally macabre, supported largely by the figure of the secretary "Angelo". The interpretation of Paul Muni is possibly the best of his career. The resource management creates the precarious 1931/32 highlight film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Chicago-styled city, bootlegging Paul Muni (Antonio "Tony" Camonte) shoots his way to the top of the underworld. Reportedly, "Scarface" was ready to be released in 1931, when it would have closed in on Edward G. Robinson's "Little Caesar" and James Cagney's "Public Enemy". It worked out well for those other two gangsters that producer Howard Hughes and director Howard Hawks had trouble getting "Scarface" distributed, because it blew them out of the water by intensely raising the level of violence depicted in a crime drama. The sound of machine guns had never been so artfully communicated.These films can be said to romanticize and promote the "gangster lifestyle" - no matter what they do to script an "appropriate" and/or "moralistic" ending, a dynamic lead performance (Cagney, Muni, or Robinson) makes the villain heroic. Also raising eyebrows was the hint of an incestuous interest Mr. Muni's character has for his teenage sister Ann Dvorak (as Francesca "Cesca" Camonte); however, these kind of sexual subtexts (both intentional and not) were nothing new.Additionally fine supporting performances are delivered by banged-up mob boss Osgood Perkins (as John "Johnny" Lovo), henchman George Raft (as Guino "Little Boy" Rinaldo), leggy blonde Karen Morley (as "Poppy"), inept male secretary Vince Barnett (as Angelo), and bowling rival Boris Karloff (as Gaffney). Screen-player Ben Hecht and the writers adapt Armitage Trail well."Scarface" made the annual ten best lists complied by the "National Board of Review" and "Film Daily" but was overlooked by "Academy Award" voters. At the time, neither Howard (Hughes or Hawks) was very popular with "Oscar" givers, who were encouraged to vote for studio favorites; "Scarface" was independently produced. Muni was very popular, and received an "Best Actor" nomination for his follow-up "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" produced for Hal B. Wallis and Warner Bros.********* Scarface (3/31/32) Howard Hawks ~ Paul Muni, Ann Dvorak, Osgood Perkins, George Raft</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I 1st thought about seeing this movie, I figured it would have been like the 1983 version. It was not like it, but actually better in my eyes. This film told the story of the real gangster life and how it was seen in everyday conditions. The film was very violent and should have been used as a wake up call for the police at the time of how violent the gangster life and scene really was. Actor Paul Muni was amazing for the role he played as Tony Camonte. The way Paul Muni brought his character to life with the dramatic ups and downs and highs and lows kept myself glued to the TV. I felt as if there was never a dull moment. The newer version of Scarface was just too long and drawn out, where this movie kept you wanting to keep watching. One interesting fact I learned about this movie is that in fact was shot two years prior to its actual release. This was due to the film's graphic content and had to keep being edited. This right here truly shows you how truthful and to the point the director Harry Hawks was trying to make the movie. Overall, the movie was excellent and I would recommend to anyone wanting to see one of the great gangster movies of the 30's. The movie shows that it is either the way of the gangster or it was no way at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original Scarface(1932) which was phenomenal. For my first time watching it, I instantly understood what everyone had raved about. This is the ultimate "gangsta" film, no wonder it's every rappers favorite movie. I thought the script was wonderfully written, and expressed so much truth behind gang wars and life. I think life as a gangster is something that the average person has a curiosity about because it's not something that is publicly displayed or discussed. It's a more undercover way of living, therefore enticing to outsiders. Scarface was a great look into a different world. A world of money, drugs, greed, trust, betrayal, and a lot of violence. Al Pachino worked brilliantly as Scarface, he completely adapted to his character, making the story so believable. I thought there were some points in the film where the directing could have been a little better, and the camera work could have been improved. Nonetheless, I was completely enthralled in the film, feeling like I was there, which I think is the best part of watching a good film. You get completely sucked in, that you don't think about your real-life surroundings during those two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original scarface that i had no idea even existed... Today Al Pacinos version is highly acclaimed and has been blown up to all proportions. Any inspiring thug or drug dealer looks to that movie with giant gleaming eyes. Pacinos Scarface glorifies Italians and their mob mentalities, exposing extreme murder, drug use, and corruption. The 1932 version tells the tale of somewhat exaggerated truth. During that time period gangsters were frowned upon by the government but glorified by the public. Gangsters captured the publics attention due to their heroic efforts in taking what they thought they were entitled to, even if they had to kill for it. This film highlights a lot of the present day activity during that time period. The 1930's were an extremely hard time for America and crime ran rampant. Gangster films were extremely popular. Scarface was the king of them all, but unfortunately the government at the time didn't want the public exposed to such crude and vulgar acts carried out by the skilled gangster actors. The film was held up for two years while restrictions were slapped on it. Many states even banned the film. This film was great in my opinion. I personally am a big fan of the gangsters of the 1930's. I think they stood up for what they believed in, they were criminals but were also hero's. They carried out acts organists banks and such that the average American struggling during that time would love to do. The film itself has a great deal of action, suspense, and crafty acting. I think its fun to take a look into history and this film portrays a great piece of American history. This film was action packed, much like what you'll find in a lot of the mainstream movies of today. Interesting that with all the murders portrayed in the film and there was no blood shed... Censorship i take it. We have come a long way in that aspect. There isn't much censorship going on in todays action films. Violence has reached its absolute peak, and i don't believe it can be taken to a higher. Scarface (1932 ) I believe showed Americans fascination with violence and crime. I think the movie displays Americas affection for the " bad guy " and our civil duty to rebel against to authority. Would certainly suggest this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first talking gangster films and a cinematic landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on real events that happened in the criminal career of Al Capone, although Capone's criminal career had already ended with his conviction on charges of tax evasion six months before this film was released in April 1932. You know you're watching a Howard Hughes production when, during the first scene, a bar employee is sweeping up after a party held by one of Chicago's big gangsters and finds a bra among the confetti. The film shares some aspects with its gangster film predecessors - Tony Camonte is motivated by a desire for power just as Edward G. Robinson's Rico was in "Little Caesar", and also like Rico takes over the gang from a boss he perceives as weak. However, Camonte doesn't seem to have the pent-up rage of Public Enemy's Tom Powers. When Tony performs acts of violence it is usually related to gangland business. The actual deaths are strictly business, but the execution of the killings themselves are something Tony takes pride in - a sort of work of art on his part.Like Tom Powers, Tony Camonte is given a family background, but unlike Tom Powers, Camonte's family is a completely dysfunctional one. What is unique in this gangster picture is Tony's trio of love interests. He wants his boss' girl, Poppy, as a status symbol. He also seems to have a love affair going with the machine gun, acting like he has discovered America the first time he shoots one. Finally, Tony is in love with his own sister Cesca. Tony's only true fits of rage occur when he sees her with another man, and it is this loss of emotional control over this one issue that is ultimately his downfall. George Raft, an ex-gangster of sorts himself, is terrific as the smart and level-headed Guino Rinaldo, Tony's right-hand man. Finally there is Vince Barnett as Tony's extremely inadequate secretary in a bit of comic relief turned tragic at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Scarface for the first time and I thought it was a great film for a couple of reasons. One, I think Paul Muni is an incredibly talented actor who tends to get overlooked when we think about some of the greatest actors not only from this time period, but of all time. Another reason I thought the film was great is because I thought it was somewhat of a revolutionary film. The violence and the way the gangster or mobster lifestyle is portrayed was very edgy for the time and I would expect caused a lot of controversy when it was originally released. I really enjoyed the way Howard Hawks and Howard Hughes pushed the envelope as the director and producer of the film. Lastly, I enjoy films like this such as the 1983 Scarface with Al Pacino, The Godfather Trilogy, and Goodfellas, so I may be a bit biased when it comes to reviewing this film. All in all I would most certainly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gangster or mobster films, or just to someone that enjoys a great film no matter what the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie that going into it I was extremely excited to watch because I am a huge fan of the "Scarface" remake. Seeing this film there are so many similarities to DePalmas "Scarface" to even begin to list. However, some of the ones that stuck out to me was first not only the relationship between the characters and her but the attitude of Poppy compared to Elvira. In both films she seems a powerful, rich, although unhappy woman. Furthermore the relationship between both "scarfaces" and their respective ladies begins the same with the women looking down at them as if they were scum and then eventually as we know they get their women. The attitude of both scarface's is also the same in the way they both just keep pushing the limits with no regard for anything or anyone else but their own greed. The relationship between the 2 and their sister is strikingly comparable as well. My favorite similar scenes between the 2 movies however was when both find out their former boss and friend tried to have them killed and the way they got back at them. I thought Muni did an excellent job in this film I never realized what a brilliant actor he is. Seeing this after "Chain Gang" for me at least, made him seem like the Johnny Depp of that time in that they are both great actors and can play a variety of roles and execute them so well. The movie was exciting, intriguing and very fast paced (at least half as long as the remake). The action scenes were shot well in my opinion and the movie although briefly, showed not only how devastating, but how much of a problem the tommy gun was for police of the time. I particularly liked the scene towards the beginning when the cops were rushing to one of the stores that had just been "drove by" and the camera was placed on the actual car towards the rear so it made you feel as if you were in the car as well, nice touch. For the movie as a whole I really enjoyed one of the earlier scenes when Muni lights his match on the cops badge showing complete disregard and disrespect for the law and it gave you a taste of what was to come. The movie had some comedy as well considering what a gritty, dark, "gangster" film this was. I enjoyed the scene when Muni and his secretary are in the shop and the phone rings and as the place it getting shot up his secretary is still on the phone trying to get the name of whoever called for Muni; "boss there was too much noise I couldn't get a name" haha. Overall this was an excellent film filled with drama, comedy, action and even a little romance definitely worth taking a look at.</fullReview>

I thought that the actor who played Tony was great. I liked how comedy was intertwined with reality. The part where the guy is trying to get a name on the phone while the store is being shot up was funny. I also liked how almost every time someone was going to be killed, there was whistling. I thought that the scenes where they were taking out the north side were very advanced for the time. Overall, the story, directing, camera-work, sound effects, and acting came together beautifully to create a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of gangster films. The Godfather series, Goodfellas, Casino, most of them have been good. The 1983 Scarface was good, but something was missing for me. I can't find out what. Whatever was missing in the remake, was present in this 1932 classic.The story is based loosely on the criminal career of Prohibition-Era Mafia kingpin, Alphonse Capone (who's nick-name was Scarface) and a novel of the same name by Armitage Trail. The movie chronicles the rise and fall of Antonio "Tony" Camonte (Paul Muni), who begins to elevate his role in the Chicago mob. He gets a crew together (including George Raft) and dominates the city. His line of work causes family tension (with Ann Dvorak as his sister, Cesca) and trouble with the cops and rival gangs (including an appearance by the celebrated Boris Karloff as Irish mob boss, Gaffney). Soon, he becomes the cities most powerful crime boss and suffers a dramatic fall from grace.With all honesty, this version was better than the remake with Al Pacino. All major plot-points from the remake still exist in this one (his love/hate relationship with his sister, his love-affair with his boss's lover, and the main character's rise and fall of power). Paul Muni deliver's a great performance as Camonte, the rest of the cast also done a fine job. This movie blew me away, while the remake did as well but not to the degree that this classic piece of film-noir did. I love them both, but I have to point my fingers to this one as the better movie. This is easily one of the greatest gangster films of all time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The father of all gangster films and definitely one of the best, Howard Hawk's Scarface is an incredible array of bullet-flying action and sexual innuendo that does not stop. Considered extremely violent for its time, it took over a year for producer Howard Hughes to get it released, but he did and it now stands as a classic with full-fledged performances and a very tight script.Paul Muni, a name not that much heard in Hollywood lore, does excellent work as Tony Camonte, a man who starts out working for a local crime boss but has such a big head he is going to end up one eventually. His ambition and passion drive him to do everything he does, including take on a rival gang and go after his boss's woman, Poppy played by Karen Morely. He is so fearless and determined, no one can truly stop him, except maybe the law. George Raft appears in the role that defined him as the coin-tossing sidekick Rinaldo. And Anne Dvorak is very good as Tony's sister, whose relationship raises incestuous questions.What most impressed me was how Hawks was able to stage such beautifully shocking sequences of violence. Of course they are so timid for today, but it is the lack of visuals that lead to stronger feelings. And it all leads up to a fantastic conclusion with a message pointed right at you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Camonte V.S. Tony Montana? Too Hard To Choose!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was praying inside that this would be awesome and lo and behold it totally was. Not as good as De Palma's but still really good.I picked it up at Go-Lo for $2 with a Charles Bronson film but I only got the DVD for Scarface. I was blown away with how good it was. Paul Muni is fantastic here almost rivaling Pacino's Montana. He lacks with the class but makes up for it with an almost better accent. They're both deadly and could easily make me shiver in real life. The one big polar opposite is Montana went down angry riled up and firing. Camonte started off firing, started snivelling like a little girl (understandbly), then got shot escaping fleeing like a deer. Thats the big difference though. I think De Palma and Pacino adopted the Camonte persona then beefed it up making it more human and more brave but the evilness that Camonte still shines through Montana. But enough about that.It surprised me with how well it was made too. Now I'm not knocking old movies. I love classics especially old Frank Capra flicks. But for it's time it was well made and very defiant. It must have caused a hell of a ruckus around Hollywood and Hawks must have been Public Enemy No 1 just like Camonte. I'm so glad it made it through the censors and stuff. Because if this hadn't made it through it would have been a crying shame. This is brilliant and should be viewed by everyone who has seen the remake. Like i said, It's not as good as the newer Scarface, but hot diggity damn it's so dang close. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic film about a Capone-like gangster trying to take over the Chicago mob scene. This was a landmark cinematic achievement. While most of the films of the period used static cameras, Hawks put the camera in motion, energizing the screen and creating a lot of excitement. He also cleverly uses the "X" mark to symbolize pending death. Muni is terrific in the title role, although he, like the film, becomes a bit too melodramatic at the end. However, even then, Muni is subtle compared to Al Pacino's performance in the remake. The film daringly hints that Muni's love for Dvorak is more than brotherly. Raft's coin-tossing sidekick would get spoofed in "Singin' in the Rain."</fullReview>

But when it comes to a movie like this, it's the greatest gangster movie. It makes me angry how a movie as great as this can be unrecognized and followed by the 1983, Al Pacino version. The 1983 version is about Cuban drug dealers. The movie's plot is good, but should have never been called Scarface. Maybe Tony Montana, or just Montana, but not Scarface.If you're looking for a gangster movie, this is the one to see. If you're looking for a movie with action, this is the one to see.

		<fullReview>Throughout the film, you'll notice the letter "X" appearing and reappearing. Howard Hawks does this for a reason. The same reason why Brian De Palma uses the saying "The World is Yours" over and over again in the 1983 remake. Scarface is another gangster genre film of the 1930's like Public Enemy and Little Caesar. The average Joe fighting society. The cowboy fighting the law. The tommy gun montage sequence is one of the most memorable scenes in the entire film. Wonderfully filmed in 1932 by Hawks. It lives up to the remake for the simple reason that the majority of the remake was taken from the original. Except for one major element in Tony's character. In 1932, Tony ends up to be a coward and is caught by the police. In the remake, Tony dies but dies standing up like a legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SCARFACE (United Artists, 1932), directed by Howard Hawks, ranks one of the finer crime stories ever produced during the gangster cycle of the early 1930s. Inspired by the recent successes of Warners' own LITTLE CAESAR (1930) and THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931), which made overnight successes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney respectively, SCARFACE in turn helped gained recognition for two upcoming young actors, that of Paul Muni, having already been featured in two forgotten 1929 Fox films, THE VALIANT and SEVEN FACES, and George Raft. Unlike Robinson, Cagney, Raft and later Humphrey Bogart, Muni never lived up to his reputation as a movie gangster, having never enacted the same type of character twice. Although he did play a gangster again, in a comedy fantasy of ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER (United Artists, 1946), nothing remained as powerful nor as memorable as his role of the Al Capone-inspired Tony Camonte. In spite of the cross-like mark engraved on the left side of his face, he's never once referred to on screen as the title role.FORWARD: "This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our society and our liberty. Every incident in this picture is the reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government, 'What are you going to do about it?' The government is your government. What are YOU going to do about it?" With all that said, the story gets underway on the 22nd Street section of Chicago with the shooting of Louie Costillo (Henry J. Vejar), "the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders" following all night party, by a whistling dark shadow entering the empty restaurant. The prime suspect is Tony Camonte (Paul Muni), a tough punk with a cross scar on the left side of his face, who got his start as Costillo's bodyguard, and now working for rival crime boss Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins). Assisted by his right-hand man, Guido Rinaldo (George Raft), Camonte, whose mother (Inez Palage) claims him to be "no good," and hated by his 18-year-old sister, Cesca (Ann Dvorak) for his over-protective ways, rises to the top of his profession by stepping into territories of rival gangsters on the North side, doing away with them massacre style, taking over Lovo's establishment as well as acquiring his mistress, Poppy (Karen Morley), for his very own. In spite of being constantly hounded by detective Ben Guarino (C. Henry Gordon), Tony's life of crime would eventually reach its pinnacle point after "taking care of the guy" who married his kid sister. With other crime movies of the day, SCARFACE makes every attempt in topping them all, even those produced by Warner Brothers, where many of the best gangster films were made. Muni, Dvorak and later Raft would become contract players at the studio, which could cause SCARFACE to easily be mistaken as a Warners film. Boris Karloff comes as an even bigger surprise seen listed in the cast as Gaffney, a rival gang boss, whose key scene comes in a bowling alley where he strikes his last game. Other members of the cast include Tully Marshall (The Managing Editor); Edwin Maxwell (The Chief of Detectives); and Purnell B. Pratt (Garston). Vince Barnett as Angelo, Tony's secretary, is the only character in the story who enacts his role in comedic fashion, which somewhat unbalances the story as a whole. Barnett attempts an Italian accent while Muni's accent is far from being an imitation Chico Marx, but remains a strong central character regardless. Dvorak, however, looks quite different from her subsequent film roles sporting dark curly hair and heavy makeup, which adds to the character, but her serious overtone and screeching after the shooting of her husband is overly melodramatic that would stir up laughter for contemporary audiences, but in general as "a young girl with grown up ideas" chasing after men is perfect casting. Karen Morley, whether intentional or not, starts off as being stiff as the gangster's moll, but improves as the movie progresses. George Raft's signature role as Camonte's coin flipping trustee assistant is certainly one that gained him recognition as well as a studio contract for Paramount (1932-1939) shortly after this film's release.Rarely seen since its initial theatrical release, SCARFACE eventually turned up on cable television during its early cycle of the 1980s on Wometco Home Theater before airing frequently on American Movie Classics (1989-90) and Turner Classic Movies (starting in 2001). It was also one of the first films from the classic movie era to be distributed to home video by about the same time as the 1983 remake starring Al Pacino in a remake brought up to date, changing the Tony character from Italian mobster of Chicago to Cuban refugee in Florida, containing more intense violence that the original ever allowed at that time, each concluding with the neon sign reading, "The World is Yours," along with a closing dedication to director Howard Hawks after its extreme three hour length. As for the original, which was reportedly first previewed at 99 minutes, circulating prints are currently available at 92 minutes. In closing, Paul Muni gives a masterful performance in the title role, but his next role, I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (Warners, 1932) is even better. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #062: Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>062: Scarface (1932) - released 3/31/1932; viewed 6/5/06.KEVIN: Scarface rounds out the gangster trilogy that included Little Caesar and The Public Enemy. I still like Public Enemy the best, but this movie has some great direction from Howard Hawks. I caught the business with the "X" signaling death the first time I watched it, and even more here. When Boris Karloff's Gaffney gets a strike at the bowling alley, the writing's on his scorecard. The most notable thing about Scarface is that apparently as the violence in society escalated and increased, so did the violence in the films that depicted it (and not the other way around, as many conservative groups have often claimed). I'd forgotten that there were so many on-screen deaths since the first time I'd seen the movie, more than in the other film's we've watched from the past year. Another of the differences between this and the other two gangster classics is that Scarface kind of comes in at the middle of Tony's rise to the top, where Caesar and Enemy are both biographies of their main characters. The scenes when Tony and his fellow torpedoes are going around marketing their booze is a faster version of what we saw Tom Powers &amp; Co. doing in Enemy. And the bloody climax is cooler than the final shootout in Caesar. One might notice in this review how much I'm comparing this film to other movies, and that is an obstacle this movie must overcome, which it does. It's not the best gangster picture, but it stands on its own as the most graphic and realistic depiction yet of things that were going on at the time every day.DOUG: We watched this film about three years ago in Action Adventure class. Since then we've watched Brian De Palma's 1983 remake with Al Pacino. We had to tape it on TCM, since it's only available on DVD as part of the big Scarface gift set (gold money clip and all). Now here on the Odyssey, it completes the classic gangster movie trilogy with Little Caesar and The Public Enemy. Howard Hawks flexes his muscles as the best director of genre pictures the Studio Era had ever seen. Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney create more vivid characters, but Scarface is probably the most relevant film dealing with the problem of organized crime in its day, not to mention introducing us to the most dangerous gangster anti-hero of all, Tony Camonte. Paul Muni plays Camonte to perfection, a volatile hothead who feels he must prove himself through violence to move up the ladder. I'm still scratching my head as to why the great Paul Muni wasn't in more movies. Maybe it was his heart problems. At first Tony seems content to take orders from his boss, Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), until he discovers the Tommy Gun. My favorite scene will always be when Tony storms into Johnny's office, Tommy in hand, and declares that he will use his new "typewriter" to "write his name all over town in big letters!" A fire lights up in his eyes as his ambitions soar; he takes orders from no one now. I knew it was violent when I saw it the first time; now I can see that it's even more violent than its predecessors. It's also more conscious of its message, with the opening credits blaring it for all to see. We also get a scene where the police chief and the newspaper bigwigs sit around and debate what to do about all these gangsters, essentially calling to the audience to take action.Last film: Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). Next film: Grand Hotel (1932).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raised the bar for all later gangster films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Howard Hawks film that I've seen... and if they're all this good, I'll be sure to watch all of them. This movie really impressed me... I had not expected so much from such an old film. This is excellent film noir... the shadows, the dialog, the tone... while it didn't entertain me quite as much as The Big Sleep with Bogie himself(a hard feat to do, even for another noir), it's still high up there on the list of movies that pretty much any man(as in race, not gender) should see, in particular any that would claim him or herself a fan of noir and crime films. The plot is great, and it develops very nicely throughout. The pacing is solid, I was never bored. The acting is top-notch, everyone hands in a credible performance. The characters are well-written. The editing is magnificent, with some nice stylistic choices that surpass most anything else of the period. The cinematography, I think, impressed me the most; long, panning shots and angles that I would never have guessed film-makers were capable of so long ago. This film is almost 75 years old, yet it easily beats new releases. Now, it's impossible to watch this film without making comparisons to the '83 remake(or the remake without making comparisons to this; something I didn't realize when I watched the Pacino version). I will say that the similarities are plentiful, and I'd say that in most cases, this is the better film(not counting the many changes and additions of De Palma's version), but the film that Oliver Stone wrote still has the upper hand in a few of these scenes. The idea also seems somewhat grander, larger-scale in the newer film... whether that's a good thing or not is up to the viewer to decide, but with the second film showing a longer progression and having Tony start lower, the story does become bigger. With that said, this definitely has better pacing, dialog and all-round acting. This has the style that the latter film tries to make up for lacking by instead going for more violence. For its time, this was violent... it certainly pushed the envelope, but by today's standards, it seems tame. No matter; if you're watching this film for the sake of violence, you're missing the point and you've got the wrong movie, anyway. One character in this movie truly irritated me... he was inconceivably, uncontrollably(though, as my father pointed out when we watched this, rather convincingly) stupid. So much supposed "humor"(which the film has in spades, and of a fairly high quality) is drawn from his obnoxious role, making it abundantly clear to anyone that this film was made in the era of such characteristically unfunny comedy teams as Laurel and Hardy and The Three Stooges, which were all based on that very same kind of idea of passing intense stupidity as comedy. The thing that bothered me more, however, was the blatant, insultingly obvious message of the film. Sure, it's a good message(if a bit close-minded as well as black and white), but why shove it down our faces like that? It doesn't take a genius to realize it; crime is *bad*. Organized crime: guess what, even worse. Surely, one would think, that even in the time of these mobsters, people would read the papers, hear about what was going on and be smart enough to realize that? I disagree with just about every "law" person in the film, and their view on criminals, making every single scene containing them(which, compared to the full running time, isn't terribly many) somewhat cringe-inducing... mostly because they're practically speaking to 'us', to the viewers, as if to provoke a reaction. For such a high point in cinema, it's sad to think that this film may truly have been conceived and created with the sole object of scaring people away from criminals... something the acts of them(the gangsters) ought to do quite well by themselves. But I digress. This is a highly enjoyable, if just slightly propagandistic, film that will satisfy the need for noir, great acting and smart dialog in any viewer, young or old. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in making it and every fan of noir. 8/10</fullReview>

Eventually Camonte wants control of the North Side of Chicago and machine-guns his entire gang. Gaffney (Boris Karloff) another dangerous mobster is killed while enjoying a great game of bowling. Ann Dvorak (Cesca) and even Rinaldo(George Raft) appear in this classic. This film was adapted from Armitage Trail's novel, and is really about the career of Al Capone and the reinactment from Chicago's crime-filled history like the killing of "Big Jim" Colosimo, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Karloff is not convincing in his gangster role because of his British accent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most influential gangster films and an early pioneer of the genre. Plus the source for a much more well-known remake from the 80s starring Al Pacino.Basic story is pretty simple. Tony (Paul Muni) is a rising hit-man for the local mafia in Chicago. The Prohibition Era of the 20s is in full swing and his boss is looking to expand his illegal booze business. Tony's story begins as he performs a hit, taking care of one of his boss's rivals. But Tony has ambitions and needs of his own.In the process we explore the ugly underbelly of organized crime and the fallibility of man under the pressure of his own lust for power. Iconic stuff. But, if I'm being completely honest, I found the movie to be quite boring. It's a product of its time, and while it was no doubt impressive back then, almost a century has passed. The sets are stiff, the acting equally so, the story feels rushed because the film is so short and it just doesn't hold a candle to the remake.Many would argue that a film should be reviewed keeping in mind when it was made. But my personal ratings are based on how much I liked the film in comparison to others I've seen. And this just didn't impress me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface was filmed right at the beginning of the Hays Code era. This impacted the film so much that was re-shoot was payed for and done prior to it's theatrical release, causing the film to be put out a year after it's original date. The film that was finally shown was very good. Paul Muni, was such a strong anti-hero, that the ending crushed me that he had to die. His pain became my pain, when he realized what he had done in killing his best friend who was always by his side, when his sister died, and then he was cornered by the police. The cinematography was amazing. The mysterious air of a gangster film was caught very well by use of off-screen space, and the use of framing that would show a shadow or a sounds that would be heard and instantly, the audience would know exactly what had happened without having had to be shown explicitly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Paul Muni was great as Tony and gave such an amazing performance. I prefer this version to Al Pacino, Pacino was great but I didn't feel the same emotion or weight in that as I did in Muni's much shorter performance. Muni played Tony in a very masculine macho way that really worked, he could go through lots of varied emotion and still be that same thick headed jerk and it was perfect. The action was great! The shootouts were great and very violent for the time, I would love to see all the stuff that was cut when it became censored. This movie is funny yet serious and it maintains that balance because of all the amazing actors and Hawkes vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface is a great early classic of gangster genre. This is probably the most controversial, most brutal and most violent gangster film in the early thirties of the last century. The film is thematically quite clear and represents the beginning, the rise and fall of a gangster leader. If I looked deeper, maybe I made some links with Al Capone. I'll keep this explanation vague and distant. The inspiration for the script is obvious. The streets of Chicago during Prohibition and accounts of criminal leader.Hawks obviously had the courage to do such a good movie and certainly a lot of money to be faced with censorship. Scarface is extremely fast and exciting movie. No, it is not surprising that at times breathtaking. The amount of explicit violence and depravity of the characters in these years is perhaps counterproductive. However, any other scenario would guarantee an average result. I am glad that the Hawks did not agree with that.Paul Muni (Tony Camonte) is raw, violent, hasty, and at the same time and calculating the main character. Perversity is best seen through a latent homosexual and incestuous relationship with best friend and sister. Tony is crazy and stupid at the same time. Muni was fantastic.Karen Morley (Poppy), Osgood Perkins (Johnny Lovo) and George Raft (Guino Reinaldo) are solid. C. Henry Gordon (Ins. Ben Guarino) and Boris Karloff (Gaffney) are in small roles excellent. Vince Barnett as Angelo is a special character credited with black humor and a bit of relaxation for all of us who watch the movie. Excellent fit in the atmosphere.Ann Dvorak (Francesca Camonte). Cesca is a female character required all films of this genre in the early thirties. Powerful and very well acted female protagonist. When actress in addition to the ubiquitous Muni wins space in the film it is the essence of which is sought. Scarface is rightly a classic and one of the most influential films of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface 1932</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni (Tony Camonte)who ruled most of Chicago, made great movies and was a successful actor. He is based on Al Capone and his gang and their murderous rampage of the time. Liked by many, and disliked by many, he was know for his violence and guns. I really enjoyed the Caf shooting incident. It was quite funny to me. His secretary was the funniest. I am not sure if I should consider him an idiot or a tough guy. As soon as the secretary answers the phone and asks who they want to speak with the shooting starts. Like a set-up. The secretary does not duck nor hide. Instead he keeps asking the caller the same question. Then decides to pull out his gun. I found it funny when Tony found it amusing that machine guns could be carried. His friend shot one of the enemies, then runs outside to grab the machine gun with no fear of being shot. It seemed almost normal to be shot at. I also thought it was funny when Tony brought the machine gun over to Johnny. Johnny was worrying and Tony was just calm. Overall this was a great film and it was very clear that Tony made killing a part of his business plan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have an idea of how many of these old gangster films are in general (lots of neeeehhs and see here's) and you have seen the more recent release of starring Al Pacino, than there probably wont be any surprises or thrills here. That being said it is an enjoyable watch and as over the top ridiculous as Paul Muni can be at times, he still puts on a good performance. In all honesty I had to watch this film for a class but within about 10 min I found myself very interested in Muni's character and seeing his rise to infamy. However I really don't have any thing more to say about this aside from it's basic entertainment value (which is much higher than expected).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who didn't grow up around older movies, watching the original Scarface, I wasn't really expecting much. I had seen the remake (as most people have), and I didn't enjoy it. However, I did enjoy this version. I liked the simplicity of it. I enjoyed how it could be a compelling gangster film without needing to add drugs, graphic violence, or an overuse of swear words. I thought the film was beautifully shot, and unlike his role in "Chain Gang," Paul Muni did an EXCELLENT job making everything believable. I would absolutely watch this film again. However, it was Ann Dvorak who, in my opinion was the best. Also, knowing that this was a pre-Hays Code production, the film had some gritty content I wouldn't have expected from this time period.</fullReview>

It stands out from the more recent version and is completely different. The prohibition back story is great and really just makes perfect sense for the time. The acting, characters and story were all great. Scar face was too greedy and it ultimately led to his demise. The one thing I was not particularly fond of was the sister. She overacts and is way too dramatic and almost ruins every scene she is in. However, this doesn't spoil the movie. From start to finish its a great gangster power thirsty movie.</fullReview>

This seems to be important for gangster movies. For an audience to get sucked into a gangsters world view, there must be a feel of a kind of hopelessness. I would have rated this film higher if it weren't for the female lead. I felt her acting was overdone and would briefly take me out of the story at times. The shot of the protagonists mansion stood out to me as an effective display of wealth, really defining the character. Overall, an awesome film with certain aspects that didn't necessarily translate over all the generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface is a great example of an early classic gangster movie. I liked how dark and scary the movie was filmed. It has brutal scenes throughout and the bodies pile up to support that. From quick shoot outs to the bowling alley where Tom is killed. Even though it has its brutal moments it also has a humorous and sarcastic side to it. Most of the humor came from Angelo in the movie. I thought Paul Muni played Scarface very well as a classic violent and dumb gangster. I also found it interesting that Karloff and Raft played smaller parts in this movie and that this movie was somewhat of both their starts to their film careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Classic Gangster Films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 1930s, there were a lot of amazing gangster films coming out. Films like "Little Caesar", "The Public Enemy", and, this film, "Scarface".Directed by the always great Howard Hawks, "Scarface" is one of the least dated films of the 1930s, and still manages to hold up very well. I cannot compare it to its remake, because I haven't seen the remake, but I believe that if you have seen the remake, you shouldn't base your thoughts on this film off of that, since the two films were made in two separate decades (this one being from the 30's, and the Brian DePalma directed version being made in the 80's) and both have very different runtimes. The remake is literally over an hour longer than this version! Obviously, there must be quite a few differences between these films.I'm kind of glad I couldn't base my thoughts of this original version off of the 80's version, because I can fully see how much it manages to work as a stand alone film. With some astounding action based sequences, compelling drama, and some very interesting and artistic direction. Hawks uses various creative techniques, some involving shadows, which give the film a more menacing and dark touch, making it feel less like some violent action movie (which it manages to have many elements of) and more like a Film Noir.The acting is pretty good, Paul Muni makes the character both extremely hatable and pretty sympathetic at times, and Boris Karloff (famous for being in a lot of classic horror films such as "Frankenstein" and "The Mummy") shows up, and is pretty great, too!I cannot come up with any negative things about the film. It is far more than just a racy, controversial 30's movie, and doesn't deserve to forever be categorized as the "original 'Scarface' movie".</fullReview>

All the characters were well played, this movie would be good to do a remake in color keep the same concept but just add color to it...I wonder hoe the world would view it....this movie was one of the reason why Scarface w/Al Pacino came to light which was another great movie to watch. Both these movies had to good looking men and of course at the end of the day a woman was involved and of course the man had to have her and everything else that he wanted, and with that came jealousy, greed and envy. A lot of these things can definitely ruin someone, yet alone living a fast life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting to see the differences between Paul Muni's performances in this film and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Although his character here had his own particular charm, he still managed to come off as a ruthless gangster. The lighting in the film was very effective to dramatize certain events, particularly the use of silhouettes and the off camera shootings, where we could hear all the action but not see it. The film was rather gritty considering the times, but that made it full of excitement and suspense. It was interesting how the character of Tony was so brutal one moment, and lighthearted and humorous the next, particularly in the scenes with Poppy versus the scenes with his sister. This juxtaposition and his enjoyment of violence really worked to make his character more monstrous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World is Yours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarface" is one of my favorite and one of the best gangster film plots in the history of cinema. A single man, Tony Camote, rising to power from his lesser position of society truly embellishes the American Dream's darker path to success. Scarface was a successful film targeted at mainstream audiences of the time and geared towards a very real and despised gangster industry that had swept through the nation. It was a masterpiece to watch, as well as Brian de Palma's remake. They are truly supplemental and if you've seen one, you should see the other as well. Scarface remains one of my favorite old gangster crime dramas for its brilliant depiction of the life of gangsters in 1930's Chicago. It is a roller coaster ride of betrayal, revenge, and love that is action packed from start to finish. Humor also drives the characters such as Tony and especially his secretary who's humor further adds to the cinematic masterpiece of Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson. Paul Muni brings a certain depth to an anti hero that the audience finds themselves rooting for despite his illegal intentions. The audience wants to see him accomplish the American Dream as well as see him stopped due to the nature of the film that was both socially conscious and genuine about the world of 1932. The audience back then saw these shootouts and gangsters in the big cities and this movie portrayed the openness and fearlessness in which these gangsters operated well. One powerful and recurring element of the story is the quote "The World is Yours" which Tony adopts as a sign to take what is rightfully "his" and, to me, that was very interesting and symbolic throughout. The action is packed into this 93 minute film and always around every corner. The plot is one of my favorite gangster plots and remains to be rivaled to this day. A man rising to power and achieving his goal of "The American Dream" through illegal means and facing the music for his pride and greed. The ending, which i will not reveal, is poignant as well as thrilling and it had me on the edge of my seat rather than the alternate ending, spawning due to censorship issues of the time, which just doesn't do the movie justice. This film was subsequently influential to American Cinema and spawned a brilliant remake and soon will spawn another Scarface title in the next few years due to its brilliant plot and acting as well as its social and historical significance.</fullReview>

I'm not sure if "Scarface" was ahead of its time and paved way for other great gangster movies, but if so I would easily agree and understand why. Can't say I liked this more than the 80s "Scarface" but I enjoyed both in their own right and their own pros &amp; cons.

I think Tony's character was less of a man to be admired in this version of "Scarface" as oppose to remakes. Which I thought very highly about because I felt that this was the message of the film in the first place. "these are the people we must work to remove from our streets" kind of idea would not have worked with a Tony whom everyone could adore.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed how this movie was intended to inform not only the general public of the United States, but to show the government just how big of a problem gang violence was becoming. I also really enjoyed how there was an actual scene in the film where characters were talking directly to the government about how awful the problem was becoming. Something I do not enjoy about violent films is how gruesome and graphic they are. This film did an incredible job at showing the violence and more disturbing scenes in a way that wasn't graphic or obvious. It was always behind closed doors or in the shadows, but the sounds really informed the audience of what was truly going on, and just how serious some of the crimes and murders were.</fullReview>

This movie, which the later Scarface (1983) was based off, ended up being just as good as the latter. I loved the fact that this one was based in Chicago opposed to Miami which was a direct realism of the times when gang violence was a very real thing. Both movies have the same idea though, Tony starting low and eventually working his way up the ladder until he is basically out of control and power has gone to his head. The film is produced by Howard Hughes and is very much entail with other gangster movies of the time. Loud gunfire, women, and nightclubs all while fending off those pesky police.

		<fullReview>One of a handful of 1930s favourites that very much came to define the gangster picture, "Scarface" is a stark, grim, and effectively violent film, a solid collaboration between producer Howard Hughes and (co) director Howard Hawks. The splendid Paul Muni is a force of nature as an Al Capone-inspired mobster, Tony Camonte. Although ostensibly working for people like Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), Tony has his own way of doing things. He's ruthless, ambitious, and impulsive; he has no problem with doing the dirty work. He also tends to get very touchy when it comes to the matter of his kid sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak).Good times are ahead when you see gangster specialist George Raft is playing Tony's associate Rinaldo, and especially when the wonderful Boris Karloff turns up, in a substantial non-horror role, as a competing mafia goon named Tom Gaffney. Both Dvorak, and Karen Morley as Poppy, the gal who catches Tony's eye, are striking and appealing talents. C. Henry Gordon squints and snarls entertainingly as Inspector Guarino, the lawman just itching to take down our flamboyant antihero. But it's Muni who will command most of the attention. He's got a fun and meaty role, and really makes the most of it."Scarface" is vivid, well paced, well edited, and atmospheric. Although crime films in the decades to come would up the ante in terms of splatter and sadism, the violence in this was pretty shocking for its time. Bullets fly on a constant basis, and bodies drop. "Scarface" even begins with a nicely staged murder set piece.Even though films like "Scarface" would get accused of glorifying underworld life, this one clearly has a different agenda in mind, going so far as to denounce organized crime in its opening minutes. Still, it was a tough sell for Hughes, who eventually made the bold move of giving "Scarface" wide releases only in those states without strict censorship boards.Powerful stuff overall, with an engaging and rousing big finale.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Muni does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the opening credits of this film, and realized that it starred Paul Muni, I immediately became more interested in what this film had to offer. After viewing I am a Fugitive of a Chain Gang, which starred Muni, I had high expectations of this film. Also, being one of the very few Americans who have not watched the Al Pacino version, I was going in with an unbiased view of if the original would hold up to the Hollywood rendition. Due to the time that this film came out, 1932, right on the heels of sound being introduced into feature films, it still encompasses the ways of the silent film by adding in a message in the beginning. As soon as the messages came across the screen, the first thing that I was reminded of was the Silent Film classics. This film incorporated good use of shadows and lighting, especially for being black and white and especially for the time period in which it was filmed. This movie is complete with cigar smoke, car chases, pretty blonde women falling in love with the bad guy, turf wars, women with guns and men shooting guns. Finally seeing some real, raw emotion from Tony when Cesca gets shot in the end during the police hunt, made this movie come full circle for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface is a good gangster movie at that, it has a very interesting leading charter in Tony and him with Paul Muni's performance is the best part of this gangster flick. Muni is next level portraying Ton yin the crazy way he acts and basically everything about the charter he owns that and is the best part of this movie. The story really didn't grab me, I just couldn't get into any of the side charters that follow Tony and that hurt the film for me. The other good part of the movie is the chase and shoot out scenes my favorite is when Tony is first being shot at with Tommy Guns in a restaurant and the shots go right above the man using the telephone and he isn't phased by it and just takes his bullet riddled hat off and keeps talking. Overall Scarface is an alright film in my opinion and gets the rating of a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface (1932)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The World is Yours!! Sign that is all too familiar in this film.I found it interesting that the audience sees this sign in the beginning of the film and as well in the end. It was also interesting to see the sharpness of the black &amp; white, it was completely different than the other films that was created before hand. The amount of shadows that we seen too, they were huge and I guess this was to echo the amount of danger a character was in and also to show some type of power some of the characters had. There was so much murder in this film as well as gun shots. I like how the gun shots was used to express time and the amount of death throughout the film. I was surprised to see all of the gang on gang violence and maybe this was because I wasn't expecting it. But their fights were epic, all over territory, alcohol, power and money. The sound in the film was thrilling. I loved how each punch had a distinctive sound that was loud and hard all in the same time. The transitions from scene to scene were so smooth, they faded out to a new which made it seem effortless for the mechanics of the film. The way they showed calendars with the gun shorts to the change of clothes throughout the scenes signified the time frame. There was also a heavy use of smoke, we cigarettes and smoke from empty barrels, and also in some explosions. The deaths we very interesting and this is because for example every time the main character whistled it meant someone important was going to die. It seems as though the deaths happened more frequently at night and positive things happened during the day.The car chases were hectic and chaotic but also serious because so many people died in these scenes. In the scene when the men were held at gun point all lined up against the wall the director shows the audience a bar of X's above the men before and after they were murdered. I believe the X's signified their deaths. The way the characters spoke too was different from other films and this is because of the use of slang, there was nothing proper about it, and I liked it. It made the story more believable. The only thing that seem to bother me was when the main character's sister came around. It felt as though some of her acting was a bit overly dramatic and also when Ginuo was murdered, the way his just slide down the wall and shook his head seemed kind of odd to me. In all, I think this was a good film and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface 1932 review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface the 1932 film was a fantastic film! I loved the quick, violent, and very brutal shootouts and gunfights. My favorite scene, which was also a comedic one, was when Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) hired his personal secretary who did not know how to take a message. Firstly, because he could never remember that he had to ask for the persons name, and secondly because he didn't know how to write. What made this scene my favorite was the bickering between Tony and the secretary whenever the phone would ring. The irony of this whole situation is that when the secretary finally understood the message and took the guys name down, he ended up getting shot, and died (I did NOT like this part!!!!!!!!). I think that the main character, Tony Camonte, was a bit of a brutal one. He seemed to want to have the "upper hand" with all the women in his life (his mom, sister, and his girlfriend). He was also able to shoot anyone without even the slightest remorse, except for when he shot his sisters husband. This characterization I think made the movie but I also think that it gave the gangsters a bad name during this time period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Scarface (1932), is an excellent mobster movie that showcases the crime families of the prohibition era. The film has some real powerful action sequences, and really seemed progressive for the time. The plot is fun and shows the rising up of several key figures in the film, like Tony Camonte. There are some interesting elements such as gun fights, romance, car chases, and gang wars. The film is good at setting up protagonists and antagonists that clash with each other. The main protagonist Tony Camonte is an antihero, but I felt for him throughout the film. The movie does an excellent job at conveying its story. Overall, Scarface (1932) gets an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chicago has a historical past dealing with crime syndicates, which plays a huge part in this film. Tony Camonte, our anti-hero, rises from a low level thug, to conquering most of the entire city and all of the fallen crime families he had defeated. At one point, the infamous Valentine's Day Massacre occurs, where Tony leads his men, disguised as police officers, and mows down his rivals in a garage. His friend Johnny, the head of the gang, eventually grows weary of Tony and his rise to prominence, and demands Tony to be killed. Tony overcomes the assassination attempt, and lives up to the billboard outside of his apartment: The World Is Yours. Tony ultimately meets the long arm of the law, and winds up on the wrong end of a pointed gun, proving that crime doesn't pay. I feel that this is an absolutely wonderful film, where the Hays Code was disregarded for great reasons. A life of crime is not pretty, and should not be sugarcoated, which can be seen in the end of the film. All in all, I love this film, and it is a definite must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this for the first time, and found it very entertaining, especially considering its age. Performances are strong and interesting, and action flowing and constant. Paul Muni is solid, and his move to crime boss fast and easy to follow. I didn't know how to take the lengthy message imploring us to take matters into our hands regarding the eradication of gangland crime. But at the least it adds to the film's historical interest. I liked the almost sweet suggestion of the future relationship of Tony's sister Ceska with the George Raft character early in the film, and sure enough it becomes pivotal to the film. By the way, Ann Dvorak is occasionally unfairly criticized for overacting; a misinterpretation of her youthful optimism and enthusiasm (until squelched by her oppressive brother). Folks, she is a teen aged little sister! But to most viewers, probably male, this will go unnoticed; they will want a fast moving ultra-violent gangster flick, and they will get it. But there is a lot more here for those who care to look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this version of Scarface for the first, and I must say that I enjoyed it for a couple reasons. The first reason I enjoyed the film was it was a pioneering gangsters/mobster film. The second reason I enjoyed the the film was the performance that Paul Muni gave, clearly he was one one the greats of all times and needs to be mention more. To me the story was loosely basic on the prohibition era, where the sale, production, and transportation of alcohol was ban. The film had a lot of action from driving chase scenes, to shootouts. The editing was pretty interesting because, I could tell when the scene were being shot in the lot but it worked out really well. For this one Howard Hawks must definitely go down in the record books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface, among other things, is a gangster flick that takes place during the prohibition era and is loosely based on Al Capone. It focuses on being as gritty and as lifelike as possible, given the time it was made this was quite a feat having various censorship codes to hurdle over. I was quite surprised to see some of the shootouts and drive-byes in Scarface, not because they were particularly graphic or stunning, but simply because it was allowed in a movie made in 1932. Scarface follows Tony Camonte, a hostile gangster willing to murder his way to the top, as he murders his way to the top. Along the blood path we find his love interest, his sister whom Tony cares deeply for, and an assortment of gangsters and policemen. All the elements needed for a good mobster film. The problem with Scarface is that it isn't very engaging. The isn't really any effort put in for you to like Tony Camonte or some of the other characters , with the exception of Cesca. It's a gritty film capitalizing on the drama and action of the gangsters of the time, but it isn't as well developed as say, Godfather. Given how it was made and Scarface's censor hurdles, it's still quite a good film. It wouldn't be the first gangster/mobster film I'd see if given a choice (even picking the remake over the original), but Scarface is still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie follows the rise and fall of the famed gangster known as Scarface. It begins when he is just another man in a gang, to being second in charge, to eventually be head honcho of the group and seeing his own demise. The movie itself is very good, and very well done and is in no way to glorify gangsters as I have heard some say, it was filmed in protest to thee government for not doing more to stop such senseless crimes. The film itself is actually quite violent showing the cold blooded murder or many individuals including gangsters and poor saps that were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tony (Scarface) played by Paul Muni believes that he is a certain degree higher above the law for the simple fact that he has friends in high places and then because he obtains a machine gun he believes he has all the power. He expects his orders to be followed and will assert his dominance when needed. Muni does an excellent job in this film. When I saw him he looked....uglier than I remember him last, but his charisma definitely shows well through to the audience. I also enjoyed the role of Poppy played by Karen Morley. She more than once tell Tony what she thinks of him, and eventually his charm gets through to her as well. All in all it was a good film, it was just not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this film not exactly knowing whether I would like it. I personally have never been engulfed in gangster films. I think this film like most other gangster films was boring.Throughout I entire movie nothing made me think. From the first 10 minutes I could accurately predict the ending.Now after watching the film I can say that it confirmed my prediction and it all fell into a stereotypical "Gangster Flick". If anyone likes gangster flicks like "The Godfather" and the more recent "Scarface" film with Al Pacino and you also enjoy black and whit films then I would recommended this film to you.Besides my dislike of "Gangster" style films the film was hard to follow at times. For the most part many actors looked alike which made determining who was who very hard at times. Also because of the actors having very hard accents made it hard to hear what they were saying at times. Even with this difficulty I'm happy they choice to cast people with the real thick accents it made the film more appealing. My only other problem with this film was the lighting. Because it is a black and white film if scenes are not light properly they appeared very dark and hard to make out what was going on. Over all personally I would not watch it again.</fullReview>

Her life ends with his in a literal "killing jar," as Tony has neglected to shut the steel shutters on his safe room, since that would prevent him from taunting the authorities down below. In the script it may appear that Tony is hunted down for starting a gang war for the Chicago booze market during American Prohibition (a time when alcohol consumption in the United States reached its all-time peak under the careful guidance of so-called "bootleggers" and "speak-easies," all of which were carefully managed by state and local police and politicians, as today's historians have thoroughly documented in a shelf full of recent tomes). Though the cops' had their noses out of joint since Tony was upsetting their money wagon, his incestuous lust was the final straw in his demise, given that blood is thicker than water.</fullReview>

In doing so he takes Tony as his second in command and personal bodyguard.

As Tony's murder count climbs higher and higher, he and Lovo realize that they have different ideas as to what their ideal world would be. That and the fact that Tony is attracted to Lovo's girlfriend, Poppy. Can Tony and Johnny Lovo coexist in the same world? Can Lovo hang on to his girl?

I liked the character development of Tony, both from his "businessman" way of looking at what he did and the undercurrents of his perhaps stronger-than-most's brotherly love toward his sister. The comedic aspects were thrown in where I wouldn't necessarily have expected them, such as with the phone conversation during the drive-by.

The implication of the incest relationship between Tony and his sister is completely mind-blowing considering how early on in cinema this film was made. The Hayes code allowing that to happen completely shocks me. It almost added an element of screwball (not-so) comedy, in that they figured out a clever way to get around the code. Tony's facial expression when he was first handed a gun is both scary and exciting.

The overall production of the film is why I gave it 7 stars, it would've been 8 but it lost a star for Paul Muni being a key actor(not a big fan of Muni either). I enjoyed the overall plot and message the film had. There was so much emphasis on the lighting and sound in this film. The lighting was used very well. However, it was used more to create certain feelings during certain scenes. Sometimes the characters wouldn't even be in the shot physically, but their shadows would be. This is a great way to cause anticipation for the audience. Personally, I love the "lurking shadow" effect. Sound was the obvious feature in this film. From the blazing gun shots, sounds of sirens, sounds of footsteps, EVERYTHING...played a key role in thrusting the imaginary film into the realms of reality.</fullReview>

The movie was made to identify with the people who lived in the prohibition era, so it would be harder to relate to than the more recent remake in the 1980s. However, this does not mean that is wasn't a good film anyway. Paul Muni demonstrates great skill as an actor, and is very easy to follow. This film focuses very much on how mortal we all are, and uses a good deal of symbolism to show when death is coming for someone.

I found that there were countless elements that exemplified this message in the movie, specifically the lighting and the characters.

		<fullReview>When you say gangster film Scarface is one of the first films to come to mind and this is the original. Everything that defines the gangster film is here; bootleg liquor,ladies, death and machine guns. The film is action packed with a body count that easily rivals modern crime flicks. The gritty realistic action helps to paint the film's message: the gangsters need to be stopped. Paul Muni brings life to Tony Camonte in a unique way and makes Tony quite multi-faceted. On the outside Tony is a brutish thug who doesn't seem to care about anything but his own desire for power, and Muni's sluggish face and accent portray this excellently. But there is also a soft side to Tony, caring for his mother and almost creepily for his sister. A strong cast, great action, and even a little humor on the side make this movie a powerhouse.</fullReview>

None stop action is what can be expected from Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) weather he is brawling with dudes at a dance, shooting up mobsters or ducking tommy gun fire in a crazy car chase. Tony's hard, short tempered and cold blooded attitude make him a really interesting character to watch develop as he works his way to the top. This film would be a 9 out of 10 if it wasn't for the annoying little secretary Tony has answer his phone calls because I found him rather obnoxious and unnecessary.

		<fullReview>Scarface is a 1932 gangster flick about a mobster named Tony's rise and fall from power. This movie is epic, much like its remake. Paul Muni is a total boss as the very stereotypical gangster Tony (though to be fair, this character may be the beginning of the mobster stereotypes, not sure though). The film is epic, in scope at least, using larger sets and more action than any other movie I've seen from this time (the beginning also has one of the best long shoots I've ever seen in any movie, puts Tarantino and Scorsese to shame). Also, it was kind of shocking how much gun violence their was in this movie, considering when it was made. But what sets Scarface apart from other gangster movies is its influential narrative. The classic gangster narrative thats used in almost every gangster movie i can think of (with the exception of The Godfather) is refined in this movie. A young hood works his way through the ranks to become a big shoot, but the power becomes too much and he eventually falls from power. This is the story of Tony, and Michael Corleone, and Henry Hill, and Tony Montana, and Stringer Bell, and Avon Barksdale, and pretty much any other gangster i can think of. Without this movie, none of those other movies would even exist. 8/10</fullReview>

Woo your boss's girlfriend, boss tries to kill you. Drag your sister into the matter, she'll get into trouble, too. The last scene shows that family should really stick together, and that some ideas that go a long way, but end up failing, should never have been put into action in the first place.

		<shortDescription>Camonte Vs. Montana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i didn't know that Scarface directed by Brian DePalma use this movie as the basis of their story. i started to realize it more into the movie. even though the 1983 version was way more better than this one, this movie had a sort of a feel to it. it had drama, comedy, romance and a little bit of a triller to it. Of course Paul Muni was excellent playing Tony Camonte and so where the other actors. it was executed very well. the camera movement was awesome, the scenes were well taught out and you really didn't expect what was coming which i liked. i love to be surprised and not know what to look for. Now in the present you kind of would suspect that since filmmakers love to use the same template that other filmmakers have laid down for them but to get people going you gotta put in your own twist. like DePalma using this movie for his. this movie was great and i probably would watch it again but not before i watch Tony Montana</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exciting gangster film that pushes the envelope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface is an enthralling film about the gangster culture of the Prohibition era. With the government ban on alcohol the industry goes underground, like every other banned thing in existence, which creates violent mobs of gangsters who look to profit on the governments mistake. It is ironic that the government used this film to propagate the activities of the mob in the opening credits, as the government itself created them with the prohibition of alcohol. One could argue we face this same problem today with Marijuana and other controlled substances.The film is a tail of American greed gone wild. In some ways an inspiration, with a man coming from nothing and climbing the organizational ladder, and in the more obvious way, a shocking display of sheer evil and lack of respect for human life. This film contained a plethora of murder scenes and gun violence, which I'm sure served as an inspiration for future gangster flicks.Paul Muni is magnificent playing the role of the flamboyant, and fearless Tony Camonte and this film's political influence and scenes of violence cannot confirm enough the films historical significance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Much To the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immediately following "Scarface"'s opening credits and before the film even begins, there is a sort of public service announcement pleading for the viewer to stand up against gang crime, which was on the rise at the time the film was released. This disclaimer sets the tone for the rest of the film, but the two don't quite jive. It brought to mind Upton Sinclair's novel "The Jungle" about the mistreatment of immigrant workers, and I asked myself why the filmmakers who worked on "Scarface" couldn't have pushed their anti-gang agenda with a little more subtlety or finesse. That being said, the film is very well made. The cinematography in particular caught my eye. Many shots in the film are long, slow pans that allow the viewer to focus on the actors' performances and the set designs without being too distracting. The sound effects during the action sequences. The film is produced by Howard Hughes, and it seems to embody his reckless, larger-than-life attitude. Overall, it was very entertaining and interesting to see how differently crime was depicted on screen nearly a century ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only was this crime-filled movie fast paced, but so was the dialogue. Every time someone talked, their words felt rushed and at times it was hard to understand what they were saying. The acting however, was phenomenal. Paul Muni was so convincing every time he killed someone. He played the part of an over-protective brother very well also. His conversations with Poppy always left the viewer laughing as well, because he would try to charm her and she would always act unimpressed by what he had to say. For a 90 minute (give or take) film, a lot of action was fit in to this film, always leaving the viewer wondering what would happen next. Overall, the acting was exceptional for this 1932 classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface is a 1932 gangster movie directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni . During the initial movie credits, the viewer is informed that the story is based on true events, primarily the exploits of Al Capone. There is also a plea to the movie viewer to take action, and support the government efforts in the fight against gangsters and the crime-wave. Set in the early 1930's, the movie opens with a long, continuous shot focusing on a group of gangsters conversing after a party. While not overt, the gangsters are stereotyped to be of Italian descent, with 'Big Louie' as the boss. Using shadows rather than the actual appearance of actors, the suspense builds as Louie is followed and eventually murdered after the party. The plot then centers on the rise of Tony Camonte (Muni) to become a crime boss. And while Tony craves the respect of his men and girlfriend, he only holds power through fear and intimidation. The conflict Tony faces throughout the movie is his desire to keep his younger sister free of amoral behavior. In the end, he observes the tragic demise of his sister in her efforts to emulate him, and this eventually leads to his own destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I must say that I am not one for gangster films or movies of this kind. But this one was able to keep my concentration. I was able to follow along with the subplots and relationships of certain characters. Say for instance Tony's relationships with his sister, Poppy, Rinaldo and Angelo. But all of the police, press and mob scenes, not so much. I only caught onto the brief St Valentines Day Massacre reference. But I suppose that what makes this movie good after all. Because even if all of those things weren't for me, it still had things that were. Things that made me care to know what happens to the main characters.For an early sound film, a gangster movie is a good choice. Because a lot of sound effects had to be applied to all the gun scenes, a few of them went on for a long while. So I'm sure it was very impressive for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface: the Shame of a Moralizing Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to assume that Howard Hawks' "Scarface" is a grander film than De Palma's 'flashy' 80's remake, on the simple basis that it's the original one, but let's not jump to such a quick conclusion, several acclaimed masterpieces can be tagged as 'remakes': "The Wizard of Oz", "The Maltese Falcon", "The Ten Commandments", "Ben-Hur" etc which I hope would dismiss the whole 'original superior to remake' argument.Having said that, there is no doubt that Howard Hawks' "Scarface" is a cinematic landmark constituting with "Little Caesar" and "The Public Enemy", the seminal Trinity that defined the gangster genre, probably the most prevalent genre on the long term. Movies that had the gutsy merit to create unforgettable characters who were not the good guys, and that's why the genre was ahead of its time, it paved the way for the most popular cinematic figure: the antihero, from Caesar Enrico 'Rico' Bandallo aka "Little Caesar", to Tom Powers aka "The Public Enemy" and last but not least, Tony Camonte aka "Scarface".Let's face it, none of us like gangsters in real-life, but if we decide to watch a film about them, it's not to follow the slice of life of their victims, but just to 'enjoy' the gangster's lifestyle before reality shows us how nasty and ugly it is. That's what cinema is about: a form of escapism. And gangster movies allow us to explore the darkest sides of humanity: the easy way, temptations, showing how crime does pay for a little. Crime reflects the very idea of "The World is Yours" that drove Tony Camonte's ambition, as if it was better to possess the world for a night than being a schmuck for a lifetime (paraphrasing a famous quote from "The King of Comedy"). And that's why most gangster films follow the pattern set by the early 30's classics: the alluring rise and the disillusioning fall, champagne, cocktails, parties, ladies, some killings in- between, but ultimately, an obligatory comeuppance, and you wouldn't believe how this 'obligatory' adjective is hateful for me. Indeed, no matter how ground-breaking the early gangster classics were, they had to justify that they were not intended to glorify crime but to depict a sad reality that was poisoning society: the birth of organized crime, and its torrents of blood, shootouts, and unfortunate collateral damages. In case the viewers let themselves hypnotized by Robinson, Cagney or Paul Muni's charisma, they had to endure the good old moralizing cops reminding us that a kid died during a shootout, and each shooting is followed by a random woman's shrieking scream. But here is the perversity of the gangster films; people did love Cagney, Muni and Robinson, and I suspect they probably loved Muni, more than anyone, for he gave the most electrifying performance of the three, acting-wise. Yet it was almost ruined by a zealous attempt to obey the Code.In "The Public Enemy", it was the big brother staring at Tom Powers, in "Scarface" but the character was getting more interesting at the end. In fact, "Scarface" suffered the most from the Code, with the police officer hatefully looking at Camonte and holding his suspenders to look tougher. And I'm not comparing the apples of the 30's with the orange of the 70's, you could tell the genre evolved with "Angels with Dirty Faces" when the idea of setting an example was a plot device, not an indirect reference to the viewers, and that worked perfectly, creating the idea of a gangster with redeeming qualities.Which leads me to what I consider the film's biggest flaws, let's say I close my eyes on some embarrassing bits of acting, the mustache cop, the supposedly comic relief "Dope" who wasn't even funny by 30's standards, all the Trinity gangster films had their share of bad acting that fortunately didn't affect the main protagonists. BUT that can't distract from the biggest flaw, which is the characterization: Muni gave a performance that was equal to Pacino, and even at some parts, slightly more memorable. Both characters were embracing the madness of their excessive dreams, money, power, the blonde woman, stuff you can't get by 'saying please'. Now, would you really believe a man like Camonta would crawl like a rat begging for his life at the end? He lost his sister, his best friend, everybody, what meaning could life has anyway at this point. I was glad he tried to escape, at least it meant he was bluffing but it's a sort of childish way to teach us that 'bad is weak' when it's not the case. And don't get me started on Cesca, the sister who quickly forgave the killing of Rinaldo, totally off character, and only died when she realized how a coward he was, what a waste of acting talent. As much as I admire "Scarface", I thought the crawling like a rat was atrociously flirting with moralist propaganda. And that's why I firmly believe that the real maturation of the gangster genre was achieved with the underrated masterpiece "Angels with Dirty Faces".The merit of both "Scarface" was to show the flamboyant appeal of the gangster world and the way an extreme ambition could progressively devour and destroy the soul of its protagonist. Imperial in their rises and Shakespearian in their falls, the two Tony are still ruthless killers, but not without redeeming qualities, it's even ironical that their soft spot cause their demises. And if the remake is criticized for being over the top because it's exactly what the crime world is about, an excess to another, it's about a thug, how he succeeds and how he ends, it's the perfect, the consummate gangster movie, 7 years before "Goodfellas" would be praised for the same reasons. If the film is violent, graphic, and full of profanity but it's as far as the original went, by today's standards, without the corny and moralizing intelligence-insulting ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni plays a character loosely based on Al Capone. The story is dark, the film itself is violent, and gory. I think Al Pacino was a more memorable character and performance but I think this is the better film. Everyone's seen the 1983 version but I bet few even knew it was a remake. Howard Hughes fought long and hard to get his version released with all the unflinching violence attached. The film even begins with a disclaimer against such acts of violence and states that the film is a plea to good men to help clean-up our streets. All-in-all - An incredible movie that in many ways was ahead of its time. Th emotion from the actors towards the end is incredible. An extraordinarily captivating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Classic Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarface" is a great gangster movie and really set the standard for future gangster movies. It was meant to help bring down the crime and gangs that had been occurring in that time and I think that even though you could tell that it was an anti-gangster film it still kind of set up the basis for gangs. People who weren't necessarily fully exposed to gangs during that time received an inside glimpse of what it was like from this movie. And I really think that even though the 1989 "Scarface" is the remake to this classic, I believe movies are great and should be looked at separately because each has great features. The originally has some really great raw characteristics. And the acting was great and once again another round of applause to Paul Muni, not only can he play the good guy but also is a great mobster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow this was some incredibly raw and gritty stuff full of violence, immorality, vice and lust. Incredibly lax in relation to its time period, the only thing missing was vulgar language. Other than that it was all there. I loved the accents, the panama hats, the suits, the machine guns and Paul Muni's somewhat stereotypical portrayal of the Italian mafioso, nevertheless it was some masterful acting, he really got into his character. You can see how influential this film was to the gangster epics in the following decades. This film and others made during the same period are blueprints for what a gangster film ought to be, I enjoyed seeing how it all started out, where it all came from. I liked that the story was real that it didn't necessarily glorify gangster life and riches and that it had a cold tragic ending. It was almost like a documentary as if we were there along with a news crew getting a juicy glimpse into the lives of these men. It was cinematic in a very subtle way at times for me it felt too real which I thought was pretty fascinating. The camera work and shadows were lovely and conveyed an atmosphere that one could get lost in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best gangster film I have ever seen. Everything about it is just great the storyline,plot,music everything. I really liked the parts where it showed the sign saying "The World is Yours". This sign had a huge significance because every time you see it in the movie Tony is at a different stage in his life. The 1st time you see the sign is when he is on the rise to being a mobster, the 2nd time you see it hes on top of the world,a climax in his life and the 3rd time you see it he is dead. I really liked those parts where it showed the sign because it means you make up your life. Meaning every decsision is up to you. I have seen this movie over 10 times and still love it just as much as the first time I saw it. If you haven't seen this movie you really need to stop what your doing right now and watch it. This movie is truly a timeless classic, it never gets old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say "hello" to my 30s friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever someone brings up the movie "Scarface", right away they think of the 1983 Al Pacino version. That movie has become so iconic, and so famous in pop culture with its insane violence and "Say hello to my little friend" line, that people often don't realize that it's a remake of a 1932 gangster movie. It's a shame to, because Howard Hawks' "Scarface" may be the greatest gangster film of the 1930s. Howard Hawks is one of the greatest writers in film history. He had such range, that he could write for various genres and come out so original. He's written sci-fi classics like "The Thing from Another World" (another great movie that gets overshadowed by its remake), comedies like "His Girl Friday" and "Bringing Up Baby", and westerns like "Rio Bravo (which I think is John Wayne's best film). You could just give him a genre, and he would never disappoint. "Scarface" (1932) is definitely one of those classic movies that pushed the boundaries in movie violence. It is pretty tame by today's standards, but if it wasn't for this film, the 80s version wouldn't get to be as violent. This is one of those instances where you can like the 30s version and the 80s version equally. They're both very similar, but also very different. It's actually really cool watching the 80s one, and seeing which parts are original, and which parts were lifted straight from the 30s one. The two films definitely have two different messages they're trying to convey. The 80s version is a dark, bloody version of living the "American dream", whereas the 30s version is about being a rebel and upsetting the establishment. But both films are connected by one thing; the characters hunger for respect and power. Many scenes are pretty graphic for 1932; such as the scene where Paul Muni is going on a cop shooting spree. At first, the film kind of shows how fun it is to be a rebel (doing whatever you want, and getting respect for it), which could maybe influence people to do what Muni does in the film; but of course the film ends showing the price these people pay for choosing a life of crime. The 80s version is good, but the original (I think) is a lot better (and a lot shorter by an hour and 20 minutes). It just broke more ground, and represents the time it was made better. It may not have a "Say hello to my little friend", but this movie doesn't need a single quote to make it classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic gangster flick, but better than remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks' 1932 classic gangster masterpiece was a remarkable film during the 30's - during an era where powerful mob figures had major control of American cities, notably our setting for this film, Chicago. The film, loosely based on Chicago's own leading Mafioso, Al Capone, didn't create the powerful American gangster, it exposed it.Paul Muni shines in this brilliant, anti-gangster narrative, as he portrays our protagonist, Tony Camonte, a ruthless thug who is overtaken by greed and stops at nothing to get what he wants - as his motivation sits atop a buildings billboard reading "The World Is Yours."I really enjoyed this film. My true favorite genre is gangster films, and this did not disappoint. The dark sets create a mysterious and dim mood, and the mobsters' personalities really bring the film to life. But if you were to ask if I thought the original was better than De Palma's 1983 remake? No...Of course, this is the original, so there's only so much more you can say to complement the remake. But being a 50+ year difference in releases, the 1983 version just adds elements that far surpass the limitations Hawks and filmmakers alike were dealing with in the 30s. Muni's depiction of Tony is very well done and enticing to watch, but Pacino's portrayal of Tony (Montana, in the '83 remake) is a legendary performance that has been praised, mocked and parodied ever since its release.Nonetheless, this film is a classic, brilliant gangster flick that I encourage everyone to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off the bat, Scarface told us what the purpose of this movie was. It made it clear that it was sending a political message. Paul Muni played the main character of the movie. When I say main character I don't mean protagonist. It is clear from the beginning that this man is evil. He kills and steal with not a single second thought. That doesn't mean to say the role wasn't well acted. Muni played the character to perfection and actually scared me at times. Poppy, the female lead seemed just as bad as Tony, only more subtle. The movies made it seem like the the police were incompetent, which was probably on purpose, so they could get their point across. One big problem I have is the ending, when a character pulls a complete 180 for no reason at all. I thought the sound was great, but sometimes the action was a little underwhelming.</fullReview>

Also, a surprise was how he cared about others, his ladies especially, if they were threatened it made him weak. He was at the top of his mob, he felt he had the priority of keeping his crew safe. How there was a rivalry between gangs was a clever idea.

		<fullReview>Scarface is probably the film that really made Paul Muni one of my favorite actors. While you might expect someone playing the lead in a gangster film to be tough and intense (Not that his character ISN'T either of those things necessarily, but that's not the while of his character), Muni's character was more goofy and fun and almost childish at times in the beginning, something that brought real attention to the way his character changed throughout the film. Though Muni has a bit of an over-dramatized style of acting, I don't think that came through as much in this film, which really helped the film become a lot more realistic (though there were still a lot of more over-dramatized scenes, something that is obviously unavoidable when working with people who had previously worked in silent films, where you HAD to be over-dramatized). The message of the film is just amazing and the sets are getting a lot more believable, and also the costumes are getting much more complex.Truly an amazing movie. I absolutely loved it. I'd rather watch this than the '83 version any day.</fullReview>

He took a character and made you like him and appreciate him for his brains. And then feel the disgust when you were supposed to. Scarface was a bit tense than I usually like, however I thought it had such a solid story line and was so well put together that I actually really appreciated it. It really sold the idea that the director was trying to get across. Ann Dvorak did a fantastic job as playing Cesca, Tony's sister.

Howard Hawks' story of Tony Camonte is action packed and tragic and well made for it's times. I was a big fan of the films climax where Camonte has nowhere to run so he hides out with his sister, the action plays out nicely.

		<fullReview>This film can be summed up in one word :brilliant. A true epitome of gangster films of it's time and a perfect action film set during the prohibition. The main character, Tony Camonte, played by Paul Muni, is a solid combination of crude, childish, cold-blooded, and quite to the contrary of all of those a bit of a sex symbol. Tony starts off as the second in command to Johnny Lovo but begins to think bigger and deeper than Johnny and rises above him. With no averse to killing anyone, Tony's character is simply chilling to the viewer. As Tony rises to the top he also begins to pursue Lovo's girlfriend, Poppy, plays by Karen Morley. As what is seemed to be typical of a woman involved with gangsters of this time, she shows no interest in Tony until his reputation rises. This film also plays up the time period in American Cinema when sound was a new accessory to film, with a quick and witty dialog and plenty of gun and action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the message aimed at the authorities when Scarface was first released. Even though it has gone down in history as one of the best films of the gangster genre, it was and forever will be a morality tale incorporated into an amoral gangster world where greed, backstabbing and murder is common place. The morality tale within Scarface works alongside the blatant attempts through dialogue to desecrate the gangsters not only in the narrative but in then contemporary America.The amoral protagonist Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) is introduced to us at his most sinister. His silhouette making its way towards its target whilst whistling a tone portrays Tony as a cold hearted figure, his silhouette expressing a vision of terror and mystery. When his face is revealed to us, the cross - shaped scar on his cheek indicates he is the personification of death and danger within the seedy world he inhabits. It is only the beginning of our trip through this world.Yet this trip does not come without its blatant warnings that go unheeded. Thinking he has the upper hand over the police Tony is warned, "You think you'll get there with a gun but you won't, know why? You've got $1,000 bills pasted across your eyes. Some day you'll fall into the gutter". Although we as the audience understand this warning about the greedy lifestyle Tony leads, it is oblivious to him. Instead he lets his desires take control which results in gang conflicts across town, going head to head with his boss Johnny (Osgood Perkins), muscling his way to the affections of Poppy (Karen Morley) and being linked to multiple deaths. Tony's actions throughout Scarface highlights the theme of morality as he has such disregard for it. He just wants to benefit himself as he stated, "I'm gonna write my name all over this town in big letters". The theme is further shown in the conflict between himself and his younger sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak), who is going through life in similar circles to Tony. "Never mind what I do. It's alright", he tells Cesca once again showing disregard for his own actions.Meanwhile the sub plot is the authorities continuing their attempts to punish Tony for his crimes. This results in scenes where the film blatantly conveys their hatred for gangsters. There is a speech by the Chief (Edwin Maxwell) who criticises people for thinking "these bid hoodlums are some sort of demigods". This leads on to a scene of a panel who state their outrage against the strength the gangsters have over law and order. Again these scenes where attempts by the film makers to get the authorities to act tough on gang crime which was running rampant at the time. Eventually as a result of his actions Tony gets his comeuppance which serves not only as a great finale but also as the final statement by the film makers of the gangster lifestyle.Definite till the end, Tony fails to hold off the police resulting in personal tragedy and defeat. Shown cowering down the stairs, asking the police to give him a break before ending his life riddled with bullets in the street. It hits home the grim realities of his lifestyle and shows the irony that the world he craved for so much was never really his. It serves as the final product of what the film makers thought must be done at the time, to serve justice with force.Overall Scarface works perfectly as a morality tale along with its use of motifs. Particularly the use of the symbol X, an auteur touch to forebode death. Paul Muni was well casted as Tony, a character full of arrogance, selfishness, stubbornness and violence. His character had all the right elements to be conveyed as a man you shouldn't respect and nowhere near the romanticised image some people may have thought gangsters to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film, Slightly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a newly declared fan of Paul Muni, I was slightly disappointed with Scarface's blatant "indictment of gang rule in America," as the opening credits describe. Then again, having first seen the 1983 remake starring Al Pacino (and hating it), I may have jumped into this film with a preexisting bias. Paul Muni's performance as Tony Camonte was mostly good, but at times over the top. Also, being a movie that relied heavily on action and violence to make its point, i found some of the scenes involving fights and things of that nature to be poorly coordinated and not quite believable. There were, however, some unique and useful shots in the movie. One in particular that I really liked was a closeup of a calendar overlapped by a machine gun. As the gun blasts its rounds, the calendar pages fly off the wall. I thought this was a really smooth way of jumping ahead in time while easily maintaining the film's tone and themes. My main qualm with Scarface is that the message was too direct; the film didn't make you think at all. Obviously, Scarface is an anti-violence and anti-gang film. The film makers really do a great job of throwing that in the audience's face. A good example of this occurs during a scene which depicts a newspaper editor talking to several people, including police. The editor exclaims something along the lines of "How can you just sit back and watch this happen?" as he looks at someone positioned behind the camera, giving the impression that he is talking directly to the audience. All in all, Scarface is a good story told by good actors, and is worth watching when you don't want to think about anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, Yet Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another one of Paul Muni's films makes it big....Scarface (1932). The famous Paul Muni plays a great performance of gangster Tony Camonte in this brutal flick. Camonte features in the film as a modern mobster, while ironically watching over his younger sister. He is a criminal involved with the prohibition in the 1930s. He sets out to overcome and defeat his boss, Johnny Lovo. He also undermines Johnny and soon takes his girlfriend, Poppy. Scarface is a film of exhilrating violence and dark humor. Although the film features murders and crimes, all of the sinners end up paying the price. This film is packed full of scary scenes and loud shoot outs but it will get your heart pumping and your eyes widened!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this is where one of the most famous movies of all time gets its roots from. When I first heard of this movie I was under the impression there was only one Scarface, the one with Pacino. Having already seen the 1983 version over a dozen times I was eager to see where Pacino got all his passion and fire from to play the character Tony Camonte. Paul Muni played the role perfectly he can act so cool and relaxed when he needs to and so insane and violent the next second. Some of the lines he saids in this movie are classic, I might steal one or two. I could tell this movie was in part a political propaganda film to push for tougher gun control laws but seeing the devastation a tommy gun can do, I cannot blame them. The 1980's version played with an awareness about drugs and violence. It is nice to see the different social problems of an era being portrayed on the big screen. I enjoyed this movie greatly because I knew the plot already and I could see how the characters were fitting to the ones I knew from the 80's version. Somehow knowing what was going to happen and watching it unfold 1930's style was very cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gangster movies of the early 1930s were one of the definitive aspects of the talkie era. Of all the movies made back then (and Hollywood was incredibly prolific for those few years) it's the gangster movies that tend to be remembered the most. There's something in the smart dialogue and easygoing violence that seems to have made a hit with cineastes down the years.While most of those gangster movies were fast-paced and punchy, under the smooth direction of Howard Hawks, Scarface is a languid and quietly menacing affair. Hawks was one of the best architects of tracking shots Hollywood has ever known. His tracking shots weren't obtrusive, so you don't notice the cinematic artifice going on, as Hawks subtly changes the landscape before the camera without changing the shot. There's a great example in the opening scene. We home in on the bunch of mafia guys in the aftermath of a party, festooned with ribbons and suchlike, then follow the boss over to the phone, with an ominous empty corridor dominating half of the screen, then delve into the corridor amid the shadows and overhanging houseplants. In this deceptively simple manoeuvre the image has been smoothly transformed without the jerkiness of a cut.Paul Muni was a brilliant actor in a steady dramatic role, but put him in the stylised world of gangland and he founders badly, descending into an embarrassing bundle of Italian American clichs. James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, while certainly overstated in manner, seemed to slide naturally into their gangster roles. Muni on the other hand looks like he is constantly thinking how to act like a hood. Even George Raft, seen here in one of his earliest roles, though a terrible actor could do a convincing gangster strut if nothing else. Speaking of Raft, you do see here what a disappointingly wooden fella he was, limited strictly to mean posturing. And whose bright idea was it to cast Boris Karloff as a gangster, hmm? But despite these flaws, Scarface's reputation endures thanks to its striking imagery and snappy dialogue. And really, the early gangster movie is probably the one genre that is the most similar today as it was back then. When Scarface was remade in 1983, sure, it turned Tony Camonte into a Cuban and replaced bootleg liquor with cocaine, but the principles of iconic words and iconic killing remains the same. Perhaps the biggest difference is that, though the 1932 movie opens with a token title about condemning organised crime, it actually made the life look enticingly cool. Today's mob movies need pay no such lip service to morality, carrying the gloss of glorification, and yet deep down they genuinely show gangsterism to be depressingly morbid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony's Shadows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film seamed to have a slow beginning and was some what confusing at first. Everyone seamed to be talking really fast and it was kind of hard to follow, but once I got an understanding of the plot it was a little bit easier to follow. What i found kind of interesting about the film was the idea of a shadow symbolizing Tony the main character. I believe the introduction scene was of a shadow shooting another person. This shows the audience that Tony has a very secretive personality and does not like to expose himself. The idea of a shadow was brought up again later on in the film when there were seven men lined up against a wall and Tony shot them at point blank. It gave the scene a sense of strength and power that Tony had over the other men. Lastly I felt that the most interesting scene to me was the scene where the newspaper company was held on trial for exploiting the crimes to the citizens of the towns. The idea that it was considered "informing to the public" in some eyes, and in others just "promotion &amp; a symbol of power" for the bootleggers is a problem I feel most advertisements and information papers come across even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The significance of the 1932 Scarface depicts the idea of a small time gangster becoming greedy and reckless enough to work his way up the ranks and kill off everyone in his way. This was a common thing to happen in prohibition America. The film takes place in prohibition America and that also signifies the greed of the early 20th century. American gangster to bootleg as much alcohol as possible. The story of Tony Camonte was not a true story, but in some ways it definitely described the life of a twentieth century gangster. The end of the movie signifies the irony on what greed can do to a human being, Tony ends up losing everything that he has always wanted, all due to power and greed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Scarface is a classic movie that touched on the crime and gangster life of those in Chicago during the probation. Paul Muni does a good job of acting and versatility after just seeing Runaway Chain Gang. The cinematography wasn't half bad and what was really interesting is how unlike today the shootings scenes then were mainly made up of flash, sound, and smoke. On occasions it was rather funny just to see the shadows get it where as today they depict most shooting scenes with lots of blood and you can see the shell casings and they make it so much more realistic.It contains a very realistic point of view depicting Chicago in the early 1930's during the probation era. Comparing it to the Al Pacino version of the 80's its was the complete basis of the award winning movie. The writing was remarkable for the time and was expanded on in the 80's to make it longer. I say if you want to see where the gangster movies now first originated this is a great film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is such a fantastic actor. His portrayal of the borderline insane Tony Camonte is phenomenal.The filming is great. The streets look dark and terrifying and they make you feel small when looking at them. It's a scare tactic that definitely makes this film memorable. Another memorable bit is when Muni whistles before each kill. It's terrifying to think that when you hear that sound, you'll be dead.This film is the ultimate gangster film, and it shows it by being totally apathetic to human lives. The death count in this film is ridiculous. There are many things in this film that would totally have been banned by the Hayes code if it were done any later. There's rampant sexuality and tons of violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Locus Classicus of American Gangsterdom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American film industry has long had a love-affair with organised crime. Like most love-affairs this one has had its ups and downs; it probably reached its nadir in the sixties, when relatively few gangster films were made, but was rekindled by the huge commercial and critical success of the first two "Godfather" films in the early seventies and has continued, on and off, ever since. The roots of this affair probably lie in the fact that the Prohibition years (1920-33), which gave such a boost to organised crime, coincided with the early years of Hollywood. Had the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act never been passed, this affair might never have been so passionate; in Britain and other countries which never had Prohibition the gangster movie has never attained the same cultural importance as in America, even though the British film industry has occasionally produced excellent examples such as "Brighton Rock" or "Get Carter"."Scarface" from 1932 is one of the best-known of the early gangster films, coming out a year before the end of Prohibition. It is loosely based upon the life of Al Capone, whose nickname was "Scarface" and who is here renamed Tony Camonte. Several other notorious Chicago gangsters appear in fictionalised form; Big Jim Colosimo becomes "Big Louis Costillo", Johnny Torrio "Johnny Lovo", Dion O'Banion "O'Hara" and Bugs Moran "Gaffney". The film tells of Camonte's rise to power in the Chicago underworld. When his original boss Costillo is killed, he transfers his loyalties to Lovo, and it is primarily the ruthlessness of his trusted lieutenant Camonte which enables Lovo to take control of the South Side. (In the film, as in real life, control of the illicit liquor trade in Chicago is divided between the Italian-American gangs of the South Side and the Irish-Americans who run the North Side). Lovo, however, is unwilling to confront the Irish gangs, and this leads to a feud between him and Camonte, who has ambitions to become the undisputed crime boss of the city. There is also a sub-plot about Camonte's sister Cesca and her romance with his friend and hit-man Guino Rinaldo.The film was made before the introduction of the Production Code in 1934; after the Code came into force a film of this nature could not have been made unless the amount of violence was very much reduced. And there is plenty of violence on display here. Like the real-life O'Banion, O'Hara is killed in his florist's shop, and there is an obvious reference to the Valentine's Day Massacre when Camonte orders the killing of several of Gaffney's men. Another detail which would not have pleased the post-1934 Hays Office was the suspiciously close- verging on the incestuous- relationship between Cesca and Camonte, who is pathologically jealous of her affair with Rinaldo.Even before the Code, there were limits to what the film censors would allow. These limits varied from state to state, the New York censors being notoriously strict- but there was a general rule that films should not glorify crime. Ostensibly, "Scarface" fulfils this requirement. It was also known as "The Shame of a Nation", and contains a preface which states that its purpose was to shame the Hoover administration into taking more resolute action against organised crime. Where the film departs from Capone's life story, it generally does so in order to show Camonte in a worse light than his real-life counterpart. In 1932 Capone was serving a prison sentence for tax evasion, the most serious crime which the authorities had been able to pin on him. This was felt to be inadequate retribution for Camonte's crimes, and he dies a coward's death after being shot by the police. (An alternative ending has him being hanged for murder). Camonte ends up killing his mentor Lovo, whereas Capone's mentor Torrio was still alive at the time the film was made.And yet, even though the film observes the letter of the censors' demands, it blithely ignores their spirit. (Perhaps unsurprisingly given that the producer was Howard Hughes, well known for his battles against censorship). "Scarface" does, of course, glorify crime, and this, as much as the amount of violence, might have made it unacceptable in the Hollywood of a slightly later date. (After 1934 director Howard Hawks was to make relatively few crime films- the famous noir "The Big Sleep" being the major exception- but was to make a number of war films and Westerns, genres in which the censors took a rather more relaxed attitude to killings).Paul Muni's Camonte may not be a morally admirable figure, but he is an enormously charismatic one when compared with, say, Osgood Perkins's snivelling, weaselly Lovo. He is one of the cinema's earliest heroic, larger-than-life gangster bosses, the direct ancestor of Don Vito Corleone. "Scarface" is perhaps the film which did the most to establish the popular reputation of 1920s Chicago as (in the words of film historian Thomas Patrick Doherty) "the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommy-gun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages". 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the movie that started a genre, that of guns, action, and gangsters, Scarface doesn't live up to all the hype. While it's understandable to see where others may enjoy the film, sometimes depth is really important. The film did not progress smoothly, and it took about 45 minutes to even kind of plot, if not a weak one at that. Some scenes in the beginning felt pointless, an occurrence that actually takes place in many old films. The dialog in the film was spoken too fast with a lot of content in one line, which made the storyline difficult to follow. Even when the action did pick up, and the picture got somewhat interesting, the viewer is left weary from trying to follow the first half of the film. Yet, the movie is not entirely bad. The actors were good, and the interaction between them seemed genuine. If there is someone at fault for the lack of fluidity in this film, perhaps it's the screenwriter. Scarface is a movie that deserves recognition for being the pioneer in it's genre, and although mistakes were made, it's a movie that should be watched, if only to learn from the past and understand the history of filmography.</fullReview>

The car stunts for the time period were amazing and pulled off very well. I haven't seen the newer version of Scarface I was going to watch it to compare but from the reviews for it I'm not sure that I could sit through it. Grant it this is an old movie but I have learned not to judge them by that. Just because a movie is old doesn't mean that you won't like it.

		<shortDescription>Timeless tale with a call to action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, Muni's portrayal of Tony is superb. Muni, with his acting chops fully on display in this film, is able to ensnare the audience with his seemingly maniacal behavior and at times, funny antics. That being said, this movie raises several interesting questions about life in America during the tumultuous period of prohibition. The first of which is, if this movie was meant to be a call to action so to speak against the violence and tragedy that often goes hand in hand with the mobster lifestyle, then why make it in the first place? It seems almost contradictory that in one scene the police are bemoaning the glorification that these murderous bootleggers receive in the press, but in several other scenes, the film is intentionally funny. Don't get me wrong, the jokes in the film, while few and far between, do go a long way to lightening the spirit of an otherwise dark and sordid tale. It just seems to me, given the opening inter titles that make references to the fact that average citizens must rise up against this sort of radical tyranny of mob rule, the filmmakers would have made it their paramount duty not to include anything that would make the characters likable. While admittedly this would have made for a much less interesting piece of cinema, my opinion remains the same.Secondly,as someone who grew up with Brian DePalma's version of Scarface, it was interesting to see the similarities and differences between the two tales. While DePalma's more contemporary tale of immigration woes and living the American dream is obviously identifiable to many people, I believe that this original version of the film is much better suited to leave a lasting image. While the violence is clearly more understated in the this earlier version of the film, it is this same lack of violence that allows the viewer time to truly think and reflect on what he or she is seeing, as opposed to the bloody spectacular that is arguably Pacino's best work. Lastly, but certainly not least, is the way Muni's character Tony kills Guino simply because he was engaging in a relationship with Tony's sister. This heinous act speaks volumes to the mindset and mentality of someone who lives that sort of lifestyle, and that for me, was a truly spectacular part of the film. It is subtle and almost demure, a quick few shots and Guino is on the floor. However, this scene is arguably the most important in the film because it showcases Tony's complete and utter disregard for human life, or any life for that matter. That, to me, is the endearing message of this film: That no matter what, if you cross one of those people, they can and will kill you without hesitation. If the filmmakers had tried and succeeded at making that fact the "moral" of the film, I think it would have been better. Overall though, the film was superbly shot and scripted, with the hour and half(give or take) run time seeming much shorter. I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in taking a peek into what life was like back in those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Scarface had some good acting and fast paced moments, I found it lacking an interesting plot line, character development, and a protagonist I actually cared about. The plot seemed overly simplistic. It followed the exploits of a ruthless, vicious, gangster, Tony Camonte, as he tried to take over in Prohibition era Chicago.I found Tony Camonte's character to be uninteresting. While Paul Muni portrayed him perfectly, the character seemed one-dimensional and lacking in any qualities that would make me care about him or what happened to him. I did begin to think briefly toward the end that Tony might have some depth as a person when he seemed upset about having killed his sister's new husband. This ended quickly when he allowed his sister to join him in the shoot out with the cops and then reacted to her death by caring only that her death left him all alone, rather than being horrified that he'd caused the unnecessary death of his 18 year old sister.Finally, I had to wonder about the purpose of the movie. It starts with a disclaimer about it being an indictment of crime and calling for reform and ends with a neon sign proclaiming that "The world is yours". But between the beginning and the end, there's non-stop gang violence. I wondered if it was a movie shot to entertain or to advocate social reform. Maybe this was a just a reflection of the times in which the movie was made, but I found it odd and distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muni does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface was a great movie, but Muni was even better. Just like "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," Muni again captivates the audience thru his superb acting and emotion. However, unlike Fugitive where Muni made me feel for his character, Muni made me dislike Tony, his character in Scarface as he was a backstabbing friend and murderer. This was his character and Muni was good at portraying him and good at making me dislike him. It's amazing to see Muni in two opposite roles as Scarface and Fugitive.Scarface surprised me. I did not think that for such an early movie that much violence and sensuality would be shown. This was before the code though, so every gun shot and death seemed to be caught on film, and the sensuality between Muni and his lover seemed to cross the boundaries for the time. Speaking of killing, there was a lot of it, and it seemed to be done with one "Tommy gun" and with one magazine, that never seemed to leave a trace of blood.Scarface is the original gangster movie, and should be considered the father of all gangster movies. Every gangster movie is pretty much the same, just a bunch of killing for a struggle of power, but Scarface did it first and did so brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was enjoyable, but for me contained many highs and lows. It is the story of the rise to power of a brutal gangster Tony Camonte. Tony is a ruthless murdering thug in Chicago during prohibition. He is the enforcer for crime boss Johnny Lovo, and is always pushing the limits. His violent ways spark Gang Wars that continually add to his wealth and power. As the film develops Tony makes too many moves, and puts a bulls- eye on himself that is just too large to miss. Tony meets a bitter, sad end, after alienating and destroying everything he loved on his relentless path to the top. While the story is enjoyable, at times it felt overdone. The plot was very predictable, and the actors seemed to brood, and overact at times. The pace of the film was continually switching from a dead stop to full speed, and I feel it detracted from the overall quality. It lacked flow for me. George Raft, and Paul Muni turned in excellent performances, and the story was a memorable one, that I feel could have delivered much more. I feel it was a 10 star story with some excellent actors that ultimately fell short of its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I really want to know what the point of this movie is. Is it to show that gang life is tough? Or is it to show that Tony Camonte is just a big jerk? Throughout the whole movie he is over stepping his boundaries in his mom and sister's life, is constantly trying to overthrow the boss in terms of his job and his girlfriend, and not to mention, start an all out gang war with the Irish. I'm honestly not surprised, or angry for that matter when he dies, because he totally deserved it. But, aside from the movie's plot line seeming completely absurd to me, the second half of the movie did begin to shake things up and catch my attention. The actors all did pretty well, my particular favorite being Tony's secretary. He was the comic relief character. There's moments in this movie with a lot of action and gangster violence, but altogether I thought it kind of dragged along for most of it, and Tony Camonte just frustrates me with every thing he does. No one can connect to this story or any characters (since they're all basically criminals),and there are some entertaining moments here and there but it seems so pointless to me. I guess you could watch this if you're a Paul Muni fan, but I personally would not care to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scarface" shows just how far pre-code movies can go to tell a story. The tale of an underdog's rise and fall makes for a great film. Different shadows and lighting work for each scene appropriately, and the scenes with the mobsters give a sense of how deep the city is in crime. Best of all, there's a scene where Boris Karloff is bowling. I think if he was wearing his "Frankenstein" monster costume that he wore a year ago, that would have been one of the greatest movie moments in the history of cinema. The reveal of Muni's character, Tony Camonte, was pretty neat. At first, you don't pay much attention to the guy under the towel in the barber's chair (which reminds me of the barber shop scene Muni played as James Allen in the movie "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"), but as soon as the towel comes off, you know there's more to this character than just a murderer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might creak with age a little with some rolling-eyes acting and and all but this early Howard Hawks gangster movie still packs a punch and I for one much prefer it to De Palma's trigger-happy gorefest from the 80's. Its historical proximity to the events depicted, right down to the recreation of the St Valentine's Day Massacre and barely concealed depiction of then crime-lord Al Capone in Paul Muni's title character give a real frisson to the piece and took a lot of guts - get a load of that crusading legend before the first reel. Hawks hadn't quite mastered pacing at this stage in his directorial evolution with some turgid scenes holding up the action but considering it was only a few short years since the birth of the talkies, allowances have to be made. Famously, Muni's Tony Camonte character's crossed scarface motif is everywhere the violence is, a brilliantly original device for the time. The actual violence is rarely "in your face" direct, no doubt a sop to the censor of the day, but this only serves to encourage and indeed stimulate Hawks' creativity in depicting the actual death scenes. The acting, as indicated, is mixed in quality, but there's no denying Muni's domination of the picture in the rampaging central role. It's a gift for any actor and he grabs it with both hands. George Raft looks tiny but is effective as Guino, his right hand man who makes the foolish mistaken of falling for his boss's sister while the two women in the lead parts, Karen Morley as anyone's moll Poppy and Anne Dvorak as his rebellious sister both act with spirit. Boris Karloff however demonstrates clearly why he soon after moved into the field of wordless monsters with a supremely stilted performance as a rival hood. There's some pretty low comedy however surrounding the dumb secretary Camonte employs and a weak running gag about his telephonist skills right up to his last breath. I thought there was better acting among the police than the villains in general, Muni and Raft apart. I'm surprised Hawks himself didn't remake this himself as he did a number of his other hit movies but this is still a great piece of cinematic entertainment which at the same time dares to hold up a mirror to society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the earlier mob films that would lead too many more films and television shows about the mob. When this film was made, the mob was an over powering force in the Unites States. The introduction tells the story. It challenges viewers saying this was the normal in society and asked what you would do to change that.Paul Muni in the lead and George Raft head an impressive cast. The film has plenty of action and quite a bit of script. The special effects, while impressive for the time, today seem a bit over the top. Still, the drama does unfold quite well. While the early sequences and character studies have some depth, today's viewer would find the sequences as being choppy at points and the continuity is choppy at points.Still, when this was made, historically, it was an important film because of the issue. It would be many years before the mob problem in the United States would be confronted. While this does not have the kind of stuff some of the later films about the mob, Muni &amp; Raft do bring this off pretty well.</fullReview>

After this film, it is now my favorite.The main character Antonio 'Tony' Camonte (played by Paul Muni) was a very evil,violent man but his charm and sharp wits made him the hero of the film.Tony starts the film underprivileged immigrant and works his way to the top of the mountain only to fall off a cliff at the top.

		<shortDescription>Hard not to compare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many others in my generation, we were brought up on Pacino's Scarface, and it's hard not to escape all the posters, t-shirts, and one-liners such as "say hello to my little friend" and not compare the two movies. The similarities were obvious as in the phone call after the hit attempt, the sister, etc... However, in Pacino's version, the movie itself was a lot longer and had time to develop the relationship of his best friend, his sister, and even his mother, but in Muni's version, the relationship with his sister seemed a miniscule side piece that just took away the from the main story of violence and corruption. His sister's role almost came away as forced and only a filler, but somehow transformed into a major issue at the end. I said it before, and I'll say it again... not a fan of Paul Muni. His accent was horrendous throughout the movie, and instead of underacting certain reactions as he did in the chain gang movie, he completely overacted in this one. I was impressed with the level of violence for a movie of this time period and was sure it shocked a lot of viewers. If you add blood splatter and explosions to car crashes and you could insert into our time period haha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original version of Scarface was one of the best early talkies! In my opinion it the first realistic depiction of organized crime in America. The underlying message was clearly anti-crime but it did not interfere with the entertainment value. The main character, Tony Camonte(Paul Muni), was very real in that he was not made to sound like an educated man and he definitely looked like a war battered street thug. Muni was an excellent choice for the lead in this film and I look forward to watching more of his work. The plot of the movie was extremely modern for its time. I was amazed at the extreme violence and sexual innuendo in a movie this early. I have to admit I liked the later version better simply because it was more flashy but this is a very excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this movie a two thumbs up! For it's time, I think this movie was incredible. It was action-packed and full of excitement, and I was shocked to find such limited censorship throughout. This movie is significant because it is ahead of it's time. Although it isn't the most gory or bloody film, there is an undeniable amount of violence. The use of close-up shots was interesting and effective as well as the use of various moments of humor. For example, the man who played Muni's secretary but couldn't read or write - definitely a good chuckle! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in gangster films, action and excitement. I also recommend this movie to anyone who's not particularly interested in gangster films. Coming from someone who has yet to see the newest remake, I can honestly say it'll be worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think this movie was great for its time had a lot of action and drama to it. It showed Paul Muni's character tony to be a violent animal. In the beginning you see him being a normal hit-man for the mob getting paid small amounts. He wanted to be bigger and tougher then all the other men. You slowly see him move up to the top of the ranks and become a boss with his fancy clothes his expensive car and his new apartment. ITs showing he has got it all,but he takes to much controls of his sisters life i thought that was kinda cool because he is living this life of crime and destruction, but he wants to keep his sister pure and happy. I think this movie was great to show people because it shows that you can have all the money and power but still be brought down to justice if you are doing the unjust. I can see why the Al Pacino film was such a success being based off of this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the way light was used in this film. I thought it was very clever to incorporate the use of shadows to represent scenes of violence. I also liked the way the light was played off of all the smoke making it thicker and also more visible in scenes. Showing the smoke created a sense of "thicker" air which intensified all the scenes it was present in, whether as the smoke from a cigarette, cigar, or from a gun.Another interesting part of the production was the use of whistling to foreshadow darker scenes that involved murder. The scene I most enjoyed was when the police shot Tony's sister through the windows because it confirmed my expectations, which satisfied me as an audience member.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Much A Classic as It's Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I had seem this movie, I had only seen the 1982 Al Pacino version of "Scarface." I knew both movies were based on the life of Al Capone, and that they were similar in that sense, I just did not know how similar they would be. Paul Muni's acting is just as passionate as Pacino's. Both actor's actually seem to become the movie's embodiment of Al Capone. What was really interesting about this version, however, seemed to be the lack of plot. Ever though the movie was more of a time-line of events as opposed to a definite plot and series of actions leading into a domino effect (reminiscent of Martin Scorsesse's "Goodfellas") I found myself completely engrossed within this movie. One of the most notable effects was the sound effects within this movie. The use of sound was executed beautifully to make the audience have more of a connection to the scene and to the characters themselves. The gunshots were spontaneous and make the audience jump with fear, and the car chases make the audience's heart race just as fast as Tony's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action-wise, this movie was 60 years ahead of its time, at least in terms of the amount of violence in it. I think it's safe to say most classic films, including the crime movies, are much slower in pace than today's fare. Sometimes that's better, sometimes it isn't. This movie is action-packed with few lulls and it's fun because of it, in this case. Paul Muni, as "Tony Camonte" the head gangster, is compelling and fun to watch. He's tough until the end. The main women in here - Ann Dvoark and Karen Morely - are interesting too. One fantastic shot lasting about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, giving us a prologue of much that's to come: the casual brutality of the whistling murderer, the lust for the good life, the impossibility of letting anybody else have a part of the fortune. That was my favorite shot of the whole movie because it set up what was to come in the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1932 film Scarface is directed by Howard Hawks. I have recently view it. It was an alright film, not one that I would highly recommend to a friend. Paul Muni is the lead actor playing the role of Tony Camonte. Paul is an incredible actor; he does a good job in the film playing a serious ganger role. I wasn't impressed with the overall quality of the film. It was in black and white. It has sound, but I thought the quality of it wasn't that good. Also, when a gun was fired in some scenes I felt the shots were not believable enough. You could tell there were not firing off that it was just the sounds. The plot was alright. It was interesting to see the way they shot some of the scenes. They were many long scenes with little to no editing, it has no brakes it runs real smooth. For example, in the very start of the film. The camera starts at one point the moves though a scene without stopping. It does this for about the first four minutes of the film. The actors in this film had to remember their long and actor perfectly so the scene could be shots without any editing. That requires a lot of talent and practice. I enjoyed seeing how director used different techniques to shoot films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is very violent. For example, the machine guns were used to kill a lot of people. There were many guns almost every scene. In addition, the bad people stayed together to be the big gang that made them very strong ,and they could do everything that they want. Each times to kill people had no reason ,so it was very challenge to polices to capture them. The most cruel scene is the scene that people stood in line against the wall ,and they killed them all by using the machine gun. However, I thought this scene was different from the normal because there was no blood. It would be more real and get the emotion of the audience if there was a lot of blood spreading on the wall. Besides, another scene that I like is when Tony knew that his friend wanted to kill him ,and he went to see his friend and tried to prove by whistling to put a pressure. Finally, I was quite disappointed in the last scene because I imagined that it should have had the big battle between the Tony's gang and the polices.</fullReview>

He plays a man who's on top of the world just as well as he plays a man who's been kicked to the curb by society (I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang). Even by todays standards, this film is incredibly violent, and that's after it went though multiple re-cuts. But unlike many of todays films, the violence isn't for entertainment alone. Director Howard Hawks uses the violence in an educational way, to promote the message that everything is not always as it seems. Although the film is almost 80 years old, it's message still holds true.</fullReview>

Also, the whistle before Tony killed someone helped make the movie a little more suspenseful. Tony was very overprotective of his sister to the point where he killed the person she loved. Towards the end of the movie his sister has the intentions of killing him but decides not to when they both notice the cops are there. His sister ends up getting shot and dies. This is a very powerful scene because its shows that even though he is a killer he still loves his family. Also, when the cops come to get him he asks them not to shoot.

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of gangster movies and seeing one of the originals shows how entertaining they were in the 1930's. This one is much different from the Al Pacino remake, being that it is located in Chicago and is based on Al Capone. Scarface was way ahead of its time and Paul Muni gives a great performance as Tony, one of the original gangsters. The use of guns in the film is the most remarkable thing, because guns weren't used much in early films and they couldn't be used in later films. When Tony is eating at the restaurant and shots start firing you believe that he is going to be killed because he isn't expecting them. If you are a fan of todays gangster films I recommend you seeing this one, it will make you see were the remake came from.</fullReview>

Although the audience knew that Tony was a mass murder you couldn't help, but feel like he was the man right from the beginning. Tony's jealousy and overly protective instincts with his sister was over the top, but those moments were probably some of the most intense. Ironicly Tony was losing everything around him, he had lost his mother in a sense once he had chosen his lifestyle, then his friends, followed by his secretary and sister. Despite all the loss he died still feeling that the world was his. Wardrobe and make up was done beautifully for the women. They looked like dolls from the time. On the down side, music could of helped the suspense in a few scenes, such as the scene at the bowling place. However, the whistling did just that when it came to the beginning murder, John's murder and his sister's lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Rich Or Die Rapping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's amazing about the original "Scarface" is not how dated and quaint it is, but how little modern gangster movies have broken away from its mould. Aside from attitudes toward sex, swearing and violence relaxing, there's nothing thematically to separate, say, "Goodfellas" or "New Jack City", from Hawks' film.What's most interesting, though, is the way De Palma's remake has so ingrained itself with hip-hop culture. Part of the appeal of De Palma's "Scarface" was the way it shamelessly played games with materialism. You may wear expensive shoes, clothes and designer labels, but who you are at your core never changes. You may look like a million dollars, but you're still dirt from the streets, some impossible to lose "it" always defining you as forever lacking class.The irony is that current hip-hop and gangster rap artists actually celebrate this. "You can take the thug out of the socio-economic context, but you can't take the socio-economic context out of the f**king thug!", they proclaim, proudly displaying their coarse edges and ghetto defined presence like peacocks on cocaine. Rather than hide their roots, they broadcast it with Tony Montana like shamelessness. "You don't like who I am? F**K YOU! MY BALLS TOO BIG TOO CARE!" Like De Palma's film, Hip Hop/gangster rap found a way to transcend its contradictions by ignoring them with "Scarface" like brazenness. These artists throw huge wads of money at the screen, surrounding themselves with hordes of half naked women and the most expensive cars. Commentary on the ghetto, racism and economic impotence gives way to a crude mimicking of white society, Donald Trump kitsch meets the Hugh Hefner playboy image meets hardcore porn meets Lehman Brothers corruption meets video game hyper-reality. "You don't like it? F**K YOU! I BURY THOSE COCKROACHES!"Imagine an MTV parody: "I'm Tony Montana and DIS IZ MAH CRIB!". It sounds odd, but that's how these guys behave, inviting the camera into their massive homes, displaying their money, their toys, their gold teeth, before reminding us that they came from the "streets". They got dead cousins, arrest warrants and bullet holes in their ass. "POLICE CAN'T CATCH ME. I TONY MONTANA! LOOK AT DA PELICAN FLY!"They started with 50 cents but now they got prestige in the form of car rims, gold chains and expensive boats. You don't like it? F*CK YOU! YOU WANNA GO TO WAR? I TAKE YOU TO WAR!Hip Hop and gangster rap had become a vessel for arrogant opulence, a way for people who had grown up with nothing to show off their hard earned wares. Influenced by cinema's glossy gangsters, they turned themselves into walking billboards for expensive European clothing companies and broadcasted their tacky class at every turn. The funny thing is, most of these rappers from the "bling era" wound up bankrupt and broke, forgetting to pay mortgages, taxes and incurring unbelievable debts. Say hello to my little eviction notice.7.5/10 ? An influential film, though it hasn't aged as well as Hawks' "The Big Sleep".</fullReview>

That is, until someone happens to tell me that Paul Muni is the lead role. Muni is very talented, yet under-rated. The verisimilitude in this movie is strikingly real. If you happened to see the movie in Chicago (your grandparents, rather) you'd wonder if you're looking at a screen or just a very large window. The use of lighting is also striking. The grisly feel to the set really helps you understand the dark tone to the film. The score also helped enhance the atmosphere. I'd recommend this film to anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the greatest movies to ever develop in the 1930's, in my view, has to be scarface. Paul Muni is excellent from beginning to end and doesn't hold back at any point. Antonio 'Tony' Camonte is the kind of guy that won't take orders from anyone. He's his own boss that will stop at nothing to get the job done no matter the situation and how many people he has to kill. there's no stopping tony as he gets rid of the top boss and starts running the business his way. but there are always side complications as his sister Francesca 'Cesca' Camonte, played by Ann Dvorak, marries tonys main sidekick and good friend Guino Rinaldo (George Raft). When tony finds out about them two, he does the unthinkable and murders guino. from there, things start to go down hill for tony and is eventually left all alone fighting for his life and is then shot. anybody watching this movie will agree that there is nothing but thrilling from start to finish with a great plot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1932 version of Scarface is a forgotten film. Movie buffs will be quick to give it credit for being the best pre-code Hollywood gangster film and while that can be argued, it doesn't hold up as well for modern audiences. Dialog is muffled, pacing is slow and character development is non-existent. When today's viewer is likely to have seen 1983's remake along with 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' it's difficult to give this original as much credit as it likely deserves. Overall my impression of Scarface, the original, is that it's an interesting tale that helped created a genre that is as popular today as it was then. Repeated views will likely be needed on my end to hone in my true feelings because on multiple occasions I found myself being unsure of what was being said and only determined it through context or a few key words here and there that were more clearly spoken. The violence did not phase me, but I appreciated the subtle nature of some of the scenes, allowing my imagination to fill in the blanks. Any fan of the remake and/or the genre should take the time to watch this early 30's gangster film. As a stand alone story it may not be all that impressive, but when you take the time to consider the culture in which it was created and the issues that were important it's impressive that it was able to get made at all. And without it, we may not have some of the masterpieces that clearly followed in its footsteps.Read my complete review (w/ possible spoilers) at CD1083.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over The Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. Of the three pre-Code gangster classics, this one is the weakest. That's mainly because Muni can't summon the piercing menace of a Cagney or a Robinson in the central role, (Public Enemy {1931}; Little Caesar {1930}, respectively. And that's the case despite Muni's heavy- handed bluster. It's like the actor is afraid he can't compete with all the Tommy gun splatter unless he amps up behavior to fuse-blowing level. Unfortunately, his gang leader Tony is over the top without even a hint of needed nuance. At the same time, much of the film's pervasive violence approaches the cartoonish, especially the drive-by's that splatter everything but people. And catch the splatter between the side-by-side cars that incredibly miss even the driver. Now, I'm willing to suspend disbelief in the interests of movie-making, but not when my nose is rubbed in it. To me, these two prominent features undercut the film's status, classic or no. There are positives, however. Dvorak (Cesca) delivers an ace performance as Tony's (Muni) beleaguered sister. Her range of nuance, unlike Muni, is impressive. Plus I certainly didn't see Cesca's sudden turnaround coming. That turnaround suggests a character complexity that deepens the story, but is too tricky even for a 1933 movie to explore. Then too, the not-so- subtle theme of incestuous attraction is a daring one and remains perhaps the film's most distinguishing feature. Raft too registers as the quietly sinister Rinaldo. Too bad he doesn't get more screen time since he could furnish the menace so lacking in Tony. Frankly, I didn't spot any of director Hawks' trademark stylings. Likely, it's still too early in his career, but he does keep things moving.Anyway, except for the incest angle, the plot's become a pretty familiar one of a gangster's rise and fall. I know my general opinion is a minority one, particularly about Muni's turn, but I don't want to risk conflating loud talk with good acting, regardless of reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true gangster film down to the very core. This film was so masterfully put together in every aspect from the placement of the lines to the scene work to the very plot itself.Starting out as a sort of rags to riches tale this story tells the tale of a man who took his life and through illegal means propelled himself to the top of the metaphoric food chain and ended up having to face the consequences.The acting in this film alone makes it worth a watch. At times you'll forget your watching a movie and become totally immersed in the plot and characters, which to me is what a good movie should be all about.The almost constant sound of violence sets a very tense mood for the film and truly reflects the tense state of a bootlegger in the Prohibition years. You can almost feel the intense stress that Tony feels knowing that at any given time he could be shaken down and destroyed.Along with the awesome scene work the depth of emotion in this movie is quite palpable. Tony's care for his sister is evident through the whole film and this care eventually leads to his downfall. I think this represents the good that is still left in his heart leading to his failure in the cold hearted world of alcohol running.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling American gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface directed by Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson is an American gangster story during prohibition. The film follows an ambitious mob member in Chicago, named Tony (Paul Muni) and his rise to power after the killing of a former mob leader. Throughout the film Tony begins to change due to the money, power, and corruption associated with being a prominent bootlegger. Although he starts to lose his mind you can still see he means well when he is constantly protecting his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak). Paul Muni does a spectacular job throughout the entire film and really sells the intenseness of situations encountered. The lighting did a very good job of giving certain shots and scenes a certain mood depending on the action happening in the shot. For example, most of the time the on screen action was very serious, or sad, the lighting would create deep, dark shadows. This brought a real sullen feeling to the shots and contributed greatly to the overall scene. One memorable scene in the movie was the scene where there are 7 men lined up against the wall and all the camera shows is their shadows. The men are executed by a firing squad, bullets spray onto the wall, and the men drop to the ground. This extremely graphic scene made it so people could get a close look at how horrible the things happening were during this time. Very exciting and well-made film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie Paul Muni does an excellent job he plays a very cool suave guy but still you can feel that he is always on the verge of snapping going into crazy killer mod. this was well written and produced really gave you a look into the gang life and how the shift of power rules this world of crime. one moment that really caught my attention was how they showed the passage of time. A calender and a machine gun very similar with the example of time passage in "I am a fugitive on a chain gang". even though he was crazy and blood thirsty he was also brilliant with his ideas in his personal safety. and at the end you really feel his panic as he is under attack by the cops and then the lost of his sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has always been one of my favorite movies! This is the gangster movie that paved the way for any gangster film. Further more since the film was made in 1932, it has the gangster vibe already with the classic looking cities, closes, etc. Paul Muni was a great actor to play Tony. He really knew how to completely become his character and it shows on screen. The look that he got every time tony was about to kill someone was so creepy almost like he liked it. The way he walked and talked you could tell in his voice that he was power hungry. Over all this movie showed lots major things for being filmed in 1932. For example the panning of the camera to show the drive by shooting scenes or the when you just see the shadow of tony shooting someone. Again this is a great classic movie that everyone should watch and I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime Movie with a Spot of Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of the movies of the time, this one has an overt message that is described in the first few minutes. I found a portion of the message in this movie to be particularly pertinent. Paraphrased, it was that you (the viewer) are aware of problems in the world today and what are you going to do about them; relying on "the government" to fix the problems is not enough because you are the government. That same message was later repeated by an official (the mayor?) in an in-movie speech.The use of a shadow hit man was interesting and his whistling was an effective method to uncloak his identity. Scarface's "secretary" was slightly incongruous to the rest of the movie, but very amusing ? especially the scene where he was trying to talk on the phone over the machine gun fire.To me, this movie seems almost like a really accurate modern remake (down to Cesca's playing "Wreck of the Old 97" on her apartment piano) instead of an original version. It was interesting enough to hold my attention even though I don't generally care for this movie genre. The acting, camera work, and sound were not ground breaking, but they were effective and did not clash with the feeling of immersion engendered by the multi-stranded storyline, though the ending was a bit unimpressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks's "Scarface"is easily the most entertaining studio era film that I've ever seen. Paul Muni's performance is equal parts chilling and intoxicating, and definitely lent to the believability of the whole film. The visuals were also essential in creating the suspenseful atmosphere of the film; particularly concerning it's use of shadows. Rather than show actual gore and carnage, the film allows for our imagination to run free, as most of the brutal deaths are somehow concealed or suggested by shadows. For instance, in one especially gruesome scene seven men are murdered, and you can see their bodies fall like dominoes, one after the other. The horrifying effect of this scene is just as, if not more effective than it might have been with more obvious gore. I also thought that the camera movements were really interesting, and often strikingly poignant. such was the case in the incredible final scene. The camera drifting from Tony's body, past the mob of screaming cops and civilians, up to the "The World Is Yours" billboard; that's a whole lot of irony for only 15 seconds of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for it's Time and Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When movies have been made in the early 1900's, they often had a lot to do with parodies, but not this one; This one is an example of crime organizations in US during the 30's (or in this case, the Great Depression), where people already had problems with the economy and the rise of crime have just begun. Interestingly, Paul Muni takes the part as if it was who he true was, shooting the people he had to shoot and acting as though he was tough. The film itself helped bring the idea of intense action and suspense to the big picture and many people will find that this movie is just as good as the movies that exist in these times, regardless of the large time span and they will also find Paul Muni's acting brilliant. Watching you be a good experience, having it as your own is even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World is Yours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Get outta my way, Johnny, I'm gonna spit!" "Scarface" is a film that moves like a hurricane: swift, merciless, and brutal. Driven by Paul Muni's maniacal performance and Howard Hawk's keen and concise direction, the film, while often preachy and melodramatic, still holds up today, offering quite a wallop.The film is not subtle in its purpose: to expose gangsters for the dangerously immoral criminals they truly are. I can imagine audiences at the time racing home and locking their doors after having witnessed all the on screen chaos and violence the film unabashedly emphasizes.Of course, the highlight of the film is Muni's madhouse portrayal of a man out of balance, chewing up the scenery and spitting it out. His wild eyes, slimy grin, and mocking one-liners make "Tony" one of the most repulsive, and yet somehow likable characters in film history - perhaps it is because while Tony may be vicious, it is only because he is not very clever, like two fists swinging in every direction. Nonetheless, it is an iconic performance.Overall, while the film does have its flaws and some elements have aged better than others, it is still quite a rousing and jolting piece of old fashioned entertainment - one to please any fan of the shoot'em-up genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? There's so much praise this movie deserves!I was unaware of the fact that the 'Scarface' movie with Al Pacino that most of us have seen is actually a remake of this 1932 stunner. The stories are just about identical with only changes being names, setting, time period, and drug of choice. Both films are centered around what was the big thing at the time: Illegal Alcohol during the '30s and Cocaine flowing into Miami during the '70s and '80s. This biggest difference between the movies that strikes me the most? The original film didn't have the luxury of color, advanced editing and sound techniques, more developed acting and picture quality, so what it lacked with flashy effects it made up for with pure story. It was genius! The modern version of Scarface simply took an incredible tale and made more dramatic and flashy, holly wood style. Paul Muni has become one of my favorite actors ever after seeing this movie, he portrays the character flawlessly. I believe if he had been the one in the 1983 film he would have put on a better show than Al Pacino! And i love Pacino as an actor. While many of the camera techniques and editing was primitive compared to what we are used to seeing today, this movie still entertains and had me still guessing what was going to happen even though I had seen the remake that many people I'm sure think is an original! Excellent movie in every aspect, I cannot begin to describe all the things that make it interesting. If you liked Al Pacino's 'Scarface' you will love Paul Munis' even more. I can't explain it's greatness. Go see it. NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect mix of crazy and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Scarface is now officially my favorite gangster movie of all time. Paul Muni's acting is superb and he really captures the image of the sociopathic mass murderer known as Scarface. The first scene that really showed me that Muni's performance was going to be stellar is when he strikes his match on the detective's badge while they're in the barber shop. The other actor who I think excelled is the man who played Tony's secretary. The secretary was a great source of just enough comedy; his performance lightens the mood just a little without taking away from the dark murderous feeling of the film. Right before the murder of Boris Karloff's character, Tony is talking about a play about a disillusioned women which I believe is supposed to be him referring to himself. That he's disillusioned about being king of the world and being unstoppable.In the end Scarface chooses to be killed by the police by running into the road and being mowed down. In the end he acts as a cowered and takes his own life because he cannot have everything he wants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WORLD IS YOURSThe rise and fall of a cocky, confident Latino hood from poverty to tailored suits and finer living who uses guns and violence to get to the top as the #1 Chicago gangster only to come apart because of his unstable protectiveness over a sister he wants no man to go near. Paul Muni really loses himself into the role of Tony Camonte, only concerned with taking whatever he wants, starting as a "body guard" for one kingpin he shoots (his whistle, a signature before he plans to murder someone, in this scene, along with his shadowy silhouette on the wall, is iconic), joining up with another he considers a bit cowardly because Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins) isn't keen on moving in on the North side of Chicago, an area ran by another mobster named Gaffney (Boris Karloff).Booze is the profitable product coveted by gangs who want to monopolize the industry in Chicago. Camonte sees the North side as easy pickens despite Lovo's reservations. When Camonte starts using Lovo's thugs on a violent rampage, shooting anyone who stands in their way, including destroying property (it is well established that children are even caught in the middle, bellies full of hot lead), it isn't long before Gaffney runs out of men to protect him (resulting in a tragic fate inside a bowling alley).Howard Hawks' masterpiece hits the ground running, and has a pace that never lags, with a cast that sinks their teeth into the parts, lots of memorable faces and colorful characters who I think inspired the Dick Tracy comic strip. The noirish look of the movie, how the streets are ominous and imposing, dark and foreboding, gave birth to a whole genre of classic cinema. Muni's dangerous, take-no-prisoners, volatile mobster would be a precursor to James Cagney who took this kind of character and made it his own. I must say that the violence even surprised me, particularly for a 1932 picture, how so many people are laid to waste by machine guns or shot dead in close range. Buildings are riddled with bullets and Muni's scar-faced gangster seems immune to how devastating his actions are to the public at large. The scenes with Muni and Dvorak (what a woman! She just dominates her scenes) are quite eyepopping and less-than-subtle regarding the incestuous feelings Demonte obviously has for sis. Cannot forget George Raft?and his memorable coin-flipping signature?as Demonte's right hand man, Guino Rinaldo, one cool customer with a level-headedness his pal is in short supply of. The movie's message, about controlling the crime populating the streets of the city, is laid on thick, but has relevance, even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands out among many pre-code gangster films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More violent and raw than any of the crime films of its period, "Scarface" stands out as one of the greatest gangster films of the pre-code era, and of all time. Paul Muni's portrayal of a mean, nasty, and imposing boss is captivating, and Director Howard Hawks not only crosses lines that other gangster films had not crossed, but he includes clever and entertaining symbolism, such as the X to symbolize death. The film had trouble passing the censors as it was seen as glorifying the gangster lifestyle and too violent. Several scenes had to be added or changed to give the film a more condemning feel, including adding the subtitle "The Shame of a Nation." This film with its unapologetic portrayal of the gangster lifestyle, is directly responsible, more so than almost every other film, for the implementation of the Hays Code a couple years after its release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is "Scarface" in this 1932 film, beautifully directed by Howard Hawks and Robert Rossen, with a screenplay by Ben Hecht. The film also stars George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Karen Morley, Osgood Perkins (Tony's dad), and Boris Karloff (as an Irish gangster and there is NO mistaking that face).Muni looks eerily like James Franco as Tony Camonte, a gangster with a screw loose who moves in on territories and another man's woman, quickly rising to the top, killing as he goes. I didn't see the remake which I'm sure is way too violent and graphic for me - this Scarface is violent but not particularly graphic by today's standards. Personally, I prefer films where viewers have to use their imaginations once in a while.This was a very daring film for its time. It's precode, so we see Poppy (Karen Morley) shacking up with Johnny Lovo, Tony, and possibly Rinaldo (Raft). We also see Tony's not so subtle incestuous love for his sister (Ann Dvorak). Dvorak looks amazing in the early Joan Crawford hair and makeup - she sparkles in the role of a confused young woman looking for love in all the wrong places, no doubt to get away from Tony.Dark and disturbing, the most striking thing about Scarface is what goes on during the silences. The best scene takes place in Johnny Lovo's office. Tony believes that Johnny set him up to be killed. He escapes and, with Rinaldo, goes to see Johnny. Johnny knows that he knows. The tension with just the silence in the room is unbelievable. Sheer brilliance.Paul Muni was an actor from the Jewish theater. He created his characters from the outside in, and, as was the style of the day, he was given to a certain amount of melodrama in his performances. Here he is a total thug -- and, unlike Cagney and Bogart, very ethnic in appearance, with a clumsy walk and a vanity about his appearance. He's truly excellent and more than up to the final moments of the film."The World is Yours" the Cook's Tour neon sign says -- this is an anti-mob movie urging people to insist that government do something about mobsters and take back the streets. It would be a long time before that happened, if it's happened yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface(1932)was a very satisfying film. There was suspense, action drama. Paul Muni is a very gifted actor as well. He played a more than convincing role as an intimidating gangster, which speaks highly of his talents considering the complete turn around from his role in I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932). There were some parts about the character of Tony that I didn't really like. For example, the way he wouldn't allow anyone near his sister, also would hit his sister. It was as if he had some weird feelings for her the way he kept her so confined. And it eventually makes him murder his trusted friend. He was also very mean to his mother. In most gangster movies, the tough guys are usually really nice to their families (their mothers at least, oh well). The scene when Tony is whistling before he has Johnny killed was priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I started to watch this film I immediately thought I wouldn't enjoy it nearly as much as the 1983 version, but I was quickly proved wrong. "Scarface" delivered on all ends of the cinematic spectrum. It had a great story with exceptional dialog and cinematography. I was even impressed by the well executed drive by and shoot out scenes. Now yes the scenes would have been way more realistic with some fake blood but this was the 1930's and Howard Hawks had to work with what he could get away with. As it was already most states wouldn't even let it play even after Hawks put in an alternative ending. The film had some terrific actors and actresses but Paul Muni's performance as Tony Camonte's stole the show! He played the role of a cold-hearted killer who would grab wealth and success by any means necessary perfectly. To be honest I was more intimidated by Tony Camonte than I was Tony Montana. There was just something scary knowing that this man who was usually smiling would shoot you down in a matter of seconds if he had a reason to. I must not forget to mention the song he whistles as well before he goes and kills someone. That seems like some deranged tendency of a serial killer. So if you enjoy gangster films check this movie out, it's one of the best ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface doesn't make my favourite movies list, but it is a brilliant film. While people may say the 1983 remake is better, I'd say this is better by quite a significant margin. The film does look good, the cinematography is skillful and the costumes and sets are top-drawer. The script is excellent, and the story draws you in and never lets go.The film also moves very briskly, without feeling too rushed, and while the film is quite short, if I had a slight criticism it could have been a tad longer, a lot of other factors make it not matter that much. The direction from Howard Hawks is also superb, while the violence and innuendos was and is shocking for its time(this is what I and other people mean by it being ahead of its time). The acting is fine, Paul Muni is quite brilliant, Ann Dvorak is sexy and surprisingly good in her acting and Boris Karloff is also very good. It does helps that the characters are credible at least.So all in all, this is a brilliant film and definitely worth seeing. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original gangster classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Scarface" wasn't the first notable gangster film (it was preceded by both "Little Caesar" &amp; "The Public Enemy") it was undoubtedly the most controversial of the pre-code gangster films. Loosely based on the life of Al Capone, "Scarface" doesn't skimp on the violence while unfolding its tale of prohibition era gangsterism.Playing the titular lead role was Paul Muni who contributed a larger than life portrayal full of swaggering machismo. However, his character wasn't just a one-dimensional goon; Muni seized the opportunity to show multiple facets of the man, from ruthless gangster to devoted brother. While the supporting cast doesn't quite rise to the same level as Muni, there is nevertheless notable work here from Karen Morley, Osgood Perkins &amp; Ann Dvorak. You'll also see George Raft &amp; Boris Karloff, though I wouldn't count their performances among the film's best.Howard Hawks' direction captured the action admirably though I'd say that the explosive content overshadows the film's craftsmanship. The screenplay (by the talented Ben Hecht) is daring and features some nifty wordplay from time to time.In the end, though, the inevitable question is how does it compare to Brian de Palma's 1983 remake? Personally, I prefer the later version for its memorable script and fine performances. Some of the earlier film's themes benefit from expansion while the violence was ratcheted up a notch or two. For this reason, I find the original "Scarface" mostly of interest as a pre-code time capsule, albeit one executed with considerable vigour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Scarface. Having grown up in the 1990's the first Scarface I was turned on to was Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone's version. Though they did a fantastic job with that film, I would have to say that this film is every bit as good. Paul Muni's portrayal of Tony Camonte is wonderful, he brings emotion to his character who seems conflicted between his adult ideas and his brash, child like actions. My only draw-back for this film is the lackluster job done with any fight scenes, I can't say I've seen a weaker looking punch in my life but, you get what you get for the time period in which the movie was filmed. All in all, a wonderful film and from what I've read on the novel Scarface, this is a pretty solid adaptation that I would call a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the "Gangster" genre of movies.</fullReview>

There were quite a few similarities between the two gangster films, including the main character's apparent attraction to his own sister and the crush on his boss's wife, along with some other things.This is great and is almost hard to imagine was able to have been made in the year 1932. This was something I would definitely watch again, and I think that Paul Muni was a pretty great actor. The picture and sound was also surprisingly vivid.I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in watching an old-fashioned gangster film and enjoys movies having to do with the Al Capone and prohibition era.</fullReview>

However it is different from the 1983 version that everyone now-a-days is used to. The 1932 version is different in the way that they shot it. You can notice right away which one of the versions you are watching. It is a much older look and the sound isn't as clear as it is in the newer version. It is pretty cool how used the dark lighting when a gangster scene is happening and a light scene if its something involved with a family. They basically used everything they could to make a great classic movie in 1932. Scarface will always be a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was superb. Directed by Howard Hawks this is probably one of the most classic gangster films ever created. This is a true Al Capone like Film. Being shot in 1932 it has a lot of great features. Great cinematography and Being as long ago as it was made, it appears that the filmmakers really started experimenting with Moving the camera. Lot's of dolly shots and tracking shots. But as far as the story goes it's great. Paul Muni who plays "scarface" Tony Camonte does an excellent job, he has a sort of "boss" like attitude which really develops his overall character. (now I know where Al Pachino gets it all from.) Bottom line..if you haven't seen this movie and are a true fan of gangster films you have to see this. This is one of the most classic gangster films ever created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface is the gritty and dark story if a gangsters rise and fall. Tony Camonte, played by Paul Muni and Johnny Lovo, played by Osgood Perkins take over the south side crime ring after the boss, Big Louis Costillo is killed. Lovo and Camonte sell illegal alcohol to speakeasies and bars and when they start to attract the attention of rival gangs and the police, they find themselves in a bit of trouble. Eventually an all out gangster war breaks out between the rival gangs. Meanwhile Camonte begins to pursue Lovo's girlfriend Poppy played by Karen Morley. Scarface is a story of greed revenge and crime, where a lot of bad things happen to a lot of bad people. This film epitomizes the gangster genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first large amount of crime the US experienced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a really great movie for a few reasons. The way it was directed and filmed really put you in the mood of what was going on and made you feel like you were right there with them. The actors were great and it was entertaining in a strange way to see all the violence that really went on during the prohibition times. This is one of the reasons I think this movie did so well; because it really related to what was going on in the world. With all the new people moving into the US and prohibition and crime at an all time high. It was a way to show what was happening in a not so stressful way. It was informative in "fun" way. All the guns kept you on your toes, the flirting made things interesting as well as trying to figure out who was really trustworthy. All the special effects and crazy driving with the beautiful cars going off of cliffs and the "bosses". The props went with the time period, the sets really fit the part as did the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface, the Shame of the Nation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had obviously seen the Brian De Palma/Al Pacino remake before this original from producer Howard Hughes (the character Leonardo DiCaprio plays in The Aviator), and director Howard Hawks (Monkey Business, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), so I didn't know what to expect. Basically the last of the old-style gang leaders, Big Louis Costillo (Harry J. Vejar), is killed, and after suspecting his bodyguard, Antonio 'Tony' Camonte (Paul Muni), without finding the body, he is released. The police strongly suspect Tony was paid by John 'Johnny' Lovo (Osgood Perkins) to kill Big Louis, and soon enough after release Tony is the new mob king taking over, becoming a threat to Johnny. Meanwhile, the overpowering and overprotective grasp of Tony is getting to his sister Francesca 'Cesca' (Ann Dvorak) and she wants independence. Tony's relationship with his sister is in fact too close for comfort, it is pretty much incestuous, and when all the other mob bosses have had enough of him, she is the only one he can turn to. The final scenes (just like the remake) have Tony held up in his home trying to avoid all the bullets and shooting some of his own, and after Cesca is shot dead, he goes outside and is blown away (the ending back then would have been Tony going to court and hanged). Also starring Karen Morley as Poppy, C. Henry Gordon as Inspector Ben Guarino, George Raft as Guino Rinaldo, Vince Barnett as Angelo and Boris Karloff as Gaffney. Muni was quite good, but I will be honest and say that I was paying most attention to all the guns blazing all over the place every few minutes, this to me is great viewing, and when I understood what was going on, it is a quite worthwhile crime drama. Tony Camonte was number 47 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Very good!</fullReview>

At first I was skeptical but after watching the movie I now understand why it is considered one of the first original gang films.All aspects of the movie kept me hooked on watching it.

		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly violent film considering the time it was made. It may not be as well known as its 80s re-imagining but its still a solid film. Darkly lit compact sets and grimy streets set the mood in this film. This film really set the foundation for film noir. Paul Muni delivers another entertaining performance though he's considerably more over the top in this than in I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. With the acting in this you get what you pay for, mind numbingly over the top performances that really do not take away from the film whatsoever. It's a fantastically entertaining film and the hysterically ridiculous Italian accents only help to make it that way. An interesting note is a certain motif used in the film involving X's but I wont give anything away, I will say that Scorsese paid homage to this film by using this same motif in his film the Departed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great example of a classic gangster film. Paul Muni portrays what most would feel a typical gangster would act. Paul Muni did an amazing job showing power, greed, jealousy and still having insecurities, which were unfortunately his downfall. When Paul Muni's character, Tony Camonte, begins to become too hungry for power and slowly begins to unravel and by the end he becomes the person he didn't want to be. A very interesting point about this film was how violent this movie was but such a little amount of blood. Most of the time when there was an altercation between a few gangsters, yes there was a lot of gunfire but there was hardly any blood. Also, if someone did get shot, they did not show a slow and dramatic death. All in all, this film was great! I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in any dramas like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another great Paul Muni film. The 1932 Scarface had it all. Paul Muni plays the roll of a "gangster" named Tony Camonte who starts out as a mere body guard and eventually works his way up to become a "boss". Tony was a explorer, searching for his treasure. He lived by the words of a sign outside his bedroom window. The words "The World Is yours" ran through his mind and built up the ambition and desire to make it to the top. in the long run those words were the death of him. This movie set the bar for every other gangster/mob themed movie after it. Scarface is full of gun fights, drama, and humor that really sucked me in to the story. i recommend this movie to anyone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesoem Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Scarface was an awesome movie. It was a lot better than I was expecting. The protagonist of the film, Tony Comonte, was ruthless character and Paul Muni did a brilliant job portraying him. The character was a really interesting twist between a cold blooded killer and a sort of playful child. He treated the whole gangster life style like a big game. A good example scene is when he gets the machine gun from the rival gangsters. The fully automatic weapon is new to him and he acts all excited and giddy about it; saying stuff like "he Johnny, look what I got!" and "lookit Johnny, you carry it around like a baby." It's a really funny scene, but at the same time a little disturbing. After that scene Tony goes on a rampage, wiping out guy after guy, and you really get a sense of how cold hearted the character is. Especially when he lines up seven or so men against a wall and basically executes them all with the machine gun. Comonte is a strange character beyond just his ruthless blood lust and playful childish attitude. He also has like a weird obsession with his younger sister, and even goes as far as killing his beast friend over it. Which is probably the strongest example of his coldblooded personality. The whole movie is pretty brutal, which surprised me a good deal since I always assume older movies to be real prim and proper. I had never know about these "pre-code" films in the past, but I can easily tell that this film is one of them.The writers really get their point across about the horrific nature of mobs and gangsters. The scene that really drove the message home in my opinion was when the police chief gives a short speech about the whole situation. He talks about stuff like kids getting shot while playing hopscotch, how people have unhealthy romanticized attitudes toward criminals, and about old west criminals and how at least those guys fought each other fairly. It's a great speech, and is probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie.I really liked how shadows were used in the movie as sort of substitutes during violent scenes. You see what's going on, but you don't really see it. The effect does a great job producing a dark, malicious atmosphere. Overall I was really impressed by the film.</fullReview>

I must say I was very impressed with story (which at the time was original and fresh) and the whole classic tragedy aspect of the great rise (coming from nothing and became rich beyond anything you could imagine) and the epic fall (being gunned down like a rabid dog)of the main character. Seeing this film also made me realize how much other "gangster" films take from this movie. So if this movie was never made I don't believe the gangster film genre would have lasted or at least would of been as good.

		<fullReview>Paul Muni's portrayal of a prohibition era gangster is a great investment of time. While this picture is a great cinematic work, it also serves as a social call to arms against organized crime. The beginning of the film asks viewers to think and reflect on the crimes committed and to try and put a stop to them. The film even has a scene in which several city officials explore options to try and eradicate organized crime. I couldn't help but wonder if the sign outside Muni's apartment displaying the words "The World Is Yours" is actually a message to the audience. Aside from the powerful social commentary the film stands on solid legs, with dramatic lighting and Muni at the helm the film embodies gritty gangster life. The strongest aspect of the film I felt was the use of an "x" mark whenever someone was killed, and with an "x" on his own face Muni meets an appropriate foreshadowed death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Scarface from 1932 is one of the original gangster movies. Although it is a movie from over seventy years ago, it has all the qualities a present day gangster movie would have. It has family drama, illegal substances, an over abundance of guns, and of course an underlying love story. The main character Tony, played by Paul Muni, is portrayed as a bad gangster, but also has hints of a likable family man. In the beginning he starts out as an average spot among the gang, but quickly moves himself up the ladder by way of greed. Tony gets a taste of money and power and quickly decides that's the life which he chooses to lead. As a travels down this path he is quickly blinded by once motivated him. He decides that the woman he wants is one which is with his friend. One of the first bad decisions that Tony makes. This is a line that once crossed can never be gone back on. Tony also has a younger sister Francesca, which has also gotten a taste of the same lifestyle. Throughout the entire movie, Tony as a man changes changes to a point of no return. His family thinks that he is nothing but trouble, his friends are beginning not to trust him, and there's nothing that he can do about wither situation. Everything in Tony's life comes to the boiling point when he goes to visit Francesca, and one of his gang members open her apartment door to greet him; Tony breaks. He thinks that he is protecting her when in fact he is breaking her heart. This movie is very well written in the sense that it shows the effects that power and money can have on a man. You may start out as a descent family man, but once you get a taste your whole world can change. By the time you realize what has become of your life, it is usually too late to go back and change what you have become.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface is an amazing gangster film better than its 1982 remake. While cocaine was a good key point of focus for the '82 version, alcohol and the prohibition in the 1930's was much more distinct and real. Paul Muni puts in a very believable performance as a psychotic gangster blinded by his own ambition. He practically takes down the crime ladder completely through murder and once he's at the top he was never the same. I loved the bullet-proof glass in his car and the steel windows to protect his house. Another point to make was the social commentary right before the film, making it perfectly clear that this is unacceptable social behavior and needed to be controlled; because back then gang violence and deviance through alcohol was a serious problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished watching the classic movie Scarface, a gangster life propaganda film starring Paul Muni. This movie was entertaining in many ways. The cinematography was interesting and well thought out. During the opening scene, the camera pans around a lonely street lamp flickering against a fading night sky into early morning. There has been a party all night thrown by a notorious gangster named Big Louie. In the same scene, however, Louie is approached menacingly by a shadow creeping into his home, intending to slaughter him (no doubt an attack of gang relation) This camera effect of following Paul Muni's character as a shadow is menacing, and thats just what his character is. This film, like many others of its era, has long scenes without breaks (it is 5 minutes into the film before the second scene even begins) During gun wars between North and South side are long, drawn out, loud, and shot from very unique angles. The audio, even for an older film, is sharp and clear. Even when focusing on characters with heavy accents, it isn't hard to hear the dialog. This movie is extremely well put edited. As for the acting in this film, as I've stated before, Paul Muni is incredible. He is so well animated and his facial expressions are over the top. In the scene where he meets his love interest Poppy played by actress Karen Morley he imitates her plucking her eyebrows- it's hysterical. His thick Italian accent accompanied with such facial expressions makes his character so believable. I really enjoyed this movie! After seeing this version, I appreciate it so much more than the re-make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very interested to see this movie because I am a huge fan of the Al Pachino's Scarface. I heard that they were completely different movies, but in fact there not. In this scarface they sell beer not coke. This movie takes place during the time of prohibition when the law and mob were at war. From one of the first scene in the movie you can tell Tony is a bad guy he shows no fear to the cops and even insults him. Through the movie no matter what scene, Tony is the biggest guy in the room. This shows that he is powerful and intimidating. I did not enjoy how easily tony's sister seemed to forgive him. In the remade Scarface his sister does not forgive him and it is a very powerful scene. Also I feel that they should have showed Guino Rinaldo and Francesca 'Cesca' Camonte relation building up a little more. The whole time Rinaldo just seems to be rejecting Cesca offers, then all the sudden they were together. I really enjoyed the Character who was always answering the phone for tony, it was good comic relief for the very violent dramatic movie.</fullReview>

My Favorite character in this movie was Angelo played by Vince Barnatt. He added some comedy to the mob mentality. And my second favorite charter Poppy (Toni's girl)was played by the lovely Karen Morely. Ann Dvorak played Toni Camonte's sister Cesca. Her big gorgeous eyes could draw in any man but not under Toni's watch. And then there is the handsome George Raft who played Guino Rinaldo Toni's partner in crime. My favorite part was when the restaurant was getting shot up by O'Hara's mob (?)and Angelo was on the phone trying to get the name of the person on the phone, all the while being shot at left and right. I also thought the part where the calendar days were shot away towards the begging on the movie was a nice touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this movie pushed the audience (american society) to do something about the gang violence at the time. It was made obvious in the first couple moments of the movie and again when the mayor of the town was telling the people that if they wanted laws to be made to prevent this from happening, the people would have to push for it. I think Paul Munis performance in this movie is what made it. This is the second movie I have seen him act in, and he fully commits to his characters. The only thing lacking in this movie that I can see is that when characters were shot they did not make it look real. also, when Paul Muni's character punched or hit another person, it did not look real at all. Maybe for the time this was what people expect but now a days it just doesn't compare. In the bowling alley scene, I thought it was clever to use the falling of the bowling pins to signify the sound of gun shots. It made it seem more unexpected to the man that got shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps even better than the seminal 1983 remake, this tale shines with the maniacal acting of Paul Moni as Camonte. The dialog is typical gangster fare (Myah! You coppers are never gonna get me, ya see?) But the characters in this film are what shine.As Camonte gets deeper and deeper in the life of organized crime, his family starts to crack and everything all around him falls apart - a side effect of his boisterous, brash, and over-the-top brutal lifestyle. There is also some splendid camera work in the film, including the death scenes where Camonte shoots up half of the city. In those shots in particular, it shows how he has become somewhat of a "harbringer of death" as everywhere he goes dark shadows and death surrounds him - especially when a victim falls in the street under Undertakers Crossing, forming a cross in the shadows on the ground where he fell.The comedic elements in the film feel odd and out of place. While Camonte is being shot at, Several stray bullets come close to hitting his secretary, the de facto comedic relief in this film, but it doesn't work. What does work however is the splendid push of Moni always trying to get what he can't have, and never gives up, that's his undoing. A great film.-Smola</fullReview>

While there is no blood, it still has a very high body count with drive-by shootings and even a body getting dumped from a moving car.The film's cover highlights that Boris Karloff also appears, but do not let that sway you unless you are a die-hard fan. He has a very small role and does not show up for some time.The 1983 remake with Al Pacino is probably better-known, and debatably better-made.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good film, but 1931 seems to have been a bit better vintage for Warner Brothers gangster films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a thinly veiled biography of Al Capone. Some names and incidents were changed, but many were left intact (such as the nickname "Scarface" and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre). The biggest difference was the ending. In the film, Scarface died in an expectedly melodramatic way, whereas in real life, Capone slowly wasted away due to the ravages of syphilis.For the most part, the film is what you'd expect from a film about gangsters, but it was a little more crude in its execution. In contrast, Warner's other two big gangster hits from the year before, LITTLE CAESAR and PUBLIC ENEMY, seemed more polished and with better, less shrill acting (particularly Muni's and Dvorak's). I definitely prefer these other two films.About the only really unusual and unexpected thing about the film was its strongly implied incestuous relationship between Scarface and his trampy sister. While they never exactly said they slept together, their relationship was very, very unnatural and the audience was left to wonder and draw their own sordid conclusions! The addition of this plot element and liberal sprinkling of violence and sexual innuendo isn't all that surprising, really, as Howard Hughes produced this film and these are pretty much the norms for his films.</fullReview>

Seeing the invention of gangster clichs is neat, and so is reflecting upon all the movies down the road that have paid respect to this. (DePalma's remake is the most obvious.. but many more subtle homages, such as naming of the characters in "The Usual Suspects" after Boris Karloff's role.)Contemporary folks looking for pure entertainment should move along; if you have a soft spot for movie history, give this a try.</fullReview>

Scarface holds nothing back, showing the effect gang society and violence have on families, love lives and innocent bystanders. As Tony gains power he proceeds to lose everything and everyone in his life until there is nothing left. When it comes to the movie itself, I was particularly impressed by the lead actor who depicted Tony equally well at his very highest and lowest. The plot was tightly written and absolutely believable. Especially the reactions of Tony's sister from hatred for her brother to worrying for him. That final line of hers, "Because you're me and I'm you," really stuck with me long after I turned the movie off. Truly an excellent film and one I won't be surprised if it is remade yet again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people would probably compare this to the Al Pacino version of scar face. Still this movie has some similarities; like Tony as the main character name and also he has to be attracted to his boss's girl and of course win her over. Also of course a lot of shooting and killing for the gangster to keep power over the others.This was a very early gangster film that of course had a lot of gangs in it. So many gangs appear in the film is that the most powerful gangster is killed. Creating a new war amongst all the gangs.Tony Camonte the main character takes advantage of this war to prove himself better than any other gangster by doing all the work or just killing more people than anyone else. With that in mind the film was successful in keeping murder graphic and accurate to what graphics it was limited to. Still this film created the outline for the future Scarface film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson's 'Scarface' (1932) was ranked #6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Gangster". All I can say is that I can't imagine how painfully bad every other film from #7 on must be. I truly don't understand the hype surrounding this movie- but maybe that's magnified by the remake, which I haven't seen. Before reading my opinion on this film, you should know that I rarely dislike movies this strongly; so it takes a lot to get me to write such a scathing review.I can honestly say I started watching the movie with an open mind, as I had recently watched and enjoyed 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang' from Mervyn LeRoy (1932) also starring Paul Muni. Not long into 'Scarface' I realized my boredom. Although this realization made the rest of the movie even less bearable, I sat through it, just in case it would turn around. It didn't.The plot is messy (most of the film is a back and forth where one mob attacks the other and vice versa again and again) yet predictable (the greedy gangster who eventually feels guilty). The characters are underdeveloped and Paul Muni painfully overacts, exemplified by how his Italian accent gets inexplicably more pronounced as the story progresses. After watching 'I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang', which has the same main actor and was released in the same year, I was sorely disappointed by how flat 'Scarface' was in comparison. There are some obvious attempts at clever cinematography, like the use of shadows, "X"s, and whistling, which are occasionally redeemable, and my reasons for giving it a higher rating than I would have otherwise. I think if it had been condensed quite a bit, it would have been a hundred times better. The film dragged along like it was a requirement for it to be an hour and a half, but the plot unfortunately didn't have the density to be spread so thin. I found myself counting down the minutes until it was over and I could say I gave it a chance. To sum up, 'Scarface' to me was boring, unimaginative, insufferable, and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really interesting that this version is the original. It really makes people think of how the world is like today... well, almost. This is really nice when people notice the nice settings of Chicago in the 1920's. This is one of the brighter times in history because of the people who loved the jazzy feeling.Anyway, the reason why this is a movie in the Crime genre is because there is a lot of crime in this. Heck, the whole world has a lot of crime in it! I really don't like the feeling about crime. However, in this one, it seems appropriate to watch and realize many things. The casting choices are really good, and the climax in there makes us feel that it is down to the wire. This is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the days of prohibition organized criminals fought to gain distribution territories. Howard Hawks' "Scarface" (1932) tells the tale of a wiseguy on his way to the top. Right of the bat our main character Tony (Paul Muni) offs the head Don so his "Family" can take over the bootleg distribution. These are the days of prohibition, after all. As Tony rises to the top of the ranks he goes mad with power. He thinks everything is up for the taking. But crime doesn't pay.The visual story telling is quite compelling. The director shows the viewer before telling them. Some of the set designs made for a great use of shadow to amplify the essence of crime and murder. Quite the graphic film considering the time it was produced. Also a bit racy with much exposed leg and promiscuous young women such as Tony's sister. All of these variables combined make for quite an entertaining classic.Its apparent that the film-makers are not only out to create a beautiful masterpiece but also communicate the truth behind what crime can do to a man. Tony alienates and destroys everyone around him in pursuit of money, power and respect. Not to mention the loss of innocent people in the process. In the end there are some strong themes suggesting how rotten the life of a gangster is under all the clothes and cars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dark humor in this film was like none I've ever seen. For having been made in the early 30s, I was shocked at the amount of violence that there was. However, I think it accurately depicted the way the mobs were, so it didn't turn me away from watching. There also seemed to be an overall flow of the movie. The scenes blended well and there was a chemistry between the characters that was apparent on screen. It made for an easy view, despite the violence. Seeing the 1932 version, made me want to re-watch the 1983 version to compare and see what one was better! The work was truly a masterpiece, and paved the way for many more gangster/mob films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-Notch Gangster Thriller Still Packs Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rarity, a classic old film from the early talkie days which I have never seen, prior to tonight. Howard Hughes did things in a big way when he made films. His Hell's Angels of 1930 was a top-notch aerial epic. Scarface, made in late 1930, but unreleased until 1932 is a top-notch gangster picture. Beautifully directed by Howard Hawks, the film's dark and brooding cinematography glistens. The performances by all concerned are first-rate. Paul Muni was truly a great actor, and he infuses his character with life. Karen Morley is very good as the girlfriend, but Ann Dvorak is simply great as the sister who is looked after just a little too carefully by Muni's Tony. There are many killings throughout the picture's 94 minute running time, but people looking for blood-and-guts had better head for the Brian DePalma 1983 remake. The violence, and the tension leading up to some of the killings are there, all right, but things were a bit more subtle in the early '30s than they were 50 years later. There is a symbolic "X" theme which runs through the picture which is quite interesting and something I've not seen too often. Boris Karloff has a small part in the proceedings, and while this film was released in April, 1932, which was after Karloff's star-making turn in Frankenstein, Scarface was filmed and completed before the famous Universal horror flick. Scarface is a satisfying gangster picture which is rightfully regarded as one of the very best in it's genre, regardless of year. The DVD print is very good, and there is an alternate ending included which lends a more properly moral tone. I liked the original ending as seen in the released film better, but you can judge for yourself when you see it. This is a film which is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Muni</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks directed this early(and violent) gangster picture that stars Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, an ambitious and fearless man who quickly rises to the top of the underworld after first being hired to kill his own boss by a rival, then later overtaking and disposing of him as well. Tony is quite ruthless, but has a soft spot for his kid sister, whom he is insanely protective of, and can't stand to see with any man, which will prove to be his downfall... Though this features lots of action, and is clearly inspired by "Little Caesar" &amp; "The Public Enemy", Muni's performance is too broad, and picture becomes unintentionally funny, especially in its climax. Good direction though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not my favorite, but the directer still made a good movie. It showed a real sense of that era because it was based on true events that had previously happened. There were many technical aspects that the director and writer uses in the movie. They use panning with the shots, when the camera follows the man as he walks inside and with the motion shots of the drive by shooting. One particular scene where they move the camera from one side to the other is when they are doing the drive by shooting on the city street and then they throw out the man outside the car. They also use different perspectives and angles to show the men in a certain way, they wanted them to come off as tough and rough. The low angle shot in the office with all the men sitting around a desk, shows them talking to each other and it shows them as big and tough smoking their cigars. The scenes are clear, sharp and the sounds of the guns are very vivid.</fullReview>

The aspects that did not make this film jump out to me were, the plot was dull for me, and it was not lively enough to keep it interesting. The aspect that was very successful in this film was the acting by Paul Muni. His character at the end becomes insane, and how he shows this insanity is amazing. You would actually think the he might be slightly crazy with how well done he did with his character. You can feel his emotion through the screen because he expresses it in such a dynamic way it draws attention to his character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first time with Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first like to say that I have never seen the Scarface that is so popular today. I was never really into the gangster films and I don't really like watching violence. My favorite part of the movie was its reason for being made. The fact that a movie was made to show how gangs were running the cities and all of the violence that was going on was very dramatic. I liked how the movies point was to try to inspire people to take action against gang violence. I think that it was also a good story because usually gangs are glorified and this showed that even though the life is glorious, overall it is a hard road. Tony ended up losing his family and friends and with that came his power. I thought that the one part where there was just a bunch of people driving around shooting each other was boring. I didn't even know who the people were. It was long and pointless. I was also disappointed that the famous line "Say hello to my little friend" was not in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface was a decent gangster film from the 30's that was pretty good. With a plot and characters that were very straightforward, the film kept you interested, yet not on the edge of your seat. Paul Muni plays the Scarface, who is very charismatic and pretty cool. Shootout scenes ranged from intense, to even humorous. In one scene, a gangster is talking on the phone in a restaurant and trying to get the name of the man on the other line, but he can't hear and continues asking even as a bunch of gangsters do a drive by shootout on the restaurant the man still remains calmly requesting the name from the man on the other line. This was amusing, however it won't make your sides ache with laughter, or you might not even chuckle. That stays true throughout most of the movie.The film was fairly good considering that it was still early in the genre, however it didn't provide enough. Thank you and goodbye.</fullReview>

In the one scene the man was hurt in the hospital and the two guys come in with flowers but really were guns. It was most likely 10 seconds long but had so much power. I really enjoyed tony's sister. I thought she was a great actress. When I think of the 1930s woman from new york, she has nice hair, dressed to the best, and is independent.

		<fullReview>The 1932 drama film, "Scarface, the Shame of a Nation", is a classic gangster/crime movie. The great Paul Muni stars as Anthony 'Tony' Camonte, a power hungry mobster. Even though it is an older film, I was instantly caught up in the story line, and appreciated how well it was written. I also thought that the movie was filmed well. Not only that, but this movie was very violent for its time. One thing about the movie that I thought was ironic, was how the mob was involved in the alcohol business. This was because when the movie was being produced, there was a prohibition of alcohol. The 1983 remake starring Al Pacino, had the mob involved in the drug business. All in all i give, "Scarface, the Shame of a Nation", 5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface took the typical crime movie of the time and added an interesting character as the main guy. Paul Muni was good as always, but his character was really hard to like. He was arrogant, overbearing, and full of flaws. The writing was extremely average. It was mostly these guys are selling illegal beer and they have a little competition and some problems. Then Tony experiences problems with his life and tries to form a good life at the same time. It was hard to respect Paul Muni because an actor is only as good as his lines. He did a pretty good job considering, but the flat writing was the main flaw. The major events that occur in the second half of the movie happen too quickly and have almost no narrative except for maybe a couple of scenes which show Tony being way too protective of his sister. I almost suggest watching the 80's scarface first because that one fleshes out the characters much more even though it's a different setting and the names are different. It will give a better understanding. The lack of sound was also a contributing factor to the boring atmosphere. There was even little music to help set the mood when appropriate. This movie is good more Paul Muni fans, but I found it to be not impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Scarface is a great movie and you can tell it's a tragedy and things will only get worst once it starts. Paul Muni plays a fantastic gangster and bootlegger during prohibition era Chigago. He does an excellent job a showing the insanity and scary nature of a gangster. This film is also representative of an anti-gang movie by showing how tragic it is and that nothing good comes of it. Muni who throughout the film feels invincible until he eventually meets his fate in the end. For example, When someone starts shooting while he's at the party, he barely seems startled. The movie's use of shadows and dark sets also give this film the dark mood that it has. This film is intense with the loud machine guns, fast cars, and it's violent nature. The gangster movies of this period really are a style all of their own.</fullReview>

This film opened the door for censorship-free material, though Hollywood would not conform until another 3 decades. With Hawks behind the camera and Howard Hughes controlling the budget, this masterpiece is one of the fundamental films of Hollywood and a great experience. The action scenes are top-notch and the film avoids self-indulgence. An essential for Hawks fan and film buffs in general. Unfortunately, this would inspire the 1983 De Palma remake that throws this to shame. Watch this instead.</fullReview>

The machine guns were great. The sound we got from them made my heart race. It all looked so realistic and the message they wanted the audience to get was very clear.

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and violent Pre-Code gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commissioned by Howard Hughes in the Pre-Code era, Scarface arrived in a time when the public had a growing interest in organised crime. The James Cagney films The Public Enemy and Little Caesar both had a nasty gangster as their protagonist, and portrayed their rise and fall through the criminal underworld. Whether the audience had a genuine fascination with a very real problem at the time, or they just enjoyed the exploitative violence and colourful characters, I don't know. Scarface remains one of the best examples of the genre, and a film that would directly influence many a modern-day gangster film.Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) is the chief lieutenant in the new criminal organisation overlooked by Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins). They plan to bootleg alcohol on a large scale throughout the city, and Johnny hopes to unite all the gangs so they can operate efficiently without any trouble. Tony is warned not to try to muscle into the turf ran by an Irish gang, but Tony ignores these orders, and begins an extremely long and violent war. With his coin-flipping second-in-command Guino (George Raft), Tony gains more power, and soon the greed and ambition take over him. He also has an over-protective, almost incestuous, relationship with his sister Francesca (Ann Dvorak) and frightens off any man that shows an interest in her. Little does he know that she is secretly seeing Guino.After many demands for script re-writes by the Hays Office (who would later introduce the ridiculous Hays Code), Howard Hughes finally put the film in production and told director Howard Hawks to 'make it as realistic and as grisly as possible'. Only passed by the censors a year after production was finished, Hawks would have to change the ending and introduce a title card damning the actions of the kind of criminals that the film portrayed. Still, Howard Hughes was forced to release it in states that lacked censorship rules, after refusing to edit the film any further.The film still remains extremely violent even by today's standards. On one hand, it's an interesting commentary on the corruption of the American Dream, showing how greed can consume, and on the other it's an enjoyable and rough gangster film with exciting and impressively realised gun-fights and drive-by's. It's all anchored by Paul Muni, who gives a convincing and nasty performance. His character acts completely without remorse, and therefore extremely unlikeable. Tony Camonte is obviously based on Al Capone, complete with identical facial scar (hence the title), and apparently the set was visited by Capone's thugs.I was quite surprised how much the Brian De Palma/Al Pacino remake took from this - the sibling jealousy, the shootout ending, the double- crossing of his boss - and out of the two, I feel this is ultimately the better film. There's just something authentic about the film that the remake failed to capture.I'll certainly be tracking down some more Pre-Code crime films after this, and if any of the others can capture the excitement and the grit of this, then it will be a great experience. And watch out for a small roll for Boris Karloff!www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

I liked Paul Muni as Tony, I think that he really got into the character and portrayed him in a way that a lot of people find appealing. Although he does have some flaws, you can really tell that he is a hardened criminal demanding respect. Another thing I liked was that the film was shorter compared to the newer version that seemed kind of drawn out just for the heck of it, where as this earlier version was direct, to the point, and very entertaining.</fullReview>

I felt the ending was a let down because after hiding out, I felt that Tony gave himself up to easily.

Most of the other performances of the supporting cast were wooden, one-dimensional, or over the top. Karen Morley gave an interesting performance as the reserved Poppy, as did George Raft as the quiet Guino Rinaldo. I do wonder if it was the performances, the writing, or just the acting of the time that made me feel this way. Despite the action scenes and violence, the plot seemed predictable and not very interesting. The moments of comic relief were not very successful either. This film also seems very dated.

		<shortDescription>A film without an ounce of subtlety or realism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface(1932) falls victim to its filmmakers mixed motivations. On one hand the film's stated goal was to reveal the scourge of organized crime to the American audience and encourage further government action against gangsters. The other goal was to produce an exciting and entertaining film that would be commercially successful. In this reviewer's opinion the film totally fails in both respects.First, the film fails in its goal to bring the harsh realities of organized crime to the audience as there is nothing about the film that feels real or genuine. Aside from a strong performance by George Raft as Little Boy, there isn't a single believable character in the film, only caricatures. Paul Muni's Tony seemed to drift in and out of a bizarre Italian accent throughout the film. Clearly the character was meant to be a psychopath, perhaps his inability to decide if he had an accent or not was a symptom of his psychosis? The sniveling and weaselly mob boss Lovo had absolutely no credibility making it impossible to believe that any mobster would respect or fear him enough to work under him for any period of time. Ann Dvorak's Cesca character has emotions and motives that seem to have little basis in the real world, we could see the trouble was going to cause coming from a mile away. Vince Barnett's Angelo was also unbelievable but at least the character was at times genuinely funny. But, again, the lack of subtlety hurts the comedy as the audience is hammered over the head with Angelo's antics. The very strong, unnatural looking lighting style of the films also adds to the unnatural feeling of the film and the cartoon violence of indiscriminate gun fire and one-punch knockouts cement the fact that no one could mistake this film for real life.The film also failed in being a pure entertainment piece as the judgmental tone and the sense of Tony's impending comeuppance weighed heavily throughout the film. The through-line of the story was so clear and the ending was so telegraphed that I found it impossible to get lost in the enjoyment of the action and the occasional comedy.If Scarface had attempted to just be a cautionary tale about the dangers of organized crime or just a cartoonishly violent and over-the-top depiction of mobster life it may well have worked. But because it attempted to be both, it totally failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure if it was just because I have a strong love for the 1983 version of Scarface that made it so hard for me to follow along from beginning to end of this movie. Right off the bat I noticed that when someone got shot at and was lying on the ground for minutes on end, there wasn't even pooling of blood or anything to make it look remotely realistic. I figured that it would get better but once I realized that it kept happening over and over and it wasn't, it made it so hard to focus on what was really happening. It took away from the purpose of what was really going on in the movie. The actors were excellent but they just didn't fulfill the jobs that they needed to be so called "gangsters". I think it was a little disappointing seeing this side of Paul Muni's acting after seeing him in I'm a Fugitive of a Chain Gang. Definitely polar opposites of each other. I was expecting him to be much better in this surprisingly. As far as the sounds go. It was actually kind of pitiful. Very little kid like, and the guns sounded very unrealistic which made it kind of humorous when it was supposed to be serious in most situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarface, directed by Howard Hanks was a suspenseful movie with a gangster theme. Filmed in the mid-1930's, this version was a lot more bearable with less bloodshed than the 1970's remake. The lighting for the movie was set with dim tones, almost like you are expecting something to come out of the shadows at any time. The lighting did add to the suspense of the movie. The characters, particularly Tony, were portrayed a likable side, even though some of their central focus was killing someone else. Even with the killing theme, I found it interesting that they brought some humor in to the movie as well. One scene that I found humorous was when Tony was at the play and had to go to "handle his business" and kill someone. He made his right hand man stay behind to watch the rest of the play so he could find out what happens in the end, even though he wanted to go with Tony to handle the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I just can't stand. It does not have anything to do with the actors or director, but it is just not my type of movie. I really did not enjoy the story or anything about it really. I was bored the entire way through, I actually had to stop the movie several times just to get through it. Once, I finally got through it I honestly was extremely relieved and very very thankful that I did not have to watch it ever again. I am not one for these kinds of movies with crimes and guns. I never liked them and I am pretty sure I never will. So,yeah I really just did not like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good photography; drawn out story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I have to admit that I watched it twice because the first time I fell asleep. The sound is excellent and well represented as are the gun shots and numerous other sounds. The photography was also excellent because the picture was very clear and not grainy as I expected it to be. The part where the movie fell short was what was in my opinion a long drawn out plot. I would've like more action and less talking because the action is what really sells the movie. The production and professionalism in making the movie I don't question whatsoever it was only the plot that could've been spicier; which is most likely why the film was remade and the remake Scarface with Al Pacino is the infamous "classic" while the original is forgotten.I rated the film a 3 out of 10 for great photography and sound; besides that the plot didn't interest me at all because it was just played out too long. I'd suggest the remake of Scarface with Al Pacino before the original any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay okay I have to be honest, I've never seen any versions of Scarface before viewing this film. Having watched it for a film class, well not my type of movie, although I can see why others liked it. Having seen Paul Munni in I am a fugitive from a chain gang, i just didn't care for him in this role, not that his acting was bad. Scarface gets real gritty, real, dramatic.After one crime boss is killed, a new one takes over, its a mafia movie, we all know how they go. I understand that to many people its a classic, overall a pretty decent gangster film though. Its on my list to watch the remake of Scarface and find some interesting comparisons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangsters Disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to watch this movie from beginning to end was a struggle. I felt as if the idea of the plot was a good one, but the actors didn't carry it out and bring it alive. I found myself having to rewind what I was watching because the accents and slurred speech of all the actors made it hard for me to understand them. There wording was jumbled and it made me loose interest in what they were saying or what was going on very quickly. The other problem I had with this movie is the scenes where someone would get shot. They would show the gun fire, and the person falling down but they would show no injuries to the body or even show any fake blood. I know this is probably early for this type of movie, but I feel as if they could have done something low budget or even throw fake blood on a actor to show that a person got hurt. In conclusion not being able to understand the actors really deterred me from watching the rest of the movie. Would not recommend to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the pits. The absolute bottom. The only film that I would call worse would be the remake with Al Pacino, "Scarface". Supposedly based on the gangster Al Capone, this trash is nothing more than a mixed bag of pointless, violent mayhem. It has little to do with the way the mob really works instead it uses excessive violence with the staccato of a machine gun to pass for what was profit-making gangsterism in the 20's. I have always enjoyed HH's films, but this one is a loser all around. It distorts so much of the truth that the characters become unrecognizable. If that's not enough, they insert a suggestive incestuous subplot. Somewhere I read that Al Capone loved this movie. I don't believe it. Anyone sincerely interested in the life of Al Capone should read several outstanding bios of the racketeer ("Capone" by Kobler, "Mr. Capone" by Schoeberg, "Capone, the Man and the Era" by Bergreen and many others) The only shame about this film is the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film I am commenting on is the original Scarface. I picked this film because I am a big Tony Montana and Scarface fan. So once I seen that the first Scarface film was originated in 1932, I had to watch it so that I could analyze it. As I was watching it I was looking for different shots to dissect so I could break down this film. So within this critique I am going to describe the different shots that were used to make this film.The Mise en scene of the film was very basic. The scenes within the film were very basic. They consist of a simple backgrounds, very little effects, fading in and out of each scenes, and the actors and actress within the film could have used a little more work at doing their job.The angles in the film were also very basic. In one particular scene, Tony and his boss received their weapons (Tommy guns, Pistols, and many of bullets) in a warehouse full of other individuals. The angle that was used was just a straight forward angle that could only focus on the both of them. There were individuals moving in and out of the warehouse and also crossing their face. According to my knowledge I believe the shot that was used for this scene was the medium close up shot. Even though Tony and his boss were the two main characters in this film, I believe that the main point of this scene was to get everybody involved in the scene but they either did not have the knowledge to do so or they did not have the proper cinema equipment to make it happen. Because of the medium close of shot, the duration of the scene was not very good. Yes indeed this was a great movie to watch. This scene could have used some extra work. This particular scene was about the same length as the rest of the scenes in the movie, but there was not ever a continuous set of still images. So with that being said, the camera did not move throughout the entire scene. Even though there were people moving in the background and closely to them Tony and his boss, the camera did not focus on any particular individual entering or leaving the warehouse. The other characters who actually had parts within this scene had to approach Tony and his boss directly instead the camera adjusting to where they were at already. I think they should have used the Extreme long shot because this could have made their movie even better. In that case, their audience would have had a better picture about what was actually going on in this particular scene.There is another scene within this film that I am going to comment on. This scene is when Tony meets his bosses wife at a diner to have lunch. As they sat down to eat their lunch, a group of individuals performed a drive-by shooting at the diner that Tony and his bosses wife was eating at. The camera moved very little within this scene even though there was a lot that took place in this particular scene. When the camera, it moved side to side (laterally) so they could get the full body of Tony and his bosses wife as they sat down at their diner table that they were going to sit at. The motion that was used was called the "pan" motion. They should have used this motion throughout this entire scene so they could have made this scene better. The drive-by shootings would have been a great opportunity for them to use the "pan" motion's shot. Instead of using the "pan" motions shot, they used the eye-level shot. By using the eye-level shot they could not film the vehicles as they continued down the street as they passed the cameras on the street they were being filmed on. Also within this scene, Tony's assistant was using the diner's telephone. Even though the camera motion was not up to par in this scene, I believe that the duration of this scene was pretty good. Because of the events that took place in this scene, I think they were forced to focus more on a particular shot because of their lack of knowledge to maneuver their camera around to fit everything in one whole shot. First was Tony and his bosses girlfriend that they focused on as they were being shot at. After them was Tony's assistant. Tony's assistant was using the diner's telephone during the time of the drive-by shooting. As he was associating on the phone they showed bullets hitting objects around him but they did not show where they were coming from. So with that being said, instead of the film director actually filming the individuals doing the shootings and the individuals being shot at, he just showed they individual that was being shot at.Overall this was a pretty good movie. Even though this film had flaws that needs to be fixed, it was still a great movie. I would not have ever noticed any of the mistakes in this film if I had not been taught the proper knowledge of how to brake down and describe different shots within a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK B-film that suffers in the shadow of a 10 times more brilliant remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do have Howard Hawks down as one of my favorite filmmakers but this is one of the films that keeps him from ever reaching the top. I now know that he's not as talented as I first thought. A great director should be able to transform anything into gold but Hawks can only give out gold when he has something fairly good to begin with (another evidence is the terribly mediocre SGT. York).The film itself is OK but extremely dated. I can imagine that I might have liked it a bit more back then but I would never have thought of this as great.The acting from most of the cast is sadly pretty bad and it felt like most of the scenes stood alone due to the extremely long breaks between them. Overall it's well shot and framed but the script is poor, it also suffers from the fact that it's a propaganda film against guns and gun traffic and I almost began to laugh when the two gangsters explained to us how it was so easy to smuggle in guns because no one had made the politicians create harder laughs. Of course I do know that the propaganda part was merely a trick by the creators to get their violent action film out to the masses but why should that help. It's still damn annoying!Muni was OK, though this is one of his worst performances. I actually thought the main story had a lot of high quality and luckily it was remade into the far superior 80's version. The feel this movie gives out is the one of a B-movie and not much thought seems to have been put into it. I still have to say that it was pretty entertaining and a few cool effects like the one with the machine gun along side the calender me be pretty nice with my rating. A very low 6/10 (if a film is entertaining I never give it less than 4)If you are planning to watch this film keep all this in mind. Perhaps you will like it more than I did and perhaps not, that's up to you! But keep your expectations low!</fullReview>
