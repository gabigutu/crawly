		<shortDescription>Powerful, Disturbing Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film with my girlfriend about a year after I graduated from college, where I had lived in the alpha-male, females-as-accessories environment of a fraternity house. While I know of nothing that went on in my fraternity that compares to the horrible events of this film, I was struck that some of the beer-fueled conversations I had with my fraternity brothers could have led to the same results with more likelihood than I realized at the time (or care to admit even to this day). Suffice it to say, I cried all the way home from this movie, as much from shame as anything else.Twelve years later, I still cannot recall being as horrifyingly struck by a scene as I was during the rape scene at the end of "The Accused" -- and I definitely do not have the stomach to see it again. The movie, in my view, is exceedingly well-acted (Foster's Oscar was well-deserved) and well-told. It has the rare gift of touching the viewer viscerally for the entire duration -- discomfort being the feeling.This isn't virtuoso film-making like "The Godfather", but at the same time I can think of no greater compliment for a movie than it truly opened my eyes to a new perspective that I was not mature enough to grasp on my own. I left the theater a different person -- how often can that be said?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about more than rape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about more than rape. It's about societal views of rape and the objectification of the female in a patriarchal society. The actual courtroom drama portion is not prosecuting the rapists, but the men who cheered on and encouraged the gang rape of a woman in a public place. As you watch the movie, look at the image of the woman on the pinball machine; look at the friend who turned away; the boyfriend who expects the victim to "get over it;" the lawyer who thinks it's OK to cut a deal that removes a rape charge in order to get the rapists behind bars, without thought for the life of the victim afterward. Society is on trial here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie Foster Does Justice To This Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1988 Paramount release was the film that made many people take former child star Jodie Foster seriously as an adult actress. Foster won a well deserved Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of a woman who is raped in a bar by a group of perverted drunks while everybody else in the bar encourages it. After the ordeal, she persistently seeks full justice for what she has suffered. Kelly McGillis, who had previously appeared as Tom Cruise's main squeeze in "Top Gun" lends credibility to her role as a tough DA. This genuine thriller of a film (which was based on a true story) deserves high praise for all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that much of a movie... but Foster's performance wins it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfectly knowing that a lot of people would get inspired, personally relate or cite examples from this film, there is no reason to deny that except for the rape victim Sarah Tobias, all the other main characters, even attorney Kathryn Murphy, are written blatantly as stereotypical as they can be. Same can be said about the atmosphere, circumstances and the participators of the incident. The screenwriters have played only one masterstroke by showing the whole rape incident much later in a flashback, which perhaps helps us to relate better to the victim's emotions.However predictable and blunt the film appears in its formation, it delivers it message right with the help of the outstanding (and Oscar-winning) performance of Jodie Foster. She just plays her part with so much passion that sometimes it would seem that she really IS the victim. I wonder how she could get such a driving force for her role which is so powerful and vengeful, yet so helpless and fragile. It is the performance of her career, Clarice Sterling doesn't even come in comparison. Her job in this film should be treated as educational material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On 6 March 1983, a woman named Cheryl Araujo was gang-raped by four men on a pool table at Big Dan's Tavern in New Bedford, Massachusetts. A number of men in the bar were cheering the attackers on and after the victim escaped into the street, they continued drinking and joking about the incident.Ms. Araujo, 21, and all four of her assailants were Portuguese, a major ethnicity in former New England "mill towns" like New Bedford. The Portuguese community sided with its errant sons, rather than their victim, and Cheryl Araujo was basically driven out of town by the animosity of her neighbors. She was killed in an automobile accident in Florida in 1986, leaving behind two children.This film was loosely based on the Araujo case. Several of Jodie Foster's scenes were so powerful they nearly brought me to tears -- specifically, the scene where she confronts lawyer Kelly McGillis in the latter's apartment during a dinner party; her courtroom testimony; and the horrifying rape scene.Kelly McGillis seemed to be sleepwalking through this entire film, with only a few moments when she roused herself a bit, but not enough to help. Even so, she appeared more sensitive than the volunteer from the rape crisis center, who stood NEXT TO the ER doctor during the post-assault pelvic exam. If I had been on that table, I'd have wrenched a foot out of the stirrups and kicked her. A woman who has just been gang raped doesn't need one more person invading her privacy.I agree with an earlier poster who noted the difficult roles of the "cheer and clap" trio. It must have been extremely challenging for a guy who has any sensitivity at all about women to convincingly portray the kind of jerks those three were. My hat's off to all three of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Performances Raise Rough Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the roughest films ever produced that is pure misery to sit through due to its realism and Jodie Foster's striking Oscar-winning performance. Foster stars as a sexual victim who tries to get prison sentences imposed upon the men who cheered on her gang rape at a sleazy roadhouse. Foster is far from being an angel herself and every little thing in her past seems to come back and haunt her. A great supporting turn from Kelly McGillis (who plays Foster's lawyer) just adds to Foster's show-stopping role. Not a film I love, but a good film that displays the seemingly ungodly cinematic talents of Jodie Foster. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a serious and troubling study of sexism at its worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shocking true story of a bar room gang rape is lifted from the headlines to become, with dramatic license, a serious and troubling study of sexism at its worst, when the victim herself is accused of 'asking for it'. Jodie Foster offers a courageous performance as the tough but vulnerable Sarah Tobias, whose behavior on the night of the crime was certainly provocative, but as the flashback re-enactment shows all too clearly no amount of provocation could justify such a brutal response. Up until those final scenes the film is a well-crafted but largely conventional topical drama, with lots of predictable bonding between Foster and her conscience stricken attorney Kelly McGillis. But the attack itself, teasingly saved until the final reel, is so graphic and degrading it obliterates the memory of everything that happened earlier. The scene is pure exploitation, but it serves a purpose, putting audiences in the same, ugly position as the cheering onlookers in the bar, who in many ways were even guiltier than the rapists themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie thinking of the Oscar it received for Jodie Foster. And mark my words that was the only thing that was good in this movie.The theme of this movie was simple - a girl is gang-raped in a bar while the convicts escape the complete term of crime by plea-bargaining their charge down to "reckless endangerment". But the victim is furious about this judgement and wants the ones who cheered on this crime to be brought to justice.The story is typical and pretty much predictable. Over emphasis is given to the emotional drama than to the court room buildup. During trial it looked as if the defense lawyers were not the least bit interested in protecting their clients' interests - this part which should have been the essence of the movie has been completely neglected. There are few hitches as to how the attorney became aware of the fact that the guy playing on the video machine was the one who called the police. Too much of coincidence and assumed facts have ruined the movie. The only positive parts of this movie are the characters portrayed by Jodie Foster and Kelly McGills.Try at your own risk - worth watching for Jodie Foster performance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Controversial look at womens rights in the liberated 1980's, focusing on a gang rape in a crowded bar. Film claims high ideals and explores the right of a woman to decline sexual advances at any stage, despite giving out signals of encouragement to dumb-ass males.'The Accused' has been highly praised because of its head-on tackling of its subject matter, but the film is crude and clumsy with Foster (as the victim) and McGillis (as her attorney) no better than adequate in stereotyped roles. The explicitness of the rape scene leaves a sour taste in the mouth, and questions whether the films intentions were anything more than cheap entertainment disguised by its claiming of the moral high-ground.Whilst not denying the important issues which the film may have brought into the public eye, looking at 'The Accused' purely through the cinematic lens it is a cheap sham. 'Straw Dogs' and even 'I Spit on your Grave' are both far superior.</fullReview>

Her miserable life, her dress, her drinking, her use of drugs shall all be used against her in a trial.She is angered when her attorney settles for a lower plea, but is up to the task when the former realized her mistake and will now prosecute those who provoked the brutal attack by their screaming and encouraging the participants.The rape scene is self is brutally staged but unfortunately that what was needed here.This hard-hitting drama reflects a tragic social issue of our times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of TV-movie-ish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster's performance is good and the gang rape scene at the end of the film is horrific, but the whole movie has the unfortunate feel of a made-for-TV movie. As Jarvis Cocker of Pulp sang, "A movie made for TV, with bad dialogue, bad acting, and no interest. Along with no story and no sex."Actually, I don't feel the movie was THAT uneventful (I just wanted to squeeze in the Pulp reference, to tell you the truth.) But the difficult subject matter is rendered tame with a boring court case and lots of "You can't win this trial!" dialogue between Kelly McGillis and her bosses. What's worse, the conclusion of the case of the case is never in doubt. Yawn.The movie is best when it focuses on how Sarah reacts to the rape. She is a fragile woman who acts braver than she is, and her struggle with the rape is rendered clearly and plainly on Foster's face and in her mannerisms. The scene in the record store is uncomfortable and disconcerting, as it should be.McGillis, though, isn't believable as the prosecutor. She is too bland, too unconvincing; she seems like a calculated attempt at a strong woman character. She never exists as anything more than "the lawyer."This could have been a very powerful film, one that conveys the pain and anguish of such a terrible crime. As it is, I had to settle for a few powerful moments and some toothless filler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same year Jodie Foster got an Oscar for "The Accused" Meryl Streep was nominated for "A Cry In The Dark" Both films climax in a court room. Look at Jodie and look at Meryl. Jodie (don't get me wrong she's always been one of my favourites) but her intelligence, her brain, overshadows her character's predicament. Her "anguish" in the witness box lacks the emotion it requires because there is something about Jodie that tells us, she is really on top of it. She is acting, beautifully, but acting. Meryl, on the other hand, is heartbreaking in the witness box in "A Cry In The Dark" the intelligence of the actress doesn't come to interfere with the character's. The actress is in total control. Jodie is a very good actress, Meryl is a genius. At the centre of "The Accused" is Jodie's brain, so compelling in "Silence of the Lambs" so distracting in "The Accused"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't watch many courtroom dramas. I've seen most of the great ones: 12 Angry Men, Witness for the Prosecution, To Kill a Mockingbird. Of all the ones that predate The Accused, Not many push as far into the red zone as this. As you go back through the decades of Hollywood cinema, films get more and more censored. In parts, The Accused is quite brutal. It would probably have seemed even more so to those who viewed it upon release 20 years ago. There are two trials in this movie. For the first, the accused persons have been charged with rape. For the second, the accused persons (different people) are charged with the crime of cheering it on (to put it in more casual terms). What the movie gives us a taste of is extremely inhumane, worse than murder even. That and two good actresses at the top of their game, results in a credible, involving courtroom drama. The screenplay is a tad over written in some places, so it's not a brilliant movie, but it is a fine specimen to sample for those who enjoy this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard film to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very hard watching this movie because it is such a shocking story. A girl is gang raped by 3 men in a bar, where a crowd of male customers are shouting, clapping and cheering it on like it's a show.Jodie Foster plays Sarah Tobias, the girl who is raped. She is not shown as this good virgin but someone who has made mistakes in the past and on the night she was raped but in no way deserved what happened to her. It is shown that before she was raped, she was drunk, had smoked pot, flirted with the men and even made a joke about taking one of them back to her trailer and sleeping with him in front of her boyfriend's face. It must have been a very demanding role for Jodie Foster to do, especially near the end of the film where we see a flashback of the rape and it is very realistic and goes a lot further than any other films about rape has. It must have been very hard for Jodie to do that sequence most of all. She is totally amazing in this role where her character comes across as tough but has a vulnerable side and doesn't have anyone to look out for her until Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) comes into her life.Kelly McGillis does start off as cool but as the story goes on, we see a compassionate woman who wants to stand up for Sarah's rights and wants to right the wrong she did when she accepted a plea bargain for the charge of reckless endangerment with Sarah's rapists. She then decides the only way she can make up for it, is to prosecute the men who egged the rapists on and feels she can prosecute them using the charge of criminal solicitation which means the rapists will stay in jail for the whole sentence.I liked the relationship between McGillis and Foster who are completely different people. Sarah is more loose, she's been arrested for drugs in the past, she smokes pot and drinks, she lives in a trailer park and is into astrology. Kathryn, on the other hand, comes across as squeaky clean, a goody-two shoes, conservative, educated in Law school, and is very middle-class. You wouldn't think these two could ever bond but they do over this case and end up caring for one another in a way neither thought they would.The film is very graphic and leaves nothing to the imagination in the rape sequence and the language that is used. The language during the rape when the crowd is shouting 'Hold her down', 'needle-dick', 'poke that pussy' is very colourful and cruel. It shows these men have a total disregard of the feelings for women, particularly the callous way they talk about the rape as being a show Sarah put on and the rapists were only following her actions and don't have any reason to feel guilty for what they did to her.It is a difficult film to watch but when the film ends, you have a positive feeling that justice has been served as the men who egged on the rape are just as bad and guilty as the rapists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>she's a pinball wizard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A girl is raped by a bunch of men in the game room of a bar, and they are cheered on by other drunks. No one wants to come forward about what they saw, and the girl's lawyer gives in easily by letting the men off on a lesser charge and lesser jail time. The victim is furious and feels even more trashy because she doesn't want these guys to walk away with the truth hidden. The lawyer then decides to prosecute the guys who cheered and supported the rape in order to make sure the truth comes out.This movie had a much deeper meaning and story than simply a rape. The victim here comes off as flirty and provocatively dressed and often times it makes it seem like they were "asking for it" and a girls character can really be hurt by that and this movie beautifully shows that no matter how you act, or dress, or even what you say has no justification on rape or doing something to someone when they tell you "no". It's rape pure and simple and these jerks that watched and cheered and did nothing are very responsible and very guilty too. The movie had many good messages and it's an honest depiction of rape and how people try to classify it in different ways, when in reality rape is rape and there are no innocent sexual abuse or rape cases out there.I thought Jodie did an amazing job, as did Kelly McGillis as her attorney. Bernie Coulson is also a great underrated star who did well here. Leo Rossi is such an annoying actor when he needs be and he did really well as one of the "cheerleaders" here. The direction was pretty good and the over all story was very nicely done. I think the thing I liked best was the victim's need to become a stronger woman after the events occurred, that really spoke to me, because it was almost like a passage into womanhood for her.I thought the movie was really good, it was honest and blunt and did well with telling the whole story without details and then at the end it had the courtroom drama, which I always love, and then the details come out and we here them from many peoples point of view. 4/10 stars - nice drama</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any other barflies out there?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 5 because it's a good movie. It keeps on moving and the tension keeps you interested. It increases constantly, the thought about getting the criminal rapists their due. The acting is good enough for the story and the moral lesson is powerful. But,,,,, are there any bars out there where something like this could even happen? This is supposedly based on a true story, though certain details have been left out and some even altered. I am a barfly, partly from prior work and social networking. My drinking is limited to 3 drinks on any night and I am personal friends with many other bartenders (having been one for almost 17 years). Unless the bar is practically empty and the bartender is in the back room loading up the roller with cases of beer for restocking, I don't see this story as even being possible. Almost every bar I've ever been in (and that's many) have a few early evening, middle, and late night regulars. Almost every one of them, if they saw something like this happening, would step in to stop it, or call the police. Other guys (and girls) would jump in and the scene wouldn't be pretty. The rapists would probably get their asses kicked, maybe crippled, maybe killed. I can picture it, "What the f*** are you doing? This is MY BAR!!!!!" People who are regulars at a bar don't want the bar to get shut down and they don't want police constantly walking in and looking suspiciously at them. Most regulars at a bar look at the other regulars as practically part of their family, even the ones they never talk to. Family members look after one another, even the slutty women, whether or not they have ever been to the bar before. --It's our second home!!! Don't even think about doing that f****** sh** in our house!!!!!!!!-- I can't help but wonder if there are any bars out in the REAL WORLD where this story could happen..??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I found interesting about "The Accused" - a film that's famous for the vicious rape of a young blue-collar woman - is just how they chose to go about making such a movie. You know going in that there's a bad scene, and that the rest of the movie deals with the repercussions. But the film begins immediately after the atrocity went down. We open with Jodie Foster desperately flagging down a ride to make good her escape, and flow right into the doctor's examination of her ghastly welts, claw marks and bruising. The tone is set without any on screen violence. Now, there's still a "bad scene" involved, but it doesn't happen until we've spent some time in the courtroom. It's a flashback, although the tension and foreboding have been ratcheted to obscene heights that it's still, to this day, beyond brutal (nauseating would be the better way to put it). The whole of the movie is not easy to watch, and it's one that doesn't hold a lot of replay value. But the reason to recommend it (and I'm sure it has been for 25 years) is the performances from the two leads. Both are exceptional, but Foster won that Oscar for a reason. At the center of this movie are two women who are fighting; one for her side of the story to be heard (after her character assassination in the eyes of the public), and the attorney who's out to help her find justice. "The Accused" is not as harrowing as "Leaving Las Vegas", but it's still no day at the beach. Regardless, should this movie ever come up in conversation, my recommendation will be based entirely on those performances from Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was brilliantly acted, by Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis, at least. However, it's also very hard to watch at times, not to mention infuriating, esp. the rape scene. On the other hand, certain scenes involving the justice system, are pretty angering as well. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie and very powerful, but anyone-male or female, with any compassion for rape victims regardless of the circumstances, and this "she was asking for it" doesn't fly well with me, either, only a chauvinist would think that! Well, once again, I'm obviously wrong because a lot of men think with the head below the waist instead of their brain. For the record, 98% of the time, I have little to no compassion for rapists, but I do believe slow-minded people can be forced into things, but that is clearly not the case in this film. These men knew exactly what they were doing, and didn't care, that infuriated me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster is a woman who gets gang raped at a pinball machine at a bar in this based on a true story movie that won Oscars. While at the first trial for rape, the perpetrators receive a light sentence, for what Foster believes to be because of her character and how she was dressed - the "she shouldn't have been out at night or dressed that way" excuse. She hires Kelly McGillis to charge the men again and it plays out in court. The movie gives different POV's and shows graphic details of the attack several times. Foster gives an outstanding performance. The actors who play the perpetrators are stereotypes however and it does diminish a bit from the overall film. The movie is a definite roller coaster ride and will stay with you afterwards. A sign of a good movie</fullReview>

I wondered if it would still hold up ? after all, it MIGHT be SO "Eighties", etc. First of all, Jodie Foster does NOT let it slip into a mere Period Piece. She brings seriousness to this harrowing story. Kelly McGillis does a good job as her lawyer, too. The power of this film lies somewhat in the photography, quite a lot in the story, and overwhelmingly in the performance of Foster, who takes it to SUCH a real level SO fast, that wasting time being distracted by a slightly thick musical score, or the fact that you are seeing late '80's fashions in a late 80's film (duh!) is quickly dismissed. This is High Art acting. It is also a film that should not be seen by younger children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen again..."A person is guilty of criminal solicitation if he commands, induces, entreats or otherwise persuades another person to commit a felony-"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Accused is directed by Jonathan Kaplan and written by Tom Topor. It stars Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis. Music is by Brad Fiedel and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.After Sarah Tobias (Foster) suffers a brutal rape in a road side bar one night, prosecutor Kathryn Murphy (McGillis) takes up the case to bring the perpetrators to justice. Including the ones who encouraged and cheered on the attack.Criminal Solicitation.Some have bemoaned The Accused as being a TV movie type production, while the thematic edge of Sarah Tobias being a "good time gal, even slutty", has caused consternation in highbrow circles. What garbage!Depressingly based around an incident that occurred in Massachusetts 1983, The Accused is still a powerful film watching experience over twenty years after it was released. It finds Kaplan and Topor refusing to sweeten the meal, it is what it is, uncompromising in detail whilst casting sleazy like shadows over the justice system and the marginalisation of Sarah Tobias. In fact, as an observation of the law, with its plea bargains and shifting around of character judgements and actions, it's a potent piece of cinema.Foster is terrific and completely deserved her Oscar win for Best Actress. She has Sarah as tough and demonstrative in her belief that justice has not been served, that because she likes a drink, a tug of weed and a flirt with the boys, she is fair game to be ganged raped whilst others cheer on like Neanderthals. The energy and raw emotion shown by Foster is fantastic and a lesson in acting that budding actresses should study. McGillis was overlooked for praise, but she also is wonderful, brilliantly written by Topor, Kathryn Murphy in McGillis' hands builds from a weary cynic at the beginning to a force of nature later in the courtroom. The scenes there between Foster and McGillis are enough to shatter your heart.Opening the film with a scene that sees Sarah screaming and fleeing from the bar, her clothes torn, the makers rightly show the actual rape at the end of the film in flashback form. It's harrowing and devastating, and the point where the picture achieves all the goals it set itself. If you are sitting there thinking about TV production value or predictability? Then quite frankly you really haven't been paying attention. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dominating Performance...Average Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gang rapists are brought to justice, but what about those loathsome, wretched, disgusting bystanders who vicariously and by proxy take part in the assault. This is the theme here and caring, sensitives will have little doubt that it is sinful if not illegal. Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance is, arguably, justified because she no less then dominates every scene she is in. However, this is partly due to the weakness of the film as a whole. The men accused, trial, and backdrop of the movie are all so flat, uninteresting and unremarkable it weakens the exposition and the actual rape scene seems exploitative.A social sickness ("a rape is reported in the US every 6 minutes") that certainly is ineffectually addressed and approached is in dire need of our attention and consultation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few performances in American cinema that are regarded as being the best of all time. This is one of them. When looked at a hundred years down the line, Jodie Foster's adult turn as a rape victim will be considered one of the best of her generation. In fact, Jodie Foster's performance is right behind Meryl Streep in "Sophie's Choice" as being one of the superlative, best performances of all-time American cinema. Bold, raw, nuanced, and carnal. Jodie Foster deserved every accolade she received for this film, including her "Best Actress" Oscar. Some of the film can be hard to watch, incredibly gut-wrenching rape scene and scenes where Jodie graphically describes what happened to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Accused is a film that accomplishes two wonderful things: 1) it tells a great story about the injustice of rape, which is done in a way that makes the story timeless, and 2) it showcases the great acting talent of Jodie Foster in perhaps her best performance.The film starts with Foster running out of local dive bar screaming and crying. It's a great entrance; and, you are immediately drawn into the story of her plight. The director uses great techniques to tell the story of what happened to Foster's character. One of the best ways is his use of interviews between the assistant DA (McGillis) and the dialogue of various characters who describe to her what happened that night to Foster. The Directer also makes great use of flashbacks by Foster and other characters. The story unfolds to the climax at the end of the film in a brilliant court scene.McGillis is also good as a DA who makes mistakes, but then attempts to redeem herself in the name of what is morally right.This is a great film with many interesting elements. I just watched this on May 3, 2007 after not having seen the film in probably 10 years and it is still as shocking and brilliant today as it was when it was made. If you happen to see The Accused listed to air on television, it is worth a look. Rating 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful performances that make viewers think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A warning for viewers: This contains a very realistic graphic depiction of rape. This movie is not recommended for those who would have serious emotional issues (beyond the normal reactions) with the subject matter, nor for anyone other than adults. The event depicted is allegedly based upon the rape of a woman in New Bedford, MA by several men in the mid 1970's.Never an easy topic, this movie does an excellent job of depicting the brutality of a gang rape of a woman by three men in a local bar, while others line up for their turn or cheer the violence on. Witness, victim, and rapist viewpoints are presented to form a complete picture of the events that took place.Foster's performance throughout is intense, to say the least. According to interviews subsequent to the movie, the rape scene was filmed in a single take, with nearly all of the male actors and crew members being devastated for hours afterwards. When you see the scene, you'll understand why. With only one exception, the acting of the cast was intense. McGillis' performance as ADA Katherine Murphy was less than stellar until the courtroom scene, and lacked the passion and intensity of the performances of others in the film.While the subject matter is a difficult one to portray, the writers and directors do a wonderful job of hand holding the viewer from start to finish. Lighting and camera angles are expertly used to portray the mood of the various scenes. The subject of the rape itself is portrayed from the victim's, rapists', and eyewitness' point of view. It shows how quickly things can spin out of control, and in particular how a mob mentality can overrule common decency and morality.The story line takes you from the crime, to the miscarriage of justice by an unsympathetic legal system, to the prosecution of those who goaded the gang rape. The testimony of a friend of one of the rapists who witnessed the crime is portrayed from his point of view. This is the scene that will likely provoke some controversy, as it is highly realistic. I was amazed that, with this scene, the movie got an "R" rating, and not an "NC-17" rating. There is nothing sexual, per se, about the scene. The directors and cast did an excellent job of portraying the true violence of rape itself.Had it not been for McGillis' unenthusiastic performance, I would have given this one a 10, but instead it got a 9 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad were the other nominees?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of never having done so, I recently watched Jodie Foster's "amazing" "performance" in "The Accused". Jodie's normally a darn fine actress, and it was bizarre to see such an absolutely awful performance from her. This was pure and simple bad acting, and one of the least impressive Oscar winning performances I've seen. The only positive about her performance is that she is (slightly) better than the cartoon characters that populated the bar and the cardboard cutout of Kelly McGillis they wheeled from one scene to the next.This film had a solid story, an important message to tell and what appeared to be a good screenplay, but a large chunk of this got lost somewhere in the mess of meaningful expressions and shouty overacting. The particularly appalling acted ending of the film appears to be a parody of the end of a Rocky movie. I was laughing for about ten seconds before I realized that it wasn't supposed to be funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great performance adds meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foster's performance makes a point to not let the audience off easy on this film: She is not trying to liked, or particularly vulnerable in any clichéd way. She simply -is- vulnerable, in fact, though not in the superficial sense of personal style, or in the deeper sense of self- esteem. And so, the viewer may find themselves facing the same confusion that a juror might have: Can a victim be so unsympathetic that they are no longer considered truly a victim? Perhaps a deeper film could have been made by not letting us -ever- view the rape scene, (where all doubt is removed for any rational person), but it is well done, and put off long enough in the altered time-line to give us a good chance to weigh some evidence on our own. As the character progresses, there is a duality of her actually becoming more of a sensitive person along with her learning how to be perceived in more positive light by the judge and jury. I found this intersection of real emotion and manipulation to be true to life. Personality itself is the tip of our personal iceberg, as superficial as a haircut, the part we manipulate to wend our way through life; changing is no more insincere than a new hairstyle would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable, But Not Oscar-Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this being somewhat of a controversial film when it came out, probably because the rape scene was too graphic for many people. The subject of rape, in itself, is not new to films so it must have been the way it was presented. (I am writing this from memory.) I do remember the scene as extremely uncomfortable to watch.In a nutshell, Jodie Foster plays a woman, "Sarah Tobias" who goes looking for trouble in a bar and gets much more than she bargained for, being gang-raped on top of a pinball machine. She then goes to court to prosecute the men involved.This was an out-and-out "women's lib movie" and since they are given favorable press by the politically-correct media, the film got extra publicity. Even for feminists, though, this story has too many holes in it to be as credible as we would like it to be. The had a female prosecutor, of course, and Kelly McGillis just didn't cut it in that role, just not convincing. Also, with Hollywood, when you hear "based" on a true story, you know facts will be few and far between and the dramatic parts will be very exaggerated. None of this implies, by the way, that the victim deserved what she got. In fact, I hope some women learned from this movie and never put themselves in a spot where something horrific like this could happen. Alcohol and sex desires are a lethal combination and a bar with a number of drunks is not where you want to start arousing people.Jodie Foster is a fine actress but I did question her winning an Oscar over this. Too much of the Academy Awards in the last two decades have become nothing but political forums (always favoring the latest left wing cause). In this case, the feminists were appeased. Foster has done better work in other films and not been recognized.Overall, I think this film is good for one viewing but a little too unpleasant for more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The accused truly is one of the best pieces of film I've ever seen in my life. First of all, Jodie foster just absolutely shines in her starring role. Jody really brings the emotion and the raw realness, I mean there is absolutely no doubt that her character was raped in the movie, her performance is so focused and it is absolutely heartbreaking, you will most definitely need to bring tissues if you decide to view this film. Kelly is amazing here too, she works absolutely tirelessly for Jodie and her case, and you can see the clear dedication in her character to bring true, honest justice. The dialogue and the script is so top notch and it really brings the entire movie to life. The movie also brings the issue of rape to life, it shine some light on rape victims and the entire issue of rape and how it affects the victims. It also shows that no participant should ever be let off the hook or get away, because truthfully, even if you don't physically rape someone if you cheer them on, then you are participating, and you are just as guilty as the actual rapist(s). This movie depicts that rather graphically in one scene, which was 100% needed and necessary for the movie, it needed to depict and show the actual assault in order for the audience to get the full/entire affect of that occurred. I definitely recommend the accused to mature audiences that can handle the tough subject matter and want to see a fantastic drama.</fullReview>

Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) is the deputy district attorney taking the case. She is not happy with her drunkenness and drug test. They return to find the rapists still at the bar. Sarah is not the perfect victim and Kathryn is pessimistic about a conviction with no friendly witnesses. Kathryn does a deal angering Sarah. After Sarah is hospitalized confronting one of the cheering witnesses, Kathryn decides to charge the others who cheered on the rape.Jodie Foster is simply magnificent. She probably has less screen time than Kelly McGillis but her performance is on full power. She doesn't play an easy character. It is a fully realized complicated character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where to draw the line?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Accused is a powerful movie to educate the ignorant world about the law. The movie focuses on the fact that it is not only a crime to commit a rape, but it also a crime to induce, persuade, and convince a person to continue or and commit a rape. The second thing that this true story focused on was, no matter how you dress, how you act, how many lovers you've had, how you talk, or where you live, you deserve a fair trial, fair treatment, and justice like anyone else. The most brilliant thing about this film is they showed the actual rape scene. Once you see it, you have a whole new perspective on things.Foster received a well-deserved Oscar as her fearless performance of Sarah. There is a graphic rape scene towards the closing of the film that is to be expected since the main theme of this film is about the outcomes of a terrible and vicious rape. McGillis's character seeks justice from the men who raped her in a downtown bar and even goes after the men who watched and cheered on the rape and did nothing to stop it. Tom Topor wrote the outstanding screenplay. His heroine is not a clean cut responsible person but a flawed woman trying to make a living and a life. This is more realistic than other films that would have a perfect Sarah.Once you've seen this movie, you'll never forget it. It's no wonder Foster won an Oscar for this movie.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Yes. The answer is yes. But that is really beside the point.We know the classic story: someone is assaulted and then their personal life, their alcohol habits, their outfit come into question. That story is well-known. But this film takes it a step further: what about those who witness a crime and refuse to stop it, possibly even encouraging it? An interesting legal question, to be sure. But how will it play out in court? And does the way it plays out in the film mirror how it would go in real life? I suppose these are some philosophical, legal questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS*** Film version of the disturbing gang rape that took place in New Bedford MA. in 1983 who's shocking repercussion's are still with us today thirty years after the terrible event. Going out to have a good time at a local Bar, The Mill, after a fight with her live in drug dealing boyfriend Larry, Tom O'Brian, 21 year old Sarah Tobias, Jodie Foster, ends up getting gang raped in the bar's game room on top of the "Slam Dunk" pinball machine. With the case against Sarah's attackers weak in her being a wild and crazy kid involved in drugs and sex parties her attackers end up with nothing more then a slap on their wrists if anything at all. Feeling abused by her attackers and abandonment by the law Sarah get's the assistant D.A Kathryn Murphy, Kelly McGillis, who prosecuted the case to re-try them as well as those patrons in the bar that evening that egged them on in attacking her.With at first hesitant to re-try the case Murphy suffering from guilt feeling in letting her client Sarah Tobias down went full blast to get her justice in the crime that she suffered at the hand of her attackers. Being a somewhat loose woman with a criminal, drug passion, record it took more then court expertise and knowledge of the law to get Sarah the justice that she so rightly deserved. It took an eye whiteness to the gang rape local boy, and good friend of one of the rapists, Ken Joyce, Bernie Coulson, to brake the case wide open: In both Sarah Tobias and Kathryn Murphy's favor.Shocking in not only the crime that was committed in the film but how the victim of the crime was made as if she was the guilty party in bringing up her lifestyle that was anything but perfect. This tactic is used in the defense in many likewise rape trials by defense attorneys in trying to get their clients off: In blaming the victim not the victimizer. In truth the real life story of Sarah Tobias, really Cheryl Araujo, didn't end as happily as in the movie. Forced by threats and intimidation to leave her home in New Bedford with her husband and three children, she wasn't the loose and pot smoking party girl depicted in the film, Cheryl was killed three years later in a car accident while driving her three young daughters to a Christmas party in Miami Florida.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As for plot and theme, several more interesting court-related dramas have been made before and after -- although it is based on real events. Moreover, there are no distinguishing actors or actresses apart from Foster; even Kelly McGillis is just average. The issue is painful and the movie gives food for thought (it is said the rape was first openly discussed in the movie in question), but the outcome was predictable and there were no sudden twists in the events. This is not the movie you will watch over and over again and find new angles and nuances. Recommended to fans of Foster and/or strong female characters.</fullReview>

While everybody knows rape is a heinous crime, the message here is that no matter how provocatively a woman dresses or how flirtatious her behavior, "no" means "no." A valid point, but the film goes overboard in trying to drive this message home, making the victim a low-life floozy who was drunk and high when the crime occurred. Although well made, it feels like a contrived by-the-numbers exercise. Foster won an Oscar for this, but her performance is uneven and unnatural; it seems too much like she's acting.

		<fullReview>Not to get all political, but this movie, now 25 years old ? and still one of my all-time favorites, holds up today. Meaning, I've been hearing a lot of recent chatter from a lot of outspoken conservative stations and advocates that women that dress proactively probably deserves the rape she got.Now, I'm sure that's a select few radicals ? and sad, pathetic and misled idiots ? but, that's what The Accused is mostly about.Enter Jodie Foster's first well-deserved Oscar for Sarah Tobias. She's partying, drinking and doping at a dive bar when a trio of bad men gang rape her, in the bar, in plain sight. Enter (should've also won an Oscar) Kelly McGillis as DA lawyer Kathryn Murphy who cares about winning a case against the rapists. Unfortunately for Sarah, this slam-dunk win would involve plea bargaining and lessens the meaning of justice and level of pain Sarah had to endure.In one of my all-time favorite scenes, and one that chokes me up each and every time I revisit this movie, Sarah confronts Kathryn in her home at Kathryn's high-class dinner party and lets her know she has no feelings. I just summed it up, without trying to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.But, it needed to be printed, because that's the main course of the film: Justice, and redemption, for Sarah, means getting ice-cold Kathryn to melt a little and fight harder for Sarah and any woman that never, ever deserves to be raped.Of course, the movie portrays Sarah as "a low life, trailer-trash, pot-smoking drunk," but never once?there's NEVER A MOMENT that I ever switch sides and feel she deserved it. I've been a juror twice ? and an alternative once, and I know you have to listen to all the evidence first, but it would be extremely hard for me to not immediately make up my mind within the opening remarks.That all said, this is a powerful, interesting, emotionally driven and thought provoking film that should be seen by all. It's incredibly well shot and absolutely had Oscar-worthy performances by the two leads."You don't understand how I feel! I'm standing there with my pants down and my crotch hung out for the world to see and three guys are sticking it to me, a bunch of other guys are yelling and clapping and you're standing there telling me that that's the best you can do. Well, if that's the best you could do, then your best sucks! Now, I don't know what you got for selling me out, but I sure as sh|t hope it was worth it!" ?

		<fullReview>The Accused came at a time when attitudes towards sex crimes was very much changing. It is commendable that it is actually so even handed, Jodie Foster's character goes to the police who believe her and their investigation is faultless. After we get into the courts things get trickier, Kelly McGillis DA must balance the demand for a trial with the appeal for a plea bargain which will spare the victim the ordeal and have more certainty of a conviction. Is she right or is she wrong? Once we get to the part where they start to prosecute the other bar patrons for cheering on the rapists you're really placed in a moral quandary, should these men be prosecuted even though they placed no part in the crime? Did they in a dark and noisy bar having been drinking all night even realise what was going on?Goes without saying that we have terrific performances from Foster and McGillis (whatever happened to her? with this, Top Gun and Witness she was a massive star in 1980s but then just seemed to stop making films altogether?). It's a brave decision in that Foster's character to basically be the DA's nightmare witness, admitting that she was drunk and drugged, had been dressed provocatively and dancing suggestively with her attackers (her strengths are that she has visible injuries and reported the crime immediately). The rape scene itself is horrible (never actually watched it, just fast forwarded through)but necessary to bring home the enormity of the crime.The ending is pretty downbeat and somehow a little disappointing although what did we expect? A good film although hard to watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The female leading star deserved her (second) Oscar for playing the famous Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, and I had always wanted to see the film that she won her first Oscar, because I heard about what it was about, and I definitely didn't miss out on it. Based on true events, the film opens at a bar, young woman Sarah Tobias (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jodie Foster) is running out frantically, while a young man is calling from a telephone box on the opposite side of the road to call the police about an incident, and going to the nearest hospital she is covered in blood and severe bruises, she confirms that she was raped while other drunk spectators cheered it on. District attorney Kathryn Murphy (Top Gun's Kelly McGillis) is assigned to defend her in her case, and off-screen she is successful in putting the gang of rapists, but after this the case is dropped after a plea bargain is made with the guilty men, but this only angers the young woman. Sarah is enraged by this deal, and more specifically because she has not spoken to a court room with her witness statement, but, after a car accident involving one of the men who was cheering in the bar, the case is reignited to attempt the prosecution of the three men who were cheering and solicited the rape. Sarah's friend Sally Fraser (Ann Hearn) works as a waitress at the bar and gives her witness statement in court, that she was aware that a rape was going on but feared to intervene, but she confirms the identities of the men who were cheering it on Kurt (Kim Kondrashoff), Danny (Woody Brown) and Bob Joiner (Steve Antin), they have three attorneys to defend them. Sarah is then called in and questioned by Kathryn to give her personal recollection of the night where she was gang raped, describing in graphic detail what the men penetrating and restraining her and her being helpless to stop it or call for help, and of course recalling the men who cheered it all on. Then the key witness Kenneth 'Ken' Joyce (Bernie Coulson), the young man who called from the telephone box and a supposed friend of the accused men, is called to stand, and as he describes his version of events a flashback shows the entire night as it happened, from beginning to end (the point where the film opened), where Sarah was dressed rather provocatively, held down on the pinball machine, and one at a time raped by three or so men while those accused watched. The testimony from the defence is given to try and convince the jury to allow three "innocent" men to go free, but of course Kathryn fights hard to make it clear that what happened to Sarah cannot be called "nothing", do everything she can to convince them that the young woman was raped and that the men did indeed watch, laugh and encourage it to happen unwatched by the other bar occupants, and in the end the three men are all found guilty and not given parole, so Sarah and Kathryn happy justice is served. Also starring Leo Rossi as Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrect, Carmen Argenziano as D.A. Paul Rudolph, Tom O'Brien as Larry, Peter Van Norden as Attorney Paulsen and Terry David Mulligan as Lieutenant Duncan. McGillis is pretty good as the lawyer who is at first resilient but then determined to get to the bottom of the rape case and prove the truth, but of course the film is all about Foster who is absolutely superb as the young woman abused by both hideous sexual assault and the law system but comes through as a moving and equally determined victim. The story is well written, performed and paced, the court room scenes are as gripping as any I have seen before in other films of a similar standard, and the subject matter means that there are some disturbingly explicit hard to watch moments, but this all combined makes it a distinctive and compelling drama. Jodie Foster was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Above Average Crack at Direct Film Polemics Which Plays With the Audience's Preconceived Notions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pertaining to the vast majority of mainstream movies, the audience historically has identified with the male hero's desire for the female, voyeuristically, and with his exertive resolve of the story, narcissisitically. A big consequence is that women are hardly ever foremost to film plots or shown as able to undertake dramatic predicaments by themselves. Yet they are usually vital to film spectacle. This above average crack at direct film polemics plays with us, depending on that preconceived notion.When you see Jodie Foster dancing next to the pinball machine, curve-hugging jean skirt, bra strap hanging down her arm, a little drunk, a little stoned, deliberately arousing the attention of the men in the bar, to turn them on, face it. You get half-stocked, at least. Naturally we want her. But what happens to her as a result of that very same desire shared by the men on screen comes to make us aware of ourselves, and the scene to which the whole film has been building up is that much more absorbing in how deeply unsettling it is, because our fascination is reinforced by prior inclinations of fascination already at work within us and the social forms that configure us.The opening scenes begin the instant following the rape, as Foster is ushered into emergency supervision and legal entities, where she encounters authorities and experts who are attentive and effective, but not gushing with compassion. Then she meets the assistant district attorney who will handle her case, played by Kelly McGillis. McGillis is not dazzled by some of the things she learns, such as Foster's past arrest for drug possession, or her drinking on the night in question. And one of the rape suspects is a young fratboy whose parents enlist a good lawyer. McGillis acquiesces to shave the charge to aggravated assault. Foster feels swindled. She was physically ransacked, barbarously, over and over again, with copious others present. It was not aggravated assault. And the presentation of the movie is that even if a young woman is behaving recklessly, let alone what a court may perceive as bad social form, she still has the liberty and reason to say no and be heard. This is something that by now is widely understood as obvious by most, the McGillis character has trouble grasping at first. She is so complacent among the casual bartering of the judicial system that she has lost some of her competence to discern real injustice.The film is hindered from being as powerful as it could have been by Jane Fonda's decline to play McGillis's role. McGillis does not give a bad performance. She just goes through the motions of the role's conventions. Fonda would have made that role come spicily alive. Aside from that peeve, not to mention a music score that would've probably felt more at home in a movie made for television, this is a very potent drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Means No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty decent movie in its direction (Jonathan Kaplan) and its principal performances (Jodie Foster, as a gang-rape victim, and Kelly McGillis is the prosecuting Assistant District Attorney).In the opening scene we see Foster running out of a bar and onto a highway, sobbing, her dress torn. She's been raped by three young men on top of a pinball machine while a dozen others stand around and cheer. One young college student is appalled, however, and drops a dime on the others. Justice winds up being served.The obvious point of the movie is that not all rape victims need to be saints to deserve our sympathy. Jodie Foster plays a sluttish waitress who lives with some tattooed moron, drinks too much beer, and smokes dope. And after she cuts her own long blond hair in a spiky fashion, she looks like hell. On top of that, she's so ensconced in her working-class world that, when McGillis is driving her home from the hospital, she turns to the lawyer and asks in her croaking voice, "Did you go to college?" College, for Foster's character, is as remote as the planet Neptune.Charges are brought against the three rapists and McGillis, at the insistence of her boss (Carmen Argenziano), plea bargains them down to a guilty plea to reckless endangerment, not rape, because the boys don't want a sexual assault on their record. When Foster learns about this, she erupts with anger and accuses McGillis of selling her out. Foster wanted them convicted of rape, not reckless endangerment, although the sentences are identical.McGillis, fraught with guilt, decides to prosecute the onlookers for encouraging the crime by clapping, shouting, and offering encouragement. There follows a sharp argument with the D.A. who tells her to go ahead and throw her career away because, win or lose, McGillis is fired. The jury brings in a guilty verdict and three of the onlookers wind up in the slams.The strong performances bring out the weaknesses of the film, and they're simple flaws, easily avoided by a writer or director willing to challenge more than the rather mindless observation that some rape victims aren't perfect.All the men are bad and all the women are good, or at least well intentioned. The rapists are horrible of course. (I've always wondered how a man who is drunk and stoned can beat a woman into submission and still achieve an erection, let alone maintain one.) The onlookers, free to walk the streets, are remorseless. They follow the victimized Foster around. They taunt her and call her filthy names when they meet her in stores. They ridicule her and block her exit from the parking lot. They're ugly too.That's the second main point established by the movie -- men are beasts, from the loathsome rapists on up to the District Attorney -- and you can only trust another woman to jeopardize her own welfare for your sake. The message reeks of political correctness and is offensive to anyone of taste and perception. Life simply doesn't work that way and presenting reality so structured is a betrayal of art, although it would fit nicely into a Saturday morning children's cartoon. Granted, though, that the world might well be a better place if we could find some kind of antidote to all that testosterone.None of this vitiates the film's many virtues. Nice location shooting. And effective performances from everyone involved, including the men who are villains, pragmatists, and weaklings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrenching And Gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wrenching and clever, THE ACCUSED is about justice in all its flaws and wonders. Jodie Foster is the victim of a brutal gang rape who feels sold out by the legal wheeling and dealing of her lawyer, Kelly McGillis. With the rapists already behind bars for "reckless endangerment", McGillis agrees to go after the pathetic barflies who egged on her aggressors.THE ACCUSED is equal parts gripping and disturbing, and in several key areas. It's a film about the indignities of victimization, as painfully exemplified in Foster's post-rape medical exam. It's a film about courage, seen in McGillis' selfless determination to help Foster and in the key witness's stepping forward against a close friend. And it's a film about how our contemporary legal system cheapens victims all in the name of expediency.Though famous for Foster's Academy Award-winning performance, THE ACCUSED deserves to be remembered for its own merits. It is an important film, rare in that it grabs you and seldom lets you go.</fullReview>

I think maybe it's because it really effected me so deeply. It is brutal and tough to watch in spots, but well worth it. It handles a very difficult subject very tactfully, but unflinchingly. We not only feel for Tobias, but we also care about her attorney, Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis), who goes through her own set of problems because of the controversial nature of the lawsuit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Film Deserving Of The Oscars It Won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Accused is a powerful film to be commended for taking a controversial subject and bringing it onto the screen.Jodie Foster performs her best role as Sarah Tobias who is gang-raped. Kelly McGillis plays the prosecutor Kathryn Bigelow. The film is very powerful, just the right length and full deserving of the accolades it has been given.Rape is a very controversial subject and this film reminds us that for the most, the onus is on the woman to prove she didn't consent. As a male, I do not agree with that. I equally think that in a court of law, a man should have to prove he was satisfied that the woman consented. I don't want to get into the ins and outs of such a heinous crime as rape but the good thing about this film is that it reminded us of how terrible rape is.Throughout the film we see the effect on the victim and how she reacted to it. I used to work in a court here in my country in a clerical role and sometimes it seemed that the powers that be forgot about the consequences for the victim. This film shows us the mental scars that are left on a woman after being raped. It is important for us as people to remember that criminals may serve sentences but victims of crime more often than not serve life sentences. A criminal may leave jail after ten years, a victim is trapped in their own personal jail for life.The film was very entertaining and deserved to win the awards it did. Whilst a film's primary role should be to entertain, a film such as this can have a good role in highlighting such an important issue. I would include this film on a top ten list of 'MUST SEE MOVIES.'One more thing, I notice one IMDB user commented that Jodie Foster should have played the prosecutor and Kelly McGillis should have played the victim. That is a good idea and I think that would have worked well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to understand why Jodie Foster won the Academy Award for this movie. Her outstanding acting is certainly one of the highlights in this movie dealing with the theme of rape. The character she plays is a very rough person, a bit vulgar too, and most likely not the type of person you'd want your kids to hang around with. Yet Jodie Foster plays her role as a gang-raped woman so convincing, so real and so powerful that it's hard not to sympathize with her.The overall movie is excellent too. It's one of the very few movies of it's kind that do manage to show what a rape is really like. And it tells a simple message, one often heard before: It doesn't matter whether one dresses up provocative or tells sex-jokes or whatever. No means No. But seldom this message is conveyed so powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING-SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!!The accused is an extraordinary film and one of my all time favorites. It's a very Very gripping movie starring Jody Foster and Kelly McGillis. The movie portrays a rape victim(Foster) who is gang raped in a bar and her Attorney(McGillis) makes the decision to prosecute the men who cheered the attack on. This movie was very well done and very moving.(It is based on a true story.) as well. It featured excellent acting, knock out performances by everyone particularly the two female leads. Foster won the Oscar for her performance but I think the movie itself should have been nominated as well.This movie was somewhat controversial, I remember when a group of us saw this picture we all had a spirited argument on whether the "eggers on" should in fact have been punished(I said yes). It's a tough,tough movie to watch, the rape scene is very graphic, Foster is just amazing, maybe hard to watch but gripping and important to view.The attitudes of many toward rape victims, today, sadly are still somewhat disturbing, the "blame the victim" mentality is still very much alive. The Accused is very realistic in showing that but then again as mentioned it is based on a true story.There was a comment or 2 that mentioned such a tale was highly impossible. Actually it isn't. Rape is a very common occurrence and can happen anywhere. Also I did not see this film as man bashing at all(there were some comments that mentioned this as well). The movie was not saying all men are capable of rape. Rather the opposite actually, in fact it is a male who winds up saving the day.All in all a film not to be missed. 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT ***This is an odd movie. From what I had heard, I had thought it would be about rape, questions of consent derived from behavior and dress, and the beliefs of the rapists regarding whether consent was withheld - given her behavior.It's not.The central focus of the movie is whether non-rapists are guilty of solicitation of a crime due to what they said (cheered, yelled, etc.).The definition of solicitation given in the movie is whether the defendant "induces, entreats, persuades, encourages" a crime to be committed. Thus, the central questions in the movie should be:a) the persuasive relationship between the rapist and the defendant cheering - did each defendant "induce" or "persuade" this particular rape - or would it have been committed anyway? andb) did each defendant know that WHAT he was egging on - i.e. rape - or was he too far to see, or it too noisy to hear, that she was struggling moments after she had been kissing the first of her rapists?Obviously there's nothing illegal under this statute with urging multiple sexual partners to step up and have sex with Foster ("make her moan" was one phrase) if the speaker believes that she would consent to the sex - after all, the crime is of persuading another to commit a crime.The way the movie presents the action, it is clear that each of the men having sex with her could tell from her struggle that she was not consenting - they were raping her.Yet the crime in this courtroom drama is about the cheering - and it seems clear that no one persuaded the first rapist to push something far beyond what Foster was willing (indeed, eager) to undertake. This first rape would have happened in an empty room. Moreover, the first rape is under way before the cheering begins.Whether the second rapist would have committed this crime without crowd encouragement is unclear. He seems pretty eager regardless.However, the third rape clearly seems influenced by the crowd behavior -they chant his name, etc. But were all those yelling for the third man to have sex with her - aware that it was rape, rather than more sex, for which they were yelling? The particular yells are ambiguous about knowledge of her consent (e.g., "make her moan" or "Kurt, Kurt, Kurt!", etc.). Thus, the speakers' knowledge depends on their distance to see and hear her struggle.Unfortunately the movie doesn't clearly show each of the defendants, where they were standing during each of the rapes, and what they were yelling. Naturally it would all seem a horrible blur to Foster (who so testified).Yet these must be the key issues for a movie centering on this crime.Unfortunately, the defense counsel in the movie are never shown trying to differentiate cheers or yelling during the first rape (in which the rape seems likely to have occurred regardless whether anyone else was in the room) and that preceding the later rapes.The viewer is naturally thinking about whether the rapists would have committed the rape without the yelling of others ("induce ... persuade") - but the movie doesn't address these issues central to the crime at the heart of the drama.Unfortunately too, the movie does not really go into the issue of awareness of the crime. Perhaps most people have seen instances of sex in public, and virtually everyone is aware of instances of consensual sex while being held down (even bound and gagged). So how does one know it's rape?It seems less clear - because the movie does a poor job of differentiating two of the defendants - whether each defendant was in a position to see more than a sexily clothed and dancing woman now having sex on the pinball machine and being held down. For example, the men at the door seem too far away to know that this was rape rather than giddy sexual dominance and submission in public (until the rape is over - when she kicks and runs away).This movie seems confused. At the end of the movie, there is a statistic on the screen about the frequency of rape - yet we have not seen a courtroom drama about rapists.There is another statistic about the frequency with which rape involves two assailants - yet none of the defendants in this courtroom drama were assailants - none seem to have touched her - and assault was not the crime in the courtroom trial.Jodie Foster's performance is spectacular - particularly during the bar scenes - she gives an electrifyingly sexy performance while playing pinball and dancing. Throughout the movie, she seems completely believable as an ignorant, flirtatious girl who likes fornication, but naturally wishes to control the place, time and identity of that evening's sexual partner.Unfortunately, Kelly McGillis is given little to do - and fails to think of anything to make her role interesting. She had been a bigger star than Foster when the movie was released (1988) but I think this was her last big starring role.McGillis has a bovine quality in this movie - large, dull, slow-moving, placid. Given the inherently dramatic possibilities afforded the Foster character - and the superiority of Foster's acting ability - I think the actresses should have switched roles.Foster would probably have made the prosecutor's role interesting - and McGillis would have been an interesting choice for the sexy working-class rape victim. The victim's character is so interesting by itself, that McGillis would have been far more watchable.The movie often seems poorly thought out -E.g., why are the prosecutors so adamant that McGillis prosecute the rapists (when she is reluctant due to poor and unidentifiable witnesses) - when they are later so insistent that the solicitation statute is inapplicable?E.g., Foster's character's best friend's behavior is APPALLING (simply leaving when she sees Foster on her back on the pinball machine) - yet the movie gives us no sense of why this is so. Upon seeing Foster on her back with an entire room full of yelling men, Foster's supposed best friend not only fails to rush to her side or to yell anything, fails to tell the bartender or any other employee, she FAILS EVEN TO CALL THE POLICE. She just goes home. Why? The movie doesn't tell us.Does the screenwriter not realize that the viewer will wonder if the waitress thought that Foster (who'd made a joke about "f***ing the eyes out" of the man who rapes her ten minutes later) was consenting - or that she was too far to see that Foster was struggling - as were the men standing where she was? The viewer may wonder if the waitress thought Foster was simply engaged in an outrageously public sexual act -and therefore so did some of the men watching, hooting and hollering. I don't think the movie intends us to so wonder - but there's no explanation for the waitress' inability to call anyone.E.g., the atmosphere in this movie does not seem like Seattle - but like the urban East Coast or Midwest. Gritty surroundings throughout - with a very urban tough accent by Foster that sounds NOTHING like the Pacific Northwest. I kept thinking "Seattle"? It seems more like New Bedford or Flint, Youngstown or Chester Pa., Bath Me. or Troy N.Y., Paterson N.J. or Worcester Mass. Seattle????The movie's premise raises interesting questions about the extent of Constitutional protection of speech, the culpability of those who use speech during the commission of a crime, the knowledge of non-participants about whether a crime is being committed. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow through. It seeks instead to rely on the viewer's sympathy for the victim's degradation and fear of a mob. These are fairly easy plays for sympathy.So, I'd recommend this movie for Foster's performance - but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster sears the screen as a gang-rape victim, but no director has yet figured out how to film a rape sequence without it coming across as sensational or titillating to some pervy audiences. This assault in a bar, complimented with flashing pinball machine lights and a hunky attacker's thrusting rear-end, is prettied up for no apparent reason, and the other attackers and various on-lookers don't ring true. Kelly McGillis, playing the prosecutor who brings the rape's ringleaders to trial, is another problem: harried, breathy and fake-dramatic, McGillis doesn't so much create a character as she does reinforce a legal stereotype. Foster holds this one together with her Oscar-winning performance and, although I didn't find her a particularly convincing drunk, she pulls off the trampy side of her character admirably well and really gets into the rage of Sarah Tobias. Jonathan Kaplan's direction is a bit pedestrian; he keeps focusing on things that don't matter (such as McGillis' strained relationship with her co-workers, who seem to do little but walk up and down the office aisles). The movie wants to pack a powerful punch (and ends with rape statistics that are sobering if unnecessary). However, if one viewer out there secretly finds the rape sequence 'hot' instead of disturbing, this picture fails to do its job. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flirtatious and mini-skirted young women who is "slightly the worse for drink and soft drugs" is gang-raped on a bar's pinball machine, but are the non active on-lookers guilty of a crime too? Inspired by a real life crime-celeb.The wooden Kelly McGillis plays the adventurous go-getting prosecuting council and - in near perfect contrast - the versatile and talented Jodie Foster plays the central crime victim. Foster won an Oscar for a sensitive performance of a less-than-perfect person who has had very bad things happen to her. I agree with her award, even though this is a unpleasant and ramshackle film. *IMPORTANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION STARTS*I have to review the film as a total piece of fiction because the difference between the "inspirational" case and the one presented on celluloid are (bar the instance of unquestionable gang rape) so totally different.Big Dan's Bar - the now closed real crime scene - was a disreputable dive ignored by everyone but hard drinking immigrant types. Not a jot like the modern preppy student bar presented in this film.Crime investigation showed that the victims income was much boosted by social security fraud and was well known locally as "a vamp" (a very kindly way of putting it) who often turned her back on her own children in search of a party. This isn't to diminish the fact that she was also the victim of a horrific crime - for which the actual perpetrators received appropriate sentences - but because we deserve to know these facts for comparing-and-contrasting reasons. She died soon after in an unrelated motor accident.The case got nationwide publicity mostly because of false reporting. The bar was not crowded - there may only have been less than 12 people present - and it is possible (sparing you the technical detail) that some were present were genuinely ignorant of on-going events. It certainly didn't feature the crowds of cheering on-lookers that the media had originally seized upon. Ironically some of the sensational pre-trial misreporting of the case - which both sides of the argument took time to dismiss for the benefit of the newspaper reading jurors - reappears in this "fictionalised" film!*IMPORTANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ENDS*This is, on the face of it, a simple movie with a simple message. But the more you think about it, the more you realize how false and dangerous it is. Rape is a terrible crime and my heart goes out to all that suffer it. Be they male or female. It is violence that is both physical and psychological.However this film wants to spread the guilt to everyone short of the victims' dressmaker and this is not fair to everyday reality. Naturally the film makes it own environment - but even in this it fails to prove its own case "beyond reasonable doubt."The Accused argues that on-lookers with no possible way of knowing a crime was about to be committed, and play no active part in it, are equally guilty by not lifting a finger to prevent it.Crudely we have two types of "do nothings" - people that encourage vocally and those that simply do nothing but look on. How on earth could a court distinguish between these types without credible independent witnesses? Or is the victim able to divide them while being both being attacked?There are no women (apart from the victim) present. Women are half of the population and they are present in the main bar itself - but are totally absent in the "games room" where the attack takes place. Nor is their any kind of (visible) security monitoring or CCTV security which any bar insurer would insist upon. Very - Hollywood - convenient. To make things even more bizarre the (working) waitress friend of the victim mistakes the sexual act as consenting and takes no steps to interrupt it or call the police. Despite one of the rapists gagging Foster's mouth with his hand! Confused - I certainly am!(Let's be frank, if that had been a male bar worker it would have been read as another crime witness that was looking the other way!)The reason why this film was made is that it addresses rape through freak show sensation and cutting edge law. A more normal date rape - the stats for which are included in the closing titles - would be of no interest to Hollywood.I came in to this film thinking that the mainstream couldn't take on and do justice to a tough subject like gang rape and I now know it for certain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the movie was extremely well done and Jodie Foster probably deserved the Oscar she won. I thought the well publicized rape scene was unnecessarily graphic and way too long. We didn't need to see it (late in the film as a flashback) to appreciate the pain she went through.This movie, like so many others, moved progressively toward a jury verdict. As the climax of the film, it certainly hurts how I rate the movie when, in my opinion, the verdict was preposterous. Of course we knew what the verdict would be, but I hoped that somehow it would be different - though difficult to reconcile.SPOILER WARNING: The trial was not about the rapists, but rather about the ones who watched and participated via encouragement - a felony. The jury found all three accused "encouragers" guilty. Though, we as an audience, certainly know they were guilty and we hope they get their just due, it just doesn't begin to hold up that a real jury would have found them guilty in a court of law.1) There were at least 20 people watching at all different levels of encouragement. Where do you draw the line. And, that presupposes that you can state with absolute certainty what person went to what degree along that line. How could these three have been separated from the others for a felony is beyond me.2) In order to be convicted of "encouraging" a rape, you have to first prove in a court of law that there WAS a rape. That was never done. In fact, the only court documentation was that the three "rapists" had been convicted of an "assault" charge. The whole point of that plea bargain was that it specifically omitted any implication of a sexual crime. So, there is no way the bystanders could be convicted of encouraging a rape, when it had not been legally established.3) Most importantly. There is no possible way that it could be definitively proven that these three bystandards KNEW that she was being raped. There certainly was enough subjectivity in the scene (thus the court testimony) that would make it impossible to KNOW that each of these men knew that she was being raped. If they did not know there was a felony being committed, then there was nothing illegal about their cheering! If they thought that she was just having a good time with these three guys, then they may be pigs for watching and cheering, but hardly criminals.Summary: There is no way in the world that they would have been found guilty as the movie portrayed it. No way! A jury of twelve people unanimously stating that beyond any reasonable doubt, they were guilty. No way. Unfortunately, this is not just like some minor issue I have with part of the plot. This is THE VERDICT - the climax - the whole point of the movie. Considering, I would have given it a 9 had the verdict been "not guilty", I really am being easy on it by giving it an 8. And, considering the average imdb voter gave it a 7.3, I am being really generous.</fullReview>

Does dressing and acting provocatively mean that you deserve to get raped?This film addresses the moral issues attached to rape very effectively, and features excellent performances from Kelly McGillis as the District Attorney tasked with pursuing the line most likely to meet with success, and from Oscar-winning Jodie Foster as the victim.This is disturbing stuff, but it is well written and brilliantly performed. It will leave you with considerable food for thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After channel surfing for a while I settled upon this movie as I quite enjoy the work of actress Jodie Foster. It is interesting to see her as a well known actress here but not yet enjoying the prominence and quotable lines that Clarice Starling brought her.A couple of the themes explored in this film are the group behavior of males and how easily they seem to be influenced by a psychopathic but overpowering minority.It also illustrates the issue that the onus seems to be on the woman to prove events no matter how condemning the perpetrators actions were.There is the taunting of the victim as well which seems to cause the heckles to rise in the watcher.A sombre footnote at the completion of the film seems to highlight the motivation for the story to feature as a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing subtle about Jonathan Kaplan's powerful story of the terrible gang rape of Sarah Tobias. His method is unrelenting as he slowly builds to the horrible climax.Jodie Foster plays young Sarah, a girl who is no innocent, as she went to a bar, got drunk, smoked pot and was very flirtatious. But from there things went frighteningly wrong. The strong come on turned into sexual abuse as Sarah was violated in the worst way imaginable. Foster gives a stand out performance and thoroughly deserved her first Oscar. All the supporting cast are also strong.Tom Topor's script remains fairly even throughout and Kaplan manages to keep the story from becoming too one-sided, while he achieves with ease his objective, that is to infuriate his audience. Even the most amoral people will be uncomfortable watching the very disturbing rape scene.Brad Fiedel's music sets the sinister mood and adds the final touch to a film which will find you surely thinking that no matter how badly a woman behaves, she never deserves to be so grotesquely assaulted as this.Tuesday, June 1, 1993 - VideoPowerful, no holds barred cinema which makes no apologies for hitting you square in the face with its topic, rape. And why not? This subject is shocking and disturbing in real life, so why tone it down for the movies?"The Accused" is everything that the recent "Philadelphia" ought to have been, as it takes a person whose questionable behaviour put them in a dangerous situation, but whose victimisation was in absolutely no way justified. "Philadelphia" has a very similar theme, yet fails to really confront or challenge its audience as "The Accused" does. Director Kaplan stuns us in the opening scenes as he sets the mood for a high powered finale which really knocks its viewers out.Tom Topor's script is excellent as is Brad Fiedel's music, and the acting cast do the movie great justice, especially Jodie Foster's outstanding Academy Award winning role. An absolute must for those who can handle it.Monday, April 4, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who felt uneasy when they saw Jodie's character dancing seductively and enjoying the men's companies, it's simple: get over it. Nothing justifies rape! A person might take responsibility for misbehaving but not for 'soliciting' rape. Who are we to judge someone for not behaving according to our standards ? Some of the things we tend to think are: too sexy and alone for a dark street, too drunk, having too much of a good time. Rape has nothing to do with clothes, behavior, looks or gender even. RAPE IS RAPE and mob mentality is dangerous. Rape and crime can happen to anyone. This is why we spend our lives trying to protect ourselves. This movie is about confronting our bigotry.</fullReview>

Not that there isn't any legal way to do it, but the way the director and writer do so, very much a question mark, and sort of a poor writing example.Not a bad concept. But to be honest. Not a very good performance. Though the individual performances are mixed. Some quite fine, some others not so much. The court performances on all sides are quite awful. Caveat: Foster is excellent.

		<fullReview>I have watched many Hollywood films, but this topic is so rare. Now these days, most of the Hollywood films are comedies, fantasies, Historical films. Films are no longer based on real life stories, they are about the future, the past, the wizards, etc. This film could easily be made as a TV movie. This is a serious film, it described the true dark side of the society. I am sure that injustice, legal bargains between lawyers still exist today. It is also like a good moral story. It gives all the women who have been raped with hope. This kind of film is very rare in the year of 2007.No wonder Judy Foster won the Oscar, she acted like a real rape victim, very authentic. When she described what happened, it was as if you were right there witnessing the crime. Hollywood should make more films like this one that are based in reality, and show the audiences about the real society that we are living in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully dated courtroom drama, but not too bad besides that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster plays a woman who was raped by three men in a bar. The legal case this film covers is not about the rapists, however, but about several men who stood by and cheered it on. In that way, the brunt of the film is somewhat anticlimactic. It's based on a true story (many details were changed, of course), and the conviction of the "criminal solicitors" was a precedent. The quality of the movie is like a made-for-TV movie of the week. The music is awful and most of the acting is poor (Kelly McGillis co-stars as the prosecuting attorney, and is very weak). However, I did think the film was worth seeing. Jodie Foster - and I'm not a big fan - is excellent. She won the Oscar for the role. Yeah, it's the old trick of an actress de-glamming herself (though, honestly, Foster has never been much of a glamor queen as it is), but she creates a real person. The character of Sarah Tobias is the only thing in the film that's anywhere near three-dimensional. The actual rape sequence, which is smartly held off until the climax of the film, is also very powerful. For its time, it's very unflinching. Niki Caro had to have used this film as a reference point for 2005's North Country. The films are very similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie ages ago and it still sticks with me. The movie succeeds solely on the realness of Jodie Foster as an imperfect victim of a horrific crime. She truly becomes Sarah Tobias and there is never a false note in her performance. And therein lies the only problem I saw with this movie. Unfortunately, when you have someone like Jodie Foster in a movie, you have to find an extraordinary supporting cast; otherwise, the passion of her performance just makes those around her seem mediocre and stiff. Luckily, although this movie tries to center on Kelly McGillis's struggle to serve justice, you are drawn in by Foster in such a way that McGillis's overly cool demeanor is almost overlooked. The scene where she finally lays into McGillis is amazing to watch. A true demonstration of an acting talent and range unmatched by any other actress that has ever graced our screen. She shows pain, anguish, humiliation, disappointment, betrayal with toughness, vulnerability, and a vicious anger all at once. She's a true gift to her trade. Overall a very good movie that could have been great with a better supporting cast. A must-see for any fan of Jodie Foster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I think Jodie Foster did an excellent job of playing the part of Sarah Tobias, (the rape victim). I'm going to buy my own DVD of it because I like it so much. This film does a great job showing what happens when rape happens. Everyone is against you, the victim blaming game starts and they ask you how you are at fault and how you asked for it. A rape victim or any victim for that matter never asks to have a crime committed against them no matter what the circumstances. Those rapists should have gotten longer then they did. They should have gotten 15 to 25 years in prison. That Katherine Murphy (Kelly McGillies) the D.A. should not have done those deals without talking to Sarah first. What a jerk! As for that rape counsoler at the emergency room in the beginning, I thought how rude it was for her to just stand there and stare at Sara's private area. If that were me I would have taken my foot out of that stirrup and kicked her right in the face. Two Thumbs Way Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent law film, with food for thought. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notable for the Oscar-winning performance of Jodie Foster, THE ACCUSED is a thoughtful film that sheds light on the issue of whether you are as guilty of watching a rape as you are of committing one - an interesting thought in light of being a filmgoer.I saw this on the weekend it opened in the UK in a packed audience in London's West End and have to admit that the reaction to the film's key sequence was one of silence and genuine shock at what was transpiring.Inevitably in this film, some female commentators notioned the fact that the film had limited stereotypes and played off these to the audience's baser instincts. However, for some films to work, you need obvious characterisation to make it more effective. Foster is a top Hollywood actress dumbed and dressed down and gives a top notch performance to make the film more effective in it's execution.All things being equal, this is a well-made movie with a lot to say about the role of undervalued women in society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Possible Spoiler****This is by far Jodie Foster at her best. Her performance in this movie is stunning. Jodie plays a "white trailer trash" woman who happens to get gang raped in a bar one night. Her attorney is Katherine Murphy who not only wants to go after the men who commited the actual rape, but she wants to prosecute the men who cheered it on. Some interesting points are made in this movie.1 Should people who didnt actively participate in a crime but cheered it on be prosectued? Yes in my opinion.2 Just because a woman is drunk and stoned and has a past..is it still possible for her to be brutally raped? Of course. And should her past be brought up in court? 3 Just because one of the defendents is a young,clean cut college kid with a bright future ahead of him should that make a difference in his sentence? No in my opinion.The scene where Sarah burts into her attorneys house after finding out her Katherine did a plea bargain behind her back is phenomenal acting. The script in this movie is brilliant and creative and very to the point.Sadly, the woman who this story is based on was killed a few years ago in a car crash. The brutal rape scene in this movie is very difficult to watch as it is very realistic. This is a great movie with a very happy ending. I give this movie 9/10 stars. Jodies Oscar in this movie was well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not another thriller, it is a film with a solid and socially important message worth to be seen by young people as well as adults. Here there is nothing to guess, the facts are given and you will become upset each time you see how some young men treat the women, particularly Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster). Bad treatment could be by words or even by violation. Law is something flexible as a gum, and the film tries also to indicate this fact. If the attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) did not adopt a different approach to this case probably all guilty people would have been free and not caring about what they did to that young lady. The story is not real according to the film, but I took it as real. The message of the film after its end is really very sad. It is clear that economical wealth is not a synonym of good values in the society, so more civil education is always required, and less excess of drugs and alcohol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Story Line, but done as well as it could of been done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Accused" a movie about a rape victim getting vindication rather than ridicule from our legal system and society, is PERFECT! However, even though the 'story line'was something worth expressing, the film, which gave Jodie Foster an Oscar, just didn't have the 'structure/direction' it should of had. There were a few really good lessons that could be learned from the various film characters, but for the most part, I feel the movie didn't and couldn't run under it's own steam; it had to be 'kick started'a few times throughout. There were just too many places that your attention would begin to ebb in the movie and it is the overall basic premise of the film (rape vindication)that seems to carry you through. One of the reviews commented on the placement of the 'actual rape scene, claiming it was only added at the end to 'tittilate'; I'm kind of in agreement with that; either it should of been done in the film's 'real time' sequencing, or not at all. Because it wasn't focused on at the beginning and just more or less alluded to, I don't feel the viewer is able to get the full impact of what rape really is; how it affects the woman in every aspect of their life nor does it give a clear picture of the rapist. Rape is a violent assault against another person, and has nothing to do with what having sex with your partner is suppose to be about. Instead of 'love' and 'sensual' feelings shared between two people, rape is completely opposite; it'rooted in and shows 'hatred' and 'a desire for only self-gradification'.I think by placing the 'rape scene' in the film's 'real time' sequence, the viewer would of been able to get a much better understanding of what the film was saying and not just become 'tittilated' by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Accused" is a great movie that makes you see into other peoples' eyes about how you would act and deal with a crime being committed right in front of you. It also shows you how easily people get swayed in kidding themselves that nothing bad happened, it was something that the lady was asking for. The crime committed was rape done by three different men in a small bar to one lady "Sarah Tobias" played by "Jodie Foster". This role for Jodie won her first "Academy Award" in 1988 for "Best Actress" for her. When you watch it you will just see by her powerful performance exactly why she received it. How Sarah arrived at the bar was she got into a argument with her boyfriend and went to talk with one of her friends that was a waitress at it. Sarah is a frequent drinker and druggie, so she had a few drinks and smoked some pot at the bar. Then a little later in the night a man came over to her and bought her a drink and started to dance with her.... When Sarah finally got out of the bar she ran outside and someone picked her up and brought her to the hospital. The hospital is where she meets her attorney played by "Kelly McGillis" who is un-knowingly going to have to go over many obstacles along her way in order to do the case. During the case both of them find surprise after surprise coming out of the woodwork by many places and people. What is interesting no one needed to come up with this story because it was a true story that took place in Eastern Massachusetts. You will get from this movie a great plot and characters that you feel for.</fullReview>

What shook me the most was not the frightening rape scene, but a monolouge by Jodie Fosters character, Sarah Tobias, towards the beginning of the film. I cannot say if it was the content of what she spoke, or the honest, almost career-best performance by Jodie Foster, most likely a combination of them both. The scene sent a shiver down my spine, and has inspired me to write my first IMDb review.But back to the begining...the story follows the gang rape of Sarah Tobias, committed on the pinball machine of a bar. After her lawyer messes up her case against the three men that raped her, they set out to punish the men who cheered on and encouraged her rape.This a harrowing tale, which strikes inside and makes you think hard about the sick state of this 'Mans-World'. What makes the movie as great as it is, is a brilliant, rightfully Oscar winning performance by Jodie Foster.Prepare for a hard to digest movie, and prepare to like it. 8/10 or ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst this film attacks stereotypes about the model rape victim I feel it fails in PERSUADING the viewer that rape, against any woman, is wrong. In the main its major weaknesses were the diabolically corny script and B-movie quality.Firstly, if Alicia Silverstone wants to walk around butt-naked in Harlem then she should be able to - just as any man would if he wanted to! Men should never assume that women lose the right to personal autonomy in some sort of bargain for their right to sexual expression and independence. Ultimately, the Accused (feebly) attempts to convey this: It is men who should exercise control over their actions and responses - not women.Obviously the main thread is that once a woman becomes reckless and unsavoury (i.e. behaves like a man), she becomes the Accused, undeserving of justice, of support from her mousy friend Sally (the traditional good, hard-working domestic mother), of loyalty from her lawyer Kathryn (the post-modern career woman), and undeserving of understanding from any man, including her boyfriend, except for Kenneth Joyce - a stranger and a man on whom she ironically comes to rely. So for all the latent chauvinists (or chauvinazis if we want to be petty) with "mother" issues - this film is not indicating that all men are capable of rape! However, the film does fundamentally contradict itself. The only time the viewer really sympathises with Sarah as PERSON and not as a VICTIM is when she starts acting (and looking) like a vulnerable, little girl -which is increasingly noticeable as the film develops from the car crash. This is exactly what the film was trying to crush. Although the rape scene was graphic I did not think it was gratuitous and anybody who could get off on those scenes is just sick. The sequence was mostly filmed from Sarah's point of view - which has never been done before or since. The remaining shots focused on the crowd, Rossi and his troop, and Coulson's disgusted face, with few of the actual penetration. Indeed, I thought the scene was both sensitive yet shocking. Foster's portrayal of Sarah was good, but a little melodramatic at times. Whilst I agree that McGillis' acting was a little wooden, I think it is understandable considering she had been raped in real life not long before the Accused was filmed. Indeed, her steely performance showed how even career women - those women who you think would be more feminist and supportive towards rape victims - can still be as unemotional and prejudiced as anybody else. Coulson's character was played with adequate warmth and sentiment but nothing more than what was required. Hearn's character and her act of cowardice could have been explained better.May I briefly explain something to those who cannot get their heads around the law of rape and "criminal solicitation"?! It is not at all surprising that charges were brought against the ones who cheered and there was no clever twist of the law or logic - it was simply charging those who had very simply committed the crime of aiding and abetting. Whether the crime of rape had been committed or not is irrelevant to the case at hand - the question is whether they believed a crime was being committed. There is, indeed, an English case where a soldier witnessed a gang-rape in the soldiers' barracks. He was convicted for aiding and abetting for doing a lot less than the "applauders" in the Accused!Secondly, such rapes as these do happen and are quite common. This particular rape was based upon a poolroom rape in Massachusetts in 1983, so the story cannot be that incredulous! Indeed, most rapes are not the "stranger in the dark alley" rape (which constitutes only 7% of rapes), but mostly marital and date rapes.</fullReview>

Dealing with the material in a very direct and brutally honest way, McGillis (a victim of an assault before - part of the reason why she took up this film) and Foster (who showcases her unbelievably powerful acting skills) shine some light on an otherwise unchartered and undiscussed area of not just women's rights, but human rights and the issues and possibilities behind some of the human race's ugliest sides. A great film that can both act as a beacon for the subject, albeit arguably brutally direct, or as merely if nothing else as a platform to take the many more and multi-polar complexities regarding rape as an issue to the public domain of debate at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie this weekend so my boyfriend could see it. We both are mesmerized by the awesome performance of Jodie Foster. I think she won an Academy award for her role in this film and she truly deserved it. This movie was based on a true story about a milestone court case.Jodie Foster plays Sarah Tobias-a woman who is a heavy drinker and partier, sometimes drug user and overall, white trash. She goes into a bar, gets drunk and very flirtatious with a few patrons, and winds up being gang raped. Not only does her attorney go after the men who commited the rape, she tries to prosecute the men in the bar who clapped and cheered it on. Sarah as alot going against her due to her questionable character, but does that mean she had the rape coming to her? This movie tells an incredible story and its hard to take your eyes off the screen just for a minute. One of my favorite movies of all time. 9/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't enjoy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a horrible experience watching this "film" and I will never be able to look at a pinball machine the same again. Actually, I think I was originally warped by Tommy. SPOILERS??? Sarah (Jodie Foster) is raped in a bar by three or so men, while a group of drunks clap and cheer. She takes the case to trial, of course, where the accused are not only the rapists, but the on-lookers, particularly the ones who cheered the rape on. The subject matter is not pleasant, the atmosphere is dismal, and I can't think of any redeeming qualities. The movie did nothing for me. As for Foster, let's just say, I didn't see what the big deal was. But that's just my opinion. I give this a 5 out of 10. It is not worth it. I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago and recently watched it again. While Jodie Foster's acting was very good, and the movie is a good movie, the thought occurred to me, why was there absolutely no mention of Jodie Foster's character's behavior? Now before I get jumped on, why are you blaming the victim? kind of stuff, let me explain. I am not blaming the victim. First of all, yes, rape is a terrible crime and the men responsible for the rape were punished (although it was through a plea deal which I don't agree with) but that aside, look at the rape scene. A young woman goes into a bar to meet her friend. She gets drunk, goes into the back room (which is full of guys who aren't feeling any pain either) with a guy she doesn't know, smokes a little pot, is flirting big time with this guy, a seductive song starts playing on the jukebox, she starts dancing and her tank top is almost falling off her. She motions for this guy to dance with her, and then that's when things get out of hand, and the rape happens. Don't you think somewhere in the movie there should have been something said about her behavior? Not that she was "asking for it" but you don't dangle red meat in front of hungry lions, either. I just think women (especially young women) would have been better served if somewhere in the movie part of the message would have been to take responsibility for your own behavior, too. I just think it's a mistake to ignore it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie for Jodie Foster and she is the only one who carries this movie through. Kelly McGillis has nothing to add to the movie. She had a good role and she could not do justice to it. What this movie needed was a strong performance form her and she could not give it. She has slept right through the film. The courtroom scene should have had more conviction. The story is pretty well written the dialogues could have been better especially in the courtroom scene. The ending is expected. Watch the movie for Jodie Foster and the story. Do not have any high expectations form it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>never blame the victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster broke out of her teenage persona in "The Accused", in which she masterfully portrays a rape victim seeking justice. The movie shows how, as often seems to happen, the raped woman gets accused of bringing the rape upon herself because of how she dressed. But her character understands what she has to do. Equally as good is Kelly McGillis as her attorney trying to prove that not only did the men rape her client, but several other men encouraged the rape. A particularly effective scene is when Foster decides to take revenge on one of the men who encouraged the rape; you can feel what she's thinking.All in all, this is a movie that I recommend to everyone. It shows how our society stigmatizes women, but also reminds us never to give up hope. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was petrified by this movie one night, after falling asleep with the TV on, waking up to a woman being gang raped. I found out what the film was and have seen bits and pieces of it, but have not managed to even attempt to view the whole thing. I can't even comment on Jodie's performance because I haven't seen enough of the film, but the AA should just rectify the fact that I already know it's brilliant. Chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average at best law film, with great acting 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Accused has only one message it has to say: Rape is bad. This truth is already known and it sticks in the head of any moral person -- without them having to be told multiple times. The film does no real justice to the subject matter of rape, except to point out that it is wrong. The acting is great in the film, but there is nothing that makes this film superior to any other episode of LA Law or Law &amp; Order. The court room scenes are dull, and it just keeps going on and on. Worth a viewing on cable, but the film just can't live up the hype it was awarded by the Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is TV movie material, not even elevated by Jodie's performance. Why did she win an Oscar for such a mediocre movie? McGillis is wooden, and the only person who delivers the goods was Carmen Argenziano, as McGillis' boss. Not worth your time and the rape scene takes too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure a lot of people like this movie because it deals with an important issue and points out how easy it can happen. But this movie really bored me quite a bit. I didn't think that Jodie Foster did a very good job, and I didn't really like this movie. There were other strong acting performances that gave this movie something but very little. They could have done it another way! I give it a 4/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>assault with a deadly weapon?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One interesting point about this film that no one seems to consider. In one scene, Foster's character repeatedly drives her vehicle into another vehicle, with deliberate intent to injure that person. In fact, she drives into the driver's side door of his vehicle, which is certain to do him much greater injury than her. Yet, she's the one on her back in the hospital, while he is up and around. No one charges her with motorvehicular assault, or assault with a deadly weapon, an extremely serious crime which she has committed. The point seems to be, violence perpetrated by a woman is socially acceptable as long as the man in the past has committed an anti-social crime. And this guy, of course, is depicted as the most obnoxious male on the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a watchable movie which tried hard to be a powerful drama, but fell short basically due to the fact it was unrealistic. Firstly, it paints men totally as monsters (apart from Ken, the real "hero" of this film) - I don't even believe the worst rednecks would stand and holler, clap and cheer while three of them gang-raped a woman in a public bar. It's a typical feminazi impression of what men are really like, brutal, savage and all potential rapists. Secondly, it's unlikely that the onlookers at the end would be found guilty... I think it'd have been a better movie if they had been acquitted, but that'd have given it a real martyr tone and given feminists what they want, a means of saying they simply can't find equality or justice in this world.The rape scene was realistic insofar as portraying the violence of such an act, but at the same time you find yourself sitting there going "yeah right" in disbelief that it could ever actually happen like that, some guy standing up on a table and chanting "one two three four poke that pussy 'till it's sore..."I suppose it's intended to make male viewers feel guilty, but considering it's all a bit too hard to swallow and that watching or hearing about rape doesn't make you responsible, you shouldn't.Jodie Foster gives a fair enough performance with a melodramatic and sometimes overdone script, but Kelly McGuiness is awfully wooden - perhaps she's supposed to be though, as her character is so uptight and correct. Bernie Coulson (Ken) gives the best performance, especially his horrified facial expressions during the rape scene. Also notable is Leo Rossi (Scorpion) who plays the stereotypical sexist redneck.Worth watching just for the outrageously far fetched yet dramatic rape scene, simply to get an idea of the influence feminists have had on modern culture and their belated attempts to poison the reputation of males.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good? Yes. Great? Not likely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler ahead, so be warned)Well, what can I say? Yes, rape is a serious crime, certainly not one I would cheer about (unlike the bar folks in the film), and yes, the fact that Jodie Foster's character was a alcoholic, drug addict, slut and downright stupid doesn't make the rapists any less accountable or responsible.But, the movie seems to preach that Foster's character is well entitled to be all that and than be outraged at the fact that she's described as a "not very strong witness". I'm not saying that she brought it on herself and deserved it, but consider this example. A young white girl (say Alicia Silverstone type) strolls butt-naked in the streets of Harlem at midnight, and (big surprise) runs into a gang. Can you guess what they're most likely to do to her? The cops will be lucky to even find her body (and in case someone reads this as racist, picture then a Brandy tipe of black girl strolling naked care-free into a KKK rally). Are the gang (or the KKK) any less responsible for whatever harm they inflict on these girls? Of course not. Now, could these girls have spared themselves a lot of suffering had they not being so dawm reckless, and frankly, irresponsible? YES. I mean, Foster's character doesn't realize (even drunk, and she's white trash, so she can't play innocent and say "I can't believe rednecks like that exist!")that a bar crowd is not one you wanna tease and fool around with? Stupid. In my opinion, what she did is no different than for a man to walk into that bar and yell out loud "Which one of you pukes thinks is man enough to f#$% with me?" and then, if he survives, whine "How could I know they were gonna react like that?"When you play high stakes and loose, you loose huge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheap exploitation flick. Wretched performance by Foster. Shot in an annoyingly pedestrian, TV docudrama style. Make no mistake about it: the protracted flashback near the film's end is there for the sole purpose of titillating the audience. How "The Accused" garnered so much respect from the press eludes me. Foster even won an Oscar for her performance! (Which was followed by a statue for her so-so work in the god-awful "Silence of the Lambs.") This is a shameful effort. That it masquerades as a sincere piece of social commentary makes me hate it even more. (I've met a great many feminists that were somehow bamboozled into lauding this dreck.) "The Accused" is downright fraudulent.</fullReview>
