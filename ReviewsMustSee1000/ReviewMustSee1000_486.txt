		<fullReview>This is the second film of the year (the other being "The Green Mile") that I have seen that I believe will recieve Oscar nominations in several categories, of which, best film, best male and femal actor and best cinematography will be definitely considered."Anna and the King" is an epic film about a British woman who accepts an offer to go to Siam (Thailand) to teach western education to the King of Siam's 58 children. Upon reaching Siam, Ms. Leonowens (Jodie Foster) is made to find her way to the King's palace by herself and subsequently made to wait weeks before she is allowed to meet him. Coming from a British background she is appalled by this treatment and decides to take matters into her own hands by bursting into the King's court, breaking every protocol on the way, and boldly confronting King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat) about her situation. This obviously does not sit well with the King but at the same time he is intrigued by this woman's boldness and so the story begins about cultural education (both British and Siamese) and a blossoming romance that has you yearning for a happy ending.Foster plays Anna Leonowens very well and at times makes you hate her for her narrow minded view of the world as she portrays a woman who truely believes that "British teachings are the ways of the world." Her comments about British rule and colonization makes you cringe at times as she comes across as this arrogant, cold woman who believes that she is in Siam to bring culture and wisdom to a backwards country. Foster manages to portray every aspect of this character flawlessly and takes the audience for an emotional rollercoaster from, hate to love to compassion and every emotion in between.The most notable difference in character development is the portrayal of King Mongkut. Chow Yun-Fat brings a quiet strength and sophistication that was never present in Yul Brynner's portrayal of the King. In this film we are shown a very intelligent man that understands more than he lets on. In fact, he seems to lead Ms. Leonowens around without her really knowing it and in some cases teaches her lessons about the world and how it really is. As the saying goes, "actions speak louder than words" and this is definitely the case for King Mongkut. Fat does not have as many lines as Foster does but he is in as many scenes and in most cases commands more of a presence.The rest of the cast was excellent as well and there were very few slow points in the film. The colors used were very vibrant and creates a feel of exoticness. As well, the cinematography was incredible. Sweeping shots of the landscape showing the green carpets of the land and the incredible shots of the elaborate palace create an atmosphere of an epic film. Subtitles are used quite a bit but it only adds to the authenticity of the film.The one thing that I was disappointed in was the fact this movie was based on Ms. Leonowens' diary which may be subject to biased occurances of certain situations or historical inaccuracies.Overall though, I was thoroughly impressed and entertained with this film. Although Jodie Foster is the top billing name, this film definitely belongs to Chow Yun-Fat and it would be ashame not to see him get an oscar consideration for his performance. He is an accomplished international actor and it seems that Hollywood has finally discovered that. My recommendation, go see this film. You will not be disappointed.A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a trailer for this film a few months before the Australian opening. Originally it was the lush cinematography that caught my eye. I assumed it would be a re-make either of the original 1946 movie or the better known Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of 1956.In actual fact, the movie is neither a re-make of these previous FOX efforts, but rather an adaption of Anna Leonowens' own memoirs of the time she spent in Siam.Jodie Foster gave a fascinating, beautiful performance as Anna. I found her portrayal of the character interesting, as it was far different from Deborah Kerr's interpretation. Yul Brynner left his mark on the King in both stage and film versions of "The King and I". However, Chow Yun Fat in a different role is excellent. I feel they are both up with a chance for an oscar nomination.The film is a fine example of movie making. In addition to the supporting cast, the costumes and art decoration were of an excellent standard. Although the film was shot in Malaysia and not Thailand, I only suspected the film was not shot there because of all versions of the story being banned there. Despite the fact I have been to some of the Malaysian locations, I hardly noticed it.Skeptical in my viewing of this movie because of my fondness for "The King and I", "Anna and the King" has forever shattered my illusions of the story. No longer can I picture the children swaying to the strains of "Getting to Know You". However, I was greatly surprised by this movie. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAGNUM-MAGNIFICENT MONGKUT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lush, epic, sweeping, entrancing. It's all here. If there's any "justice" in Hollywood, this one should be Oscar bait for at least cinematography, costuming, musical score and the magnum-magnificent presence of some dude I never heard of before I saw AATK -- Chow Yun Fat. Now, I have been informed that he is the Coolest Actor in the World (according to L.A. Times). I can see this dark, cool elegance in his breathtaking performance as a real and fascinating historic figure, King Mongkut, who in actuality learned Latin, astronomy and memorized major parts of both Bible and Koran while a Buddhist monk. Contrary to the buffoonery of Yul Brynner's overblown portrayal, Chow opens for us an entirely new cultural door, brushing for the eager audience a portrait of a monarch of absolutely power who wields it so well that he is unafraid of gentleness, hugging his enchanting, on-screen children without reserve and finding himself mystifyingly in love with a foreign woman he cannot tame or bed because of the constraint of the times. The betrayal, revolution and barbarity of l9th century Thailand (Siam) become pale watercolor in comparison to the bold red and orange of unresolved love and religious and cultural interplay represented by Foster and Chow. We fear that more of these mesmerizing moments between the two lie on the editing room floor. However, Chow's sensitive face and body language reflect this inner evolution and bittersweet turmoil far better than does Jodie Foster's rather wooden performance accompanied by a troubling British accent. I respect Foster's talent immensely, though it shone through only intermittently, blossoming only when she softens to the King's patient (sometimes stormy) friendship. The indelible etching of the film comes during a non-speaking sequence involving the disposition of Tuptim and Balat which sub-plot likely was originally meant to be a subtle reflection of the untenable love affair between Anna and Mongkut. This is so well-edited and scored that it's going to be hard to forget. When the King kneels in agonized prayer before his talismanic Emerald Buddha, one is compelled to conclude that he is in anguish -- not only over what's happening to his concubine and his throne -- but the fact that his actions necessitated by politics will also probably forever separate him from his tea-tray-tossing Anna and all she believes in and has worked for in his country. Okay, so I cried in several places (something I nearly never do) -- the mark of a film which has accomplished its goal, i.e., the moving of hearts. I was fascinated with this movie. It made me read and research a part of the world I've generally ignored, and whole new palace gates have opened. Sumptuous and rich it is; and award-winning it should be, but the sun-star opulence of this new guy, Chow, is the stellar pin on that film curtain. Thanks, Mr. Tennant. And thank you, Mr. Chow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A banquet of sensory delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a masterful piece of filmmaking that over romanticizes a true story to improve its entertainment value. However, the generous use of artistic license can be almost completely forgiven because the final product is so pleasing. Director Andy Tennant weaves together resplendent visual images, wonderfully warm lighting, magnificent set design, breathtaking locations and beautiful costumes to produce a banquet of sensory delight. I'm surprised this film didn't get more technical awards, since it was one of the most exhilarating filmmaking experiences I had all year.The story was engaging, though admittedly the characters were overly idealized. This is especially true of King Mongkut, who was far more educated, dashing and genteel than it would have been reasonable to expect. Also, the romantic overtones between him and Anna were a bit much. But the way they were presented enhanced the overall effect so I have difficulty being too critical.The story also had some constructive subtleties. In addition to the obvious storylines about the education of the children, the effect Anna was having on the King and the impending war, there was a deeper message. It illustrated the truism that exposure to different peoples and cultures can help us to grow in understanding not only of them, but of ourselves as well. For it was clear that Anna was as much changed by Siam and the King as he and the children were by her.I was highly impressed with the performance turned in by Yun-Fat Chow. His English is much improved since my last viewing of him in ?Replacement Killers' and ?The Corruptor'. He imbued King Mongkut with dignity and strength without forsaking the human side. The camera just eats him up. It is easy to see why he has been the dominating force in eastern films for years.Jodie Foster, on the other hand, was off her game. She was good as Anna, but frankly, we've come to expect more from her. Foster is a powerful actor who didn't seem quite sure what to do with this character. In some scenes she rose to the occasion and gave us the Anna we hoped for; resolute, defiant, opinionated and principled. At other times she seemed tentative and totally intimidated by the role, just limping through her lines. I give her high marks for her English accent, but her total performance just wasn't up to her capabilities.This was one of the most entertaining and delightful films I've seen this year. Yes, liberties were taken but I am inclined to overlook them. It was beautifully filmed and directed; a feast for the senses. I rated it a 9/10. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly acted and photographed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in I had expected a solid performance by Jodie Foster and some nicely photographed scenes; what I got was much more. Chow Yun-Fat commands the viewers' attention whenever he is on the screen, fairly radiating a regal and aloof presence. There is a palpable chemistry between Jodie and Chow, something not seen in the actresses films since she squared off with Anthony Hopkins' Lecter. The script is solid and generally well-paced. Keen attention is paid to the dialog and interplay between the principals and the secondary characters, too. That they didn't actually film in Thailand, but in Malaysia never shows on the screen. The photography and costumes should be automatic nominees for Oscar. For that matter, both Jodie and Chow could comfortably fit in their respective nominee lists for Best Actor and Best Actress. Overall, a wonderful film and I'm really looking forward to the DVD in June!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, yet it makes me wonder . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My overall experience with this film was very good. I felt the detail to costumes and set design was exceptional; we were really transported to Siam in the 1860's. And the acting was excellent, especially Chow Yin Fat, although I felt the relationship between Jodie Foster and Chow Yin Fat was not completely believable. Perhaps, this is because I could not push far from my mind the thought that this is only another movie loosely based on the memoirs by Anna Lenowens. But, this is probably the most realistic of them all. I'd give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Great Performances: Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I love when the movie is attacked for its epistemology. Look, this is not 2001, and cultural elements in everyone's country, including this insane asylum, will not always please indigenous peoples who want to be in the dark and idealize their societies. Believe me, I am plenty embarrassed Pacific Rim is going out to other people as representative of Americans. The movie features Foster giving one of her best readings with great range and depth. Fat, always an underrated treasure, shines here quite brightly. He, unlike Brynner's brainless version, that was insulting to Siamese, Fat conveys intelligence, morality and emotional depth. When people lampoon the movie as a mindless romance, which it is not, except at a great distance, I point out they will see two great performances by two veteran greats at the peak of their powers. I should also point out that, unlike the lobotomized musical, here the faults of both cultures are on view. The English are not spared from being portrayed as Kippling's disciples utterly convinced of their innate superiority to all other life forms on the planet. The English are delineated as arrogant beyond belief, pretentious, effete, ornate peacocks.When ethnic people attack the movie, I again point out, yes, there are the elements of your societies you may not be proud of but the English get the same treatment. Anna and The King learn much from each other while trying to retain their pride in their respective cultures. The movie moves well, it is always interesting, with the Tuptin tragedy presented very powerfully. Again, who is presented as causing this disaster? The King and the Siamese people? No, he was about to pardon both of them till Anna took it upon herself to interfere; this is why she does what she did best run away. As the King cuts her to the quick by pointing out her hypocrisy in telling him to go on with life when her whole being in the world is existential flight from the agony of her husband's death. She does the same thing; she is aware she caused their deaths, though blaming the King, and starts to run away again. When she learns of the danger the King and his children are in she comes to help him. As you see them dance, it becomes clear each has learned greatly from the other. As disparate as they were, she becomes a little Siamese and he a little English. The film models taking what is good from wherever you find it and shedding your indigenous training that often has much error in it, as do all things of man. The two greats together will draw you into their world will you will stay until the movie ends. This is the mark of all great films and performers. Do you lose yourself in the movie? Are you transported to another place and time? It reminds me of the very different Sand Pebbles which it equals in bringing you into the movie. As a side note, it also models real love; the willingness to give your life in protection of those you hold dear. A complete anomaly here, in this decadent love in, I cannot tell you what a joy it is and what a rarity. No positive energy or thinking happy thoughts; just real willing to die for you love. A Very Noble And Underrated Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie but remember it's just a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this movies was certainly better than previous musicals and renditions of the Anna Leonowen's adventures in Thailand. It also is more historically accurate than those previous versions. Although this doesn't necessarily make it more culturally accurate as well, so conclusions shouldn't be made concerning how Thailand is today. Of the acting, it is true what everyone else has been saying that both Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat acted extremely well. I've always been a Chow Yun-Fat fan. He's certainly a versatile actor, this I know from his Asian movies, but this is his break-out performance in America. Basically, if you really like great acting, then you'll love this movie. Anna and the King is also a very heart-warming movie mixed with enough excitement to please most people.This isn't entirely a romance movie either. A history lesson is trying to be told here. Although as documentaries go...well Anna and the King is not 100% correct. However history seems so much more drier if it was told by facts alone. No one would go pay money to see documentaries in movie theaters, but they will go to see a movie especially if it's a good movie. Anna and the King is a good movie. Some people have griped about the theme song, the one scene with explosion, and whether or not the title of the movie appeared in the credits. For those people, keep in mind that what makes a movie a good movie can be found in the story, acting, and directing of the movie, not in the theme song or any other locations in the credit.Concerning the length of the movie, every movie these days seem to go past the two hour mark, which is some sort of current trend in movies. Personally, I don't mind this as it allows me to let myself go and be sympathetic for the characters as if they had meaning for two hours and nine minutes in my life. Besides the acting was so well done that you won't get bored at anytime during the movie. Anna and the King will be one of the best two hours nine minutes you will spend this year if you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anna rules the King's heart and wins over the audience in this visual masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let the magic of romance and the beauty of Siam sweep and take you away to a world where the king rules the land and a teacher rules the king's heart. There are only two other movies I would consider to be worthy of masterpiece status: "Saving Private Ryan" and "Titanic." Now a third can be added to this list: "Anna And The King." "Anna and The King" is a true masterpiece that is filled with heart &amp; soul, a beautful setting and superb performances.I was very impressed with the performance of Chow-Yun Fat because he made the transition from action star to dramatic actor flawlessly. Fat showed his versatility in playing a king. Fat pulled off this role with perfection. He made it so easy for me to enjoy this movie because of his screen presence and believability of the performance as well as the chemistry between Anna and the King.This masterpiece can not be completed without the performance Jodie Foster turned in. Foster delivers the type of performance worthy of an oscar. She once again has established herself among the elite that have the special gift of natural talent.Foster and Fat come together beautifully to bring the true story of the romance of Anna Leonowens and King Momokut. The chemistry can be felt from a distance and it works from the first minute they come together. I knew Foster and Fat were compatible; however, I failed to realize how much until I viewed the movie."Anna and The King" is visually stunning in so many ways with beautiful settings such as the palace. Also, the costumes are well-made and suited the movie perfectly. "Anna &amp; The King" will take you on a journey that will touch, warm and fill your heart with spirit only a motion picture masterpiece can bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorite romances of all times. :)And It's the first time I see Jodie Foster in a role that she is in love with a man! *laughs* But really, many people are criticizing and saying bad things about this film, only because that in the real relationship between Anna and the King they never fell in love with each other,among other things. I personally think this is bullshit and people should enjoy more the movie and not worry so much; I mean, even that there are many non realistic elements, this movie is cool,right? Gone With The Wind,was not accurate as well and even in this way, many people loved it. And I read that even the present King and Queen from Thailand liked.:) Beautiful scenarios,clothes and photography,this movie should be watched spite of the bad rumors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed epic based on a real story set in 1862 Siam.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again the "critics" led me astray, and I waited until now to see this fascinating film. Jodie Foster is fine as the strong-willed British teacher who tries to civilize, at least according to Western standards, the King of Siam and his kingdom. The filming was done in Malaysia and it is nothing short of superb, for the most part. Good story, good acting, some action, the bridge is blown up near the end to eradicate the villain. I never saw the 1956 "King and I" with Brenner, so I can't compare the two. Taken on its own, this 1999 version is a fine film.09Dec2004 addendum: Since my earlier comments, I have spoken with several friends who have also seen this movie recently, and all the impressions follow a common thread. This is a fine movie and does not deserve the occasional bad review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie Foster delivers yet another spectacular performance as Anna Leonowens, an Englishwoman who is to educate the children of King Mongkut, played by Chow Yun-Fat, who FINALLY delivers a spectacular perform</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna and the King takes a fascinating story and surrounds it with breathtaking on-location visuals and costumes. The film is about the clashing of two cultures and the way that two very different people overcome those cultural differences and are able to learn a great deal from each other. The destructive effects of Hollywood are virtually nonexistent in this beautifully made picture, and the acting is excellent.The painful clashing of these two polar opposite cultures is well-portrayed in numerous hardships that are experienced by Anna, the King, the King's children, as well as a number of other characters. The thing that really makes this film stand out is the fact that it is true to reality. Obviously because it is based on a true story, but so was The Perfect Storm. That was a true story that was absolutely demolished by Hollywood. The story in Anna and the King was made even more interesting by the staggering visuals, the beautifully designed costumes, and the excellent acting, rather than the cartoonish excessiveness of films like The Perfect Storm.One thing that should be noted about Foster's performance is her deftness in playing an English woman. There are only two well-known actresses who can successfully portray characters with different accents than their own. One is Gwyneth Paltrow, and the other is Jodie Foster. These rare and very enviable skills can be seen most clearly in Shakespeare In Love and Anna and the King, respectively. Foster is perfect as the widowed English mother who takes upon herself the task of educating the King's many children.Every scene in Anna and the King is filled with amazing cinematic technique and beautiful photography. The notable direction added fascinating elements to the already interesting story, and all of the actors involved (even the action veteran Fat) performed wonderfully. Anna and the King is a great drama; it is well-made, well-acted, and beautifully directed. This one shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most moving film I have ever seen.The death of Tuptim made me cry really hard. It is a deeply emotional film that enters into the depths of friendship and life.The word that I would use to describe my feelings at the time of the execution is frustrated. I was frustrated for Tuptim and for Anna. Tuptim was innocent - she was in love. Anna was her friend, and she didn't want to see her friend die.But as the film progresses, she leaves Tuptim behind; she moves on. Chow-Yun Fat excellently portrays the troubled king and father, putting his life at risk for their safety.I voted this film '10', because frankly, it deserves it. In every aspect. Even the tiny matters like her accent. She had a pristine British accent, and their was no fault in it.Anna and the King - a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>questionable history, but a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the movie builds on unreliable historic source materials, including the diaries of Anna Leonowens it credits, it can't hope to be good history. However, as a fictional story loosely based on the time of Kings Mongkut and Chulalongkorn it's a wonderful movie.The movie as bad history:The movie credits the diaries of Anna Leonowens as its source, presumably meaning her books about her five years as an English teacher in Siam (Thailand). Other historical sources discredit much of the material in her books as self-promoting, ethnocentric, and often simply fictional. The movie appears to draw from more accurate sources as well, but shouldn't be mistaken for good history.According to the movie's Thai detractors, the worst divergence from history seems to be the Tuptim sub-plot, which to avoid spoilers I won't outline. Although Anna's books apparently tell of such events, other sources from the time period (Thai and Western) either fail to confirm her telling or directly contradict her. If Tuptim were to disappear from the movie after she joined Anna's class, Thailand would have no good reason to ban it.Another point in the movie that Thailand may have found embarrassing -- slavery -- is historically accurate. Around one fourth of the population was bound by debt-slavery. King Chulalongkorn abolished slavery in 1909. The movie credits Anna with planting the idea, which probably exceeds even her own self-promotion.In addition to Anna's historically unreliable books, the movie mixes in elements of her son's real friendship with King Chulalongkorn (the crown prince in the movie), and that king's reign.The real Anna was mentioned only once in King Mongkut's diaries. She was apparently nothing more than a hired English language teacher; never an advisor at court. However, Anna's son (Louis Timothy) returned to Bangkok. He was a friend of King Chulalongkorn, an advisor at court, and founder of a timber company that still exists.The real King Mongkut had only eight wives and about 15 children, and had spent 27 years as a monk before becoming king. King Chulalongkorn had 50 wives, and about 39 children. The movie's King Mongkut mixed his monastery background with the many marriages of King Chulalongkorn.The Thai language is badly pronounced (according to others; I don't know a word of it). The real-life Anna claimed to be fluent, but wasn't, so the movie Anna's bad pronunciation would have been closer to history than to Anna's stories. Of course the king's bad Thai would detract from the movie for anyone who knew how the language really sounds.The movie as great cinema:Whatever its historical faults, Anna and the King is wonderful big screen entertainment. The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets, natural locations, and directing are all great, and the screenplay is generally good.Jodie Foster is wonderful, as usual. Chow Yun-Fat is excellent also, in what appears to be his first serious English language drama (after a long history of mostly action movies I haven't seen). All of the supporting actors are at least competent, and many are good or excellent. The many child actors are particularly impressive.The visual experience of the movie is wonderful. The costumes are spectacular, and quite historically reasonable. The palace and other sets are grand and wondrous. The natural locations are beautiful. The cinematography is a treat for the eyes, and well worth seeing on the big screen.The screenplay is good, but it has some weaknesses. A real strength of the screenplay is how it expresses the king's strength and cleverness in the face of imperialism. Thailand is the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid European colonial domination, thanks to Kings Mongkut and Chulalongkorn, and the script deserves credit for showing that notable accomplishment.The revolt sub-plot is another strength, bring action and a dramatic climax into the movie. Historically, the kings were limited to constitutional monarchy, but not until the 1930s. The classroom scenes give the lots of time to Jodie Foster and the adorable child actors, and hint at the future real-life friendship between the prince and Anna's son.The weakest part of the story is the Tuptim sub-plot. It is the most obvious disagreement with history, and is probably Thailand's main reason for objecting to the movie. It contradicts the nature of the king's character, and adds length to a movie that's already too long for some viewers. The best part is that it puts Bai Ling on screen; too bad the script didn't give her a part that improved the movie.Overall, the movie is one of the best of the year, as long as it's not mistaken for history. It's beautiful, wonderfully performed, and has a story that's good in spite of one notable flaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Thai's comment of this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was banned here in Thailand. Both the filming location and to play here. I have to find DVD to watch. O.K. this was not the fact in our history. Just the movie that follow from the book that contain artificial name, rank and misunderstanding of culture. However, director of this film is done the good job to not insult our king. King Mongut in this film present the great charactor of the leader, the highest father of our country. His role in the movie that played by Chao Yun Fat is acceptable for me. Next, the buildings, equipments and scenes are great. It's look like the same as here in Thailand. That's the neat job. However, the Thai pronounce sometimes are not good. Just few actors can pronounced well. Many times that I can not understand what they said in Thai and have to see the English subtitle. The storyline is O.K., not bad, sometimes boring, sometime there is interesting speech. The rebel at the ending of the movie, I think it's to help movie more interested than just to be normal drama movie. For Thai people, I think this movie is good and not ruin our king image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let the magic of romance and the beauty of Siam sweep and take you away to a world where the king rules the land and a teacher rules the king's heart. "Anna and The King" is a true masterpiece that is filled with heart &amp; soul, a beautiful setting and superb performances.I was very impressed with the performance of Chow-Yun Fat because he made the transition from action star to dramatic actor flawlessly. Fat showed his versatility in playing a king. Fat pulled off this role with perfection. He made it so easy for me to enjoy this movie because of his screen presence and believability of the performance as well as the chemistry between Anna and the King of Siam.This masterpiece can not be complete without the performance Jodie Foster gave as Anna Leonowens. Foster delivered the type of performance worthy of an Oscar. She once again has established herself among the elite that have the special gift of natural talent.Foster and Fat come together beautifully to bring the true story of the romance of Anna Leonowens and King Momokut. The chemistry can be felt from a distance and it works from the first minute they come together."Anna and The King" is visually stunning in so many ways with beautiful settings such as the palace. Also, the costumes are well-made and suited the movie perfectly. "Anna &amp; The King" will take you on a journey that will touch, warm and fill your heart with spirit only a motion picture masterpiece can bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Andy Tennant Anna and The King tells the true life story of the English governess Anna Leonowens who was tutor to the children of the King of Siam and wrote a book about her experiences at the court. When Mrs Anna Leonowens(Jodi Foster)arrives in Siam along with her young son Louis(Tom Felton)to become the governess to the children of Siam's all powerful ruler King Mongkut(Chow Yun-Fat)she finds herself at odds with his rule and the beauty and violence of the country.The two gradually and very slowly become friends and he learns to trust her.Things turn complicated though when she finds that both she and the king have fallen in love with one another. Although not 100 percent historically accurate this is much more believable than the Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner musical The King and I.Featuring some truly beautiful location work and costumes this is a sweeping epic romantic film done in the style of those from the 30's and 40's.If you want to be transported to a world of beauty,tradition and history then this is one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This beautiful, scenic gem of a film is the finest retelling of this story yet on film, and for once presents the King of Siam, Rama IV, as the enlightened monarch in the midst of an extraordinary effort to modernize his country. At the time the film was released the critics all panned Jodi Foster's performance, especially her accent, but I think that she did an excellent job as a Victorian English woman, trying to survive in a foreign world, and maintain her own values as well. The film was a visual delight, and the casting was superb. Although I own all three film versions of the Anna Leanowens Story, this is by far the best of the lot. I did note in the trivia that they said Tuptim was Thar for "Ruby." But in her book, the author claimed that it was Thai for "pomegranite."</fullReview>

This was well made and visually wondrous, the two(Chow and Jody) were almost magical in their roles I was amazed at how incredibly well they brought the characters in a remake to be more beautiful than the original. Even though they didn't have the chemistry of other on screen romance-couples, it still makes you feel things about the couple and that time in history. I am not used to seeing Chow in this kind of character either.My heart was definitely taken by this wonderful film, what a surprise! The director performed a brilliant job in creating this modern day work of excellence. Not many can stand the test of time effectively, like I think this is.Bravo I recommend this to all.

		<fullReview>Great work from Jodi Foster and Chow-Yun Fat. This was a fantastic movie. Unfortunately almost no one in Hollywood gave it a second thought, or may be they only saw Jodi Foster.Don't get me wrong, Jodi Foster was great in her roll. However, Chow-Yun Fat was even better considering his background as a new comer to the Hollywood scene. Yes, it wasn't his first week here in the USA, but one that has followed his career over the past 10-20 years could see the remarkable improvement in his acting and language skills.Well, Chow-Yun Fat was always great in almost any roll he was given back in Hong Kong. Now, this movie really brought out the emotions deep inside him. We were also extremely impressed with his vastly improved English skills. Although, he had to pretend having a sort of heavy accent while playing the roll of a Thai king learning English.It was known that Chow-Yun Fat hired a personal speech/language instructor to improve his chances of landing a big roll here. From this movie, we bet that both with his hard work and the great instructor, it has paid off.Like I said before, unfortunately, Chow-Yun Fat hasn't seeing the rewards for his efforts being recognized in Hollywood. As Jackie Chan mentioned, Asian actors only get the action hero or martial arts roll in Hollywood. They do not ever get the recognition that they deserve for any other rolls, specially those of Leading Man. It is as if Hollywood only see's Asian actors in action movies ONLY. I can assure you that they are much more capable than that.The only recognition Asians get are for women. When will this Hollywood BIAS end?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a treat this film is for the eyes! Stunning architecture and decoration! Lovely costumes! Beautiful scenery! The Art direction will surely win an Academy Award!Too bad the story doesn't equal the quality of its visual support. It is kitschy to propose that a young British schoolmarm could outsmart the military leaders of Thailand while leading the country's powerful monarch around by the nose. I didn't expect this movie to be historically accurate. Anna Leonowens' diaries showed a preposterous assumption of self-importance at the court of Siam. But, I did expect this mega-movie to be good theater. What a disappointment!Anna and Mongkut's romance was neither interesting or plausible. This Anna, hell-bent on educating everyone around her to social justice issues rather than the western classics she was employed to teach, is an invention of Hollywood hacks. Anna's politically correct and unargueable views, were simply a cover for no progressive story line. It's hard to see how this powerful, thoughtful king would be interested in this busy-body.Jody Foster was her usual cool self, often competent, not compelling. Chow Yun-Fat was excellent as far as his lines allowed. The Malaysian children who played Monkut's progeny were delightful, and his concubines superb. Again, all were lovely to look at.The real stars here were the set designers. They should have been allowed to write the screen play. Bet they wouldn't have done any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie, and it's very much worth seeing. Visually it is stunning-- the fake palace they built, and the geography is well worth the price. There are some complications that make it less than great, however. These problems might be inherent in the material-- adapting an actual English lady's actual diary. Should one poke fun at the colonializing 19th century British? The various "local" political rivals who evidently were more than willing to accept British trade and other "help" in exchange for fulfillment of personal ambitions? Or does one go entirely modern and politically correct, and pretend that the entire planet was a Berkeley coffee house just waiting for a chance to express neo-Marxist thought?This movie tried really hard to appear "p.c." and historical at the same time. There were some glaring inconsistencies, however-- e.g., the British woman was evidently "shocked" by the death penalty being applied for what amounted to treason against the king, and yet in her own country, just 15 years before, the death penalty was routinely applied to shoplifters, petty thieves, vagrants, and anyone else the English nobility found inconvenient, annoying, or simply yucky.The domestic montages were at times awkward and fakey. E.g., when the camera tried to build a sense of "Hey, we're getting along now!" by roaming around the palace grounds, showing the king, his kids, his old ladies and Anna all noticing birds and smiling at each other; noticing ducks and smiling at each other; noticing cutesy-poo antics of the young ones and smiling at each other. That was very stilted and phony feeling.But this movie was much better than the critics mostly said. For example, for me, the relationship between the king and the teacher was actually very realistic, quite believable, and powerful. So maybe it's just that many professional critics don't like to see what real humans might do in a love situation with complications-- after all, they do go apoplectic whenever a movie wants you to feel something deep and real. So ignore them, and enjoy it for what it is-- a valiant and earnest effort to tell a complicated and difficult story. I gave it an "8."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might have worked better with a different denouement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna Leonowens is best-known today as the character played by Deborah Kerr in "The King and I", but she was a real person, not a fictional one, and her story was also told in the film "Anna and the King of Siam" from 1946 (which I have never seen). "Anna and the King" is Hollywood's second non-musical version of her story. Anna was a widowed British schoolteacher who travelled to Siam, as Thailand was then known, to become tutor to the many children and wives of King Mongkut. In reality she seems to have had little contact with the King himself, but her diaries suggested otherwise, and Westerners have long been fascinated by the supposed friendship which grew up between them. Some of the elements of this film will be recognisable to anyone familiar with "The King and I". Both films mention Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and feature a doomed romance between Lady Tuptim, one of the King's concubines, and a commoner. There are, of course, lots of outrageously cute children running about everywhere. The fictitious subplot in which Anna helps the King foil a military coup by a treacherous general, however, appears to be an invention by the scriptwriters for this film. Like "The King and I" the film was banned in Thailand on account of its allegedly disrespectful portrayal of King Mongkut; it would appear that the country's l?se-majesté laws protect not only the current monarch but also his predecessors. This rather heavy-handed censorship seems strange in a country which claims (or did until the recent military coup) to be a democracy; imagine the storm of protest which would have been unleashed had the British government, for example, attempted to censor "Mrs Brown" because of the way it depicted Queen Victoria. The film could not, of course, be shot in Thailand itself, and filming took place in Malaysia. The casting of Chow Yun-fat rather than a European like Yul Brynner as Mongkut seems to have been an attempt by the film-makers to placate local concerns, but does not seem to have succeeded in this aim. Racial sensitivities in the Far East are not always the same as Western ones- the casting of three Chinese actresses as Japanese characters in "Memoirs of a Geisha" gave rise to protests in both China and Japan- and to Thais the casting of a Chinese actor as one of their country's most revered monarchs may have seemed just as insensitive as the casting of a Westerner. Chow's interpretation of the role is rather different from Brynner's- more sensitive and less autocratic and self-assured. One thing which may have offended the Thais is the depiction of the relationship between Anna and the King. With Kerr and Brynner, it was clear that their relationship was based upon friendship and mutual respect, but the question of whether they had actually fallen in love was left discreetly unanswered. With Chow and Jodie Foster it is all too clear that they are in love, if not lovers in the sexual sense, and the historical accuracy of this is (to say the least) doubtful. The emphasis of the story has shifted somewhat since the days of "The King and I". That film was made in the mid-fifties, a period when many regions of the globe were still under European colonial rule, something subtly reflected in the script. The Siam ruled by King Yul was a charmingly backward country which needed to be dragged kicking and screaming into the nineteenth century, a task which would have been undertaken by the colonial powers had its own ruler not resolved to do it himself. Here Anna arrives in Siam inwardly convinced of the superiority of Western culture and that her role will be to play a part in the enlightenment of a barbarian nation. As the story progresses, however, she realises that the real situation is far more complex and that the West has as much to learn from the East as vice versa. The teacher is taught. The film is visually attractive and beautifully photographed, and features an excellent performance from Foster, possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the nineties. She also copes well with her character's British accent, something which cannot be said of all American actors called upon to play British characters. (Foster's gift for accents is one of a number of characteristics she shares with Meryl Streep, possibly the most accomplished Hollywood actress of the eighties). The film does, however, suffer at times from a lack of plausibility, particularly in the subplot involving the rebel general, something inserted to turn it into a standard thriller with an identifiable villain. Were Siamese soldiers of this period really so badly trained that they would have mistaken the sound of fireworks for that of gunfire? "Anna and the King" makes for enjoyable viewing, but it might have worked better with a different denouement. 7/10 Some goofs. The story takes place during the early 1860s when King Mongkut would have been in his sixties, far older than the character played by Chow Yun-Fat. Reference is made to the "King of France", even though at this period France was ruled by Emperor Napoleon III. Admittedly, the distinction might have seemed academic to the Siamese, but no French diplomat would have committed the solecism of referring to his monarch as "le Roi" rather than "l'Empereur". And the royal children sing the song "Daisy, Daisy", which was not written until the 1890s, possibly as a satirical comment on Daisy Countess of Warwick, mistress of the Prince of Wales.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie that portrays that love can cross nationalities, classes, and is a classic for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Anna and the King is truly a wonderful love story that shows us how love knows no boundaries. Anna Leonowens, a widow played by Jodie Foster, comes to Siam with her son to be the teacher for the children of the King of Siam, King Mongkut, played by Yun-Fat Chow. This film does not start out as a love story; there are rumors of war with Burma, and just every day issues that the King has to deal with. Not to mention that the King finds Anna to be a very difficult woman. It is amongst his daily routine as King and his dealing with prominent issues, that a beautiful love story unfolds.As she does not know the traditions of Siam and does not possess the understanding as to why certain things are done, it is a learning curve on both the King and Anna's part. Anna constantly challenges the King's authority, and thinks that the King should do things the British way. There are times in the film where the King sees Anna's point of view and changes his mind. On the other hand, when she blatantly tries to command him to reverse one of his decisions, the King has no choice but to follow through with his decision. This is the point at which, Anna realizes that although the King has come to value her opinion, he is still the King. The further into the film you get, you realize more and more that the King is valuing Anna's opinion, and she is realizing and learning that the King not only values her opinion, but he seeks it out if she is patient.Throughout the film, as the King resolves conflicts not only between himself and Anna, but even with his daily duties as King, you begin to realize that the King and Anna are falling in love. Just as the lighting in the film plays a major but subtle role in the portrayal of the events, the King and Anna's falling in love is a subtle occurrence, similar to the subtle romance of Australia. When the King is holding Anna in his arms as they waltz a British waltz, the angle at which the camera is held, you finally see the love they have for each other etched all over their faces.While some may argue that there is not enough reality, accuracy of history, or love scenes, I still think Anna and the King is a wonderful movie that portrays that love can cross nationalities, classes, and is a classic for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment ? but, it's not history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining quasi-romantic drama that centres upon the relationship between an English woman ? Welsh, actually ? who taught English language to the children of King Mongkut of Siam (today, Thailand) in the 1860s.As cinematography and narrative, it works well: very professionally staged, filmed and acted by the production and acting crew. Although nominated for many awards, it didn't win one, however. That should not deter you from enjoying the acting prowess of Chow Yun-Fat as the King and Jodie Foster as Anna Leonowens.That is, if you like costume and historical dramas, then you'd probably find this film to be quiet acceptable. I did, and so did my daughter of thirteen.The story, as depicted, however, is simply Hollywood: Anna certainly taught the King's children for a few years; but, beyond that bald fact, all else in this story has very little to do with the true facts about Anna Leonowens. Should that matter? Yes, I suppose it does, conceptually. Does it matter, in this case? Well, that depends upon your point of view.Unhappily, as you know, Hollywood has a habit of mangling history to serve its needs and ends. With a story such as this, perhaps it's not such a bad thing if certain aspects are modified to suit the drama or the romance of that period in British and Siamese history? Indeed, when watching any historical piece of filming, it's better always to see it just as entertainment ? then check out the facts for yourself, if you want to know the "truth".On that basis, it's a film worth seeing, in my opinion. Having seen The King and I (1956) with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, I was intrigued to finally get to see this 1999 version. Both are good entertainment. Both have very little to do with truth. Ignore all that ? just enjoy a good performance, great drama, stunning sets and scenery, light comedy at times and an altogether exciting two hours or so.</fullReview>

Foster is perfect as always and even though I like Chow-Yun Fat I had never seen him do anything amazing before this. He is very good in this film however and deserves to be given appropriate credit.

Performances are magnificent on all counts, and this version of the story is better than the musical, as it feels more real.

He really gave his character a tremendous dignity and depth - his performance was darn nearly the only worthwhile thing in this movie.Otherwise, the movie was just stupid and historically inept. I wanted to slap Foster's character for sheer arrogant idiocy off the screen. Same with her annoying kid. Even though the movie makers tried not to, they still ended up being condescending to the Siamese (Thai) culture. And they made the British look like a bunch of stupid, arrogant schmucks.I stopped watching this film about 2/3 of the way through but felt I didn't miss too much.Yuch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of this visual regale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us do recall the exuberant performance of Yul Brynner, and for decades, the deprecatory King and I stood for the backwardness of new Asia. True, Andy Tennant "exploited" history as much as Anna Leonowens; yet as Tennant pierces the mist of Bangkok to reveal a revolutionary monarch, the plot matters little. It's all about characters in this lavish drama, rich with colors and detailed characterization. Despite critics' doubts of Foster's accent and occasional chafe in the role, the new mother is radiant in the role of Anna. Foster's techniques truly add a shade of credibility to the story--however fictitious it may be. Chow Yun-Fat, on the other hand, is hailed as the only thing brilliant about this movie by cynics and zealots alike. This god of actors, summons forth such compassion and power behind his subtlety: a smile, a wink, a hand motion--even w/ out his trademark gun and cigar, Chow still dominates the screen with his towering presence. This presence is so tender and touching that the entire cast rallies around his performance: from passionate Bai Ling (as Tuptim)to mischievous Melissa Campbell (as young princess). When I titled this review "a visual regale", I meant to emphasize that the real recognition this movie received during the awards season was indeed its dazzling wardrobe. Against the backdrop of the magnificent replica palace of King Mongkut built in Malaysia, the elaborate Courtier silk, Victorian satin depicts a glamorous view of Asia struggling to progress. And although many say the film drags a bit, personally I prefer this kind of old fashioned romance that let the aroma of love sink in and sip through the screen. A TRUE DELIGHT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the film, I walked out of the movie theatre with my eyes all red and still tears on my face. I don't remember how many times my eyes went wet and dry, wet and dry, andt wet again throughout the film. Having seen all the other versions of the same story, I must say this is the most honest and truthful one. Everything was so beautifully put together. It honestly displays the kind of crude beauty of Asia, the culture, the landscape, the people, even the custom that is often difficult to understand. The performance of all actors involved are superb, intensed but well-balanced. I saw the King of Siam with his most appropriate dignity, the way I always vision a king should behave. Everything in this film were precisely the way they should be: the music, the set, and the story line. For me, I think that's the ultimate Art a film can achieve: the Precision. There is this understated, unspeakable emotions between Anna and the King. I think that's the most extraordinary thing about this film. The sense of modesty in their relationships. And the ending was just perfect. No need to say more, just feel. However, I'm not surprised that the film is not well-received by the film critics, or audience here in America. Being an Asian, I can understand the beauty it stated and understated in the film naturally. Of course it's totally different from any other versions, even the one non-musical version done by Rex Harrison all those years ago. Because we are looking at the real things here, the real interaction between Asians and Westerners, not just from the Western point of views. And it is certainly not another empty spectacular saga. It is a love story, and more than that, this is not just the crush, it's the real thing. Not many people can take that beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the people from the country of location , i had a rare chance to watch this movie in the theatre because it had been banned.Thais have for a long time been worshiping the Monarchy as the demi-God.The expression about them in any negative ways like deprecating,offending,blaming .....etc. will be forbidden ,banned and punished according to the Lese Majeste law.The ban of this movie in Thailand vexed the liberal -minded a lot.They blamed the authority for the dictatorship.But one fine day i had a chance to buy the DVD and intentionally watched it with out prejudice.The production was quite mediocre ; compared with "The last emperor" or the other historical films although the filmmaker spent a lot of money on it.The funniest thing happening whenever Thais watched this movie was that the actor and the crews were Malaysians and they could speak Thai , as memorizing from the script , very poorly.If this movie had had a chance to be in Thai theatre , it would not have been able to captured the Thais' hearts.The second negative point of his movie was about King Monkut.Jo yun fat was absolutely different from the characteristic of the real king.King Monkut had been in priest hood for 27 years and he was the scholar.I wouldn't deny for his irascibility , but Jo could be only the good warrior king.The third was that this movie didn't only convey the audience with the historical account errors , it also made the new plot about Siam , so i want to correct these ;1.There was never the civil war or coup d'estate in Siam during king Monkut's reign.The king could sit on his throne very safely , supported by the family of powerful nobility named Boonnak.2. What a pity that the film overlooked the king's younger brother; king Pinkao who were very well-educated in western science.He was claimed to speak English even better than his older brother, not that fool in the film.3.King Chula ,succeeding his father ,abolished the slavery not because of the inspiration from Uncle Tom's cabin but the political background.The liberation of slaves and turn them to be the king's subject and would undermined the power of the nobility.4.The king never fell in love with Anna.The forth is that the movie was too flat, never giving the audience the real climax.The confrontation between the nobility-turn -the leader of the coup was too brief. The fifth , similar to "The last Samurai" this film was merely the look of farang (the westerner) from the long distance.They nervy tried to really understand the Eastern way.The play set by the young prince and princess during the royal feast was very horribly western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all of its predecessors, Anna and the King had much to live up to (The King and I and Anna and the King of Siam), and the film preformed beautifully. With sweeping landscapes, a talented cast, and truthful script, Anna and the King is easy to enjoy. It has every aspect of a classic: a timeless message, strong characters, and effective plot-use.In this remake, which is based upon the journal writings of real-life traveler and teacher Anna Leonowens, Jodie Foster brings the character and dilemmas of Anna to life. In her dealings with her friends, son (Tom Felton), and even the king himself (Yun-Fat Chow), she is truthful and open without losing her guarded safety. Equally as impressive is the role of King Mongkut, played beautifully, with honesty and realism. Chow mixes a regal intellect with a boyish playfulness in a winning combination that captures audiences.Following up the co-stars of Anna, is the company of colorful extras who give the film a lasting flavor and charm. Not the least of these being Louis, Anna's son. Between fist fights with the king's heir and causing mischief at sacred rice festivals, Louis adds an element of childishness in the middle of a serious plot, providing adequate grounding just as the scene begins to grow too thick.Director Andy Tennant finds a brilliant combination of characters and setting, complimenting stellar performances with captivation scenery. From the clear mountains to the exotic river, grand palace, and bustling market, every aspect of life is told through the expansive backdrops.Overall, I would say this is one of those films which will find a place along side such great pieces as The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music in the movie collections of future generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite reading much criticism of the movie Anna and the King, I found it great viewing. I thought the music throughout was perfectly chosen and complemented the scenes, as music seems to have a way of evoking the emotions in viewers. The set for the palace, and the Malaysian location shots were stunning backdrops for the story. I don't think even the tiniest detail was missed by the cast and crew. I admire the cast for the way they brought this story to life, in a way that made it viewable for almost all age-groups. After reading the true story behind Anna Leonowens, I found many people criticised the movie just because it wasn't the way things happened. However, in reality, there was no 'story' as such. People must remember most films are fiction, and are created to entertain us and briefly divert our attentions from reality. If all films were complete reality, no one would bother watching them. All in all, Anna and the King was the best romantic drama that I've seen in a while and I must confess it had me laughing and crying along with the characters. 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I crawled out of the theater on my hands and knees chanting, who is this Chow Yun-Fat and why, in my 50 + years of movie loving, don't I know him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all the versions made (so far), of the story of the school-teacher and the king.None of them are factual. I really wish SOMEONE would have the courage to show Anna as the Anglo/Indian she really was with dark brown hair and eyes. But that is really a small point.Since none of the stories are accurate, this one is not MORE INaccurate than the others. Certainly Anna and her King did not prance all over any ballroom. So, if people can accept the singing/dancing version, this more serious, and some-what more factual account, should be satisfactory. I enjoyed not having to suffer through another Yul Brynner over-the-top buffoon characterization of the King. And 30 seconds after Chow Yun-Fat first appeared, I forgot all about either Rex Harrison, (who was terribly miss-cast with Irene Dunn in a very early rendition of this story,) AND Yul Brynner the man I loved in the role when I was young and silly.Chow Yun-Fat brings with him authority, brilliance, sex appeal and humor. He is warm and charming, but also not to be trifled with, cajoled or threatened. Between the smile and the shoulders beats a heart that is fragile and can break. Yun-Fat is superb in this role.My problem with this film is the cutting. On the DVD you are treated to scenes that were shot but not included in the final cut. What a mistake excluding these scenes was! They give Foster the warmth and humanity she lacked in the scenes we see. They explain her motivation and her tragedy.There is part of the croquet scene that does not appear in the film, but should. Here Anna is shown beating the King! He explains that his wives always let him win, and Anna shoots him a flirtatious look and says, "Well, then I don't have to..." A delicious scene that defines their relationship and the sexual and intellectual tension between this impossible couple. The prologue and the coda of the film as it was originally conceived are also included in the DVD. How this film needed them. Tenant made some bad decisions that made his largest work to date, a merely fine film instead of the great film it might have been.But even with those regrets, I love Anna and The King as it is. The music is wonderful, especially the drumming, the scope of the production overwhelming and the acting excellent to splendid. The emotional tug-of-war between convention, duty and passion is well brought out by Yun-Fat and Foster, and the children are delightful. The scene when the King's favorite daughter dies in his arms is gorgeous and shattering! Here the King realizes that, for all his absolute power, he cannot control or change his destiny. I cry out loud every time I see this scene.Yun-Fat loves children and it shows in every scene he has with the talented young actors who play what the King called, the future hope of Thailand.Anna and The King is a film to love as long as you don't let history bog you down. And, just watching Chow Yun-Fat is reward enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this flick on VHS just for something for my wife and myself to do on a rainy day and it wasn't a bad film. This was a compelling true (yet slightly tainted by Hollywood) account of Anna Leonowens as a teacher that tutors the children of the King of Siam.It was a romantic movie that made the viewer have the same emotions as those that played in it. The movie takes the viewer through the new life of the culture shocked Anna in the land of Siam. Anna, along with her son Louis (Tom Felton), goes through extremes of joy, sadness, and anger as they learn the ways of Siam. Anna also deals with the death of her husband and how his memory and likeness is seen through the King.Meanwhile the British act innocently while behind the King they assist the Burmese in the on slot of attacks of the Siamese. This movie is unlike any other I have viewed so I can't compare it to any. There is plenty of action, tribulation, and romance so it is good for guys or gals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna and the King (1999): Dir: Andy Tennant / Cast: Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat, Bai Ling, Tom Felton, Randall Duk Kim: Rehash of The King and I right down to its tiresome relationship. Someone must have gotten bored and suggested, "Let us make the umpteenth version of The King and I, only give it a different title in an attempt to fool people into thinking that we came up with someone original!" Jodie Foster plays a school teacher named Anna who is assigned to teach the King's children. Chow Yun-Fat plays the King in a departure from his action roles. Structure is so boring that cable channels should replace it with beer commercials before the forgiving climax where Anna tells the King to remove the stick from his ass. Director Andy Tennant does his best. He previously made Ever After: A Cinderella Story as well as the dreary It Takes Two, which in itself is a rehash of The Parent Trap. Foster is one of the most dependable actresses in the business but she is playing a role so xeroxed that all she can do is recite what has been done before. Yun-Fat is known as an action star but here he plays his most boring role. Supporting actors play host to a bunch of stereotypes. Also with Bai Ling and Tom Felton who also get to weigh in on every other stereotype presented here. Excellent art direction within a film that changes nothing but its title.

I was never a huge fan of "The King and I" though it is lovely to look at and I love Deborah Kerr. I've intended to watch "Anna and the King" for some time, and it happened to come on HDNET movies this weekend. Thankfully, I recorded it. On the first watch, it quickly became one of my most romantic films of all time! I know it's much more fiction than fact, but good movies usually are to me. This was lavish, beautifully photographed, had a lovely score, had enough action to build suspense, and, wow, did Jodie Foster and Yung-Fat Chow (they've reversed his name) have palpable chemistry. Loved everything about it! I've watched it again several times already. I rarely do that. I also rarely give a film a 10, especially right away, but this one gets one for all the reasons above and more. I recommend it to anyone who loves period pieces, especially romantic ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit long and romance lacks chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1862. Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster) is an English widow school teacher who travels to Siam with her son Louis (Tom Felton). She is to teach English to the children of King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat). Mongkut is trying to maintain his country's independence while modernizing amid colonial pressures. He faces deceit from within and a force from Burma. She faces internal palace politics and cultural differences.This is beautifully shot. The acting is mostly fine. Jodie is a bit too hard. Chow Yun-Fat is bemused. They have little chemistry together. The movie is a bit overly long with a few too many side stories. It needs to decide to concentrate on the romance or the military intrigue. The movie seems to want it all and struggles because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! I had seen the musical with Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr before, and I love that as well - but in this movie one gets a more thorough, serious and realistic take on the subject, more meat on the bones so to speak."Anna and the King" is first of all a love story of course. This is the best way to make a moving and memorable love story: to show how the love between the man and the woman slowly grows, through little things. There is no sex in the movie, but in spite of that - or maybe because of that - it is one of the most erotic movies I have ever seen. In the 1940:s-1960:s the movie makers were experts in creating erotic tension in this way, by subtle means, understatement - but one rarely sees it in movies from the 1970:s and onwards."Anna and the King" is also a movie about cultural differences. It is fun to see how the King and his women and children learn from Anna... but also how she learns a little from them. Because the British do not do everything best in the world, and they did not in the 19th century either! :-)I also like that one can learn a bit about history, geography, ethnology, botany, zoology, etc. from this movie. And I love the beautiful photo of Thailand, and all the perfect details in architecture, costumes, jewelery, weapons, etc.. The dialog is intelligent, to the point and sometimes poetic, and the score is also perfect at all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely review a film which has already been covered this many time. However, I'll make an exception here because I visited and lived in Thailand for a total of nearly 4 years.It's difficult to make a judgment about this film because there are so many ways to look at it.For example, the story of Anna Leonowens is very basically true. She was the teaching governess of King Mongkut's children, and she certainly had a significant influence on Prince (and later) King Chulalongkorn; during a visit to Europe as an adult, he visited her long after her departure from Siam/Thailand. However, it is very unlikely that she had any undue influence on old King Mongkut, and it was certainly nothing like this film (or "The King &amp; I") portrays. There is little, if any, evidence that there was a concubine named Tuptim or that that subplot has any truth to it. Nevertheless, it's a "fun" story to see...as fiction often is. Here I would say 30% history, 70% fiction. Additionally, I may be wrong, but I don't recall in Thai history King Mongkut's brother being killed as depicted in the film.In terms of the sets, the film must be judged very differently. They are magnificent and, for the most part, remarkably accurate. King Mongkut's throne room was not that large, but aside from that I would have to give the sets an A+.On the other hand, in terms of settings, the producers and directors were not as accurate. I've been most of the places depicted here, and other than in the Three Pagoda Pass and Nong Khai, all the other sites (Bangkok/Krung Thep; the seaside palace; and Anna's house) there are NO mountains, just the flat flood plain of the Chao Phrya River.But, while I am not fluent in Thai, I speak a bit of it, and much of the dialog was very well spoken Thai language. Some of the extras did not look Thai to me.Jodie Foster did a fine job of Anna Leonowens. Some have criticized her British accent, and I can't speak to that. But her acting was very good. Chow Yun-Fat, as King Mongkut, was fine, although if you look up photos of King Mongkut, you'll find he was actually a very homely man (and that's putting it politely). Other primary supporting actors did a very reasonable job.So, overall, I give this film fairly good marks, although certainly not for historical accuracy. For entertainment value, it's well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mix Of History,Romance And Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna and the King is a biographical drama loosely based on Anna and the King of Siam, the story of Anna Leonowens, who was an English schoolteacher in Siam, now Thailand, in the 19th century.It stars Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-fat together with Bai Ling and Tom Felton. This movie is a tale of Anna's culture clash and unexpected romance with King Mongkut, the King of Siam. It was directed by Andy Tennant.Anna Leonowens is hired by the king of Thailand to help care for his children. The king wants the best for his children, but Anna soon discovers that he is a strong-willed but quixotic leader, and her stay in Thailand becomes a struggle for power with romantic overtones, as they decide who will have authority over the royal youngsters.The movie is a deliberate retelling of 'The King and I' without the musical interludes. It is a slow, but ultimately rewarding period drama due to the cast's performances particularly Jodie Foster and the movie's beautiful cinematography.It remains watchable and entertaining for it is a richly satisfying mix of history, drama and romance despite its old- fashioned overtones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if inaccurate, this is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to tell you a story: back when DVD players were first released, I had to convince my mother to buy one. The one movie that I convinced her to buy the DVD player with the movie Anna and the King, it was a movie she adored and had beautiful cinematography. She always begged me to watch it, but I never got to it. Unfortunately, she passed away a few years ago and I was going through her movie collection yesterday and decided to watch it for her. There's my touching story of the day. So Anna and the King is basically the non-musical version of The King and I. I never read the book, so I'm not sure how accurate it is with the movie, but from what I understand, a lot of people say it isn't accurate at all. But judging from what I saw, Anna and the King was a good movie.Anna Leonowens is a widow has come to Siam with her son Louis to teach English to the royal children. She is a strong-willed, intelligent woman and this pleases the King, who wants to modernize his country to keep it safe from the threat of colonialism, while protecting many of the ancient traditions that give Siam its unique identity. Anna is enchanted by the royal children. Siam is under siege from what appears to be a British-funded gang against King Mongkut, using Burmese soldiers. Mongkut sends out his brother Prince Chaofa and his military adviser General Alak to investigate. However, it turns out that Alak is the man behind the coup and now the king is in turmoil on who he can trust; maybe Anna.My only problem with the film is that it does run a little long making it drag. At two and a half hours long, it does feel like it, especially with the end. But the acting and cinematography really make up for whatever you feel you lost in time. Jodie Foster pulls in a very good performance as Anna. She's beautiful, kind and very intelligent and makes you believe that she could charm any leader easily. Yun-Fat Chow is very dignified as the king and you truly care for him as you dig in deeper into his character. He's a man who not only leads the country, but wants to make it modern with freedom. He wants to remain as a certain strong man that leads his land, but wants to be a good father as well. He has over a dozen wives and over 50 children; you think having 3 kids is more than enough, I'd like to see the King help the kids with their after school assignments.The cinematography is so beautiful and the lands look stunning in this picture as you feel taken with Anna on this wonderful journey. The colors and scope of the film is grand and epic. The villains of the film are a little basic and you really don't care too much about them. It's the two leads that steal the show and it's their mutual love and respect of each other that carries the film well. The children did a good job and there's a baby Tom Felton in the picture. Now a warning that the film is a bit long, but I think it was over all worth it. Anna and the King, I could see why my mother was convinced to transfer to a better picture and sound over this movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is interesting to be faced with a fundamentally different reworking of something which is so familiar that it has practically worn grooves in your brain. The much loved (especially by me) musical The King And I is a filmed adaptation of the stage musical based on the diaries of Anna Leonowens, tutor to the children of the 19th century King Mongkut of Siam, and charged with helping the Royal family of Siam move towards an understanding of, and accommodation with, the western world. Anna And The King, with Jodie Foster as Anna Leonowens and Chow Yun-Fat as King Mongkut tells the same story in straight dramatic fashion.It is a good film. The culture clash story is just as engaging as it was before. The story gets out and about rather more than the studio-bound musical, with production value well on display in terms of gorgeous scenery. Both Foster and Chow give excellent performances (Chow particularly so) and one gets a much better picture of the importance of the issues involved.This is a rewarding companion piece to The King And I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about the history of Thailand or the king portrayed in this film based on a true story when I watched it, so I approached it from a purely entertainment angle. It delivers as an entertaining, artistic and engaging film. The story line is interesting, the leading actor and actress are credible and the scenery is stunning.Since then I have found out a bit more about the historical value of the king and his impact on the country. The teacher's influence on the king has understandably been exaggerated to suit the film's needs, but what I was disappointed with was the wasted opportunity to capitalise on the richness of the history and the significance of the events that played out.The act of betrayal that the king experiences, the simply beautiful location, the spirituality of the king and his people and the political motives of the aggressors were all present, but the film tried to relate them all to the romance between the king and the teacher. They should have been tapped into in their own right and the romance shouldn't have been the primary focus of the film. I do understand that was the point of the film, but I think Hollywood's habit of looking for romance in everything meant they missed what would have been a great film without the need to rely on tried and tested method. I guess romance sells and film makers nowadays want to produce safe films that will sell, rather then genuinely explore interesting events, but this is one of those films where the director should have been braver and respected the audience's intelligence.Still, as I said, it's an entertaining enough film, but I did not enjoy the, at times, cringe-worthy romance. Could have been an epic in my opinion but shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake of The King &amp; I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason why I went and saw this movie is because Chow-Yun-Fat was one of the main actors. It seems that Fat is making a name for himself in Hollywood and this is a pretty major role that he has scored, but then in his last two Hollywood movies, The Corrupter and the Replacement Killers, he has taken the lead role as well. He may have done others, but I think that before the Replacement Killers, his only movies were Hong Kong movies, but for those movies he does have a very impressive resume (including The Killer - a masterpiece of all movies). This movie is about the clash of cultures. It is based on the old musical The King and I, but the problem there was that I do not think that Yul Brynner was Asian. Fat is and as such suited the role much better, but I don't think many people were too concerned with the nationality of the main character of the King and I. A teacher comes to Siam as the tutor for the king's son. The teacher is actually quite headstrong, and being British, believes that she is not subordinate to anybody. She shows the king the proper respect, if he was a European King, but refuses to go the way of the natives of the land. Not only that, but she also attempts to enforce British ideals onto the culture, especially in regards to slavery and polygamy. But then the King doesn't fully understand the concept of why one has only one wife in England. To him, the wife is to make sure that there is an heir on the throne, while the concubines are for his own personal pleasure. It is that reason that he could never really marry the teacher, even though they do develop a strong relationship. In essence he is already married, and through her traditions, she could not simply ignore that. The movie is focused around the relationship that develops between Anna and the King. Both of them are very headstrong people, the king goes without saying while, as I previously said, Anna is British and as such not willing to accept the superiority of an obviously non-European tradition. Still, both of them come to understand each other's traditions, though Anna changes less than the king, but she does come to see the human side of him. What happens, in essence, is that Siam remains independent, but changes enough to be acceptable to the European nations. It is still a very Eurocentric movie. It tries to say that nations have been allowed to develop on their own, but this is not really the case here. The next king has been influenced by European teachings and as such the changes that are made, are made because the Europeans have said so. In the end, Siam, though remaining independent, becomes another European puppet state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is not bad, but the story is laughably untrue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being Thai myself, I admit that the issue about Kings of Thailand are quite sensitive. But I say the movie itself is not bad in terms of the production and story telling. One thing about the production that bothers me is the bad-accent Thai. I understand that they needed the casts who spoke fluent English and they mustn't have gotten much cooperation from Thailand with the casting, so they put up with the Chinese casts who are Thai look-alikes with the weirdest Thai accent. I respect their effort but I can't understand what they say without subtitles. The script writer tried so hard to put as much respect for Thai culture as possible into the movie, which I appreciate that. But since they work on the book written by a very self-absorbed woman, it didn't help much on the unconvincing story elements though. The original material is very distorted and too fictionalized to be called a biography. According to many Thai and foreign historians, Anna just observed and then integrated herself into the important events occurred during her time in Thailand. For example, a Thai king in ancient times would never, ever, allow an English teacher on the same royal boat, no matter how he likes her. This is only the start. She even made stuff up about geographical facts.Anna was most likely lying about the king mentioning her in his will and that she didn't accept the legacy. Because, in 'fact', if a Thai king liked anyone so much, he would just award the official title and some money or properties to that person. And that's it, not the royal legacy.Best of all, the real King Mongkut did mention Anna in a written document,shortly, as 'a teacher who is quite nosy', not an inspiring friend who had led Siam into a new era like she imagined herself to be, or she would've been in Thai history along with other important women or foreigners. I bet the real Anna wasn't even as brave or outspoken as in the book. Because with our 'uncivilized' way, she'll be right back on the ship the minute she was so rudely barged into the palace hall. In conclusion: As a movie, the friendly teacher-and-student relationship, with a little touch of romance, between Anna and The King is portrayed quite beautifully. The film shows the respect for cultural differences and even the most brutal part of the movie (the execution) isn't come off so savage. The movie is pretty good in its own right.But as for Anna's story, I say her book isn't any more true than Forrest Gump or The Last Samurai. Only that Forrest Gump didn't flat out lie about being a true story. I bet she fantasized herself and The King as John Smith and Pocahontas.This movie was banned from being shown in Thailand. Though I do not agree with the over-protective policy of the Thai government, I do not think that it's right to honor the lying btch as a heroine who saved my country either. So, if you want to watch it, just don't take it seriously, at all.PS. Chow Yun Fat did an admirable job speaking Thai. His pronunciation is quite good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andy Tennant the director of films such as Hitch and Fools Rush in directs this re imagining of The King and I.Although everyone already knows the basis of the story before they even sit down to watch this film Tennant is smart enough to combine elements that we know and love with new concepts while making the film far more visually interesting than the musical ever was.Jodie Foster does well with her role while there is also a nice early appearance of Tom Felton who Harry Potter fans will know as Draco Malfoy in the role of her son.Not quite sure this film can be placed in the same category of films like Gladiator or Braveheart as others have claimed but it is an enjoyable enough film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anna and the King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The King and I was a great adaptation of the true story based on the lead female character's diaries, and then there's more realistic version from director Andy Tennant (Hitch). Basically, set in the 1890's, English school teacher Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster), with her son Louis (Harry Potter's Tom Felton), is summoned to the palace of Siam by King Mongkut (Crouching Tiger's Chow Yun-Fat) to teach his fifty-eight children. It takes quite a while for Anna and the King to get to used to each other, but she wins over the royal children, especially Princess Fa-Ying (Melissa Campbell), very easily. Throughout the story, Anna tries to help the King get the respect of the English, but instead a war is started, she tries to avoid a forbidden romance being found out, and she cannot be near him when he has someone executed. Obviously their hate is not all the way through, it is obvious they grow stronger feelings for each other, though you never see anything happen, you get the idea. Also starring Ling Bai as Tuptim, Syed Alwi as The Kralahome - Prime Minister, Randall Duk Kim as General Alak, Kay Siu Lim as Prince Chowfa, King Mongkut's Brother, Keith Chin as Prince Chulalongkorn, Mano Maniam as Leonowens' Indian Servant Moonshee and Geoffrey Palmer as Lord John Bradley. Foster sports an impeccable English accent, Yun-Fat is alright at being mostly sweet-natured with a little majestic attitude, if the film wasn't so long and political it might be a little better, so I much prefer and recommend The King and I. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score for George Fenton and Best Original Song for "How Can I Not Love You". Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know why 'Anna and the King' exists. There is a perfectly watchable version starring Yul Brynner (The King and I) and this adaptation doesn't bring anything new to the table. Note however that this version is not a musical. Both Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat are fine as the leads but the film isn't particularly interesting. The chemistry between them seems muted. There's an unnecessary subplot that detracts from the main storyline and weakens the climax of the film. It remains watchable albeit mediocre. There's some lovely scenery and a few visuals impress.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scarcity of Passion Plagues "Anna and the King" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surplus of pomp in "Anna and the King" cannot hide its scarcity of passion. The fourth account of forbidden love between a widowed English governess and Asian royalty boasts impressive authenticity, but "Ever After" director Andy Tennant and co-scripters Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes neglect the heart of the story. When the climactic showdown between the hero and villain tops the best scene between the heroine and the hero, the filmmakers should have known they had emphasized the wrong elements. Credibly cast as they are, Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat come up short on chemistry because their roles allow them little intimacy. Ostensibly, "Anna and the King" emerges as an above-average historical costumer undercut by its dearth of romance."Anna and the King" takes place in Siam during the 1860s. Anna arrives by ship in Bangkok with her son, Louis (Tom Felton) and two Indian servants to tutor the King's son in the 'scientific' ways of the West. Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster of "Contact") finds herself immediately at odds with the monarch and the savage customs of Siam. She demands that he honors his word and allows her to live outside the walls of his palace, but he insists that she live within them. Eventually, in a contest of wills and wits, they grow to tolerate each other and he bestows on her an elegant house in the country. Later, instead of tutoring only his son, King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat of "The Killer") orders her to teach all 58 of his children! The relationship between King Mongkut and the British schoolmarm Anna Leonowens lacks theatrics. Tennant and his scenarists must take the blame for the shortage of emotional sparks. The leads are left alone together only twice in this two-hour plus epic. First, they quarrel over a tragic court verdict about two illicit lovers not entirely unlike themselves. Second, they hover on the threshold of intimacy during a night encounter on the beach, but propriety compels them to withdraw to their respective corners. Of course, miscegenation and politics create an impasse between them, but these characters seem doomed from the start in spite of their mutual admiration.Tennant excels at showing what keeps the King and Anna apart from each other. She worships the memory of her dead war hero husband, while he reigns over a volatile frontier kingdom troubled from within and without, sharing his passion and energy with his 23 wives and 42 concubines. Anna never exasperates the King as she did in the first two versions. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat quarrel, but they never tear each other's clothes off for hot, sweaty sex.Finally, in the name of political correctness, an Asian actor portrays an Asian ruler. Chow Yun-Fat refuses to imitate his prestigious predecessors in his interpretation of the King. He wears the part well and delivers a performance that may be too subtle for his own good. Moreover, he shuns Yul Brynner's bombastic strut in director Walter Lang's 1956 musical and seems too restrained. Nevertheless, Yun-Fat's King is a sagacious sire. Although he is the absolute monarch, he knows that he can only bend traditions, not break them.The straight-forward, Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes screenplay resembles an anthology of Hollywood classics, among them: "King Solomon's Mines," "The Robe," "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness," "Doctor Zhivago," and "Out of Africa." Asian action star Chow Yun-Fat maintains an authoritative presence throughout the action. Smoking a Clint Eastwood cheroot, the King stages an audacious stand-off against an enemy army, but Anna backs up his bluff and saves his neck.The filmmakers err in putting the background in the foreground and vice-versa. Too many peripheral issues displace the love story. "Anna and the King" concerns what you cannot have in life. Tennant fails to milk the plot for its melodrama."Anna and the King" won't erase the indelible impression that the 1956 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner made on the minds of many moviegoers. Tennant's spin on this popular yarn about love lost looks spectacular and evokes a moment or two of passion, but he has emphasized politics over passion.Altogether, despite its sturdy cast, its breathtaking widescreen photography and its scenic Malaysian grandeur, "Anna and the King" amounts to an occasionally touching but tight-lipped tearjerker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I have begun to appreciate some of Jodie Foster's talents. And no, none of those involve anything with action and passionate, like Lucy Liu, or something seedy, like Paris Hilton. No, they involve taking on serious acting roles. What I mean to day is, she is more into drama.Chow Yun-Fat also shows why he is an heart throb on the other side of the Pacific. His relationship with Foster actually works and both play their roles in this classic tale. Foster, with her confrontational style attracts Yun-Fat. Though both of them are from different worlds and backgrounds, their relationship one time in Siam is shown.Of course, there are critiques. The movie does go a little long. And while it tries to be a little more historical than previous incarnations, it still did not go all the way. The most glaring of those would be the internal rebellion and the tale of the concubine.Overall, however, this is a good movie. I certainly respect those in it. "B+"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sounded like it would be a guaranteed bore and I was totally wrong! Yes, it's the same story as the famous '50s musical "The King and I" - but it is great in it's own right.Basically, the story is inspired by the true story of a lady who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut in 1860s Siam (known now as Thailand). It starts with her arrival to the palace and follows her time there.Three reasons why this movie really succeeds: Great acting by Yun-Fat Chow (absolutely fantastic as the king) and Jodie Foster (the teacher), a great story with interesting events, and really nice visuals.The biggest difficultly will be actually getting motivated to watch this movie because it may sound a bit simplistic and "family oriented". I really recommend ignoring any such thoughts and checking it out - once you start, it will be hard to stop. Just about everyone can enjoy this film.</fullReview>

And there it lacks ...It lacks the heart and the purity of the original with Yul Brunner as a much better "King" (with more edges than Yun Fat). The original had another flavor, it played around another time and it worked. Although Jodie is an excellent actress, you just don't buy into her. And you especially don't buy into the "relationship" between her and the King ... etcetera etcetera etcetera! (had to do that at least one time, for Brunners sake). So if you want to listen to me, go watch the original instead of this one (yes the original is a musical, but even I liked it and I'm not that into musicals!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Anna Leonowens, the English schoolteacher who came to Siam in the 1860s to teach the children of King Mongkut. She becomes involved in his affairs, from the tragic plight of a young concubine to trying to forge an alliance with Britain to a war with Burma that is orchestrated by Britain. In the meantime, a subtle romance develops between them.Okay, there are some films that are good and some that are good but are too long. This is an example of the film being good but is too long, although, I got to say, the cinematography is good in the film. There are also some films that have too many subplots.I don't mind these subplots like in Happy Feet but I think the subplots in this film was too stupid or unneeded. The acting by Jodie Foster was good but to be honest, Yun-Fat Chow isn't good playing a person who tries to speak English.Again, the overall look of the film, including costume designs are great but some points in the film might be slow, long, boring, and unnecessary. Although there are flaws, this film might be decent enough for a rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let the magic of romance and the beauty of Siam consume you, sweep, and take you away to a world where the king rules the land and a teacher rules the king's heart. There are only two other movies I would consider to be worthy of masterpiece status: "Saving Private Ryan" and "Titanic." Now a third can be added to this list: "Anna and the King." "Anna and the King" is a true masterpiece that is filled with heart &amp; soul, a beautiful setting and superb performances.I was very impressed with the performance of Chow-Yun Fat because he made the transition from action star to dramatic actor flawlessly. Fat showed his versatility in playing a king. Fat pulled off this role with perfection. He made it so easy for me to enjoy this movie because of his screen presence and believability of the performance as well as the chemistry between Anna and the King.This masterpiece can not be completed without the performance Jodie Foster turned in. Foster delivers the type of performance worthy of an Oscar. She once again has established herself among the elite that have the special gift of natural talent.Foster and Fat come together beautifully to bring the true story of the romance of Anna Leonowens and King Momokut. The chemistry can be felt from a distance and it works from the first moment they appeared together; they were very compatible with one another."Anna and The King" is visually stunning in so many ways with beautiful settings such as the palace. Also, the costumes are well-made and suited the movie perfectly. "Anna &amp; The King" will take you on a journey that will touch, warm and fill your heart with spirit only a motion picture masterpiece can bring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(just so you all of you know that haven't seen this movie i wouldn't read the third paragraph it might spoil a small part of the movie for you)Alright so I never really had an interest to see this movie heact I'm only 14 and nobody around my age really wants to see history movies like this. But I decided to give it a try and WOW I was amazed! It is truly one of the best movies that I have ever seen! Chow Yun Fat was amazing in it, he acts a lot with his eyes and facial expressions so his acting in this movie is worthy of an Oscar. Jodie Foster is by far my FAVORITE actress and once again could have received an Oscar for her performance as Anna. Everything that I've seen her in she has been awesome.Along with wonderful acting the scenery is beautiful and helps tell the story. The story is of course about Anna Leoonowens going to Siam to teach the 58 children of King Mongfut. At first you see that they very much don't care for each other as friends. Anna has her ideas and strong opinions about the Siamese ways and King Mongfut has his about England's and doesn't like her butting into his problems at the beginning of movie, but as they get to know each other they slowly start to look past each others differences and become more than good friends. I think that the messages of story is is to not judge people by their cultural differences and to really get to them as a person and not think that the ways of your country should be the ways of the world for example. Chow Yun Fat's impersonation of King Mongfut is that he is definitely not a King that is afraid of change. Anna points out to him a lot in the film especially when Tuptim and Balat are going to be executed that just isn't right to do things like that to people that might have broken a law by loving someone. He understands that he just can't change it at that time in that situation.I mean at the execution you don't see him there cheering with the rest of the crowd, he's praying back at the palace and he feels sorry that this had to happen and Anna trying to read her bible, trying to forget about what is happening. that whole scene is just absolutely sad and leaves me in tears every time. This movie is wonderful and is a must see, it might be more of a chick flick since it's a romance, but i'm sure that a lot of guys would really like this movie. a lot of guys that i know liked this movie! so give it a chance! you might be surprised! 10/10 for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about the various historical inaccuracies in regarding to this movie actually, but then I did watched it anyway. It had shown like a few times on the television before, with the latest like early this year.English governess Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster) was being called to be the governess of the Thai king's (Chow Yun Fatt) several children. Between all those moments, tense political moments in regards to the British started to surface and Anna started to wonder where she truly is.Maybe growing up and so used to learn and heard about various Asian cultures (other than the western ones), it's so grand to see all that displays being featured in the movie. Jodie Foster as the English governess...I have to admit actually she is real pretty in that. Despite what many had said about her portrayal in the movie.Sometimes it's good for a change to see something really different from what Hollywood has been producing as yet, and this is one of those. Maybe it has not lived up to what some had expected, but then at least the pageantry in the movie is already there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that anyone would have a problem with this movie. I gave it a ten rating because as far as a historical record it is one that is the most true to the word of Anna Leonowens' diary ever told. Jody Foster came thru with this film like she has never done before and I don't believe that she will ever do again.This story of the relationship of Anna Leonowens and King Mongkut of Siam was so true to her diary that my heart screams out to those that do not understand the true meaning of the story.Siam was the strongest nation in Southeast Asia from 1767 to 1893. One of its secrets was keeping good relations with China, something the Thais had succeeded in doing since the Nan Zhao era. King Mongkut Rama was responsible for making it that way. His son Chulalongkorn Rama V (1868-1910) went even so far as to abolish slavery in his country after the teachings of Anna Leonowens.Not only did they portray the beautiful country that was Siam, But they let us see a beauty of a country that was later divided by the French and the Chinese and the English to name a few. Vietnam was a province of Siam, as well as Cambodia.Had this beautiful country survived, I am sure that it would be the vacation Mecca of the modern world.It's leaders tried very hard to keep it's beauty and magnetism until it's fall in 1939. What a wonderful look at the history of this once great nation. I think that Mongkut Rama and his son Chulalongkorn Rama would have been happy to see their country brought to the public in such a great light!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you see the movie, comparisons with The sound of Music are inevitable.While the similarities cannot be denied, the movie is significantly different, even unique. while the story is not a new one, the treatment certainly is visually stunning. the Cinematography of Siam's scenic beauty is breathtaking and while in some places the film does bear resemblances to an ad for Thai Tourism, the land, the customs , the people and the period have been depicted beautifully in the movie. The pace of the movie never slackens and the chemistry between Foster and Fat is outstanding.Right from the starting frame to the end, the movie never lets up in pace, except in places where physical violence and massacres are shown, which i feel take away from the core of the movie, which is a relationships between people of disparate backgrounds and cultures. Fat gives an outstanding performance as a witty, cool and sagacious ruler of the kingdom.The king's self effacing character is brilliantly portrayed by Chow yun fat who gives a masterful performance. Jodie Foster is as usual good although her performance seems a bit strained when compared to Fat's who makes it look easy. The story is a very poignant one and there is no pandering to Hollywood candy as the script boldly unfolds several tragedies which are heart wrenching. All in a all a movie which will leave a lasting impression and the some of the laughter and tears might stay with you longer than you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't quite understand why we needed yet another film adaptation of AnnaLeonowens's ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM. There is already one finedramatic version from 1946 with Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne, superb in their roles, as well as the iconic musical with Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr in peak performance mode. Well thanks to Chow Yun-Fat, this glacial movie is wellworth your time. But it is long, and way too formal. The cinematography isgorgeous. Sets and costumes serve the film magnificently. The story of anEnglish teacher who comes to teach, and eventually civilize the King of Siam's royal household is a bit twee in our modern age, but it has always beeneffective. The problem here is one of a lack of chemistry between Anna and the King. Not that Chow Yun-Fat is not trying. He is a commanding screen presence, and his transition from a spoiled and willful ruler to a thoughtful king who begins to understand things beyond his immediate emotional needs is very convincing. He's a wonderful romantic presence here--sexy and restrained. The problem is in Jodie Foster's downright frosty performance. I think she feels uncomfortably saddled with a British upper class accent. You know she's worked had with her dialog coach, but it sounds rigid, and she's never been a romantic leading lady. Foster's specialty is strong-minded, independent women with a stubborn streak who don't easily fit in. Here's she corseted and cosseted into a role that feels wrong. There romantic chemistry here, alas, is one-sided, and it sinks the film. Enjoy it for the scenery, the film's outstanding craft and Chow Yun-Fat.</fullReview>

I am no expert in the Thai language, but the subtitled language used had no bearing on the language I am used to hearing on a daily basis.

I never saw him before in anything, but since watching this film, was told he was in the relatively recent "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon". He didn't do any martial arts in this move (Anna and the King), but I was told he was as good as Bruce Lee in martial arts. (arguably, perhaps as I am a huge Bruce Lee fan.). Any ways, it may be construed as a chicks film, but I thought there were some disturbing parts in it, as the young lovers/monks...are tortured and murdered while King needs to keep up with tradition. I don't know whether or not this film was true to history, but I would definately recommend it for anyone who wants to put down the converter for awhile from surfing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1860s, Anna Leonowens and her son Louis moved from India to Siam so that Anna could teach King Mongkut's oldest son Prince Chulalongkorn. When Anna arrived, she did not intend to offend anyone but ended violating local customs, such as when she stood in the presence of the prime minister.In that day and age, it was quite unusual for women to stand up for their rights the way Anna did, and the men especially were shocked by her behavior.Anna ended up teaching all of the king's children as well as her son, and on the first day things did not go too well; once again, Anna went against the norms of the society and the result was a fight between her son and Prince Chulalongkorn.Eventually, King Mongkut came around to Anna's way of thinking, as much as someone in his position could, and even though he had 26 wives, he seemed to be falling for her.Meanwhile, the king had to deal with problems with the British and the French, and especially with the Burmese people. What was being described as a war resulted in the hanging of innocent people from trees. Also, Anna opposed the idea of slavery. She persuaded Chulalongkorn to read "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and bought the freedom of one servant girl who had been chained up, which caused a lot of problems.Jodie Foster did a wonderful job, serious and determined at times, as well as charming, with a great smile. And you'd never know she wasn't English.Yun-Fat Chow also did a fine job, but I've seen enough clips of Yul Brynner in the same role to know he did it better. All the major roles appeared to be well acted, and the use of the native language with subtitles added realism, even if it made the movie more of a challenge.There was some comedy, such as when Anna had to plan an anniversary party which was supposed to help the British and the French get along better with the king. There were also several sad moments. The second half of the movie was mostly unpleasant, though. There was a group plotting to overthrow the king, and an unjust punishment for the love between a woman and a man. Both of these resulted in more violence than I would have cared for.The movie had its good parts, and I liked enough of it.SPOILER: One highlight for me that came close to the end was an effort by Anna, her son, and Chulalongkorn to fool the king's enemies into thinking they were being attacked at a key bridge the king wanted to destroy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great story - writing and directing are good, as is the acting. A bit repetitious at times - could have been shorter. Jodi Foster with an English accent... so-so, but she can act. Action and suspense are excellent. Depends fairly heavily on subtitles that are almost entirely illegible on the small screen - not just too small but distorted beyond recognition. That's one of the biggest shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chow Yun-Fat gave an unparalleled performance as the King of Siam, so romantic and sensual; the cinematography and soundtrack were breathtaking; Costume and set designs were superb. Then, Jodie Foster opens her mouth and out comes the worst British accent on film (yup, worse that the 5 minutes Kevin Costner attempted one in "Robin Hood"). Her accent and wooden performance were so distracting, it was difficult at times to focus on the film. I would like to know why American actors fail to sound believable when using foreign accents when British and Australian actors affect American accents (even Southern ones) with such believability and ease(i.e., Cate Blanchette in "The Gift," Hugh Jackman in "Someone Like You").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summary: Anna, a school teacher, noble Englishwoman and widow of an officer goes to Siam with her son Louis to teach English to the children of King Mongkut of Siam. Upon their meeting Anna reveals herself as a very stubborn western cultured woman, who believes in equals and constantly opposes the King, who has 68 children, 26 wives and 40+ concubines yet his heart settles upon Anna even due to their conflicts he tries to bring his country into an alliance with England in order to keep the Burmese regime out, but with his own life and the lives of his royal family at risk King Mongkut is forced to make some difficult choices.A very touching movie I gave this an even 8/10, a brilliant performance by Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster, for a moment it seemed as if something would happen between Anna and the King, but the suspense of their feelings lasts to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romance between an Asia King and an English woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not exactly a remake of "King and I, The" (1956). The former was much more a musical piece than a drama of the present film, which draws some aspects of the former Thailand then known as Siam, and also of Indochina with the presence of British and French troops in Burma, and Vietnam-Cambodia, respectively. Although the scope of the film was to give a love drama, the director was able to present how the Siamese monarchy lived, the number of concubines and sons-daughters of the king, and the nearly eternal problems between Thailand and Burma, where their borders up to date are places invaded by guerrillas from Burma, several of them active opium smugglers. The influence of British colonialism in that zone is slightly shown as well as its ambition to also convert Siam in its protectorate. In any case, the director Andy Tennant did not seem to go more into details of this political situation, he just mentioned it to provide more argument and color to the film. Sentimentally Anna felt in love with the king, but hopefully did not become another concubine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive story about a rather mysterious woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not one precisely given to saying things like who my favourite actor is, or actress, or director; in other fields I tend not to categorize anybody as being my favourite author, or favourite composer, or favourite singer. This is generally a field into which people with few criteria and little knowledge tend to fall with great ease. However, for some years now it has been apparent to me that Jodie Foster does tend to edge a little above the usual run-of-the-mill actresses out there. Firstly, how many of all those beautiful bodies have a university degree? Jodie Foster does. This alone would seem to suggest that there is intelligence working with this fine actress. And that is not so frequent these days. She first caught my attention in a small, but important, part in `Taxi Driver' (1976) (qv), and especially so in `The Silence of the Lambs' (1991), `Sommersby' (1993), `Maverick' (1994) and finally `Nell' (1991), which to this day must stand as her best film to date, together with `The Silence of the Lambs' perhaps.In `Anna and the King' she has an unlikely coupling with the good looking Yun-Fat Chow, interpreting the character of Anna Leonowens. Since `The King and I' this personage has sprung up a few times in very diverse forms, which, it should be said, has only added more confusion to who that lady really was. Starting from her own writings which were mainly untrue ? lies, if you prefer ? and the fact that records in Wales and India refuse to disclose exactly where and when she herself was born and there is absolutely no mention of her two children ? Avis and Louie ? in the births registries, and there is even wonton disorder in fathoming out who her real father was, we end up with the only really sound fact to go on: she died in Canada in 1915.However, as the story goes, she happened to be in Singapore, but nobody mentions where her daughter Avis is supposed to have been, when the King of Siam summons her to his palace to be the tutor for a few dozen princes and princesses, and a horde of other off-spring. Well, they all fall in love at the end, more or less, and isn't that just lovely? Apart from the fact that the film is visually entertaining, even with interesting dialogues, and the interpretations are more than acceptable ? I would like to specify the role of Swee-Lin as the woman condemned to beheading as perhaps the highlight, ? it was delightful to see a little of Malaysia again. Back in the early seventies I spent a few months walking around the island of Penang, where much of this film is made, as well as the Cameron Highlands and the east coast (where giant turtles come up on to the beach to lay their eggs in the sand, and the locals steal them to make delicious breakfasts, what a shame??..).I was also very perplexed by the Thai being spoken: it did not sound right; yes, it was Thai all right, but it seemed wrong somehow. Having studied the IMDb cast list I noticed that a good many of the actors had Chinese names: and then I realised that of course they were speaking Thai with the tonal forms of most Chinese dialects. So was I glad to stumble across another review of this film from mick-90 Bangkok, Thailand 10 February 2002 who says he had to read the subtitles to understand what they were saying in Thai!All in all the film is attractive, and you need not bother with the PG-13 rating in the US. However, it is rather long for the story it has to tell and younger people might become bored. If you are looking for a solid plot which gives the idea of going somewhere and ending up in something all nicely packaged up, you will miss the point of this film.6 ? out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1999's Anna and the king is a likable film for many. Despite starring Jodie Foster, "Anna and the king" didn't get a lot of accolades, only two Oscar nominations, which were well deserved. The movie is beautifully filmed and takes us to amazing Greece. There is much to admire and dislike in this film. First of all, I want to begin with the things I truly admire: 1. Jodie Foster doesn't disappoint, she gives a remarkable performance, the way her eyes actually get teary-eyed is so believable that they make the viewer feel what she's feeling at the moment. Her red eyes make me enjoy her performance to its fullest. 2. The costumes were amazing and appropriate for the whole story.3. The cinematography is gorgeous and helps the story be a little bit interesting. That's all I can think of right now as far as pros in this movie are concerned. The disappointment in this movie is the whole story. It's unnecessarily long; all that Anna and the king do is talk without saying anything that really keeps our interest. They only talk about their lives and their differences. The happy ending couldn't save it much, since it was predictable because of its storyline. That's why I didn't find myself quite absorbed in it. Overall, I recommend this movie to people who enjoy seeing beautiful landscapes and outstanding performances; however I do not recommend it to people who want to see a fascinating story. 6/10</fullReview>

Above all, the movie touches on the important attributes that should be on the list of any leader of a group, a club, and especially a country. I think you'll find it serious, yet cute. The more modern production makes this film superior in its cinematography to the "King and I" of Yul Brynner fame.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie after years of enjoying the 1950s musical "The King and I". I have to say I was disappointed with this. Perhaps I would not have been so disappointed if I had never seen the original, or if I had seen this one first. Jodi Foster, though extremely talented, just doesn't click as Anna. She's too dainty, the accent is forced and she doesn't have the same effect as Deborah Kerr. Louis' character is downright annoying. His snide comments and hokey disposition just bugged after a while. Chow is better looking and plays the king quite well, but doesn't nearly have the "fear factor" of Yul Brynner. I do have to say the cinematography is breathtaking and the costumes are elaborate. I may be a sucker for the oldies, but I thought the dancing scene in the palace was an absolute classic and the sexual tension felt much less forced. If you've never seen the original but have seen this one, be prepared. The stories and ending are dramatically different. This one is worth viewing, but I think I'll buy the original.</fullReview>

The visuals were breathtaking, and I found myself missing Thailand dearly. The plot was less accurate and interesting than the visuals, but did hold that classic tale of heartwarming value to it.

		<fullReview>Kudos to the costumers, and to the scenic artists who recreated Bangkok's palaces in Malaysia. But shame, shame, shame on the writers and producers for spending so much money on a stupid fiction and wooden acting. The reason they had to work in Malaysia is one reason this movie fails: the story is so outlandishly false that even viewers not familiar with Thailand's unique history cannot willingly suspend their disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie. The Thai people have been for generations so enraged by the lies Anna told in her memoirs that the previous two films and the stage play cannot be produced or shown in the Kingdom, and they did not allow the producers of this most recent film to shoot a single frame in Thailand. But again, even if you don't know that the real Anna had been the mistress of a travelling preacher at the age of 14, had no teaching experience before she lied her way into the Royal household, and was the widow not of a heroic soldier but of a private who was cashiered out of the Army for drunkenness and ended up an innkeeper in Penang, would you really believe that this King who has dozens of wives, platoons of children, and a Kingdom to keep out of the hands of the greedy British, French, and Dutch empires is going to fall in love with an employee? He's got his choice of any woman in Southeast Asia, but he's gonna go all googly over a middle-aged white woman, an EMPLOYEE, with a kid and a burden of Christian hang-ups?. (She actually had two kids, but her books, the plays, and the movies have all ignored the daughter.) And then this king, who spent half his life as a Buddhist monk, is going to face down an entire army alone on horseback with a charoot clenched in his teeth like John Wayne in "Rio Bravo"? Come on. King Mongkut was an amazing man, head and shoulders above his European monarchical peers. All Western treatments of his life so far do him disservice. In an aside, someone should make a film about Louis Leonowens and King Chulalongkorn, the boy king who succeeded King Mongkut. They were friends throughout their lives; Louis became incredibly wealthy dealing in teak and ivory; had a harem of his own; and saved the Kingdom by putting down the Makkassar revolt, becoming the first Westerner to ever receive a military commission and medal from the hands of a Siamese king. And he was a second cousin to the actor Boris Karloff! (Anna and Karloff shared a common Indian grandmother. That's why Anna couldn't marry an officer in India, she wasn't considered "pure" English.) Good stuff there, Hollywood. You listening?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT FILM, WEAK SCREENPLAY...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, we have to admit that "Anna and the king" is a beautiful film. A splendid job has been made with the costumes, the sets, and the photography. With one word, the production designing is purely professional and inspiring. Luciana Arrighi, Caleb Deschanel, and Jenny Beavan have accomplished a difficult and challenging task, and the reward was the academy award nomination for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. The cast's performance was brilliant, with Jodie Foster and Bai Ling being fantastic. Bai Ling in particular, was simply PERFECT. But the questions begin when we look at other aspects of the film. "Anna and the king" is eye-catching, but is it actually what we call a "good" film? The taste that leaves in the end is kind of bitter, and that because it makes you feel as if you have just watched the best film of the year, though.without a script. Without the unfolding of a story. The screenplay is generally lacking emotions, feelings, sentiments. It gives the impression that it can't decide exactly what it wants to tell. And here comes the director's responsibility. Andy Tennant has made a great job overall, but he didn't manage to cover the screenplay's flaws. And that because he shaped the relationship between Anna and the king to fit in the political events, when it should be probably better to do the opposite. In the end, "Anna and the king" is a film that will be remembered for the photography, the costumes, the sets, and of course for Jodie Foster and Bai Ling, who brought some tears in our eyes with their performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had the director drunk another three or four cups of coffee every morning, this film would have been absolutely stunning. But as it is, he didn't, and the film turned out rather flat and ordinary. A shot at the Oscar, no doubt, but clearly far from the target.Jodie Foster handles the British accent fairly well, and Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as the monarch trying desperately to modernize his country. But it is not the acting that fails this film, it's the matter-of-factly filming, the tamed and disinterested use of the fantastic scenery that makes it so flat. The visual feast that Asian traditions offer are completely forgotten.And of course, the romance between the two must necessarily reach new levels of cheesiness and cheap shots at the handkerchief. In the last half hour, the dialogue becomes dumber and dumber by the minute, ending up in some really awful tournament of clichés: "before I met you I didn't even understand the concept of being with one woman". ARGGGHHHHH. Disgusting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a new fan of this movie, I am somewhat embarrassed that other fans who visit this site may read a message here written by a James West, from NY.He writes that the King was supposed to be portrayed as "semi-barbaric", ACTUALLY comparing this one to the MUCH older version. Apparently, he forgets that although there is more of an attempt nowadays to make a film politically correct, this would not alter a true story so much as the "barbaric" racism that ensued between the way Westerners and Asians felt about each other during the time the first version of Anna &amp; the King came out. Political correctness may try to conceal harsh realities, but racism throws these realities on a stove and cooks it into whatever forms it wants.He also mentioned that a romance would be unthinkable btw Anna and the King Monghut in those days. Really, hmm. A sexual escapade, yeah, I could understand how THAT were impossible. But one cannot choose who he or she FALLS IN LOVE with; it just happens. Though I wouldn't be surprised if the intensity of their love were a bit exaggerated in the movie. Such os what American films do all the time, as we all know.The first half of this flick, I thought, "Oh, man, this dialogue is SO lame", like with Anna's son and Monghut's son fighting over who was in charge of the land. Sorry, but an 8-year-old British kid who's been around many different cultures would know to respect them. Also,there is a desire here for the script to cover every little stigma that could possibly be attached to this story(slavery, nationalism, Indian vs. British racism, (of course) Siamese vs.Western racism, sexism, evolution vs. creationism, monogamy vs. polygamy(polygany)................you name it, tha' works. But Chow Yun-Fat makes it work. So does Foster.Then the flick got progressively better, and, by the end, I really DID feel the love the King had for Anna(at least the way Jodie Foster played Anna's part, anyway.) And definitely, vice versa. The dialogue was still really cheesy, but the acting, cinematography, and even the soundtrack will make up for it.The West guy from NY who wrote that post, at the end of it, says "What is Jodie Foster doing in this movie?" The answer is : to be inspired by playing with the #1 movie star in Asia.-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved to me why I should never listen to box office reports. Being a Jodie Foster fan I may be a little biased, but the cinematography alone will just take you in. A lot of money was put into this movie and you see it, from the clothes, set design and sweeping score. Jodie's on again off again British accent is hardly noticeable. Chow Yun Fat was probably the biggest surprise, having seen him in countless slow mo, kung fu action flicks (directed by the white doves man himself-John Woo)He has incredible presence onscreen, and captured the heart of a warrior king.You will walk away asking for a sequel, to this timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should have been good. The actors involved (particularly Jodie Foster) were top-notch, but the story was ruined by exaggerating the importance of Anna. Ultimately, she was just a teacher, yet we see her rescue the king and handle diplomatic situations in a manner that could never have happened. In the end, her ability to trick the rebel army with fireworks implies a European superiority of intelligence that is woeful, as though asians are all simple-minded and gullible, not to mention cowardly. Once again, Hollywood sacrifices realism and good taste just to make sure that their principle actor is the centre of the action at all times. That having been said, there is much to admire in the film. Just another case of a movie that was almost great.</fullReview>

And in the end, it was the Prince's 1st person monologue. I don't like it. I felt uncomfortable. It's the way of story telling is unnatural.Chow Yun-Fat's Thai is too slow.

		<fullReview>Anna and the King, as a love story and drama was really great. Costumes, places, music, everything was perfect, every little detail of the time was taken into consideration, for a couple of hours I felt myself as if I was there, in those times. But something didn't make sense, first of all, how can such a wise king not know how to use fork and knife while he can speak many languages and have knowledge of science, art, literature and so on? This was really meaningless and also any king can not be so defenseless, weak and incapable of protecting his family. But in spite of these details the movie was pretty good, performance of Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat was remarkable. It was worth sittig there for 140 minutes I've enjoyed so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as romance and political intrigue goes, I say this is a pretty good movie. Chow Yun Fat makes his, I daresay, best performance in an American movie. Jodie Foster has to put up with a British accent and really gets to me. Even if Chow has difficulty with Thai, I wouldn't notice it. Anyway, as I watch the movie, it of course must touch on some points raised in previous incarnations of this story such as slavery. I can't help but think what the characters think of the Civil War raging in the US. The story is based after all on 1862. We only get a letter from Abraham Lincoln, and that's it. Through it all, it's the romantic tension between Anna Leonowens and King Mongkut that's the heart of the story. The pace of the story is fine and I never got bored.The verdict: 4 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so effort ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So-so effort that features a surprisingly dull Jodie Foster as Anna Leonowens, the true-life Indian-born Englishwoman who journeyed to Siam in the late 19th century to teach "the modern world of science" to the many children of King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat). All the fascinating power-play dialogue in Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical version of 1956 ("The King and I") that so drove the film as a great character piece has been substituted here for politically-correct ease and charm between the two leads, leaving little room for challenge: what was most intriguing about watching Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner battle it out in the old version was seeing how two people who were so opposite could find the middle of the road. Here, Mongkut finds Anna delightful upon first meeting her and the flame just never ignites. Historical accuracy was definitely a goal in this version though, and it is achieved with incredible opulence and a fair measure of depth, though the flair director Andy Tennant showed in his previous venture (the Cinderella adventure "Ever After") for not taking himself too seriously is really lacking here. Bai Ling gives a strong performance as Tuptim (previously played by Rita Moreno), the King's newest of his many wives, who chooses the duty to her heart over her duty to her master and suffers greatly for it. The sets and costumes are worth a good look, though it's not on the whole a very memorable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer to that film, I liked it and wanted to see it, but I didn't expect that much - maybe not more than great imagery and great acting, cause I feared the story would be too much adapted to the needs of the "millenium"-audience.Gosh! Was I wrong!Well, of course that film shows excellent photography and marvellous performances (esp. by Foster and a surprisingly brilliant Chow Yun Fat), but there's so much more to it. The whole film is so nobel, so raised, even divine. Everything is so wise. And whenever I expected the filmmakers to give in to some kitsch-moments or some inappropriate action-sequence, they did not. Andy Tennent was wise enough, not to destroy his atmosphere by means of pleasing an audience that would rather see some action than some intelligent dialogue.And there was no kitsch, not one second of it.As a whole it's just brilliant, unforgettable. I guess, I could spend my whole life watching films like this. It was a cinematic experience that I haven't had felt for quite a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna and the King is a movie you can take your kids to, your mother too, and even Great Aunt Esther, who complains "They just don't make movies like they used to." This is a movie like they used to make, and there's more than a nod to The King and I, which Great Aunt Esther probably remembers pretty well. It's better than the old Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, though, and although it was filmed in Malaysia with a variety of Asian actors, it looks very Thai. Sumptuous, well-acted, occasionally moving, and perhaps just a little slow--maybe not the year's best picture, but certainly worth seeing. Oh, and whether to take the kids? It's a bit long, there are a few brief splashes of blood, and it deals with love that cannot be, but there are lots of kids in the cast who get a lot of screen time, and it's a timeless story of some cultural value. Don't take the littlies, but the 8+ years should enjoy going to this "grown up" movie with the rest of the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to admit that I would like to see this movie because I'm THAI and I would like to know why this movie was banned in Thailand. This movie was not historical movie, it's based on Mrs. Anna Leonowens's diaries so it could be added her emotion and imagination as a woman who had to live in another side of the world and totally different culture, isn't it ?I'm sure, everyone can enjoy it as a MOVIE, actually it is a very good movie which worth your money. Chow Yun-Fat was great, I like him more than Jodie Foster in this film. It was better choice for Hollywood to have an "Asian" actor to be our King Rama IV (King Mongkut). The scenery was extraordinary, both for the Malaysian rain-forest and particularly the recreation of "Wat Phra Kao or The Grand Palace". Anyone who had been to Bangkok and had seen The Grand Palace will agree with me. Even I knew that it look like The Grand Palace this time, not in the period of King Rama IV !!Another impressive point was about the Thai language, this "Anna and The King" had filmed in Malaysia with many Malaysian actors and actresses. In the beginning, it made me laugh when I heard their pronunciation but later I was really impressed by them !! Well done !!I would like to remind you that this "Anna and The King" is only a movie, nothing to do with the history of Thailand. I'm proud to be Thai, I'm proud in our cultures and of cause I'm proud in our long history. It's very difficult to link between Western and Eastern styles and to understand the different way of thinking. After I had seen this movie, I knew why it was banned in Thailand but if we see it as a Hollywood movie, it's a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sumptuous, well-acted, an elegant revision of the old romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third of three interpretations of Anna Leonowens´diaries and probably the best, although maybe because the other two now look slightly dated.The real discovery in this version is the King himself. Yun-Fat Chow is truly imperious in his portrayal of the King caught between the Scylla of compassion as an intelligent man and the Charybdis of authority as an absolute ruler. His rueful admission of Anna as an equal is masterfully worked and his tender submission to his own feelings of love towards her is movingly portrayed.Jodie Foster, sporting an English accent that she never feels utterly comfortable with, does an admirable job of the fiendishly difficult Anna. Stiff and Victorian yet progressive and, in spite of herself, sensitive. Her only drawback is with children. Her relationship with Louis, a solid performance from Tom Felton, is stilted and artificial. Whenever she has to work with children she uncomfortable and makes the viewer uneasy. Luckily the film does not hinge around this relationship but this occasional hiccup makes the film, and her performance especially, a little bumpy.The story itself is well told although the sub-plot involving the new concubine is maybe given a little too much relevance. Although it serves as the turning point in Anna´s relationship with the King, allowing him to show real compassion for the first time and peels back the glittering exterior of the regime for the viewer to see the cruelty underneath, I feel it could have more sharply portrayed, although the denouement could hardly have been more powerful. The romance between the King and Anna is well judged and intelligently paced. It never becomes overpowering and the chemistry between the two is plainly palpable.This relationship is, of course, the centre of the film and is beautifully played by both. It must be said that they are wonderfully supported by the wealth of Asian acting talent on show. Randall Duk Kim, especially, as General Alak and look out for the three bodyguards who maintain their "insclutability" almost until the end.The scenery is extraordinary and although there are too many close-ups for it to be truly called an epic, the photography is excellent. One long sweeping view of the royal steamboat on the river between banks of dense rain forest is pure African Queen meets Apocalypse Now! The remarkable colours and painstaking costumes are striking and even Bertolucci would be grudgingly admiring. They tint the film with a glittering, authentic hue which combined with the sumptuous sets makes the film the perfect setting for this fairytale romance.The film is well worth seeing if only for Yun-Fat (or is his surname Chow; I don´t know if the order of his names has been westernised) and the luxurious mantle with which the whole film is cloaked. For those of you who generally don´t like Foster (and there are quite a few of you) go and see it anyway. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a teenager in the 60s, I read Langdon's fictionalization of Anna Leonowens' life and saw Rex Harrison's "Anna and the King" before I ever saw the "King and I."I've always liked King Mongkut in all his reincarnations, including this one. However, no king with the brains to keep his country free of European imperialism would ever have gotten himself into the military fix portrayed in this latest version. The device used to resolve the situation was positively cartoonish. No wonder the government of Thailand wouldn't approve the script.Also, the song sung by the royal children, "Bicycle Built for Two" (originally "Daisy Bell") was written by Harry Dacre and first published in 1892, approximately 30 years after Anna's time in Siam. A Stephen Foster song would have been more in keeping with the time period.Although the newest version of Anna's story looks more authentic than past ones, it is no more accurate than "The King and I." Watch and enjoy "Anna and the King" for the beautiful fantasy that it is.</fullReview>

However, it was the children that caught my eye. The dozens of boys and girls who played the King's sons and daughters in the movie were just terrific. They all played their roles so convincingly and were a delight to see. Great job, kids! I doff my hat to the adults who cared for these kids during shooting whether on location or in a studio. I'm sure they had a mammoth job getting the kids to learn their lines, positioning them on the many sets, encouraging them to perform when required, costuming and dressing them, and helping them with rest room breaks, lunches, naps, playing and just being there for them. I see a few Oscars for this movie.</fullReview>

The original movie can't even hope to compare to this one.Magnificent sets and cinematography successfully create an authentic Siam in all of its beauty and splendor, but the real driving force behind the movie are Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster. These two big talents played their characters superbly, and between them sparked such intensity that unfortunately can never be fulfilled by the constraints of their time and cultures. It is so interesting to see that King Mongkut and Anna Leonowens have so much in common, being both stubborn and headstrong. This is precisely why they develop a quiet respect and attraction towards each other as the story unfolds itself.Undoubtedly, most women will absolutely love Anna and the King. It is a perfect date movie. Chow Yun-Fat is so charming and regal, and Jodie Foster shines with intelligence. The chemistry between these two performers are exquisite in a refrained way, and every passing moment of the movie will transport us to another world. Truly an amazing and beautiful movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film with a multi-faceted storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is unfortunate that it is getting billed as a romance, because it is so much more. I see 3 interwoven storylines: the building relationship between Anna and the King, the political struggle within SIam, and the development and struggles of the King to become a more progressive leader, a better father, and a better man. The cinematography is incredible, the costumes (especially Chow Yun Fat's) exquisite, and the chemistry between Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat very believable. It does move slowly at times, but should be viewed as a modern</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book, Anna and the King of Siam, back in 1967 when I was 13. I was disappointed by the old musical version of the movie. It glamorized and glossed over the true story and used Caucasians in disguise to portray Asians. The newest movie with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat restored my joy in this story. It employed a wealth of Asian acting talent. It told the brutal truth of what went on without trivializing it. The photography was beautiful. Chow Yun Fat skillfully portrayed a man of courage and compassion who wanted his country to progress in society, yet who understood the boundaries that required him to make changes slowly so as not to disillusion his citizens. Fat portrayed a man torn by the inner desire for change and the outer requirements imposed by society. He was masterful. This movie was really wonderful. Take your children to see it. Some parts are brutal, but it teaches history, geography, diversity and integrity--lessons every child needs to learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing "The King and I" cartoon, I was excited that the movie/non-musical version of the wonderful story was coming. After being in the play at my local theatre, the cartoon was a big disappointment to me. I hoped and prayed that the movie would be different. And it was. And I loved it. I haven't seen the original movie, so I can't compare. But I thought it was wonderful. The acting was magnificent - Chow Yun-Fat made the King of Siam a believable and likeable role. Jodie Foster was the stubborn yet kind schoolteacher. The children were great, of course - children usually are. The movie far out-shines the cartoon, and I hate to admit it, but the musical too. I will always love the musical, but the movie was definitely great. Great directing and cinematography. I give it a 10/10, and I think this movie has an Oscar in its future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, the film was beautifully made. It highlighted the grandeur of Thai aristocracy while quietly prying through the veneer of paradise that seems riddled with many contradictions.Jodie Foster (despite the accolades that many have heaped on her) usually does nothing for me as an actress but on this occasion she managed to display a gamut of feelings and gestures, that invoked some degree of sympathy for her character. Having seen Chow Yuen Fatt since his earliest days on TV, it is great to see that the man hasn't lost his touch. Here is a ruler and a man caught in between the need for change and the need to maintain stability. Not the most profound film ever made, nor is it likely that the film aims for authenticity but there's an underlying feeling that cultural conflicts often demonstrates less the differences among us but more of how human we all are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Nomination for Chow Yun-Fat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anna and the King" falls short of being the great epic romance it could have been, but I still found the movie to be very entertaining and ravishing to look at.The main reason to see this movie, though, is for Chow Yun-Fat's marvelous performance as the king. The movie screen is simply not big enough to contain the charisma and sheer star power that Chow radiates. He recalls the great stars of the 40s and 50s, yet has an existential edge that makes him ultra-cool and contemporary. Long-time Chow Yun-Fat fans will be relieved to see that Hollywood has finally given him a role that fully utilizes his immense talents, and that recognizes his versatility as an actor (he does drama and comedies as well as shoot-em-ups!). Chow Yun-Fat newbies who only know him from mediocre faire like "The Replacement Killers" will find his work in "Anna" revelatory. Go Chow Yun-Fat!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed but Sincere Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** WARNING: Spoilers possibly ahead. ***The lushly scenic, part historical, part fictional movie has been updated with a feminist bent, the essence of which is exemplified by Jodie Foster, who as the teacher to King Mongkut's (Chow Yun Fat) brood, wins over not only the folks around her, but also commands our respect and empathy. Chow's king is charmingly regal, though I (being Asian in Asia) would find hard to believe the extent of his bemused tolerance of Anna's behaviour, which would've seemed most impudent in 19th century Siam.Some have commented on the "lack of chemistry" between Foster and Chow, but fail to see the real emotional entanglements that sizzle beneath, instead of being thrown in our faces. In fact, their performances is one of classic understatedness, painting a story of friendship, trust and acceptance. Passionate love is not the main issue here (although the real Anna could've harboured a crush). I for one, am drawn to the intrigue between the two characters, who have come to learn that it's alright to take each other as they are, to leave behind old prejudices and as a result, achieve character growth. Determined not to show her fear of the unknowns in Siamese customs and puzzles, proud Anna will eventually realize that England's ways are not always best imposed on the rest of the world, while King Mongkut is wise enough to know how to just let the Englishwoman speak her mind, and yet still realize the need to reach out a reassuring hand when Anna falters. (" I am the king and I will lead.")Similarly, the initial arrogance of Prince Chulalongkorn (Keith Chin) gives way to a new respect for his father, and a hand of friendship to Anna &amp; her son Louis (Tom Felton). Both characters are played with much humour by the Chin and Felton, whose antics are supplemented by the heart-warming performance of Melissa Campbell who injected spark into the role of a playful Princess Fa-Ying.The ill-fated concubine Tuptim (Bai Ling) grows from a weepy reluctant bride to a resolute figure facing her own execution. Her volunteering for English lessons is not an attempt to "please the king" but to satisfy herself, besides reaching out for someone who might be able to see things from her point of view. Bai Ling gives her role an endearing mix of shy naivete and girlish flirtatiousness, and though she was sometimes a little too melodramatic in her portrayal as the adulterous lover, such a tone eventually serves to contrast her stoic stance of self-faith in the end. It nicely mirrors the biting restraint of Foster who brilliantly displayed the helplessness and seething injustice surely felt by Anna whose own faith in rights and wrongs is sorely tested. Far from being a pointless subplot, the extended Tuptim role succeeds in bringing out the inevitabilty of the human condition: when confronted by a very human dilemma and a moral ambiguity, what is Anna to do in the face of the certain death of a friend she has come to respect and love, a runaway adulterer she knows her broken bible cannot save... but only able to shut her eyes eventually against the despair?On the other hand, the fictitious uprising plot is flawed. It may highlight the chaotic political climate under the threat of foreign colonization, but the events that ensue are highly predictable (and oddly unbelievable even as a story), and thus intellectually unsatisfying. Is this the film-maker's way of obtaining a safer closure, so that whatever fatal disagreements that have arisen between the two protagonists as a result of the Tuptim debacle, can be more easily swept under the carpet, for the sake for nationalistic preservation ? This sense of artistic betrayal is further exacerbated by the unexpected fluff of the Top 40 tune that accompanies the closing credits to what should be a Siamese epic. Anna and the King, who have challenged and sometimes clashed with each other in an non-typical relationship, should not have to suffer the indignity of such a unchallenging conclusion.Otherwise, this rendition of the the Englishwoman versus the Siamese monarch story is worth the ticket price. In fact, I found myself looking at my watch when the lights came on, not quite believing that it had ended so soon. However, the movie is altogether a good enough experience, valiant Thai lines, wandering British accent and all.It's a pity that this movie is deemed sufficiently offensive to be banned in Thailand. Perhaps, director Andy Tennant should have included in a footnote that "Mrs Leonowens, besides going on to later be an early upholder of feminist activism in the prim Victorian era, was also a chronicler of probably overblown imagination." And that despite having old Siam lay prostrate before him, King Mongkut was no less a human being who had loved and guided his beloved country through tumultuous times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly romanticized version of a romantic legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem I have with this movie is that it is presented as a factual representation based on the "true" memoirs of Anna Leonowens. The truth is that her books were largely fabricated and her own role in Siamese politics ridiculously enhanced. You will read that this movie is banned in Thailand, which is true....as ALL versions of this story are banned in Thailand as "politically incorrect" Western culture ethno-centricity. However, if you take the story as a legend (which is what it really is) it makes a fairly interesting movie that is visually quite interesting. If you like "exotic location" films, you will probably enjoy this one......just don't go home thinking you know anything at all about the history of Thailand. I rate this a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When talks about a remake of " the King and I" surfaced about a year ago , I was not a bit interested in the movie. After all, the story of an English teacher teaching English in the royal court of Siam and then fell into love with the King is kind of bizarre not to mention it sounded like a typical Hollywood stereotyping romantic story. However I changed my mind when Anna and the King comes out;in fact I went to see the movie on the opening nite.The result of the experience is somewhat mixed; it was sort of entertaining in some minor way, mostly generated by the young royal children and Louis, the son of Anna the English teacher. The costumes and settings are breath-takingly realistic-at least it appealed to me. I also like the Chemistry between Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat; Their acting and physical appearances together make the impossible love tension seems more believable. Besides, Foster the intelligent, strong-minded actress is a prefect candidate play Anna, the equally head-strong character.I also like the approach of this version of Anna and the King of Siam; I would think such material is best to be made as a dramatic movie (epic or no epic). The perspective of the movie is neither from the king nor Anna, which gives the movie a more refreshing horizon. I also like the details of the movie- for example I like the fact that the Thai officials and the King spoke in Thai instead of English, giving the movie a more realistic feel.However, having said all these wonderful things why I like the movie, I must say that the movie fell flat somewhat in the end, and that's the reason why I think this movie is not a prefect 10First of all, the beginning of the movie does have the appeal and the feel of an epic movie; however it is not being maintained by the end of the movie, which makes me wonder if only ....Second, though the movie claimed to be closer to the fact of the true story between Anna and the King, it is still a distance away from the truth historical facts. Therefore I was somewhat disturbed by the end note which appears at the end of the movie. Because the Anna and the King story is more legendary then a accurate historical account,so I would prefer to see the movie to tell a legendary story instead of adding these maybe-or may not be correct footnotes. Overall, I like the movie, the dramatic approach works better than a musical approach in my humble opinions. I just think this movie have the potential to be so much greater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Anna and the King" is an OK movie. Well scripted, mostly well acted (especially by the very dignified Chow Yun Fat) and boasting good production values.It's just that I have to disagree with most comments here that the cinematography was great. Personally, I think it was the worst part of the movie. Why does Andy Tennant insist on framing 80 percent of the action in close-ups, and with long lenses to boot, completely blurring the backgrounds and foregrounds? This is supposed to be an epic -- remember epics? Wide screen, wide vistas, big scenery, big crowds, big costumes? This production went all the way to Malaysia to film a big -- make that "enormous" -- movie, built what's allegedly a set bigger than the Roman set constructed for "Cleopatra", and we hardly get to see any of it at all. Why!?! It's almost as if Tennant was afraid to get away from faces. Couldn't he have watched a couple of classic epics (Lean, DeMille, Wyler, you know the type) before he shot this and copy what made them epic? For my money, this movie feels smaller than either of its predecessors, but it's OK (not great) nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna and the King- a new version of a familiar story, provided me with nothing really new, except a rather silly action/adventure episode that felt completely tacked on. Chow Yun Fat is rather good as the king. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, looked and sounded stressed out and rather haggard as Anna. Perhaps this was her (or the director's) idea of a "repressed English matron" but it did not work. There is also little chemistry between her and Fat. Lately, I have noticed that Ms. Foster seems rung out, colorless and rather miserable in her films- "Nell" and "Contact" come to mind. Overall, I felt the film is average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Anna and the King' By Dean Kish The historical story of a British school teacher and her relationship with the King of Siam. Jodie Foster stars as Anna Leonowens, a widowed British school teacher who has come to Siam to teach the heir apparent. When she arrives with her young son in tow, Anna finds out that she must teach the whole royal family including one of King's concubines. The King of Siam (Chow Yun Fat) is shocked, bewildered and curious about the strength and vigor of this strong woman. Through her teaching and her proper British upbringing, Anna brings change to Siam and its people even when they are on the brink of a war they can not possibly win. Anna and the King is another visually stunning historical epic that tries to flesh out the real characters who so many have seen burst into song. Brought to life by looking deep into the real Anna Leonowens' diary and memoirs, the film tries desperately to tell a story none of us have heard. My biggest problem with Anna and the King is that it never really delivers any new thrilling revelations. Sure the story is a great one and the film is beautifully shot but why couldn't they have made these characters with more edge. The subplot involving the rebellious concubine and her lover could have easily been lost in edits. What I loved about the film was Chow Yun Fat. He finally seems to be getting the proper respect from Hollywood. This is a great step forward in his development as a Hollywood star. I hope Hollywood does give him better parts after this. Director Andy Tennant's lush backdrops and intricate camera scope made the film feel like an epic. This film is beautiful to look at but the majestic feel and epic scope really did need a real telling of this story. As for Jodie Foster, she seemed a little bored in her proper British form. Wow, did she need a deeper juicier Anna. I hope if they do decide to go back to Anna's diaries once again maybe they could tell the film in first perspective and really tell about what went on between these two figures. Every historical figure has his flaw or obsession and these characters never really entertained reality. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Leading Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna And The King is the fourth film version of the story told by novelist Margaret Landon about a British woman called Anna Leonowens who traveled to Siam (today's Thailand) in 1862 to tutor King of Siam's children. The most famous was the musical in 1956 which starred Yul Brenner as King Mongkut to Deborah Kerr's Anna. This version is romantic but non singing, although there is a little dancing; one or two graceful glides around the dance floor. Its greatest charm is derived from the lead actors played by Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster. Unfortunately Anna And The King often loses pace and therefore seems to be way overlong at 140 minutes. But there is still much to recommend. Anna And The King's main preoccupation is the developing relationship between the autocratic, Asian king and the fairly haughty, very English teacher. She's getting over the death of her husband. He has to deal with a woman who demands to be treated almost as an equal. He's also having problems with the British colonialists who are threatening to invade his country. Most of this is fairly engaging. In the first half of the film we're treated to a surprisingly subtle but perceptive series of comments about the nature of imperialism and the uneasy status of a kingdom. In addition the King has 26 wives and 58 children. That's a reasonable amount of culture shock for Anna and her ten year old son played by Tom Felton to deal with and again this is handled pretty intelligently. There's also unfortunately what amounts to a rather silly subplot to do with a traitor and an insurrection which culminates in a particularly ridiculous battle.But the standout performances from Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster, along with the beautiful settings and costumes, make Anna And The King good viewing for the more traditionalist amongst you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With your first impression, this movie seems to have some solid footing on which to base itself. I guess I liked it, overall, but let's dissect it a bit. There's the old story which most of us think we know, until you read the excellent comments by other well informed IMDB users, notably William Murphy's. Apparently this film was rather inaccurate historically, with lots of confusion between what happened, to whom, and when. If you are aware of the truth, then maybe this movie will disappoint you.The costumes must have been accurate, nobody seems to have a problem with them but how about the location? It's all filmed in Malaysia presumably because Thailand is still smarting over some past portrayals and some aspects of this new version. I guess they haven't progressed politically as far as the movie suggests.The acting is more than adequate but something bothered me. While her accent was pretty believable Jodie Foster seemed to display one of two or three expressions at all times. The same applies to Mr. Chow. What I found bothersome was that, in a movie with really only two principal players, nearly every scene of this not short movie had either Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat, or Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat, and their chosen expression.Two last items: Sometimes in life, things blow up. Pipelines burst, fuel tanks are breached, airliners run into mountains. Wouldn't you think that, in a movie before airplanes, automobiles, and home delivery of natural gas, we could see a movie without a huge explosion? Apparently not.Next to finally, after setting the story in the mid-1800's and leaving the viewer with that sense, why tack on a "theme song" so inappropriate? It really was a terrible song, too, common and pointless, and straight out the late 1980's in style.Finally, is it my imagination or was the movie's title never seen on screen during the credits? </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's wonderful to see a remake of the King and I story without the old stereotypes. Chow Yun Fat is majestic and Jodie Foster is radiant as usual. For once one can see real characters with emotion in this classic love story which in its past incarnations have perpetuated caricatures of the Asian emperor version after version. There's a quietly moving genuine quality to the story that does not resort to over the top theatrics. The beautiful cinematography and lavish production celebrates the landscape and times of the story, even though it wasn't made in Thailand. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chow and Foster are awesome together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to see this movie, I have heard so many mixed reviews about this movie. Some people think Foster was too stiff in this movie and is wrong for the role. On the contrary, I think Foster's subtle performance is good enough. The king, played by Chow Yun-Fat, is just handsome and convincing. It is one important milestone for Chow in Hollywood. He portrayed a intelligent, determined king, unlike the previous versions.The visual satisfaction of this movie is just marvelous. You would have to love what you see. Without the annoying singing, you could actually sit down and enjoy the peaceful pace in the 19th century Siam. It is a great holiday family movie. Although the climax in this movie is not as strong as I expected, it is a movie full of other good qualities. So go to the theatres near you and experience the exotic taste you have always dream of.(Here is some hints, pay attention to the humble chemistry between Chow and Foster, the conflict between love and duty of Tuptim(Bai Ling), and the fight and struggle in the king's heart.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one's on my DVD list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen End of Days and just about a dozen other action flicks in the past few months, boy, was this a refreshing change. Anna and the King is a vividly rich and enchanting movie, with stellar performances by both Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster. The set was incredibly elaborate, much to my amazement, and it truly transported us the audience to back to the 19th century.Jodie Foster was absolutely fantastic as Anna, and I'll just stop short at that 'cause there must be dozens of other articles already out there that praises the pure genius of her acting.Chow Yun-Fat too provides a very believable King Mongkut, putting in his most emotional performance for Hollywood by far. As King Mongkut, he was strong-headed, wise, and at the same time exuding a subtle sense of humility that at first could not be picked up but became more noticeable with time. (Perhaps tht was why they made the movie this long, eh?) Chow is definitely an actor to stay, and Hollywood had better be ready to cash out on this Asian mega-star.The story was wonderfully told; the pace sent to a turtleneck so that the audience would slowly be drawn towards the film, to feel that they are part of the experience. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat show amazing chemistry, again built up slowly during the 2.5 hours. I'm saving up right now, 'cause when the movie goes retail, it's going to the top of my DVD list as well. And thank the stars for DVD, cause without it, the beauty of Anna and the King might be lost in the format of yester-years.</fullReview>

The only problem with this movie is that it takes sooooo long for something to happen in it. If it was more tightly edited and about 20 minutes shorter it would be an instant classic.

		<shortDescription>A true Rupert Murdoch production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anna and the King" is a Twentieth Century Fox film. The owner of Fox, Rupert Murdoch, also owns some of the vilest British tabloids and is the guy whose "quality" British weekly, the Sunday Times, bought and published Adolf Hitler's diaries. This was before a spoilsport expert proved that the paper on which they were written was made well after the Fuhrer's unlamented death. "Anna and the King" similarly follows the slogan of the British press: "Never let the facts get in the way of a good story".It would be tiresome to nitpick on all the hilarious blunders in the script. My favourites were the Crown Prince's objection to being taught by an "Imperialist teacher" (Right on, Comrade Prince!) and the King's children singing (in the 1860s) the song "Daisy, Daisy" which was not composed until 1892. The interesting story about the culture clash between the very proper English teacher and the reformist-minded King is intermingled with a tiresome and totally unconvincing plot by a chauvinist Minister who wants to get rid of foreign influences in Siam. It culminates in a traditional Hollywood showdown between goodies and baddies, complete with Indiana Jones-style explosions and bridge demolitions. The scriptwriter understandably had no confidence in his ability to write a convincing and enthralling historical drama, even though the raw material could hardly have been better. He just HAD to throw in a ridiculous action climax.Of course, no politically correct version of Anna and The King could be complete without a few crass caricatures and stereotypes - in this case the crusty, if decent, British Ambassador and a ludicrous, coarse, red-faced vulgarian merchant from the East India Company who nearly destroys a diplomatically delicate dinner.Still, as long as the film sticks to the basic culture clash theme it remains very watchable. Jodie Foster delivers a subtle and thoughtful performance with a perfect British accent (I am British, by the way) and Chow Yun-Fat is mercifully free of Yul Brynner's mannerisms in the musical version. Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is as magnificent as ever, the Malaysian scenery is wonderful and the costume and set design are top notch. Yet another case of "great story, shame about the script". Overall, 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vivid performance by Chow Yun Fat without pistols, and opulent visuals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna and the King: Considered a living god by his people, King Mongkut (Chow Yun Fat), the regent of Siam, finds himself at the crossroads of history - he must find a way to preserve his country's culture and history, embrace the ways of those that threaten him (know your enemy) and avoid being colonized like his contemporaries all the while fend off treachery from within. To prepare for the inevitable changes, he hires Anna Leonowens (Jodi Foster) a newly widowed English woman, to tutor his children (all 58 ) in the ways of the West. Their relationship would eventually change a king and save a country.It seemed fitting that I was seated behind the Thai Consul at the film premiere and at the same time somewhat ironic: although we were watching a movie about Thailand's most famous monarch it was filmed entirely in Malaysia. The Thai were so embittered by the portrayal of Mongkut as an unmannered buffoon in "The King and I" that even after four rewrites of "Anna and the King" the Thai film board refused to allow it to be filmed in Thailand. Some people have questioned whether or not this film should have been made at all: with stage, screen, animated and print versions, what more could be added? Well for starters, how about historical accuracy, sweeping vistas, lush cinematography, fantastic costumes, and Oscar caliber performances.Jodie Foster's Anna is headstrong, sensitive, intelligent, and witty, an apt foil for the head of an Asian Dynasty. An English colleague of mine felt her accent was too homogenous and should have had more of an edge, but it is more than adequate for the average moviegoer. It is Chow Yun Fat however that will keep you riveted to the screen. Chow, known for his adrenaline pumping performances in "Hardboiled" and "The Killer", must rely on words -not guns - to get his message across and he exceeded even my most optimistic expectations. His portrayal is regal, dignified, and dynamic and he infuses the king with wisdom, humility, and humanity. This is without a doubt the most realistic portrayal of Mongkut and hopefully will rectify the injustices of past portrayals.</fullReview>

The cinematography is superb, with great detail in the scenery (especially the palace) and the period costumes. I am sure this movie will be a definite Oscar contender, especially for these categories.It is a long movie, but I feel this amount of development was necessary to really get to know the characters. There are plenty of emotional high points and humor (particularly witty dialogue) interspersed. You can really get caught up in the story and characters (many of the minor characters are very well written and acted also). A pity the children did not feature more, as they provided either directly or indirectly much of the humor.All in all, a must-see if you can sit through long movies.</fullReview>

There are several high emotion scenes that make you feel like you are a part of what is happening to the characters. I now want to learn more about Anna and King Mongkut.Although I haven't seen every movie this year, I would have to say that Anna and the King would be the favorite for Costume Design and Artistic Direction Oscars. I would also bet on Jodie Foster being nominated for Best Actress, and the Film for Best Director and Best Picture. May not win all of these, but I would bet on nominations.In short, I really love this movie!</fullReview>

If they insisted on casting an oriental actor as the King why cast an obvious american as Anna and not a British actress. Foster's accent is poor and her performance not very 19th century.Always over rated,her flaws are so apparent in this film.

High Hollywood production values and good performances by both Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster, as well as a bunch of cute kids and an inherently interesting story give this a shot for several Oscar nominations.Jodie Foster is great as the English teacher bringing modern thought into 19th century Siam, and Chow Yun-Fat does well as the cunning and thoughtful King. There's no singing, but there is some dancing, and there are some pretty cool special effects. The story is well told, and the only thing that kept this film from being an absolute winner for me was that the chemistry between Foster and Chow just wasn't quite enough. Still, definitely worth seeing. Chow Yun-Fat with a huge hat, riding an elephant and smoking cigars. Sweet.</fullReview>

After an entertaining bout with the king's son and Anna's son, they children seem only token to plot points. They are simply rarely used. Jodie Foster seemed too earnest with her constant criticisms that her relationship rarely seemed convincing. The King was simply too tolerant of her obstinate intrusions. Thus any true chemistry dissipates before it has begun. Since this is where the focus of drama is centered, the film tends to feel long and uneventful. When the eventful parts do come, they are refreshing and sensitively portrayed though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna and the KingSet in the world of courtly Siam in the mid nineteenth century. Anna is cleverly played by Jodie Foster with an almost perfect accent Jodie is the model of an intelligent educated Victorian lady. On the other hand Chow Yun Fat speaks like Yul Brynner but knows how to use proper timing for comic or emotional effect. The cinematography is fantastic, along with the lush costumes, and exotic locations. However its too perfect. The English complain about the heat but fail to sweat. (Which Helps) The reality of Bangkok and royal life is discussed but never shown in any detail. The film fails to capture a sense of time or place in a way 1492: Conquest of Paradise, The Mission, Passage to India, or Gandhi does. Anna and the King feels like a ride at DisneyWorld, a stylized vision of the past when the reality would be more interesting. Besides the look, the romance between Anna and King Mongkut falls flat and has all the appeal of Mulder &amp; Scully but only worse. In addition the love angle isn't supported in Ana Leonowens book about her experiences. The performances of the children in Anna and the King are first rate, and the political intrigue is interesting but predictable. With several executions and a point blank assassination Anna and the King is not a family film. The ending is contrived and will probably disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a powerful story of a country caught up in the turmoil of coming to grips with a new way of life, and a man and woman from two different worlds caught up a love that can never be.Jody Foster turned in another powerful performance as Mrs. Anna Leonowen. Typical of her roles, Mrs. Leonowen was a woman with a strong will and a mind of her own. She spoke what was on her mind and was willing to accept the outcome. But she also has a strong desire to help others mature to accept a new role in the world around them.Yun-Fat Chow proved that he is very capable of turning in a role that goes beyond the martial arts roles he has had in the past. I was very impressed with his interpretation of King Mongkat and his interaction with Mrs. Leonowen. Mongkat knows that if his country is to avoid foreign entanglements that could lead to the colonial enslavement like neighboring countries he must lead Siam through the maze of changing its centuries-old traditions. He knows that he must put Siam on the road to "modern civilization" and that he must prepare his son to be able to complete the journey.I thought the movie was well directed and filmed and the performances by all the actors involved were of the highest level. This film is sure to garner many Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Actress, writing, directing, cinematography, and probably Best Supporting Actress. This is definitely a must see movie.</fullReview>

I was very familiar with the story beforehand, having read the book by Margaret Landon, and the novelization of the movie. But nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. Visually, is was a marvel, a true work of art. The sets were magnificent. Everything had its own individual beauty, that, when combined with the breathtaking cinematography of the land, created a visual blow to the senses. I have never seen Malaysia look so wonderful. But, even more remarkable that the visuals, were the subtle yet explosive performances by Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster. The chemistry between these two stars was present from the moment you see them on screen. I have admired both these actors for some time, but never have I seen them this powerful. Maybe, people in North America will finally see Chow as the amazingly versatile man that he is.This film masterfully weaves together action, drama, romance, and a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud humour.

		<fullReview>This movie was a good, entertaining one, but not the epic, breath-taking one the director intended it to be. The best moments are provided by the nuanced acting of Chow Yun-fat and solid efforts of Jodie Foster.The movie is for the most part culturally accurate. However, historically, the movie strays from what most historians agree to the facts--which is not necessarily a bad thing for a movie, but which was not stressed enough either in the movie or in its publicity. The character of Anna lacks true depth and development at times; she is perhaps anachronistically depicted too much as a liberated 20th century woman. On the other hand, the king's role is much more rounded. It is refreshing to see a depiction of an Asian man that breaks through the stereotypes of weak and brainy.In addition, the diversity amongst the extras and the lush scenery make this movie a treat for the eyes. Strong supporting acting also gives good weight to the film.</fullReview>

I wasn't sure what to expect, I only knew that Jodi Foster does not normally disappoint. Once again, she did not. Her performance was absolutely stellar. Chow Yun-Fat was also incredible in his first real acting role. The story, put simply, is that of an English woman who comes to Siam to teach the King's 50+ children. She also brings along many of her British customs, which are just short of blasphemy to the Siamese court. The whole film is an extraordinary look at 2 cultures colliding and mending to completely change the lives of Anna, the King, his children, and ultimately an entire nation.As I mentioned before, the acting is beautiful. The direction and the choreography are both incredible. The film is not just an entertainment piece. It is what film should be, a true work of art. A story put together and told so well that you forget yourself in the characters and interaction on screen. All in all, one of the best films of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to approach this film without thinking of "The King and I", but the beauty of the film and the power of the story soon sweeps away thoughts of the musical. A spectacular setting and strong performances by Jodie Foster (of course) and Chow Yun-Fat. The story drags a bit at times, making it a little longer than box-office audiences may tolerate. But stay to the end, and be rewarded with a fine film experience. Certainly Oscar-worthy material!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chow Yun Fat definitely found his niche as a romantic lead in "Anna and the King." Apparently he has made many romantic movies in China --you definitely got the feeling that he has done this before! There is a world of experience in his charm.Personally, I have never before seen a movie in which I wanted to make love to the star so badly as I wanted Chow Yun Fat in this movie! He is the perfect man, from his wise, merry eyes to his exquisite, classically chiseled face, to his warm, intoxicating smile. What woman could resist him? The man was born to be a romantic lead -- why was he wasted on so many silly Hollywood action films? He is absolutely flawless.As the saying goes, I wouldn't throw him out of bed for eating crackers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT MOVIE WITH STRONG CHEMISTRY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It is one of my favorites. The costumes are fantastic and the scenery is lovely. It is apparent the director went to great lengths to instill a feeling of being in 19th century Siam (now Thailand) and succeeded. This movie is more dramatic than "The King and I." However, there is more chemistry between the King and Anna in this adaptation. Chow Yun Fat, who is highly underrated as an actor, remarkably portrays the King and Jodie Foster matches him perfectly as Anna.While the close friendship in the movie may not have happened in real life, it is a wonderful adaptation which allows the viewer to fantasize that perhaps it did. I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, banal delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often difficult to swallow the "romanticization" of a good story. Anna Leonowens was a rather narrow-minded woman who, nevertheless, had the gumption to do something interesting with her life -- largely because she needed the money. She went to Siam, taught the King's many children, and eventually departed. She wrote a journal with silly insights into a profoundly serious and sophisticated culture. It is unlikely she exchanged more than two words with the King during her stay. He was, after all, a busy man, and she was basically the help -- even if she was somewhat out of the ordinary.In pitching the film, Anna star Jodie Foster said that this story would be the most truthful to Leonowens' experience (unlike the adored, but totally manufactured, musical). However, the truth is often incompatible with the market and with an A-list actor's ego. Foster's insistence on playing heroines who always do the right thing is becoming rather tedious. She is tightly coiled in the film, musters a rather bad British accent, and, is really quite irritating. You want to slap her, or at least get the King to loosen her up with his lauded lover's technique. Perhaps Foster is trying to balance myth and reality; in that case, her schizophrenic performance merits some critical notice.The true stars are the Asians -- Chow Yun Fat shows you can take a Hollywood confection and make something of it; the same can be said of the hauntingly beautiful ladies who portray Lady Thiang (Deanna Yusoff) and Tuptim (Ling Bai). And the art direction and costumes certainly deserve the kudos that came their way. Of course, it would have been too much to stick with the real story. There's nothing like a platonic inter-racial, cross-cultural, going-nowhere-but-the-stars romance to liven things up. The problem is Foster is not really good with men, and the plot is further convoluted by politics with Burma -- an issue on which Anna, of course, has enlightened opinions that she shares with the King and the British representatives (as if they would have cared).Such a lovely premise, such banal delivery. One day, someone may get this story right. Perhaps the Thai film industry could take a crack at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An almost unendurable film, despite magnificent cinematography, opulent costumes and good intentions. A silly screen play, closer in plot to The Sound of Music than The King and I, complete with a parade of escaping little children. Chow is compelling and charismatic in the leading role, but Jodie Foster, and otherwise capable actress, is sterile and tedious in her portrayal of the adventurous English schoolmistress. Chow's charm was lost in playing opposite Foster, because there was simply no screen chemistry in evidence. Nods to political correctness and geopolitical realpolitik are laughable in the context of this film. It goes to show that movie producers would do better to spend less time raising the tens of millions of dollars necessary to hoist this tonnage, and instead, hire a talented screenwriter possessed of imagination and some psychological nuance. More than a disappointment; it was Thai torture to stay with this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Near Tragic Film-making Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can easily poke fun at Anna and The King simply because it is not a good, or even close to resembling, an average movie. First, the script is patchy and weak at best. There was some talk about 'contemporizing' this over-familiar story to fit our own 'times'. We must remember that Anna was a Victorian lady with Victorian values. This was part of her charm (if one can describe it thus) - her arrogance, her misplaced belief in her own superiority, the 'uncommon richness' of the British (more specifically, English)way of life, so on and so forth. So attempts at 'contemporizing' Anna would perhaps be ludicrous. There are cultural aspects of her which are outdated and should remain thus - as part of long-ago history. We can now laugh at their idiosyncracies and forget about them soon afterward. And speaking of cultural singularities, what is desperately missing from the film is that unique pageantry atmosphere of this Southeast Asian monarchy and a closer study of Siamese customs. The filmmakers would have profited greatly by looking at the richness of 'The Last Emperor' or even from the splendour of 'Indochine'. The sense of epic-ness in Anna and The King is like tough dough that does not rise to the ocassion.The 'love story' between Anna and The King was over-played; too many close-ups altogether. Ms Foster does not seem able to express deep feelings like sorrow, despair, passion so on and so forth on screen - such emotions are displayed with detachment, almost to the point of inconvenience, while her accent was rigid. She seemed to mumble her way through three-quarters of the film. It was infuriating trying to keep up with her 'speech-es!'. Chow's King, on the other hand, was fairly commendable but not enough of a commanding and majestic figure. Why the over-emphasis on his humanity, his love for his children, his people,his vision to modernize his nation so on and so forth? And as for his wives...well, they need hardly be there at all - we see them and that's all we do, just see them on parade like tired peacocks in a garden.The set looked like sets, the costumes bland, the cinematography dull, and most of all - the absence of compelling and visionary direction. Andy Tenant failed. Two-and-a-half hours of plodding meanderings. If anything, the two subplots - Tuptim's trial and the 'military coup' - could have been explored (&amp; clarified) further, adding to an otherwise soddenly damp tale.</fullReview>

There are many emotional moments in the film and although long, I found the film entertaining..The scenery and sets are magnificent but, what drew me to this film was the acting talent..particularly Jodie and Chow Yun Fat. Chow Yun Fat displays a remarkable sense of opulence in his role and his interpretation of the King of Siam is quite interesting! I read somewhere that the film was a disappointment at the box office but considering the direction mainstream film is heading these days I truly wonder what the demographics of film going audiences are..I, personally like a good story with actors who truly care about their craft and I found this to be the case in Anna and the King..</fullReview>

Although I found this version of the oft-told tale more palpable than the musical "The King And I"--which was so stagy and heavy it weighed like a pound cake soaking wet--I still cannot fathom how this came to be such a beloved story. It has a musty, old-fashioned theme, constructed here like a connect-the-dots book. Jodie Foster (far less flexible than she's capable of being) is uncomfortable using a British accent, and her romantic rapport with Chow Yun Fat is mild, to be charitable (they'd make great buddies). Events in the film can practically be checked off a list; and when violence erupts near the finale, it's neither gripping nor exciting, just painfully slack. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Anna And The King on its Australian release in 1999 and thinking what a wonderful, sumptuous, if at times tragic romantic drama it all was. SPOILER ALERT Certain images remain in the mind long after the film is viewed such as the bathing scene where we see much of Ms Fosters legs or the execution of Tuptim or the bridge being detonated.The performances of Main and Supporting cast are superb; Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat work well together.SPOILER ALERT The dialog allows for some ironic political correctness about the nature of imperialism which mark this as a liberal and not conservative film in the Raj tradition of the Rank films.On release the 2.30min length passed quickly enough but now in the light of even most period costume drama such as Sofia Coppala's Marie Antionette or the British Film The Duchess, Andy Tennants pacing seems slow and not as wonderfully paced as his delightful Drew Barrymore period Comedy Ever After. On release I would have given this a nine. Now as it has dated a little I feel it merits only 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andy Tennant, known for his comedy film, springs a pleasant surprised with the spectacular 'Anna and the King'. This dazzling film is absolutely mesmerizing, right from the art direction, music to cinematography and visuals. I wouldn't have expected Andy Tennant to be the first choice in directing this film but he's done an exceptional job here.Though the film was shot in Malaysia, Tennant and his art directors have captured the essence and beauty of the idea of what Siam might have been like in the 1860s. While the lavish sets and costumes are very detailed, there's plenty of subtlety. I also liked how the humour was infused into the situations. It's never over the top.The story flows fluidly. Much of it is based on Anna Leonoens's journal. Tennant tries to stay as true to history as possible. In addition the dialogues are well written and the key characters are properly fleshed out. The significance of honour, obligation and duty conflicting with justice and equality is also well depicted.Chow Yun Fat is brilliant as King Mongkut. His understated performance contrasts well with Jodie Foster's outspoken and headstrong Anna. Obviously, Foster knows her craft too well as she turns in yet another splendid performance. Her English accent is a little awkward at time but this can be easily overlooked. Bai Ling holds her own with a heartbreaking performance as the doomed Tuptim. The rest of the cast do well.I haven't watched 'The King and I' on which this movie is said to be based but I have heard from others that they're two different things and that 'Anna and The King' is a spectacular epic in its own right. I agree with the last part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey folks, remember when Chow Yun-Fat was going to be the next big crossover actor to make it big in the U.S. after making it big in foreign movies? Well, after his less then spectacular Replacement Killers, Anna and the King, and Bulletproof Monk, he was sent packing back to Asia. Jury is still out on whether he can make it big here; he needs the right script and circumstances (my instincts say yes). Here, in 'Anna and The King', a perfectly needless remake of a classic tale if there ever was one (The King And I was of course, the definitive version). But, here we have Fat and Jodie Foster (in the Owens part) trying to put a 90's spin on the story. Here, there is a more of a feminist bend to the movie then previous versions, and that makes Fat more befuddled. It is sure a nice movie to look at, and all the cast (especially the kids!) do a good job. But as the old saying goes, if it ain't broke, why fix it?</fullReview>

The best part about this movie is that they don't have that gay singing like the 1956 musical the "The King &amp; I" with Yul Byranner. In this adoption of Anna &amp; the King, Tuptim really does get her spanking. The goof is why the hell would anyone want to spank a grown women in her 20s, 30s or 40s in public. Isn't that juvenile and wrong. This movie was actually also banned from the country Thailand because it would seem more like a parody made up about how the past king of Siam, the former name of Thailand, is really a mean tyrant. Although this is a very good historical drama and a movie with a little AZN pride in it. This is one of the more dramatic versions of the Anna &amp; the King or King &amp; I story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the 1860's British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens and her son travel to Siam to work as a teacher of English language and culture to the wives and children of King Mongtut. She arrives and is immediately annoyed by the changes to her agreement of employment. She ignores protocol and confronts the king himself. Although she is forced to submit to the might of the king, he comes to respect her for her forwardness and a friendship between them begins while he struggles to manage an uprising seemingly sparked within Siam by external forces.Despite liking Chow Yun-Fat in pretty much everything I've seen him in, I didn't bother turning out for this film, but on television I figured it was worth a look. The film starts well and seems to be going well until I realised that, instead of being close to the end I had only watched 30 minutes! I wondered why I had mistaken the running time but then I realised that the film was very slow and laboured - making it seem a lot longer than it actually was.The actual plot was good enough on paper but it wasn't delivered very well. The wider picture of political unrest is well conveyed, as is the tension and early relationship between Anna and the king. However the whole romance is a flop as I never felt any chemistry between the two. Unfortunately the strands that do work are hampered by the bits that don't, as well as being delivered at something of a snail's pace at times. The film also looks great but that can't help it move with a better pace or overcome the very worthy status it claims.Foster does nothing to really help - she does all she is required to (simmers when needed, is outraged when required etc) but it can't really be called a great performance. Chow is much better and he feels like a real person. He brings his easy charm to the role without taking away from the regal nature of his character. Felton is a bit annoying but Ling Bai, Randall Duk Kim and a few others do good work in support.Overall the general impression I had of this film was `laboured'. The film looked great in terms of location, sets and costumes but in terms of substance it was noticeably lacking in those same qualities. Overlong and not that well developed the film stumbles along with some good elements but the fact that some doesn't work at all only makes the long running time create a weaker film that this lavish production deserved to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foster's Effort Goes Awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true story of Anna Leonowens, a British schoolteacher who traveled from her home in India to Siam in 1862 (nearly two years after the death of her husband) to instruct King Mongkut's children, `Anna and the King,' directed by Andy Tennant, is a lavish production that is visually striking but somewhat tedious in execution. The story is interesting, and the cinematography is stunning, but it simply becomes too much of not enough; Tennant's method of storytelling is pretty straightforward, and there is artistic merit to this endeavor, but ultimately-- despite the colorful canvass-- the result is less than satisfying. The redeeming factor of the film is the performance of the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat (King Mongkut), the star of many of John Woo's action films, who is afforded the opportunity here to demonstrate his versatility as a dramatic actor. He successfully lends a depth and intelligence to his portrayal of Mongkut that is reinforced with a genuine regal countenance devoid of any pretentiousness. Yun-Fat's King is a complex and secure individual who-- most importantly-- conveys a true sense of reality; he is, without question, the King of Siam. Jodie Foster (Anna) on the other hand, though arguably one of the most talented, gifted actresses in the business, is woefully miscast as Anna. Her British accent is credible, but becomes the focal point of her performance, which seems forced at best. Granted, she succeeds in capturing the stoic quality of the character, but fails to attain that necessary emotional level that would have allowed the audience to identify with her. There just doesn't seem to be anything about this `Anna' that would attract the King, either intellectually or emotionally, which, of course, mitigates the plot to a great extent. While taking nothing away from Foster's myriad positive qualities, it makes you appreciate the facility with which Meryl Streep is able to so seamlessly embody the various characters she has created in her career. Hindsight may be the forte of the unenlightened, still, in retrospect, Tennant (`Ever After,' `Fools Rush In') may not have been the wisest choice to direct a film more suited to the talents of Ang Lee or Jane Campion, or to one with the sensibilities of a Bergman or Kurosawa. Though he managed to create a pretty picture, he was unable to elicit the emotional depth required to sustain the audience's involvement with the story. All of which goes to prove that one who whittles beautifully cannot necessarily handle a lathe. The supporting cast includes Ling Bai (Tuptim), Tom Felton (Louis), Syed Alwi (The Kralahome), Randall Duk Kim (General Alak), Lim Kay Siu (Prince Chowfa) and Melissa Campbell (Princess Fa-Ying). In the final analysis, `Anna and the King,' while having the requisite elements for greatness, nevertheless lacks the emotional substance with which to achieve it. A by far superior version is the 1946 production `Anna and the King of Siam,' with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, which makes one wonder why anyone thought this should be remade in the first place. I rate this one 5/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough has been said about the historical inaccuracies of this film. I was sorely disappointed, though, by the Western bias and superior attitude the plot seemed to convey. There would have been greater charm in a more balanced depiction of Anna's contribution to Thailand.Although Chow Yun Fatt probably got the most dignified script ever for King Mongkut on the big screen, his character was unbelievably over-indulgent of "Anna". It is improbable that a man so easily swayed by an often-obnoxious schoolteacher could have kept Siam intact the way the real Mongkut did, especially when Anna's heroic rescue of Siam in this movie was heavily contrived and exaggerated.It wasn't closed-mindedness or groveling worship of their monarchy that made today's Thai authorities ban this film in their country - it's basic, commonsense self-respect.Otherwise, the acting was largely faultless, as was the costumes and set designs. Credit must be given where it is due. But that's more than can be said of what 20th Century Fox have done to the nineteenth-century Siamese royal court.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all as I was born and raise in Thailand. this movie is extremely disturbing and inaccurate in every mannor. the thai language had been spoken in this movie by the Chinese actors and actresses almost incorrect and can't be understand and the 2nd, Lady Tabtim according to the thai history stated to be very attractive woman of that time because she has south Asian (Indian descent) large eyes and curl hair - that is the ideal of beauty of thai people in old time which influenced by the Indian literatures -Beiling the Chinese actress as lady tabtim is a very poor choice and 3 rd, there is no thai princess names fa ying - this word means princess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one slow moving and inappropriately cast film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster as Anna and Chow Yun-Fat as the King of Siam is a prime candidate for some of the worst film casting ever. This beloved story has been filmed many times but no film version may ever reach the heights of 1956's "The King And I" which starred Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner in the performances of their careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Anna and the King" had a very good theme to explore: the real story of Anna Leonowens that moved to the Kingdom of Siam to teach the king's children English and after sometime one "prohibited" relationship is developed between she and the monarch. Reading the premise you imagine a romantic and touching drama. But in the big-screen, only the dramatic part remains. No romance, no tears... A big fault but even without love "Anna and the King" is a really good movie.Well, in fact, during the first 90 minutes you still think that in the future the relationship between Anna and the king will become serious and, hunmnm, I don't know, hot! They look at each other in a different way, he talks as a friend with Anna in a country where women should always remain in silent, he dances with she (the scene where the King Mongkut dances a waltz with Anna is unforgettable)... And they were getting closer and closer. But after these 90 minutes almost all the attention goes to the attacks and the possible war against the Burmeses. And the film goes in a direction that wasn't expected: the action. Where's the love? "Anna and the King" has other failures: it's not a slow movie but it's so long that it's impossible not to feel tired at the end; the end is not thrilling or dramatic or romantic, they tried to mix all these 3 qualities instead of developing one; they spent a lot of movie to do epic sceneries but they're almost not shown; they wanted it to be one of the best movies of the year and even being very good, it's very far of it.But it has a lot of qualities too: the great cast, specially Jodie Foster and Yun-Fat Chow, the songs, the art direction and costume design (but not enough for a epic)... So, is "Anna and the King" one must-watch movie? My answer is not a "yes" or a "no" but: Jodie Foster is in it! At least you won't hate it. I liked. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb and slow Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently the main actors were given the task of carrying this movie to Oscar heights. One can argue as well that sometimes this is not very tolerable to watch purely because it can get downright dull. Nevertheless, a British schoolteacher is sent to Siam to teach the King's children . . . and there are a lot of them. Meanwhile, the King deals with other problems such as a revolt. The only redeeming aspects of the film is the contrast between religion. A good date movie nevertheless, though your girl might not be too crazy for Chow Yun-Fat. Otherwise, bring your blanket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna and the King is a very well acted movie, Jodie Foster is very good and Chow Yun Fat proves he can act - not just fight. However, the writers have chosen to focus on too many subplots. There's one story where Anna is teaching the King's children, Anna and the King's uncanny friendship and love for each other, the battle between Siam and English colonies, as well as the tragedies that occur inside Siam while the King tries to improve his beloved country. All of this just doesn't work. Going on two and a half hours, it's just too long and extremely boring too allow the audience too really care about the characters. I found myself looking at my watch throughout most of the film, and that's never a good sign. There are, however, some scenes of brilliant acting - one of which involves a Siamese woman pleading for her life, while Anna becomes increasingly angry at the ways of Siam. But the editing in this film is terrible, I guess they chose to keep everything in the film, and leave little out. Obviously noone thought people could become restless in a cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Politically correct" remake of the much superior 1946 classic. In the original movie, the king was a semi-barbaric monarch seeking for Western enlightenment and torn between old customs and superstitions on one side and modern scientific knowledge and a broader perspective of life on the other. That's what made him a rich, fascinating character and gave cause to interesting conflicts and exchanges with Anna. In this remake, the Siamese ruler is (as political correctness demands) a wise and superior philosopher-king, able to look down on the British and teach Anna a lesson or two on elegance and refinement ? a flat, dull and unrealistic character. The tragic story of Tuptim is here presented in a way as to exempt the wise king of any real responsibility (thus depriving the movie from one of its key elements concerning the conflict between Anna and him), and her execution is shown in a much less brutal way. An entire subplot of war with Burma is added to provide both an action-packed conclusion and an opportunity to denounce British colonialism while praising oriental absolutism. Interracial sexual desire between Anna and the king (unthinkable in 1946) is here very explicitly portrayed. Long, slow and boring, what is Jodie Foster doing in a movie like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theres only one thing wrong with this film, its star. If it had been called The King and they had deleted all of Jodie Foster's scenes, it might actually have been watchable. As it is, however, when I pass this one on the movie channels, i am forced to stop and watch it with the same peculiar drive that forces me rewatch annoying infomercials. I guess truly bad is as arresting as truly good. And this movie is pretty darn bad. Top to bottom, with the exception of the cinematography. I neglected to check the credits, but i simply cannot believe a language coach could be responsible for that annoying annoying British accent Ms. Foster tortures the viewer with. In fact she is so uncomfortable with it, that she whispers during the entire movie, minus the dramatic scenes where she does her very best over acting. You watch this film and realize it wasnt made cheaply, and it was some studio execs dumb idea for a Jodie Foster vehicle. I think they should have showed this one to Alex in Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who at Fox thought this was a good idea? THE KING AND I with explosions. Why not remake HELLO DOLLY and have a slap fest over dinner at Harmonia Gardens? Maybe remake CAROUSEL and go for some heave ho'raping? What about getting Paris Hilton to remake some Betty Grable musicals: HORNY ISLAND instead of Coney Island or MOTHER WAS TIGHT instead of Mother Wore Tights...or in Paris Hilton's case WHAT ARE TIGHTS ....this KING AND I (kaboom kaboom) is like a Mad Magazine parody with some kid exec moaning that 'the original was boring...lets make it interesting for my generation.... with violence!" . Probably the most misguided idea of recent times...and who or what is a Chow Yun Fat? A Hong Kong menu entry? Jodie Foster as brittle British Mummykins? Yeesh. KaBoom! The dreaded remake of CASABLANCA with Tom Selleck and Jane Seymour seems closer by the day. Knowing Columbia's production tastes it will be Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in a 2007 remake of FUNNY GIRL retitled SHADDUP BITCH. The KING AND I with explosions! God Almighty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, just terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it happens to be a rainy Saturday Night, and you head to your local Blockbuster to rent a film for the family, avoid getting this movie. If you can't decide between "From Justin to Kelly" and this movie, I'll help you out. Take The former. This is a long, long, long and very pointless film, in which Jodie Foster gives a terrible performance. Maybe it isn't long as far as time goes, but you'll be checking your watch constantly to see how much time is left due to the illusion of time that the tediously disastrous story conveys. The Movie is about this British lady who goes to teach Siamese kids and the King of Siam and she fall in love. Terrible premise for a movie, and it is equally awful in its execution. It takes one look down the cast to see that its a disaster. Chow Yun Fat, Yun Chow Fat, Yun Fat Chow, Chow Fat Yun or whatever his name is, is the biggest star in this movie next to Foster, who creates a fake British accent which is easily seen as phony and adds on to the train wreck that is "Anna and the King." The movie may not be horrible as far as plot and the actual fundamental elements go, but it is disdainfully boring and it takes a mental specimen not found on this planet to sit through the incoherent babbling of A horrible cast through a ridiculously terrible film.</fullReview>
