		<shortDescription>Michael Douglas Plays Whacky-Zanny and This Movie is a Whole Lot of Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this movie and checking out the cast and filmmakers I made this a must see at this years Sundance Film Festival. The combination of Alexander Payne (Sideways,Election,About Schmidt) producing and Michael Douglas playing wacky gives hope for another great dramedy along the lines of Little Miss Sunsine and Sideways. King of California easily meets those hopes and for many it will be much more enjoyable then those former films. The movie features Douglas as Charlie a recently released mental patient with a whimsical fascination for buried Spanish treasure. While Charlie has been away his 16 year old daughter Miranda played by Evan Racheal Wood has managed to avoid child services, dropped out of school and support herself and their home by working full-time at Mcdonalds. Upon Charlies arrival home Miranda finds that life was much easier without Charlie around, not only does she have to support their home but now she has to take care of her unstable father. Persitent with his intent to search for a mythical buried Spanish treasure Miranda begrudgingly agrees to help him. The movie finds its humor and warmth in the moments shared between Charlie and Miranda during their treasure hunting through developed suburbia that leads them to a unlikely final destination. In the end the real treasure may not be the gold after all but the love between a daughter and father.The ever developing Evan Racheal Wood is solid in the role of Miranda, the whole movie develops through her narration and her acting is effortlessly touching. Michael Douglas is outstanding and in true form here, from start to finish he's a joy to watch, this is easily his best performance since Wonder Boys. This will definitely be one of the best movies in 2007, expect praise a plenty for Douglas come awards time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky but sweet comedy with a delightful Michael Douglas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Of California is best described as a wacky but sweet comedy. Michael Douglas is really delightful and that's reason enough to check out this film. He plays one of the most likable characters I've seen in a long time. The plot is so 'out there' I don't even know how to write a plot summary without making it sound like a silly kids movie. When in fact, it's a mature movie, dealing with real issues without ever getting preachy.Some people have posted threads here on IMDb asking: Is this a comedy? Well, I'm not saying it's a typical American in your face comedy but it sure is funny to me.Some complaints: Evan Rachel Wood is not really that great of an actress (yet). Of course she's talented but I mean...she was talented four years ago. Now I'm like...when is she finally gonna deliver. To be fair, I haven't seen all of her movies so maybe I should check out some other ones before spewing criticism.Also, King Of California is one of those movies that left me feeling indifferent. That's not a flaw, it's just the kind of movie KOC is. I like movies that confront me or get me thinking.I wouldn't recommend it to most of my friends, since I predict about half the people are really gonna like it, and half are gonna find it boring. I would recommend it to more mature people, who like independent films.6.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was too easy to expect a rug-chewing performance from Michael Douglas as a crazy person, and an exasperated, eye-rolling two-dimensional "oh I'm so put-upon by the world" job from Evan Rachel Wood.Thankfully, those clichés were avoided in this poignant and ultimately joyful and uplifting (thank God!) story of quiet nobility, personal vision and purpose, and underlying love and strength amongst otherwise "broken" people.It's refreshing to go into a theatre not expecting much and coming out enlightened by the combined vision of the actors, writer, director, and cinematographer.Bravo to all involved, and here's hoping to see a strong presence at the Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too silly to be serious,too wistful to be dismissed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifteen-year old Miranda(Evan Rachel Wood,luminescent!!) has had to grow up fast,since her mother left her and her father and said father,Charlie(Michael Douglass,in a word:WOW!) was institutionalized for reasons not entirely made clear but discernible through observation. When Charlie is de-institutionalized,he returns to his daughter with a grand plan to find gold in the hills along the Pacific Coast Highway. She is,in a word,skeptical.Director and writer Mike Cahill makes a movie that is both at once full of quirk and melancholy,with the daughter as somewhat of a de facto narrator. The quest for finding the treasure,while ridiculous and unquestionably irresponsible,is still almost noble and pure. Wood and Douglass shine very nicely as the estranged,mentally delicate father and daughter duo who haven't stopped loving each other,even if they get each other even less than they did before. A simple story,framed by quirky music(jazz?folk?) and a nearly poetic filming of contemporary California coastline as it contrasts the 16th century maps that Charlie references. Lost in the sea of fall releases from last year,this film is a very pleasant find on the rental shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved "King of California." It is sweet and really funny. The characters are flawed, but lovable.There are basically two characters in the film. Michael Douglas plays Charlie who has just spent 2 years in a mental institution. Apparently the entire time he was there he was in the library researching lost buried treasure from the Spanish missionaries that was left in Ventura, California.Evan Rachel Wood plays his 16-year-old daughter, Miranda, who had to drop out of school so she could work double shifts at McDonalds to support herself and pay the mortgage to avoid losing the house. She is world weary and bitter at never having a proper childhood and having to be the adult in the relationship.Eventually Charlie convinces her of the validity of the buried treasure and there is a bonding as they search for the lost treasure that leads them to the depths of a local Costco warehouse.The performances are great. Michael Douglas is all bug-eyed and crazy. Evan Rachel Wood adds to her "indie cred." Along with "Pretty Persuasion" and "Down in the Valley," she could be the next Parker Posey.This is one of the best films of 2007. Make sure not to miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tired Script but a Platform for the Skillful Acting of Douglas and Wood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KING OF California may not break any records for innovation of thought or script but it is a tightly made little film that allows veteran actor Michael Douglas a lollipop of a wacky role to remind us that he does have comedic talent! It also gives 20-year old Evan Rachel Wood the opportunity to compete with a Pro and come out an equal - quite a feat for such a young actress. Written and directed by Mike Cahill the story does have appeal, especially since it is set in Santa Clarita, California, a rapidly developing 'hinterland' that is suffering from the effects of too rapid industrialization, changing from a picturesque remnant of California raw beauty into yet another perky little town.Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in and out of mental institutions for his wacky behavior. His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map, leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home (in the midst of a huge housing development) with the money she makes double shifting at the local MacDonalds. When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s, a fact he has researched while hospitalized, on the Internet, and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years. The manner in which Charlie, Miranda, and an old ex-con friend Pepper (Willis Burks II) go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.Yes, there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before (and often better), but the pleasure of KING OF California lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood. This is a pleasant excursion of a movie, worth an evening's gander. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very slow moving movie featuring superb acting from Douglas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"King Of California" is the art house version of "National Treasure" or "Indiana Jones". It's the story of Charlie (Michael Douglas) who is released from the mental institution in which he has spent several years and is reunited with his sixteen year old daughter Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood). Although he is obviously a few sandwiches short of a picnic, Charlie manages to convince his daughter to join him in a quest for buried treasure. Together they move through Southern California looking for clues leading to the lost doubloons.If, after reading that description of the plot, you're now expecting these two characters to run through dark tunnels with giant boulders rolling after them then you'd be wrong. "King Of California" is a slow and very quiet movie which focuses more on Charlie and Miranda repairing their relationship than the actual treasure hunt. Miranda has been forced to take a job at McDonalds in order to survive during her father's absence meaning that she is now the rational one whilst Charlie acts as a child. Their search for the treasure takes them to golf courses and busy stores where Charlie sees signs that they're on the right trail whilst Miranda, not fully believing in Charlie's dream, simply wants to spend some time with the father she's lost touch with.Douglas gives one of his finest performances in recent years as Charlie, managing to make the character seem insane whilst also being totally appealing (witness the way in which he wins arguments by stating absurd facts and telling people to "look it up"). Evan Rachel Wood is also perfect in her role. It may not be as showy a role as Douglas' but Wood convinces you that Miranda absolutely loves her father despite all his faults (and he certainly has a lot).Although I liked "King Of California", I really can't say that I loved it - the plot was perhaps a little too slow moving for my tastes. I certainly admired its message, however, that you should follow your dreams because dreams give you something to believe in. If you have patience and like character-driven movies which reveal their charms at a very leisurely pace (such as the movies "Sideways" or "Rushmore"), then I'd recommend watching "King Of California" for its superb acting and life-affirming message. Others - like myself - however, who prefer story lines to move along at a much quicker rate may find it a bit boring in places and slightly too whimsical overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King of Calinfornia features excellent performances and character development from Michale Douglass and Evan Rachel Wood. Douglass' character is especially weird and wacky, but respectable. The film is very slow moving, but enjoyable. The film is definitely not as it appears to be about the extrinsic treasure hunt. Rather is more of an intrinsic hunt for the relationship and love between a misguided father, and his prematurely grown-up daughter.The film has a great balance of drama and humor, with just a touch of adventurous excitement. Other posts have similar offerings regarding the quality and depth of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake about it. Evan Rachael Wood is fast becoming a most welcome addition to the rising wave of young stars in films today. I totally admired her work in 'Thirteen' (2003),and 'Running With Scissors'(2006). In this one, she plays the daughter of a recently released mental patient (Michael Douglas,sporting an unkempt beard)who is obsessing over buried treasure somewhere in the suburbs of California. Michael Douglas makes his performance as Charles work nicely, acting like a loony that was released from the home a bit too early, in contrast to Wood's anchor that holds things together. The screenplay does contain a few potholes along the way, but not enough to make this worth avoiding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a recently released mental patient who is obsessed with finding hidden treasure mentioned by a 400 year old journal."King of California" is an interesting film. It starts off slow, but it the pace becomes increasingly quick along the way, and at the end the pace is too quick to grasp everything. I cannot not really understand the ending because so much happens within a short amount of time. I like Michael Douglas' portrayal as a psychotic person. He is not over the top, and yet looks and acts crazy enough. His character is likable and goofy. Evan Rachel Wood is also great in the film. This is a good piece of independent cinema. It is inspiring and heart warming I hope it gets more attention than it is having.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to approach "King of California"....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about the relationship between a father and his daughter. The daughter is extremely responsible, and more mature than dad. Dad is an irresponsible dreamer, and the role reversal is intriguing. Michael Douglas and Evan Rachel Wood nicely compliment a very clever script. If you are the type of viewer who demands complete logic in everything that happens on the screen, you will not enjoy "King of California", because the story requires you to suspend disbelief. If you enjoy a treasure hunt, even one that is chasing smoke, then by all means see this film. It has a nice message,"you've got to believe in treasure to find it" - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>play a crazy guy, then this is right up your alley. Douglas plays a recently released bi polar patient that goes to live with his 16 year old daughter. His daughter dropped out of school and says she's been working full time at McDonald's since he got sent away. Now that part is not believable because there are labor laws and a 15 year old could not just get around them.Once he comes home, he has this crazy idea that there is buried treasure. So he goes on all these hunts using metal detectors, back hoes, the stars and his daughter goes along with it. She doesn't even try to tell him it's the delusions, she does his crazy schemes. Then she gets mad when he sells her car and takes out loans on the house he can't pay.So the ending was pretty cool. They break into a Costco because he believes that is where the treasure is buried. And the daughter gets a sort of fairy tale ending.FINAL VERDICT: OK, it was entertaining and a short movie. Worth watching on cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is great but needs to be watched more that once spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie and tend to disagree with most people who describe Charlie as crazy. I think he is actually brilliant. Everything he says in this movie turns out to be true. He is constantly telling Miranda things and says if you don't believe me look it up. Charlie is a genius but most people don't believe him so they label him as crazy. I think the stuff he does in the movie prove his brilliance. Miranda is constantly skeptical about what her dad is saying. Then in the end he says something and then if you don't believe me look it up. But she says she doesn't need to because she realizes hes not crazy after all. I think this movie is also saying something about people who live by the beat of a different drummer like Charlie. They live their lives differently then most people. You don't necessarily have to work a 9-5 job to work. He says he isn't looking for the treasure for the money and she said something like you would if you had to work and his reply is that it depends on what you consider work. There are a lot of subtle things in this movie that you don't get unless you watch it and listen intently. You probably have to watch it more than once. There is a part near the end when Charlie says something about the passageway is suppose to be 40 bars(120ft) down. If there is a passageway it must lead to someplace where he was probably headed when he dove in the second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say that this film is Michael Douglas's best since Wall Street. I have not seen Wall Street so I can't give my say on the matter but I can assure you this: Michael Douglas gives a brilliant, touching performance as Charlie, an institutionalized dad obsessing over buried treasure in the California suburbs. I can boldly say that he's one of the best character actors around and the way he portrayed his character in the movie cannot be easily forgotten. I definitely think he deserved an Oscar on this one.An outstanding performance by Mr. Douglas I tell you that. But he isn't the only one that made this movie. There's the young actress Evan Rachel Wood who also deserves some credits as the patient and caring daughter to his father, Charlie. The director also deserves some creds. He made an awesome film with the most perfect cast and a touching, yet heartbreaking ending. I suggest you go see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Dive Into the Eel's Nest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is one of the producers of this movie and that explains the cuckoo's nestish role for Douglas (producer in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). We know Payne's previous works about negligent-parents- detached-children, such as About Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) and Sideways (Giamatti's character writes a book about his issues with his dad), and their path of finding themselves and some sort of redemption. Well here Wood's character dedicates herself onto helping her dad to move on with his life so she can move on too consequently.The treasure they are after is the link that helps Douglas and Wood's characters explain us why parents must support and believe their children so they don't grow up to be failures (losers), or delusional. Which by the way, those were Douglas issues with his dad; therefore, Payne's favorite theme plus Douglas playing Nicholson. And then eventually we'll see Rachel producing Abigail Breslin in a remake of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf released in year 2038.The movie is fairly well acted by both, specially Douglas who was given a great role and nailed it. Wood is perfect as the well centered daughter balancing the complete opposite of her dad's emotional (a character's formula for happy endings).Worth seeing if it's a family holiday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I saw recently. It has a bit of everything to make it an independent movie classic - goof ball characters, craziness and whole deal of introspection. What makes this movie different from many other independent films is a feel-good vibe which recently has been tough to find in American cinema and a quirky, interesting plot line. If there is anything bad I can say about the movie is that it felt too short. Fans of Little Miss Sunshine and Six feet under should be pleased with this little gem of a movie."King of California" actually deserves to be much more popular than it is now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful, underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those underrated films which had a limited release, was not really promoted, and, in my opinion, was dismissed by some as a low-budget, shallow flop because they really did not get the writer's intent. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance, and it is said that he immediately wanted to do the film after reading the script. Sure, it is a lighthearted, feel-good story, but I think a lot of people simply miss the dramatic undertones and the depth. Though not one of my favorite actresses, Evan Rachel Wood somehow manages to capture the character of an exasperated but loving daughter who has had to grow up and take responsibility too quickly because of her absentee parents. Her young life skipped over any fun years and immediately entered the survival mode in which many low-wage, adult workers live because of a lack of education or opportunity due to absentee parents or the socioeconomic situation of their family. Enter her mentally ill, quirky, father, who at first she sees as just another burden. Over time, she realizes he is a sincere idealist struggling desperately to make up for his past mistakes. Her love brings a reluctant willingness to humor him and join in his quixotic search, and ends with an eye-opening realization about her father, life, and the nature of idealism. If you decide to watch it, avoid all possible spoilers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The amazing performances from Douglas &amp; Rachel Wood make this interesting, yet bizarre film worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I can state this enough. This movie may not be for everyone. If you're looking for a film that's filled with originality and creativity, you may have hit the jackpot with this one. One thing about this movie is it's never boring, nor is it predictable. It's truly an original film, but I'm not fully sure if I liked it. It was a bit too cold for my liking at times, and it was the performances that kept me going. Your enjoyment may depend on how much you can get into Douglas's character. He is so loony he ended up being likable for me. Douglas has delivered many great performances out there, and this is right up there with the best of them. It was unlike any other character he's played before, and he nailed it to perfection. Evan Rachel Wood is just as good as Douglas. She is one of the most unheralded actresses going today. Her character might not be as dynamic as Douglas's, but she is just as vital as the daughter. Her excellent chemistry with Douglas was on point throughout. The finale was a bit a mixed for me. What I got out of the movie is this. It wasn't about finding treasure. It was about two estranged individuals reconnecting with one another, and trying to understand each other. The journey was a bit quirky, and I'm not sure it's something I'll ever watch again, but it was worth it overall. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the kind of movie that I usually watch, and I think that I'm pretty far out of its target demographic. However, I figured that I'd take a chance, given that I was bored and feeling open-minded. At times, I was worried that King of California would descend into insipid and clichéd family-friendly themes, but it kept surprising me with a bit of subversiveness or social commentary. Michael Douglas's character serves as the classic "wise fool", an ostensibly foolish character who nonetheless imparts great wisdom, due in no small part to his inability to properly socialize in polite society. His daughter, more inhibited and straight-laced, learns to think outside the box, trust her instincts, question authority, follow her dreams, etc. By the end of the movie, I was half-expecting her to join some New Age cult and/or dye her hair purple.The pacing really slows down to a crawl sometimes, but, overall, it's a fairly good movie with a message that should resonate with nonconformists, hippies, and madmen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treasure Hunt In Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a pretty good little movie when I watched it in 2010. For some reason, I had never really heard of it prior to 2010, so it was a good one to stumble across. Quite early in the adventure, I began suspecting that Charlie was just stringing Miranda along on his mission for the sole purpose of spending time with her, all the while doing something that would free her from her mundane life as a McDonalds employee. I guess the end of the movie does not really make it 100% clear as to if that was the case, or if he was really just crazy, or if he was correct and there was really treasure and he was on the verge of obtaining it.It felt to me that this film attempted to be a treasure hunting movie, something that would not normally take place in current times, and set it in the twenty-first century. I think that is pretty daring because it is a difficult thing to achieve. I feel that this movie did it pretty well. The troubles of a Costco over the dig site made sense in reality and also added some humor and a roadblock to the action. There were a number of times when you kind of had to ignore reality and just go with what was happening (example: the cops just ignored the initial break-in as a gas leak), but I was okay with that.I really enjoyed this movie and would actually give it a 7.5 if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Madness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas has just been released from a mental hospital. During his years as an inmate, he read a great deal about California history, especially the stories left by monks of lost treasure. One monk in particular, left behind a diary of his journey in 1651 in which he lists clues of the treasure's whereabouts. Douglas returns home and enlists the aid of his estranged daughter, Evan Rachel Wood, in his besotted quest. She supports them with her job at McDonalds. They pawn or sell everything except their house in order to buy the equipment necessary to track down the lost doubloons -- back hoes, scuba equipment, and so forth.It's a gentle family comedy, not a zany laff riot. There are no pratfalls, little vulgarity, and nothing raunchy or violent. The model of madness is fey and whimsical. There's nothing dangerous about the deranged Douglas. He's funny.And it's Douglas's kind of role too. He's superb at wild-eyed restraint. At one point he's about to drive away in Wood's heap of a car and she rushes out to stop him. She shines a flashlight through the window and when he explains the purpose of his midnight trip his eyes are so wide open that the irises are surrounded by white, as in a cartoon. I looked in the mirror and tried to do it myself and couldn't.Wood is less effective. She looks and sounds as if she'd just been extraordinarily renditioned from the streets of Sherman Oaks. She was stunning as an early adolescent in "Thirteen," where she embodied a sort of savage innocence, whereas here she's a generically beautiful young woman.The script depends a lot on the performances because there really isn't much to the story except air. One mildly amusing incident follows another, and they'd all be pointless if they weren't built around Douglas's obsession with the monk's leavings.The dialog is warm and funny without the willingness to crack the viewer up with laughter. Everyone seems so charming and good natured. Here's an example of one of the more ludic lines.Wood: (Shouting) "You think the world is only here for your own amusement!" Douglas: (Shrugs) "Look at the world." Now, an exchange like this must necessarily make a great big thud unless it's carried off perfectly, with neither party acting as if they realized its absurdity. And they do it.There was one sad underlying impression that I'm not sure the writers/director meant to elicit. I mean the striking contrast between the landscape descriptions from the monk's diary. They're all about pure valleys and unspoiled heaving hills and rivers and caves and rocks. The landscape that Douglas and Wood explore is mottled with housing tracts and strip malls. These developments seem to have been caught in mid flight, while spreading like some malignancy across the natural features of the land. Douglas needs to break into CostCo and drill through several feet of concrete to find the monk's river, now driven underground, hidden under a multitude of shelves with boxes of consumer crap. There's nothing especially funny about purity lost.</fullReview>

Not a bad movie, by any means, it still didn't really manage to captivate me to the point at which I'd consider it really good.Michael Douglas put on an excellent performance as Charlie, a man just released from a psychiatric institution who is convinced that he's discovered the location of a secret treasure buried by the Spaniards almost 400 years before. The problem: how to get at it, since it's now buried under a giant Costco warehouse! Watching Charlie work his magic in his search for the treasure is amusing, and another clear highlight of the movie was the performance of Evan Rachel Wood as his 16-year old daughter Miranda, who's also learned to be quite the operator while Charlie was institutionalized, convincing everyone that she was being looked after by someone else so that everyone would just leave her alone. Her relationship with Charlie is complicated. Both Douglas and Wood pulled off the role reversal perfectly - Miranda essentially being the mature and responsible adult as opposed to Charlie's child-like qualities. Miranda is often frustrated by Charlie and sometimes angry with him (only calling him "Dad" when he insists) and yet over the course of the movie Wood also does a good job portraying her growing affection and closeness for him. The movie perhaps becomes just a bit too over the top ridiculous once it shifts inside the Costco, and I have to say that I was just a bit put off by the obvious advertising for various chains (Costco, McDonald's and Applebee's are all featured in this.) Still, commercials aside, while not captivating it certainly counts as quirky fun. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Work....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Cahill deserves kudos for making an attempt like 'King Of California'. A unique idea, translated into a lovely piece of cinema. The 2007 flick, succeeds.... Big Time!You don't expect 'King Of California' to be a milestone.... and that's the beauty of it. The expectations are medium, and you when finish the screening, you're taken by a pleasant surprise. As mentioned earlier from this writer, this film works big time. In all departments the film works. The Writer-Director keeps your attention held almost throughout. The Cinematography is brilliant; maintaining a consistent look throughout. The Performances are outstanding: Michael Douglas is remarkable. Playing his part with amazing understanding, easily one of his careers best works. Evan Rachel Wood is excellent from start to end. All said n done, 'King Of California' is classy work, neat work. I give it, Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, this movie is far removed from my usual liking of zombies and serial killers. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. One has to ask, after losing her home, then her father, how and why did a 17 year old come up with the money to buy a dishwasher she so desperately wanted for a house she no longer has? Let us go back to a small scene in which her father had given her her own credit card in her name. Why would he do that you suppose? The methodology was simplistic and brilliant at the same time, and was most likely overlooked by many viewers. The heart wrenching scene at the near end of the father tying her to the soda machines and telling her how important she was and what she meant to him was beautiful. Then we see him cautiously running from rack to rack with a small plastic container, empty at first, then heavy and rattling on the way back. Then he dives back into the hole to go after the rest of the gold. This is where most people have trouble. First, the rushing water. Rushing water is moving water and therefore has to empty out somewhere. It just doesn't stop. After realizing he cannot go back the way he came he follows the flow of water and comes to a light ahead but it is too narrow and he cannot cross it with his tanks. He removes them and swims up. Remember the dream of the naked Chinese men? What does his daughter come across on the beach? What empties into the ocean? He lives. The director leaves the outcome up to interpretation, but I must believe that he lives given the small clues and the character's ability to see the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fantasy that uses realistic circumstances to tell something like an inspirational fairy tale. The father-daughter relationship and presence of contemporary superstore adds an element of believability to what essentially could have been a fairy tale. So, while the movie requires you to make many leaps of faith to completely appreciate the story, it is in the realistic part of the story where the charm lies. Wonderfully acted and well constructed, the story provides for many tender moments before culminating into an ending that is both fantastic and suggestive. One of those movies that you can watch, enjoy and forget and then, of course, re-watch to discover something new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, quirky movie, but not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas is Charlie, scruffy-looking, always with a glint in his eye. You never feel like what you are hearing from Charlie is the whole story. While he may not actually lie, he likely is withholding important details.Evan Rachel Wood is good and cute as Charlie's daughter Miranda. She is 16, almost 17, and has been living alone in the house that her grandfather, Charlie's father, built years ago in California. She had to drop out of school so that she could work at McDonalds to pay the bills. Being a minor, all the various agencies thought she was living with one adult or the other, when in fact she was living alone.The story begins as Charlie gets out of a 2-year stay in a mental hospital and joins Miranda. While she shows no animosity towards her dad, she calls him 'Charlie' because he has scarcely been a part of her life. But Charlie had plenty of time to read and reflect during his 2-year hiatus and came out convinced that a few hundred years ago a monk had traveled through their area and had buried a treasure of old Spanish gold doubloons. Charlie was determined to find that treasure.The third important character is Willis Burks II as Charlie's old friend, motorcycle-riding Pepper, in his 70s. Pepper had been a security system expert back i his heyday, right before he went to prison.I enjoyed this quirky adventure movie, but my wife didn't. You have to have a certain mindset to enjoy it. Can Charlie really find long buried treasure? Can he and his daughter re=establish a healthy relationship? SPOILERS: Miranda reluctantly goes along with Charlie but thinks he is crazy. But as they travel the route he predicted, they find evidence, including one old gold doubloon using a metal detector. Then, with a backhoe at a different site, some old pottery. Then a large boulder on a golf course that had been used as a makeshift altar. Eventually they end up in a Costco store, and Charlie calculates that the treasure is under the floor. They find a way to sneak in at night, Charlie digs, finds an underground stream, and with SCUBA gear discovers the treasure. Charlie disappears one last time into the water, Miranda never is sure what happens to him, but she uses a bar-code tag Charlie gave her, buys the appliance, and when she opens it we see a golden glow on her face. Somehow Charlie filled it with gold for her, and he is probably living somewhere else now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very nice movie with a message to savor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King of California ("KOC") is one of those movies where if you don't pay attention, you might miss the punch-line.Basically what is boils down to is this: The slight zaniness of Charlie (Michael Douglas) in his search for long lost treasure, is a metaphor for the long-standing allure California has had on hundreds of thousands (millions) of people over the years.Like moths to a flame, the intangible allure which is the promise of a better life, has drawn legions of seekers to California over the years.But the genius of KOC is that it waits to the ending scenes to confirm for us the viewers that Charlie's obsession is, by the standards of the allure of California, 100% correct, 100% valid and in his instance, it actually pays off for his beloved (and loving) daughter in the end.Think carefully about the symbolism of the illegal immigrants emerging for the ocean in the movie's final scene and also about the scene in which Charlie last appears and you'll make the connection regarding the utter immersion which the allure of personal fulfillment compels people to. People want the dreams of their lives to be fulfilled and they will indeed throw caution to the wind seeking it.The symbolism of the Costco (so much is there, it has everything) is also a metaphor for California itself.I'll leave the rest to the viewers, but I'll just say that Evan Rachel Wood is very believable as a loving daughter and Willis Burks's ingenuity in the Costco scene is for me a modern version of the can-do pioneering spirit which carried people westward in the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious and heart-felt movie with a quirky twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done watching this movie,and I thought it was really good. It stars Michael Douglas and Evan Rachel Wood. They are both great in it. Michael Douglas plays a guy who has been in a mental institution for several years. When he finally gets out,he re-unites with his daughter(played by Wood),who has had to fend for herself the whole time he was gone,all the while enjoying a peaceful existence without her nutty father around. He tries to convince her that there is ancient Spanish treasure buried underneath a Costco store in the California town that they live in. At first,she just thinks he is crazy and doesn't believe him. Eventually, she ends up believing him and they both lay out a hilarious plan to break into Costco and dig a tunnel into the sewer line to get the treasure. They go through one mishap after another while devising their plan. The plot makes it sound like and Indiana Jones adventure-type of movie,but it's really not. It's more of a make you think...kind of artsy-type of movie with a comedic twist to it. If you haven't seen it yet,you should buy it or rent it. Michael Douglas plays an amazing crazy guy and Evan Rachel Wood is great as the daughter who is struggling to believe her dad and see through his insanity,all the while being taken on a hilarious and heart-moving journey,in this very quirky and imaginative movie. I give this one a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King of California takes up a thread out of one of the most cherished (and well-worn) themes Hollywood holds dear, namely that a dream--even or especially an insane dream--is what makes life and even death meaningful.However, there is also a great deal of brilliance in the execution of this film. For one, the unique depiction of what it means to be young. His 15-year-old daughter, living with neither parent and also lost in the cracks by social services, emancipates herself with a job at McDonalds, making mortgage payments, etc. It is really only the general viability of community in California which makes this seem plausible. She has even purchased an old Volvo on eBay from someone from Pasadena, who happens to be a little old lady. And so, without the complications of a license or insurance, but based on her personal credibility at the wheel as a poised young lady, this house of cards works for her. She has grown into the available space like a weed and she is rightly proud of her accomplishment.When her Father, recently out of a mental institution, involves her in a hunt for buried treasure, it at first seems as if the action has moved to a wilder landscape in California--until the camera rises over a hill and we observe a Costco. The treasure hunt is taking place in vacant lots. He soon deduces that the treasure is buried directly underneath the Costco. The film pays much attention to the changing landscape as commercial development proceeds. He and his daughter are, by California standards, the old guard.I thought it was a great touch the way the camera scanning the landscape includes arbitrary floating reflections of ubiquitous corporate icons like "76" and "Chuckie Cheese," which are there even when they are not there. Transience is a great theme of this film, the transience of the landscape and the transience of people. In a society of newcomers, acting naturally is the coin of the realm. While King of California is full of wry humor, it is even more so a poignant drama. It is a story about a young woman struggling painfully with her limitations of knowledge and experience. Her zany father is a constant challenge. It is also a story about an absentee Father determined to cut a heroic image for his daughter in the only ways he knows how and at any cost. This is one of the best films at explaining what California means and why Californians love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nice little film that elicits a wonderful and (thankfully) restrained performance from Michael Douglas as a recent mental institute release who believes a long lost treasure is located underneath the local Costco. His 17 year-old daughter Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) has somehow managed to get on with life on her own through some bureaucratic foster home snafu, and has adjusted to eking out a simple life without her parents. When her Dad gets released after a few years in the loony bin, she has to slowly readjust to his presence and is not certain he is actually "cured", as he spouts off about buried treasure and naked Chinamen. But is there some truth to his wild claims? There are some good laugh-out-loud moments here and well as some emotional ones, though there is a slight depressing feel through the movie. Evan Rachel Wood, gives another great performance with a chemistry with Douglas that just gels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable but easily forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas finally gets to cut loose a bit as a mentally loose father of one who just got out of an institution only to lead his responsible daughter onto a wild treasure hunt culminating beneath Costco's warehouse floor. King of California is one of those mildly engaging, semi-quirky, enjoyable little indie films that nonetheless becomes pretty forgettable after viewing.First timer Mike Cahill shows promise, both thematically in his modern versus ancient ruminations, and stylistically in shooting some of the urban locations in a majestic light. Unfortunately, even as the climax continues to build interest, the end result, coupled by Evan Rachel Wood 's omnipotent narration throughout pulls this somewhat unique movie back into a more typical independent-styled, light-hearted character study, forsaking most bona-fide personality for a more well rounded and safer viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those extremely rare movies that makes you wish you could personally thank everyone involved for creating it. By writing this I hope to achieve that. Thank you Mike Cahill, thank you Evan Rachel Wood and thank you Michael Douglas for this amazingly touching piece of art. This is arguably the best promotion of human free will I've seen on screen! Brilliant performances by the entire cast, from the wild Latina with her hazel colored eyes to the fat crowd at the 'barbecue'. I felt blessed to see this piece of pure gold in movie-making. Transcending everyday-life, every second of it. Pulling you out of your reality, and into this beautiful made-up world from writers, actors, camera-people, engineers, producers, editors, set dressers and animation drawing magicians, in studios, working with their black trolleys and heavy batteries, on locations, shutting down streets, with their lighting equipment and recording mixers. Without for a moment being distracted by the thought of them having faked it all for you, the viewer.This little treasure throws you in a natural high, floats you over the big cloud of a dream come true, in which nothing else matters. Written as though it is one huge poem. Beginning and ending with naked Chinese guys. Funny in such an honest way. Subtle yet efficient. Easy yet action packed. And what a sweet soundtrack and score!Also, to those claiming there are plot holes: Check again. I can give you ways out of every little one of your sad excuses of a bad imagination. They aren't there. No plot holes. None.I'm rating this a 9 only because I wanted to see a different ending. Maybe it will be there as an extra on the HD-DVD. Sure hope so, I'll be buying it.</fullReview>

An exploration into the complicated relationships with family while freshly building promise that a single goal, no matter how awkward, can be the binding piece of the puzzle in a fragmented father and daughter bond. Displays how judgment of those we do not understand is sometimes unwarranted and without any imagination, while the imagination of those we judge roams freely without lack of faith.

And since it is not full of cussing, sex and killing should attract a larger audience to enjoy it. Some critics have written it too far-fetched and not believable.

		<fullReview>All around a hidden gem. Haven't seen Michael Douglas around and his role is pretty good. Rachael Evan Wood definitely steals the show as miranda, but there's not many actors in this so it's pretty reliant on her. It's not your typical suburban mellow drama, those can be good but tiring, this had a pretty well established sub plot, Hidden Buried Spanish gold. The cinematography was above standard I should say, means It made the movie actually believable, up beat with some realistic dramatic father daughter scenes, or realistic family relationship dialogue, which is something that at first might seem stretched, but works in the end.Saw one goof at the end, when she has her car back, never quite explained how she got it, considering her dad sells it at one point. But oh well, good honest role for Rachael evan wood, shows she isn't a one dimensional actor. Decent film too, I'd buy on DVD for re-watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprising heartfelt performance between Evan Wood and Michael Douglas. A very mature poetic handle by writer/director Mike Cahill.I felt the actual search for treasure part was nice, but it was more a journey between the repair of father/daughter relationships. Wood plays a very understanding daughter who's father (Douglas) has just been released from a psych ward. Gently nudging him back to reality, she doesn't judge or act on his peculiar behavior. But knows, they are stuck together no matter what. I enjoyed the very quirky unfolding of the story. We do get the sense that this could be all one big put-on by someone who is clearly acting on impulse, but it pulls back just in the right time to charm you.

		<fullReview>The movie focuses on two main characters - a mentally ill musician who believes he has discovered buried treasure and is ready to go to the extreme for it, and his teenage daughter struggling alone to make ends meet. Within 1,5 hours, we see them consenting and disagreeing, as their recent years have been so different - the parent in a closed institution leading "calm" life, the daughter had to leave school and start coping in "real", hectic life. The pace is, however, not even, some scenes are unnecessary or protracted, turns appear arduously, but thanks to Michael Douglas and Evan Rachel Wood as leading characters, it is not boring to watch; Douglas, above all, gives a performance not customary to him, proving again that he is a strong and versatile actor.If you have followed Sundance movies, you would likely appreciate King of California as well.</fullReview>

Then he uses plastic container to make extra trip to the 'hole' just before they turn on the lights in Costco. What do you think is he doing? 2nd he looses scuba diving gear to get through the narrow passage. I thought director left it to the viewer to create own ending and decide if Charlie lives or not.

		<shortDescription>Another one of the bunch or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are far more "Little Miss Sunshines" or "Sideways" than we might think. Good movies like the two mentioned titles, I think, because of time and place (and other factors, of course; but it depends on the year) end up occupying a privileged position they might not completely deserve. I men, they do deserve it; it's just that there are many movies that could share the same luck. I think Mike Cahill's "King of California", (not) coincidentally produced by Alexander Payne, is one of those films. Not planning to blow our minds in any way, with a true love for cinema and his characters, writer/director Cahill delivers an intimate, delicate and complex story in his directorial debut, set in the sunny sceneries of Los Angeles, California. After we've experienced a rich use of music, filled with amiable guitars and acoustic songs that reflect the piece's mood, it's not until the very end that Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) makes clear that we are, indeed, in California; but we have the film's title in our head and, even so, it doesn't seem to matter where the events take place. Miranda becomes responsible for the narration, as we go with her to a mental institution. His father is leaving the place and moving back in with her. She calls him Charlie (Michael Douglas). Charlie believes there's a treasure hidden somewhere; he wants to look for it and his daughter, not without reason, accepts he's totally mad.What's important, though, it's that the environment is sunny. We all know by now, as viewers, that independent American cinema deals very much with dysfunctional families and beings. Therefore, we don't need it to get darker than the first impression we have because it will always be more interesting and original to see something falling apart in the light of day than amongst a disturbing and (maybe) forced obscurity. Jonathan and Valerie Faris knew this very well, Alexander Payne is a master in the subject and Mike Cahill also seems to understand how the 'device' (if you want to give a name to it) works. That said, it's also fair to admit that it's not always that a father-teenage daughter relationship is the core and reason to be of a movie. It's typical to expect that kind of development as a subplot, and most of the time it's very superficial. In "King of California", Miranda and her father are the only existing players. Of course, there's the obligatory contact with the outer world, but the fact that Charlie is insane and his daughter ends up following him anywhere makes one believe they might live in a parallel universe...That is, until from time to time a cop or security guard warns them because of the wild activities they're performing (this is something you have to watch). Michael Douglas is one of the best, or the few veteran actors -Alec Baldwin comes to mind- at doing something quite complex to achieve and difficult to explain: laughing of themselves. Douglas came up with this during this decade, partly, I believe, because it builds credibility, to an extent. It's easy to perceive: it involves laughing all the time; and in a movie like this one it's delightful to see Douglas having the time of his life. And Evan Rachel Wood is always a good companion, as a daughter mostly, bringing out the best in his pairs (Holly Hunter in "Thirteen", Mickey Rourke in "The Wrestler", Joan Allen in "The Upside of Anger") and illuminating every scene she's in. It's a very difficult theme to manage, this kind of relationship as the center of a picture. There's the risk of too many scenes with tears and references to the past that might be unnecessary in the first place and indicative secondly. Pay attention to the flashbacks in "King of California" to seek for a precise and effective creation of emotion through the resource. I compliment Cahill and expect more from him next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie (Michael Douglas) is mental. Or was. Unsatisfied with his life and feeling under-awed with his achievements and to some extent his failed marriage he attempts suicide. Miranda (Rachel Wood) is there to save him. Two years later Charlie is released from a mental institution and comes back to live with Miranda, who in the meantime has dropped out of high school and has a McJob on two shifts. However Charlie doesn't seem much saner, than he was before he was admitted. Actually he even seems to have gone even more cuckoo learning Spanish so Miranda won't notice, wandering the streets with a palm GPS and digging in the bushes on the side of a highway. Well at least thats the way it seems...Michael Douglas is the King of California. And frankly I am amazed he wasn't noticed by the Academy for his role. Yes, the movie and its plot isn't fantastic, but that in no way means we are to underestimate how well Douglas portrays his character of a slightly demented senior. Supporting cast is equally fine, although Rachel Wood is really unable to steal her partner's thunder. The movie is extremely entertaining and only slightly pretentious. Loved the way the movie ended - no cop-out or forced ending, albeit I did feel something lacking. If the movie did have some flaws, then I really didn't notice them. I did catch a few plot-holes, but lets leave some space for creative freedom. Nicely shot and adequately told this movie is a recommended watch, even if solely to see a wacky Douglas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but it is a DRAMA, not a comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My main reason for commenting is that this movie is a DRAMA, not a comedy. It is a good movie, well acted, and an interesting story...but it is hard to find humor in the relationship between a father who is institutionally crazy and his daughter who has been left to care for herself long before any child should have to.Michael Douglas does a wonderful job playing the crazy man that his character is, and Evan Rachel Wood plays the teenager forced into adulthood too soon very well. The storyline seems a bit thin at times but the actors more than make up for it. Just don't watch this movie looking for laughs. It really should be listed as a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ReelTime Review. Movie starts. Michael Douglas is in his wacky look mode. Wild long hair and beard. Evan Rachel Wood is working at McDonald's and narrating. It appears her father (Charlie-Sir Mike) is being released from a mental institution and picked up by Wood's character (Miranda). He's talking about naked Chinese guys coming on shore. Probably not all there. They go back to their family house, no mother or wife, that apparently Miranda has kept alive while he was away. I guess he's supposed to be bipolar. Charlie used to a be a minor jazz performer so he gets a visit from an old partner. Miranda goes to work, and Charlie hangs out with his buddy. She's only 15 and drives. She's been fooling everybody with not requiring a guardian too. Okay, we just found out the mom left, and is out of the picture. Miranda even quit high school to work and pay bills. We still don't know what the thrust of the plot is yet, and we're 12 1/2 minutes in. Charlie tells her he needs a ride for a job interview which is completely bogus. Now they are flashing back to Charlie hanging himself and Miranda saves him. Almost a little funny the way it's played. They have eerie, almost Addams family music playing in the background at times when Charlie is taking Miranda all over the place searching for who knows what. Miranda is noticeably frustrated by Charlie's antics. He still hasn't told her what he's up to, and we're nearly 18 minutes in. Now he's using a metal detector in a field looking for something. Lots of funny verbal intercourse between them. Eureka, he's found a coin supposedly from the 17th century. The full plot is finally revealed at 21 min. in. He's been researching an old priest's life (movie is set in California of course), and apparently he thinks this man has buried a treasure somewhere based on the Father's journals. Now, we're on a hunt! This movie is amusing. Michael Douglas is usually really good, and is very funny here.We're at the 25 min. mark, and the search has gotten pretty serious. He using both the historical record and professional level tools like surveying scopes and an actual earth mover! Charlie is like a little child, and Miranda the doting, pragmatic mother. It's a role reversal gig. I don't know what to make out of the mental problem issue. I guess you're not supposed to take it too seriously here. They're making him clever, eccentric, and comical here. In real life, it's not so funny. I guess the Miranda role is pulling us toward that in her narration and dialog. Father Torres is the cat's name that buried the treasure supposedly. We're not really sure if any of this is real, and not some delusional escapade so far. I guess we won't find that out until the end. They are literally going all over digging up ground on private property looking for clues. It reminds you of a smaller version of that Nick Cage gig looking for treasure. This is way more whimsical and and simple. Now we're 36 min., and now surveying in Costco. Pretty funny in-store antics.I am going to stop now. You can make up your mind if you want to find out what happens. Enjoy! PS. Good music and look/feel of CA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Evan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King of California tells the tale of a recently released psychiatric patient who believes that there is treasure buried under suburban California. This film is a quirky alternative to those mega-popular indie flicks being fired at us left right and centre every Oscar season. It manages to incorporate some original (albeit far-fetched) ideas with genuine emotion - a realistic approach to an unconventional story.Although this was marketed as a 'Michael Douglas movie', the film belongs largely to Evan Rachel Wood. Her performance as Miranda, the older-than-her-years 16 year old who has to deal with work, bills and evading social services, is pitch perfect. You sympathise with her as she attempts to keep her father stable by indulging in his oddities.However, Douglas is due praise. His performance as the mentally unstable father is one that truly conveys the frustration of his condition - both to himself and Miranda. The film sustains the mystery, as the audience sees through Miranda's eyes rather than Charlies. Why is he doing this? Is he lying? Will he ever stop searching? The yellow tones of the sand and the wide open landscapes contrast with the corporate logos of McDonald's and Wal-Mart, creating an image of constant change in the area and suggest that the old fashioned ideals and natural environment of the area have been eroded by a capitalist mentality. Overall, I give this film 8 out of 10.See this if you liked: Down in the Valley Little Miss Sunshine</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the vein of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE in which we have a few high-caliber actors playing roles in a small budget film, KING OF California is funny and quirky enough to make for an evening of enjoyable film watching. Although I'd give higher praise to Little Miss Sunshine, King of California deserves its own rays.Michael Douglas got top billing, but it is really Evan Rachel Wood (DOWN IN THE VALLEY) who's the star. We begin and end the film with her, and it is her performance as the teenage Miranda that strikes the strongest chord. Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from Douglas' manic performance; he did it very well, and it was nice to see him in a not-so-serious role. But Wood pulls off an incredibly strong spot alongside Douglas, and she did it effortlessly.We have, however, seen this type of set-up before: reversing the roles of responsible adult to that of the child while the irresponsible one is the parent. It's an old Hollywood plot but one that can be used to great advantage if done right. And relative unknown writer/director Mike Cahill (best known for his visual effects work on the CRITTERCAM TV series) does a fine job in giving us a story of touching simplicity and wacky humor.The story starts out with Miranda (Wood) picking up her father Charlie (Douglas) at a mental hospital during his release. Having lived alone for quite some time, Miranda is a self-motivated woman, keeping up the family home on her own. Her mother (Charlie's ex) also ran away from home during one of Charlie's early mental meltdowns and left Miranda to fend for herself.Hoping her father might be getting better, any possibility of normalcy is swept aside when Charlie immediately starts searching for a lost 17th century treasure supposedly buried in their now booming community of Santa Clarita, California. Grudgingly being dragged along during late night excursions (to check star alignments) and heat-of-the-day golf course spots, Miranda slowly comes to accept that this might be a good way to bond with her delusional father. But then the discovery that the lost treasure is hidden beneath the concrete foundation of a newly installed Costco seems to put a halt to their plans; but Charlie has no intentions of letting anything get in his way.Miranda must come to grips with her father's need to connect with something in his life; something that makes his life have meaning. It is Charlie's (and Miranda's) slow realization that this meaning is each other, and this gives the film all of its successful, emotional heft.Whether or not Charlie found the treasure and gave it to Miranda is irrelevant (as we never see the treasure ...even though it is heavily alluded to). Perhaps the gold wasn't there, perhaps it was. Or maybe ? just maybe ? the gold resides elsewhere, meaning that a connection between father and daughter matters more than any metal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two leads completely save the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy that doesn't have its first laugh out loud moment until it's more than halfway over and then takes an oddly unjustified turn into the maudlin at the end isn't usually going to be that good. Add in a gratingly whimsical soundtrack that makes you feel like someone is constantly tapping you on the forehead with a spatula and you've got something that should suck. Fortunately for King Of California, Michael Douglas and Evan Rachel Wood paddle fast enough as actors to keep the whole movie from going over the edge and down the Niagara Falls of crappy cinema.Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) is a 16 year old girl who lives alone in a big old house, drives a ramshackle station wagon and works at McDonald's. She's all alone because her mother ran off when she was nine and her father Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in a state mental institution for the last 2 years. Charlie gets out and moves back in with Miranda, his bipolar looniness largely intact, and drags his daughter in a treasure hunt for lost Spanish gold from 1624. They wander the countryside, following decoded instructions from an old missionary's journal, eventually winding up breaking into a Costco and digging through the floor. That's where King of California takes a severe right turn out of indulgently amusing and into arbitrary drama with an ending that can be understood in two different ways, though I'm not sure these filmmakers could tell you which was the right way.Everything that's right about this movie flows out of the performances of Douglas and Wood. Charlie is a wonderful character who stumbles along the edge of mental health, never wanting to go over but never wanting to move back to where it's completely safe. Miranda is adorable as a young woman who can't deny her love for her father, no matter how much she might want to. Douglas and Wood are marvelous in crafting a relationship where it's never clear how much Charlie is pulling Miranda after him and how much she's walking arm in arm with him just so she can be close to her spacey dad. With the two of them almost constantly on screen together, King Of California is almost constantly enjoyable.Put two lesser actors in those roles and this film would have crashed hard and burned harder because there's so many things wrong with it. As previously mentioned, there are hardly any jokes for the first 50 minutes of this supposed comedy and not many more attempts at feeble situational humor. And outside of a few short flashbacks, there's also no actual drama in the movie until the very end. The viewer's interest has to entirely float along on the good feelings engendered by Douglas and Wood. And when the script does plunge into dramatics, it's so out of place and awkward it feels like the whole movie swallowed some mood-altering pharmaceutical. Drama needs conflict to survive and there just isn't any here. Charlie is portrayed as kooky but otherwise completely functional. Flashbacks show 9 year old Miranda suffering through a childhood of her mother's abandonment and her father's depression, but grown up Miranda doesn't show a single emotional or psychological scar from the experience. These are fundamentally happy people living fundamentally happy lives, despite all challenges, which is okay but not the stuff of wrenching emotional climaxes.King of California is an almost disaster that is salvaged into watchability by its male and female leads, proving that a movie doesn't have to be good at everything as long as it's great at one thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Charlie's part, well, my own feeling is if you like Michael Douglas, this is a good movie for you. Personally, I can imagine the role played more fittingly by another actor; I'll bet if I read the story on which the movie is based I'd come up with a different way to play Charlie, whether it's Michael Douglas or someone else. I don't know, perhaps it's just I don't see enough subtle touches to bring the humanity of the character out fully. Charlie is too agitated, too intense, all the time?so much so that when he shows his deep love and appreciation for his daughter, these moments don't quite fit; I'd have preferred a less frenetic quality to the man, a more measured and reflective tone.For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008</fullReview>

I knew these two characters and their lives as they are mirror images of friends of mine... they could play the roles. A surprise video that has kept me thinking about it for the last 24 hours...Outstanding and when was this in the theater !!! Michael Douglas takes a role that is a reverse for him and parlays it into a sweet remembrance of all those characters in REAL life that go along looking for their dreams. What a chance for the audience to go along with his journey. Ms. Woods plays the best part of a daughter who wants to keep her fathers dream alive and to come along with him. Her interaction and narrative seems like something that would come from any teenage daughter dealing with a tough life. Can she make it through and will her father be with her. This is hard to tell as the action escalates in each scene to the end. I should have listened to my dad more often... what did I miss?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made and Inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of King of California might not sound all that amazing. It essentially is a modern, quirky treasure hunt with Michael Douglas. Some critics say that it doesn't know what it wants to be, which doesn't apply at all here. It's a fairly solid drama with some light comedy mixed in at times. Since Douglas plays someone who isn't entirely mentally stable, it might be confused for the movie trying to be more of a comedy. All of that is beside the point as it all works as you're watching it and you'll be far too entertained to think about what it may or may not be trying to be.Douglas clearly demonstrates that he still has some great acting left in his career as he adds a very commendable performance from King of California to his list. Evan Rachel Wood is also great as his daughter. The two leads really work well together and give the movie a rather unique feel as the film progresses. The movie as a whole also looks visually impressive. As for the screenplay, it gets the job done, without doing having anything too stupid happen, even though there were some times when they could have easily ruined it.Overall this is a very solid effort, with some nice direction, from a first time director and is definitely worth seeing. The performances and the originality of the plot alone are reason enough to give this movie a chance. There were however 1 or maybe 2 scenes that could have been done differently to keep up with the freshness and stature of the rest of the film. But that is far from anything to bring down this inspirational and maybe even emotional picture. King of California has plenty to like about it and is one of those overlooked gems that is bound to leave you satisfied. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does one show love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) is a 17 year old girl who for the past two years has lived on her own. Her mother abandoned her when she was a little girl while her father, Charlie (Michael Douglas), found himself in a mental hospital. Working at McDonalds just to survive has made Miranda more mature and a bit more tougher than most other girls her age. It's a lonely life but one she has become used to.That is until Charlie is released from the hospital and ends up back with Miranda. What happens next is the story of how an estranged father sees the world in his own unique way but also how he attempts to show love to the only child that he has. In return his daughter learns to understand a father who meant well but has only made their lives more difficult for the both of them. King of California can easily be described as a comedy/adventure movie and in many ways it actually is both of these. However there is a greater story being told which is how Charlie, a failure in almost every way, tries to reach out to the daughter who he doesn't really know anymore. In return Miranda has to learn that her father, for better or worse, is who he is and she must accept his quirks if she is to understand him.The quest for missing Spanish Gold, which is found underneath a Costco of all places, serves as the means to bring the two closer together. 17th century California, filled with Native Americans and wide open spaces, shows little resemblance to 21st century California which is now filled with endless suburbs, highways, and other such modern day creations. Charlie drags Miranda from location to location and slowly ends up convincing her, to some degree, that perhaps there actually is gold to be found somewhere. Miranda discovers that she does want to believe in her father but perhaps more of a need for him to be right at least once in his life. She is a hesitant follower but eventually sees the search as a way to understand a man she doesn't really know.The gold is found but that's not the real conclusion for either Charlie or Miranda. Charlie explains that the whole search was made for Miranda's sake. In that sense Charlie succeeds in showing love to the daughter that he had in effect abandoned long ago as well as giving her a life that she otherwise never would have had. Miranda in return finally realizes that she does love her father and that he was right about at least one thing in his life. (Well, two if you include the naked swimming Chinese men he speaks of earlier in the movie.) If there is a complaint to be made of King of California it's that it seems to move much too fast. There is a lot left out in terms of what the relationship was between Miranda and her mother and how his wife's leaving could have affected Charlie's mental state. There are hints of Charlie's past adventures but we never really hear of them and how they also could have affected him. This doesn't ruin the movie but a better explanation could have given more to the plot and the characters.A moving story about how love finds even the strangest way to reveal itself, King of California is a good movie that shows how two very distant people can still be drawn together.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty silly and contrived, but it's a cute little film that's a lot of fun. Michael Douglas and Evan Rachel Wood have great chemistry on screen and it feels like they really are father and daughter. The story is really contrived and that gets pretty bothersome at times, but it's never too overwhelming. It's still easy to relax and enjoy the story; entertaining, for sure. There's also a commentary on consumerism and the lack of ambition in modern society that I thought was really well done. So overall it's a good adventure film with two very good, cute performances. Michael Douglas is at his best since Wonder Boys and I think it's fair to say it's Evan Rachel Wood's second best performance of her career.</fullReview>

Michael Douglas play excellent,as a crazy person. But its not enough to save the film. It need more meat on the bone to be really entertaining,some in her has described it as a father and daughter movie drama.And In hind sight I think it might have started out that way on paper.

		<shortDescription>Getting Back on the Old Bi-Polar Pony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"But look at the world..." says Charlie in reply to his daughter Miranda's accusation that he takes nothing seriously and views the world as existing simply for his amusement, in Mike Cahill's lyrical masterpiece "King of California". The bi-polar Charlie is played by Michael Douglas and sixteen-year-old Miranda by Evan Rachel Wood. The story is told from the put-upon Miranda's point-of-view and supplemented with both her voice-over narration and the occasional flashback.In the flashbacks a younger Miranda is convincingly played by a pre -"Sonny with a Chance" Allisyn Ashley Arm. Arm was not just an excellent physical match for Wood, but a stylistic one as well; the two actresses share a non-verbal acting style, gently teasing their portrayal of a character who does a whole lot of on-camera processing of her father's often baffling and exasperating antics. In several flashbacks single parent Charlie sends his nine-year-old daughter to school with a diorama of a California mission (presumably the one in San Fernando) they just constructed, littered with "the bodies of the Chumash Indians, who died of Syphilis and Influenza, infected by the missionaries". The film's most visually compelling sequence is nine-year-old Miranda striding home hurt and angry after the diorama has landed her in trouble at school, betrayed by her father's poor judgement.Charlie is obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their Santa Clarita Valley house. Cahill's screenplay borrows from "The Hours"; as Miranda reads the Torres journal in voice-over, she and Charlie retrace the path of his expedition across the valley in search of the treasure he buried. There is a political element to the story in the juxtaposing of descriptions of old California with images of the suburban sprawl that has obliterated much of the state's history. This is further illustrated by Miranda's adaptive qualities and Charlie's stubborn refusal to adapt; it is the only significant difference between the two characters and introduces a lot of poignancy into the story because the quality they admire the most in each other is the one they do not share.For Miranda, having Charlie as a father is a Southern California version of "Alice and Wonderland". Her self-reliant character is positioned midway between Alice and young heroine Jeliza-Rose in Terry Gilliam's Tideland (2005). And she shares many of their virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. While she shares Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical situations they encounter in their respective wonderlands, she is considerably more adaptable. Alice was a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expected a certain standard of behavior, while Miranda and Jeliza Rose are skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.Physically Wood has never looked better, like Audrey Hepburn she is more dazzling with minimal makeup and everyday fashions - including a McDonald's uniform. She simply glows in the final sequence's extreme close-ups, standing on a bluff above the beach as she processes the predicted illegal landing of a group of Chinese boat people. And in this moment she totally sells the story, which at its core is simply the story of a father and daughter with a unqualified love for each other.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright first off i don't fall for fairy tales or adventure or fantasy movies i barely dig super hero ones, but this movie has very little fantasy some fairy powder but lots of adventure and that was just the greatest mix ever!So talking a little bit about the characters, that by the way cast was good , small and great! Alright Evan wood passing by a 15 yr old!? ill really dig on that, she has a great skin, innocent look thou she was by the time married, or about to, to Marilyn Manson thou she is on her 20s by the time she made the movie she definitely filled the role of a overgrown mature teenage girl, that honestly there is lots of reality about kids that have to grow up at such young age while being so innocent still. Michael Douglas let me say that i liked this guy so much better than many other movies he goes just right with mad, crazy, obsessed roles.Now to the movie, well i cant tell u how many times i was thrilled on the movie, it had his ups and downs his sad and happy times, i think that that the writing was great fro the director not being out there, he directed as well which makes you get all that, that the director wants you to get! All that fantasy, all those indirect moments that you need to catch and think about after wards. The story, i seen this before, u know the lost treasure, the buried box, the dead man chest type of movie, but this one made get so close to the daughter that i don't even have! the whole lets go and dig for gold n California was just what i needed to wake up next morning and go look for 20 geocaches!! Anyways, the bad... well there was lots of times where Mexican music was played, so my thoughts were either the people in charge of the music don't know that mariachi has nothing to do with Spain or they just thou since its in California.. well the heck with it. The irony of the movie was over the top! but it was good it had a lot of happy moments that made up for it! uhm i read that the budget for this movie was 10million and i saw that the box office made a little bit over 1 million!! now thats a failure but honestly i think all it missed was advertising because i never saw any advertising about the movie around that time, besides your casual poster at the movie theater but, see lil miss sunshine or where the wild things are have a similar mojo to this movie and they did so much better and guess why?? because even though they had limited amount of audience, they had way more advertising than this.I hope we can see more stuff like this from mike cahill u did great job man!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underdeveloped 2-Man Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie (Douglas) is released from a mental hospital and returns to his home to live with his daughter, Miranda, (Wood) who had been comfortably supporting herself while he was away. And, Charlie has a plan to find the treasure Father Torres hid in the 1600s. Miranda is no longer comfortable. Normally, I run to a Michael Douglas movie and I ran to this one too, but now that I have seen it I wonder what all the running was about. There is something very wrong in this movie and I am not sure I know what it is. The narration by Miranda didn't bother me. It filled in gaps. Some of the narration was almost funny. The best line was by Miranda and went something like this: I never felt comfortable when he was around. I always felt something was about to happen. The movie shows that she did love her father, questionable as he was, but she looked after him like a mother would watch her child running close to sharp cornered tables. I, too, felt something was about to happen except it never did. Charlie was running around like a drunken sailor and seemingly lined up with pointy edged tables but his head never veered into those edges. He just kept running from one point on the map to another one to find that treasure. Miranda was frustrated and so was I.I just figured out what is wrong with this movie. It was a 2-man act: Charlie and Miranda. It needed to be more than that, more interaction with others, more dialogue, There was some, but not enough for me. Charlie bounced around so much it was hard to like him despite a twinkle in his eye and his easy-going constitution. He was incomplete as was the movie. I felt for Miranda, but not Charlie. The character Douglas played couldn't sustain a movie lead. He was like a monkey running from one found banana to another. We liked Charlie but we weren't sure what he liked and yes, we were wary of him too. We wanted Charlie to be more of a human soul, to be somewhat normal. Well, that wasn't going to happen and we were shut out. But, "somewhat normal" could have worked, too, in looking for the treasure. Audiences like it when the characters look for a treasure. Here we didn't care if it was found. The movie told us the journey was more important than the destination. Did the movie save itself? I think so even with the poor ending. Okay, really bad ending. But, the next time I will walk, not run, to a Michael Douglas movie, maybe read the box next time, ask a few friends, read some reviews?..slow walking the whole time. Violence:No; Sex: No; Nudity:No; Language: Yes and I didn't see any need for it in this "comedy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it, Michael Douglas amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i love this movie, I saw it without ever knowing what is about, without reading synopsis, nothing, just the poster, and Mr Douglas characterization caught my attention.The story is very simple (looking for a treasure) but very "loveable" so is Douglas character, which it's an outstanding work of Douglas.It's a solid and correct script with very nice characters and situations, gags, and arcs.Also it "look" nice, a lot of nice exteriors, and beautiful music.On top of that, very interesting the "pararelism" with the story and the story of Father Thomas, nice work there.Love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Predictable Movie But Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed King of California with Michael Douglas. It was exactly what I thought it was from the trailer and actually was a little disappointed that all the comedic parts are ruined in the trailer. Michael Douglas plays an old hippie who has done too much acid. He goes to a hospital for a couple years and then is released. His daughter enters the plot. She is very cute and the father daughter family part of the plot is nice. I just think he's a funny old stoner like when they creep up to the Costco and Michael Douglas says "I'm Getting Good Vibes Here". And Then the alarm goes off. Now if you have not seen the trailer it wrecks that part in the plot so I hope I didn't ruin the movie for anyone. This is a very simple plot film. It's a treasure hunt movie that is just silly. Very low budget and not as exciting as when Michael Douglas was younger and did col movies like Romancing The Stone circa 1980's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"California Dreaming": Does it lead to that pot of gold???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With each film she makes, Evan Rachel Wood just becomes better and better as an Actor and in KING OF California her outstanding role in the film carries it forward with a remarkable performance from Michael Douglas in a character role that is beyond belief. Act one is a tad slow in developing the story, and it is Wood who makes you want to find out what may happen to her father, Douglas. The fight against growth in suburbia is amply shown on the screen of the "over development" in So Cal and the house amongst the track homes is really a brilliant sub story in itself. However, with watching Douglas pursue his wild dreams and what happens at the end of the film, "once and again", it is the marvelous acting of Wood which makes California a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad pretext for a plot. This movie is yet another which badly portrays mental illness, both in the plot and in the acting. It makes light of those who suffer from bipolar disorder, as thought it were merely a personality quirk or eccentricity, rather than a serious brain disorder that can literally kill people or ruin their lives and wreak havoc on their families. This movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality that I can think of. Other than if you're doing a study of how Hollywood perpetuates outdated myths about mental illness and continues to take advantage and ridicule the mentally ill - the last segment of population which apparently it is OK to mock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbed man creates his own world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie(Michael Douglas)is a very disturbed soul getting his release after several years in a mental facility. He is sent home to his estranged teenage daughter, Miranda(Evan Rachel Wood). Charlie is of course still a bit disjointed mentally and his lack of caring of other's lives puts his relationship with Miranda in dire straits. Charlie is convinced that long-lost Spanish gold is buried beneath a local pet shop. The very skeptical Miranda ends up giving in to her father and aids in his hopes of attaining his last shot at reaching one of his dreams. Is there really Spanish treasure to be had? Douglas does put effort in his portrayal, but it is Wood who is the most impressive. Also in the cast: Willis Burks II, Laura Kachergus, Kathleen Wilhoite and Paul Lieber.</fullReview>
