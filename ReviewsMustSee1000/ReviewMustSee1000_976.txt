		<shortDescription>Finally, we're rolling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first heard about "Zift" some months before it was released and I couldn't believe what I had just heard and then I watched the trailer and I couldn't believe what I saw and when I finally saw the film back in early October I remember leaving the theatre with a big grin on my face, thinking how I just saw something I thought would never happen. Wonderful so very wonderful, I don't know if it can revive Bulgarian cinema, I think it's too far gone already, but I'll be definitely following Javor Gardev's career from this point on. The man shows promise as a director who thinks outside the box. Compared to that meatwagon of stale films that get made here from time to time, Zift is revolutionary in it's visual style, narrative and plot.Opening with a reference to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, "Zift" is the story of a man nicknamed Moth, no real name is ever mentioned. Right now Moth is a prisoner and it's the 1960s which in Bulgaria meant hardcore Communist regime, Moth was in prison before that regime came to power, but that's beside the point for now. What matters is that he's getting released today and he's all to keen in getting as far away as possible, but not before paying last respect to some prison guard he didn't really like. Result, Moth gets punched, knocked down, guards throw him out of the prison, then a car with some military officer comes along and they take Moth to some crummy place and they start torturing him. Apparently they are looking for some diamond... and it's going to be one hell of a long day for Moth and that's all I'm going to say about the story.From the start "Zift" tells you how this is going to play out, I don't mean that it's predictable or anything, what I'm talking about is style. The dialogue, the characters, the film has a quirky pitch black sense of humor, like the zift Moth likes chewing, it's not something that can appeal to everyone, and it might seem vulgar or profane or whatever, but it has it's lyrical value, it just adds up. Every story told by a character, however humorous or shallow it might seem, has it's own kind of wisdom to it, though not necessarily connected to the storyline. The film feels both distinctly western and distinctly Bulgarian, or Balkan to be more general, because it uses a storyline similar to that of the American Pulp novels (Zift itself is an adaptation of a pulp novel), film noirs and then the character stereotypes (femme fatales, anti hero protagonist) and all these elements get mixed together with Bulgarian culture and stereotypes, resulting in what I dare say, a quite original and refreshing piece of cinematic wonder.Visually speaking "Zift" is all high contrast black and white goodness, a tasty treat for anyone who values the classic two color scheme. Essential for it's narrative structure is a series of flashbacks explaining, character relationships and background stories and depending on the flashback (a 1930s something maybe, 1940s, or modern time in the film's time frame 1960s) we get a scene shot on different film. So for example the 1960s part of the film is shot on 35mm while the earliest on 8mm, thus giving "Zift" a substantially different look for each time segment. I have to mention something about the acting and while I liked Zahary Bahalov as Moth, he played him with a lot of bravado, my hat goes down to the supporting cast, including the great Djoko Rosic as a priest who consoles Moth, and a whole lot of other actors who gave the film a strong energy boost.And while it does have its own share of flaws(the ending felt rushed) and it might seems as if it's going nowhere, and some scenes might seem pointless to the overall plot, Zift is, nevertheless, high quality entertainment, an example in genre film-making, stylish and sharp-edged. The least to say about Javor Gardev's debut is that it's an opening to a promising career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High on Literary and Artistic Value, but low on Visual and Thematic Value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't have an Oscar nomination(for the best foreign language award) this year, still Zift is a crowning and epoch making epic movie for Bulgaria and Eastern/North-Eastern Europe. Hence, in the years ahead this movie will be mentioned often for its contemporary style, modern cinema language and creative editing.Centering on a criminal, nicknamed as "Moth", the story is taken from a novel and is adapted to screenplay from its own novelist. Director Javor Gardev features Moth being a self-respecting and chivalrous Bulgarian, reflecting the character of his country under Communism. As such from the literary perspective, personification has applied to Bulgaria. Despite all of his relatives and friends leaving him alone, and his wife wounding his pride; he has never held his head down.Not only the past of his country, the writer also reflects the present and the future of Bulgaria within the same literary perspective in a dark utopia, or a neo-noir(film-noir). The screenplay of Zift is very focused and detail-oriented on a simple storyline. The concept of the whole storyline is the sum of Moth's escape to freedom, his short-term memories, the stories he heard from his friends, how he is losing his last hope and how he dies. There we can realize obviously that the main purpose of the movie is not to tell, but is to impress. Director Gardev leaked impacts from Fellini's, Emir Kusturica's and Danny Boyle's cinematic methods. On the other hand, I don't include Frank Miller in this list; since Sin City and Zift has nothing in common but the cinematography. On the level of artistic value, Zift has more value than its comparisons.Even though it's resembling several industrial box-office hits, the screenplay is truly original; considering that a novel writer has prepared the whole script from his own adaptation, you will see the total commitment of creating this epic by the production crew. There are scenes of violence, nudity, sexuality, perversity, immorality and enormity. Viewer discretion is strongly advised. It's only suitable for mature viewers and minor groups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time where brutality in movies only count when you see tons of blood, sex only count when it looks like porn and the story only count when there are 20 story switches with three parallel stories in it, the Bulgarian cinema brought us a movie which have not any of this in it and although it is ten times better.I am finished five minutes ago watching this movie. And there is no way for me to describe the reason why i give that flick a ten.Not one minute of that movie is boring, nothing in it is hyperbolical. Its lyrical without being intellectual.Just watch it. You will not regret any minute of you're live that you will have spended for watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening of the film is hilarious. A man finds out his wife is cheating on him and he uses the septic truck he operates, loaded with three tons of waste, to get even. I don't know what it has to do with the story, but it was funny. There were a lot of funny stories throughout the film.The film moves from there to a prison where Moth (Zahary Baharov) is about to be released after serving time for a crime he did not commit. He enters a world he doesn't know as the Communists are now in power.The film is brilliant in a sharp black and white, which is perfect as it is neo-noir. At the same time, it is a Socialist Art (Sots Art) film, which parodies the Soviet Realism with reverential depictions of workers, peasants living happily in their communes. The shower scene in the prison was particularly funny.It was confusing when he is released from prison and ends up in another one immediately, but in flashbacks we see Moth with his wife Ada (Tanya Ilieva) and partner-in-crime Slug (Vladimir Penev), who is now an official in the new prison, and is looking for a diamond they stole years earlier.He escapes, but not before he is poisoned. He manages to find Ada before he is to die. Things get a little surreal, and weird from here, but they go after the diamond. What happens next was satisfying and sad.There were other great performances: Mihail Mutafov as Van Wurst-the Eye and Djoko Rosic as the priest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant dark comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" Zift"is a stunning surprise that came from Bulgaria. Black and white noir, dark comedy with a brilliant camera work and lighting. It makes you nostalgic for the old pre-color days, when the directors had to be extra creative, and shadows warmed your heart more than flames ever could. The incredible parody spots wicked sense of humor, especially with the fake Russian songs and surprisingly quite a few homo-erotic images. War and weapons usually get coupled with phallic symbols. Eros and Thanatos in it purest form. It is an immense pleasure to encounter such talented and smart artists, these days of simplicity and proud lack of novelty.Can we have some more, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Bulgarian film ever in terms of professionalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I am not a fan of Bulgarian cinema even though I am a Bulgarian myself. All the films I have seen until this point were very disappointing and could only be compared between themselves because films outside Bulgaria had always stood above in terms of cinematography, acting,Direction, Budget etc. Of course many would say this is not true, films during socialism period were many more and much better in terms of quality. While this is true that certainly does not make them foreign standard. The acting is more like theatrical than cinematic and the picture quality has more white spots on it than mount Everest, not to even mention the Sound. Cinema after 1990s had not improved much. I do not remember when I heard about Zift, I think I found it on IMDb, so I decided to check out the Trailer. I was blown away, for the first time in my life I was so excited about seeing a Bulgarian film. Yes It did took me a while since I live in the UK but I did saw it yesterday.After seeing it I felt depressed and had mixed feelings about it.I am going to analyse the film in positives and negatives. Positives: - First Bulgarian neo-noir film - First Bulgarian film successfully presents the Thriller and Action elements in genre. - Very Good acting, especially from the Zahary Baharov and Djoko Rosic - First Bulgarian film to use cgi, I know this could be a negative but in this case it is used very well. - Monologue is absolutely outstanding in some parts. - Unlike most recent Bulgarian films this one is not set around just one location. - For its small Budget, a very good recreation of 1960s Sofia. - Awesome Soundtrack - Good Humor in places. Negatives: - Too short, 85 minutes felt too short to fully achieve its potential. - Many unnecessary scenes involving downgrade humanity and dialogue which focus on 'toilet humour' - Too much nudity, this is something which all Bulgarian films suffer from but this one takes it on another level.(This may not be a negative to all but I generally do not like too much nudity, I believe there is different films for that purpose.)Overall I believe the positives overcome the negatives and In conclusion I must say I liked Zift even though by no means its a masterpiece. It is very likely to be enjoyed by people who are fans of films like, Trainspotting, Irreversible, Requiem for a Dream, The Cook the Thief His Wife &amp; Her Lover and Tarantino's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, profane, poignant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This strange, lyrical semi-gangster movie reminded me of "El Topo" and "Eraserhead" in the way it stumbles with deceptive carelessness through its plot. Smalltime thief "Moth", who's lost his youth imprisoned for a murder he didn't commit, is released hoping to jump a freighter to the tropics. Fate and his past intervene."Zift" bows to film-noir classics like "Gilda" and "DOA", even lifting plot elements, but this little gem uses their themes only as point of departure, as it does references to "Candide": If all is best in the best possible worlds, all is worst in the worst.And Soviet-era Bulgaria director Gardev depicts is just that - filthy, casually brutal and airlessly detached. Its denizens gossip via dirty jokes and debase themselves with joyful abandon. It's bracing to see such a depiction, since the "Marxist experiment" of Russia and Eastern Europe is almost sentimentally beheld in most Western media ('course, we didn't live the ugliness of the "paradise"). And a glimmer of humanity and soul in a Christian church surely would keep "Zift" off fashionably dogmatic PBS.The world of the Moth is as black and spongy as the tar he loves to chew - the "zift" of the title. But there is within it laughter and truth. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp black and white photography can't save this muddled effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this at the Sydney Film Festival and was a little disappointed. Seemed to be a lot of hype surrounding this. Really liked the black and white photography and had high hopes after a nice opening. Unfortunately the movie lost me in the middle and never quite recovered.I'd have to agree with one of the earlier posts. I think Gardev has definitely borrowed from other films and directors. Apart from that Todorov's screenplay doesn't quite work for me but I would love to read the book (the English translation is released next year). I found the little stories and anecdotes from minor characters to be intrusive and tiresome after a while and I don't know if the voice-over was that effective.Thought the acting was fine and there were some amusing moments but overall I can't work out if this was supposed to be a thriller or black comedy, heist flick, noir potboiler or a bit of all of these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the great Bulgarian films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this film entirely by accident and saw it in French translation first, a version which is simply wonderful. The translation is most enjoyable and I regret that the translation team or translator working on this is not mentioned in the credits for they deserve much praise! The plays on words and the depth of the dialogs have been kept in their entirety. There are two things that strike me about this film. The Shakespearean dimension of it comes first. Full of primary symbolism, Zift is a tragedy, which takes place on one single night. At the same time, it is a tragedy replete with irony, with deep satire. It carries something undefinable that does not drive you to tears but, on the contrary, brings a smile to your face. The gravediggers, the shots of bodily waste, the farting, the poisons and Romeo-and-Juliettesque plot, transformed into a tragical farce of betrayal via the insect imagery are elements that any student of Anglo-Saxon literature can easily recognize. The film contains countless numbers of weirdos, as if the dregs of all humankind have been gathered there to show ugliness in all its sublime beauty. This is, in fact, part of what impressed me on the second place - the sheer beauty of the photography. It is not black and white out of mere empty claims to artistry. It is black and white because it has been purged of everything that is superfluous. Black and white are highly contrasted, the gray is present minimally. On the whole, a very beautiful, very intelligent film. Very well-written, ably directed and shot. A film that deserves attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has given back to me the hope that Bulgarian cinema is going upward! Tha last few bg titles that i've seen all seemed to have a problem - they were weird (in terms of plot, acting, locations, camera angles). And just because a movie is tragic, strange, original and twisted doesn't mean it's good. Yes, maybe it can move you. Maybe. Maybe one can admit that the movie is totally genuine. But that still doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. Something is just missing for the movie to be enjoyable and moving while you're in the theater and mind blowing when you get out and think it over. The missing parts probably are the perfect storyline of Zift, the look of Zift, the action of Zift, the soundtrack of Zift, the grotesque humor of Zift! That's what makes the film of Yavor Gardev so successful - perfection itself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer first and thought it's great but it surely wasn't the reason took me to the cinema.I know Yavor Gardev is absolutely brilliant theater director and just couldn't wait to see his film debut. I like the movie is black and white, it's different from the usual American commercial rubbish. I love to see Snezhina Petrova even in that small bit, she is incredible...just adore her way of expression! I think Zahary Baharov is the right choice for the leading role, I was impressed by his voice-very emotional and touching. Have to admit I didn't understand some parts of the movie 'cause it's just full with a lot of symbols, difficult to catch all of them. The film is not perfect but it's a sign someone is trying to create something really good and competitive.I go to the cinema once in a blue moon but this time I went to see Zift for a special reason- to support the Bulgarian cinematography. And I'd like to do it again....sure I will and expecting a new film from Yavor Gardev /I'm really proud with his success in Russia/.Regards :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not often does a European or foreign film captures your attention as you sit to watch it. Here is one which will do just that. The Black and White movie later transferred to the big screen by Vladislav Todorov was superbly directed by director Javor Gardev. The gut wrenching story develops in an isolated dank, dark, brutal, Bulgarian Prison where our hero " Zift " (Zahary Baharov) otherwise known as 'The Moth' has just been granted early Parole. The movie depicts his early years, which includes his school, girlfriend, Ada (Tanya Ilieva) and a short-lived life of crime. Falsley imprisoned for his part in a murder-robbery gone bad, he insists he is innocent. Just when the audience begins to believe Moth only wants to leave the country and journey to the tropics, they are introduced to 'Slug' (Vladimir Penev) a brutal, sadistic partner who plans' on trailing Moth in a desperate search for a mysterious diamond said to have been stolen during the murder/robbery. The stark, bloody, black and white images, along with the director's ability to scatter mayhem and death through the dark rainy streets of Bulgaria offers a realistic movie which is direct, honest and as for this reviewer, a magnificent Classic of the first magnitude. Superior acting. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But unfortunately not that fleshed out. Story-wise there is not that much there. And I should have been warned. When the cover states things like a "cross between Tarantino ..." and another statement that states, that this movie might be a contender for an "Oscar for best foreign movie" ... you know something is wrong. You just don't know what that might be. But visually this is a (black/white) treat.It's just a shame, that the story doesn't get that much attention. It's pretty incoherent, not to mention that even the most beautiful cinematography (metaphors) are not working if their sole purpose is to confuse the viewer and not deliver any kind of direct link to what we are seeing. Of course you could argue that I didn't get all the references and that might be true. But this still aims higher than it actually can reach. So while not a bad movie at all, there is still quite a few things to improve with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this innovative black and white noir thriller, I kept thinking that Frank Miller must have written it, so perfectly does it fit the sensibility of his Sin City comic book series. Innovative, not exactly original: one can indeed detect the influence of any number of famous noir flicks, most notably D.O.A. But it's executed so perfectly that I wouldn't want to complain. My wife said that the film was rich in allusions to Bulgarian life and culture which went right past me. She is definitely not a genre fan but she really liked this movie.

		<fullReview>In fact, a sociological research can be done about Bulgaria along those pages here. Some people say "it is the worst movie ever" and give it 1 star, some say it is "the best Bulgarian movie" and give it 8-10 stars. Well, the truth is somewhere in between. (I hate that "this movie is horrible" people say "too much profanity"... what? This movie is FAR LESS profane than ANY meeting in Bulgaria, where men are present...)-The acting... is bad. Or, there is not any. Only Moth is kinda okay, the rest is in the mediocre-horrible range (Ada being the bottom).-Characters... are horrible. Firstly, NOBODY swears... Undertakers, drunkards, military people, prisoners... WHAT? I don't know if non-balkan guys know how is it here, but HELL, even most intelligent of our guys swear like hell... when you listen to angry security guard for example, you can laugh your ass from the swears you will hear... In this movie- "f!ck, sh!t". Hell, Americans swear that way, bulgarians... DON'T. Besides, all characters speak in PERFECT Bulgarian, which makes them totally frigid and unrealistic (imagine a movie about a ghetto, where all black guys talk like Barrack Obama). -The storyline- is utterly messed at the end. The motives of some major characters remain unclear when the lights are up. -The Balkan humor- is missing and that is just insane. All we have to offer IS THAT, not make some high-budget movie rip-offs- because they won't work. -The dialogue- is most of the time bad. So is the narrator text- yeah, it is from a book... SO WHAT? There are bad books too- and this one is one of them. -The scene when they run at the women public bath and there are numerous naked women- is POINTLESS. I don't hold anything against nudity, but I HATE pointless nudity. Yeah, with so much "bads", someone will ask where are the "goods". Well, there are some. The movie is nicely shot, from my point of view- this is the big +. There were some nice moments too. But that's about it. Yes, the dialogue, story, acting weren't insanely bad, they weren't Epic/Disaster movie bad, they just weren't any good. I would give that movie 3 or 4 for the effort- it is not so bad to deserve 1, but it ain't deserving 8-10 too... not by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a (good) bad movie which is still trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My on my, where to start with... First of all, I really truly madly deeply wanted to like this movie. It couldn't be otherwise because prior to the premiere there was such a big media invasion on all the TV and radio stations and Javor Gardev was flowing from water and gas pipes telling us how f.cking great this movie is. So I went and paid 5 euro for the ticket (this is about 1/20th of the minimal month salary here). Then I entered the cold and ugly, almost socialistic dirty theater and tuned myself for watching a masterpiece. Then I was blown away. But not with something great. Literally the first words shows how poor in soul the scriptwriter and the director were. It starts with showing feces, stupidity, foul language, genitals and unusual sex scenes like some B-movie from the 80's. The script is inevitably bad, even for a post soc Bulgarian movie, with plot holes larger than black hole in the Universe and wooden and totally meaningless lines filled with pretentious philosophical stereotypes. All the time I was getting into the impression I was watching someone's training work. Well, not really. There are so many snitches from well known movies and directors that I can't really count all of them. As if Gardev was getting into Tarantino's mind (but without having all the money) and was assembling a movie from the small pieces of all the movies he had been watching.Some of them include: - Main idea snatched from "Crank" (the main character is poisoned and ought to die in one night, so the whole action takes one night)- Script snatched from "Snatch" (the run for the (black) diamond and other ideas) - Slow motion and other moves from "Trainspotting" - Scenes taken directly from "Pulp Fiction" (the torture scene with Bruce Willis at the basement) - Scenes taken directly from "Sin City" (for example when Bruce Willis falls on the board) - Script snatched from "Revolver" (the main character ought to die in several hours so he starts giving a sh*t about everything) - Scenes snitched from the TV movie "Statskiy Sovetnik" (The State Counsellor) at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450158/ - the run in the women's bathroom and other scenes Then it becomes even funnier. There are two scenes snitched directly from soc classic series here in Bulgaria (I am sure you have never heard of them, but count on my words, it was truly classic) - "Na vseki kilometar" (At each kilometer) at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238439/, I used to notice two entirely copied scenes - the chasing in the Perlova River's channel, the tramway pioneer's sequence... All in all, I must say that using a foul language coupled with totally unbelievable, grotesque and inane characters does NOT a great movie made. Besides, the actor's play was bad to mediocre, with the only two noticeable exceptions - the main character Moth and Djoko Rossich, who is well known cinema professional. This is something most new Bulgarian movies suffer with - no one of the good theatrical actors have any experience with cinema, and I am constantly under impression I am watching TV version of the theatrical play. The lead female character was past all belief bad. Having really good actresses here I can't really explain why non-professional was ever cast. Her eroticism was non-existent. Even the sex scene at the end was flat and empty. At the very predictable end I was empty. I know that the movie has to have some double or hidden meaning, but the people in the audience doesn't seem to have caught it. BTW, from about 50 people in the theater I was one of the dozen ones to watch the movie till the end. And that's saying something. This is soctrash movie with no value so I don't recommend anyone watching it.</fullReview>

Since I hate plagiarism, I'll post it:HOW TO STEAL ZIFTFirst: We steal the plot from the movie "Crank" with Jason Statham (2006)!Second: We steal style from the soundtrack of Kill BillThird: We steal a dozen of a military jokes !Fourth: We steal Felini's characters!Fifth: We steal Kusturitsa's background!Sixth: We steal the Phillip Marlowe's monologues, created decades earlier from the great writer Raymond Chandler!Seventh: We steal episodes from about at least 10-12 worldwide known movies, I don't have spare time enough to count the details!..... we mix all the things on black and white and voil?! We get worldwide applause and we amaze the already berserk Hollywood:((( At least this is the info taken from our "objective" press (excuse me)!What the heck are we left with? We can "steal" the same movie at some torrent site and to at least know that we're not in for it financially from all this SH*T! We steal, we watch, we swear and we delete the movie afterward. At least if we have the opinion of our own.The movie "Zift" is super pitiful... at my personal estimation! I don't give a sh*t about the competent jury, about mass advertisement and box office records in Bulgaria's standards! The mere tries for the movie to look like Metallica's video clip doesn't save the production at all. It is just that every minute of this movie you're guessing what exactly movie you were watching the same thing in and you try to guess the title :((( We have good level of actor's play, that's only positive thing, WITH THE EXCEPTION of Tanya Ilieva, who pushes lines with the power of expression of the green euglene in the non-fertile age. At least her tits are nice :))) Aaaa! And this "Nosferatu" from the Bulgarian Big Brother 4... Tzvetan! He shows as a mockery with mustache, obviously made out of plastic tape.What we have at the end of the long run: that the "Modern Bulgarian Cinema" is not Modern, is not Bulgarian and is not cinema at all :((( Not to mention that chewing asphalt in the years when chewing gum Ideal was becoming cult, is true perversion!I don't like this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but a CLICHÉ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" Zift" is not a film just a horrible cliché . This a deadly born and terrible cliché. What if they have emptied the genre of no ire to pour the cliché's of communism? So miserably and disgusting and in the same time simple and dumb dedicated for idiots. It questions both sentiments and the feeling of endurance to this horrible mixture one can only zap if it was on TV. If it could surprise anyone it would be for it's appalling lack of measurement. The authors use the socialist era as a background of their demonstration of bad taste and gay games based on excrement's and bathroom images. To quote a wonderful Bulgarian film critic Kulezich in a famous newspaper "the authors have grabbed the WC plate in order to serve us disgusting a fraud deprived of everything but their extreme and infinity ambitions. The clichés cover all fields and it is simply a useless feature I can only advise and comment stay away otherwise you'll get stinky and covered with dirt almost fiscally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No hope for the BG cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a damn month where everybody in Bulgaria were saying "hey, did you watch Zift?! It's an awesome movie and it's great and it's the best BG movie ever!". Well, at last I decided to go and see it, although I had my hope in the BG cinematography long lost. I entered the ugly theater and took my good place in the middle. And damn it, the trailer says it all - "Pineapple peels and sh*ts". That's the best thing in this movie. A banal screenplay, incredibly bad acting, phrases that make you wanna kick someone's head and again this damn post-communist element. You know, all the Bulgarian movies have it.So better go and watch some stupid low-budget Hollywood movie instead of this crap. At least you could see some better acting and more than 2 colors. Yeah, black &amp; white is banal, especially when it's used without a specific reason. It might be a really nice effect (see "Pi") and it might annoy you so much that you just decide to leave the damn theater half an hour before the predictable end.Again, about the acting. Yes, it's bad. Yes, most of the actors had never played before. And yes, I can see that clearly.And hell yes, I paid $2 for that crap but I wouldn't even give 2 stotinki (around 1 cent) to watch this wannabe-a-good-Bulgarian-movie. Although some Bulgarian pseudo-patriots (this means almost all Bulgarians) might like it.In the end, the good thing. Congratulations to the director - very good and professional job! Unfortunately the good directing is not equal to a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black and white picture and trash talking do NOT make an Neo-Noir movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black and white picture and trash talking do NOT make an Neo-Noir movie? We can guess the director's ideas or the story morals. We can guess, but what's delivered as an final product is unsuccessful attempt for modern cinematography. The story is full of flows ? from the neat looking fascist time prison with snow white sweat shirts on all of the prisoners, trough kidnapping of the main character with an Russian limousine (impossible situation) garnished with bath full of women (let it be flesh?). A young girl that does not age with 20 years, a jeweler that likes to keep a black diamond? well you know where, while he exercise?. And please, radioactive poison detected in no time by lab in the beginning of the 60's?.. I know, those inconsistent facts are only the side dish of the BIG idea, the big wisdom that we must get and embrace. I did not get neither the idea, neither the wisdom. All I got is foul language, trash picture and one more convincing example that the new Bulgarian Cinema is in the same "zift" as the movie title?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst of all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am Bulgarian and I feel really ashamed of this ,,masterpiece,,. I actually prefer not making movies than watching something like this. The worst scenario I can imagine, no action - voice behind the scene reading from the book ( the movie is based on a book ). Unrelated boring scenes - trying to add a color in the black and white movie. The language - I have no words for this, so much profanity, swearing etc. Half of the movie is about fences, genitals, farts, stuff like that. I don't want my country to be remembered with this. The acting is really, really bad, terribly static, so many empty faces, no sign of feelings at all, totally stunning. So is the camera, not more than 2 points of view. The overshooting with bed scenes is completely embarrassing, much full nudity to compensate the lack of scenario and good acting, but even if someone feel the need to make a movie full with unnecessary naked scenes why not try to make them a little more erotic. This was the most sad erotic scenes, not good even for an amateur porn. I lost hour and a half of my life just to feel sad, ashamed and embarrassed. People who liked this movie are just pseudo-patriots to me. I am a real patriot and I want to see a good movie once in 50 years than this crap, and it is a real crap - the whole predictable story is about crap. I just had the nerves to watch it because I am Bulgarian myself, but I wish it never existed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably insulting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously can not believe it, that the Bulgarian ministry of culture would finance such a movie. What you see in it is a true insult for any Bulgarian people, and those, who comment positive, are just more brainwashed people who do not care about their own heritage.The plot of this "movie" is weak, performance of the actors is at best mediocre, camera work is bad. It is true, that it gets close to western civilisation criteria for a good movie, cause of all the violence, brutality, and barbarism, but this is not who we Bulgarians are.I believe i read in another post that Bulgarian cinematography is dead since 20 years, and well, after watching this pile of crap, i have to agree.</fullReview>
