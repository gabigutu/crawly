		<shortDescription>Clichéd, undistinguished but still brainless fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayes is a suave, distinguished spy with the CIA who is part of a set up to buy a stolen nuclear weapon and then capture those involved. When he is killed mid-operation, his handler goes to the only man who can replace him, his twin brother. However his brother Jake is a hustler in New York City and not spy material. Oakes has nine days to get him ready to take over his brother's identity and take up the assignment.Despite the awful reviews, I still decided to give this film a go because I was in the mood for a dumb film that really didn't require me to think even once: this was that film! The film deserved every bad review it got - the only thing you need to worry about is whether or not you can accept the massive weakness or not. The plot is a real shambles and if you think about it logically then it all goes to hell. The idea that this is a reasonable plot, even for this type of film, is absurd. The script backs this up with dialogue that is fitting for a stupid comedy but not for the situations in the plot (`does it play dvd's?' or dialogue about Dr's Dre and Irving while trying to stall terrorists). Some of it is funny, but to be honest, if you dislike Chris Rock then there will be practically nothing for you.The plot brings the bomb back to the US towards the end in an effort to inject tension and urgency into the action, but it doesn't really work. The action is reasonably slick but it isn't ever really exciting - only polished like a product. The action, like everything else, is quite clichéd and not distinctive enough to really stand out from the crowd of other action movies. The gags about race are subtle but still quite broad in the style of Rock. I didn't find it offensive, but I never really understand why films have to constantly perpetuate racial myths such as all black people listen to hip hop and like certain sports etc. Some of it is funny though.Rock is the main reason for this; as I said, if you like him then you should enjoy this as most of the comedy is driven by him (even if nothing is anywhere near the sharpness of his act). He is not very funny but he helps the film have an overall comic tone that works pretty well Hopkins is totally slumming it. He manages an air of cool detachment but the material is way below him and his autopilot light is on the whole time. Stomare is poor and none of the villains really bring genuine menace - Eastern European hoods and clichés that they are. Beauvais is sexy - but that is all she is here for, to put on black underwear! Her character breezes in and breezes out with no real reason or consequence, plainly all she is here for is to have a bit of sexy black ass in there - something that Washington doesn't bring.Overall this is a slickly made film that is clichéd, absurd, undistinguished and not as entertaining as it intends to be. Despite the fact that the film is very average and not really one to stand out, it can be quite enjoyable if you are ready for that. If you can turn off your brain and lower your standards then this can be OK, however just don't expect it to be great no matter what you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is `bad' company for the serious filmgoer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When does a knighted actor collect a paycheck? When he acts benightedly in a cliched spy thriller that is a virtual textbook of Hollywood expectations, right down to the scruffy mid-eastern terrorists and the oversized red digital readout on a nuclear bomb.Anthony Hopkins plays a CIA veteran who must train a streetwise kid, played by Chris Rock, how to act like a real agent in 9 days. You can guess the outcome; in fact you can guess every scene before it unfolds. Movies like this make me know I couldn't do reviewing for a day job-I'd have to see bombs like this everyday. Did I say bomb again? Did we just have one come to America in `Sum of All Fears'?I am committed to saying something favorable for all movies if I can. Hopkins is always interesting to watch: he underplays here with a `sang froid' that would make Hannibal Lecter proud. The bad side of `Bad Company' is the bug-eyed, monotone, hysterical Chris Rock, who may have been medicated for this role because I didn't have to cover my ears this time-I just bore up under his boring delivery.Brooke Smith, who was the captured girl in `Silence of the Lambs', plays Hopkins' partner. `Lambs' this is not.The film moves rapidly enough for espionage junkies. There, I said 2 good things. The movie still is `bad' company for the serious filmgoer. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading so many negative reviews of this movie, I expected the worst and almost didn't see it. But I was in the mood for a movie and it was the only one showing that I hadn't already seen that was even remotely of interest to me. To my surprise I enjoyed the movie and where I think so many critics went wrong was to view this movie as a comedy, which it really isn't, except for a few humorous moments as might be expected in any such action movie. And Anthony Hopkins actually played his role the way it should have been played. It was not a role calling for a wild comic genius but one calling for a very serious-minded professional who is involved in trying to train a novice in just a few days for a deadly game involving a nuke. Chris Rock also played his role as it should have been played and restrained himself from his usual antics, as in "Lethal Weapon 4." Not a great movie but much better than the awful "The Sum Of All Fears."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest Chris Rock action comedy that apparently doesn't realize that it's a comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Rock stars as a CIA agent and a street hustler, twin brothers separated at birth. When the more successful brother, Kevin (ironically the one who got his act together and made a life for himself, yet also the one who got himself killed) is shot escaping a touchy sting operation in which he and his team try to buy a stolen nuclear weapon with cyber money that doesn't exist in real life, the CIA are faced with abandoning a 2 year project and risking themselves because their new enemies are going to want to know what happened to their deal or seeking out Kevin's twin brother Jake, who makes a living whipping the crap out of unsuspecting chess players in Central Park and selling scalped tickets to just about any event you can imagine.At this point in the film, it's clear that the premise is a remarkably strong one for an action comedy - the irony of having a street hustler suddenly thrown into a top secret CIA operation. And when you throw in Chris Rock as the hustler and Anthony Hopkins as his new mentor, it seems that you simply can't go wrong. Unfortunately, the movie seems to lose track of the fact that it is a comedy, and in more ways that just forgetting to throw in some good one-liners.Bad Company was made and scheduled to be released before September 11th, but was then delayed for obvious reasons (similar to the obvious reasons that delayed the release of the much more incendiary Collateral Damage, given its subject matter). Because the movie was written before the attacks, the writers can't have been expected to have known what bad taste it was to center the plot on a stolen nuclear device that was meant to level a major city on the eat coast. I don't hold that against it because of the 9/11 attacks, but only because it is such a tired premise. When are we going to see some good action movies that are about something other than one guy who has to save a whole city from terrorists with big bombs?There are points in the movie where it seems that the writers stopped and said, `Oh wait, this is supposed to be a comedy,' and threw in a few completely unamusing jokes here and there, mostly in the form of totally inappropriate one-liners from Rock that almost invariably fall completely flat. He and Hopkins do, however, have a bit of chemistry onscreen, but it is mostly wasted. This is a flashy Bruckheimer production, obviously, but it is one of the least interesting action films that Bruckheimer has turned out in years. Granted, most of his productions are cheesy crap, but this one even manages to be boring despite itself.I watched Bad Company right after watching Men in Black II, and so was already prepared for disappointment, but I found myself trying to figure out why exactly the movie is called Bad Company. Surely it can't be because the CIA is forced to employ someone literally off the street, because he turns out to be remarkably bright and much more capable than they had anticipated. Then at the end of the movie, just as the bad guy is about to get killed, he says something about how we Americans think we're so great but we just sit here while people all over the world suffer and die, and we just watch it on our televisions and grab another burger. This is, of course, disturbingly true, and it is not a small part of the reason that four airplane were hijacked in late 2001. It's something that Americans love to ignore so that we can pretend we're victims. The victims on September 11th were the people in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families, the country itself was not.Does `Bad Company,' then, refer to the company that the rest of the world is in, being in the company of America? It seems that the message that this film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and greedy country America is, and how capable we are to ignore the suffering of the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and our heart disease instead of starvation. In this case, I guess Bad Company's not such a bad movie after all. It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up call at the end, but one that will probably be largely ignored along with the rest of the film. Ah well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Predictable and Full of Cliches, This Funny Action Movie Entertains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Prague, the CIA secret agent Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) is killed in a mission with Oakes (Anthony Hopkins). They were trying to recover a nuclear bomb from the hands of some mercenaries. In order to proceed with the operation, Jake Hayes (Chris Rock), twin of Kevin, is recruited by CIA to act as if he were his brother. Jake is a rascal ticker scalper and his dead brother was an exquisite man. The CIA agents have nine day to make Jake as refined as he brother was. Although having a plot very predictable and full of cliches, this movie is a funny action movie, almost a comedy. Therefore, it objective of entertainment is accomplished. My vote is seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, this movie caught me off guard. Aside from some incredible cinematic scenery (Prague is a beautiful city), I didn't expect this to be much of a movie. And while it may be difficult for some to believe that Chris Rock is CIA, I found this movie to address something serious and use Rock's natural humor to both lighten and relieve the audience. There has to be something said for how funny Chris Rock is, regardless of the setting. This movie is worth watching if you are in the mood for a funny movie with an action filled plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as scathing reviews...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, as far as action films goes, is really not all that bad. I normally don't like the genre too much for it's continuance of formula, but this film was a surprise. The choreography was very well done and there were some good one-liners contributing to some amusement along the way. Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock act well in this film, alongside the twisted Russian mafia boss whom was brilliant, also to be found acting in the superb Guy Richie film 'Snatch'. The photography of Prague was stunning, great camera angles and a dramatic mood portrayed well in this beautiful city. Regarding the Trevor Rabin track 'BMBBO'... I loved immediately it for its grace and sombre melancholic mood when I heard it in the film, but was so mistaken when finally getting hold of the track... what trickery! The beautiful strings and violin, the elegance and subtlety, gets butchered a minute in by tacky electronica. what a shame to have this masterpiece ruined. In the film obviously adaptations were made for particular scenes and I got the high-octane 'alternative' version, as released on the CD, which by the way, sounds like something from the 80's, a Jean-Michelle Jare lasertropic overdose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but I'm glad I used a free ticket to see it.Anthony Hopkins is clearly slumming. It's like he polished of his cameo character from Mission Impossible 2 and set it to work for a whole film.The movie is supposed to be an action comedy but the action scenes are limited to a few machine gun firefights conducted by people who can't hit targets 10 feet away, and a single car chase.The comedy is limited to hearing Hopkins use the phrase "get in the car, b*tch" and some Chris Rock moments. It was simply neither action-packed enough or funny enough for the genre.The whole film felt like a first or second draft of the script; like no one bothered to polish &amp; refine the concept. It needed better, more original &amp; well thought out action scenes, and better humor.Not bad free, but not even worth a matinee. I give it a 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins saves this Cookie Cutter Plot w/Awful Filler Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure who coerced Anthony Hopkins to enter into such a bland, standard, project, but luckily for all of the rest involved with "Bad Company", he single-handedly keeps the movie from going under. What is supposed to be a bunch of laughs draws a few chuckles at best. The story stretches plausibility beyond razor thin, as if something so bumbling could happen with nuclear weapons. On top of such a poor conception of plot and story, the general music for this movie has been conjured inside take your pick: out of an elevator or supermarket playlist. Chris Rock was miscast here and should not be involved with anything less serious than comedy. Yeah, he knows how to throw out 1-liners, but this movie is "trying" to pass as an action movie. OK as a free library rental thanks to Hopkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a bad movie at all, as for those who complain you must understand and accept common rules of movie fiction1) Unwritten laws of an Action movie Guns leave leave damage in fancy places Local Law enforcement is a joke (unless they are the main characters) Bombs / weapons / etc will be rendered into an "understandable form" Guns never run out of ammo in a fire fight Guns only run out of ammo in a dramatic momentNow this movie DOES actually break one of the cliche laws of action movies... the good guy DOESN'T leave the weapon with the knocked out / shot enemy (he actually picks it up and uses it)Now people complaining need to realize1) Chris Rock is a commedian 2) Anthony Hopkins is the "straight man" 3) Chris Rock's main character (the bookie / scalper) is a realistic cynic who has no "faith" in the system (much of the humor is derived from this)One person gives the sarcastic remark where he goes on about how Chris Rock said "big deal" when he was told he had an identical twin brother.Yeah, this is on par, because he doesn't believe them (after all, identical twins seperated at birth is pretty cliche') this not only shows realistic attitude on the main role but pokes fun at the movie (and thus lends the plot a little more credit)In my humble opinion, this is typical Chris Rock humor (which IS over the top for him if you've ever watched him)Chris Rock is on par for his usual style. Hopkins brings the refinement and grace you expect of him (think Hannibal in Silence and Red Dragon)The spy v/s spy - cloak and dagger theme is on par for Hollywood...What you get is a good Chris Rock comedy with the spy theme... I enjoyed it greatly and had quite a few laughs between Rock and HopkinsIf your looking for a serious spy movie, get something else, if you want a fun comedy spy movie, this is a blast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to make this very short, as this movie doesn't even deserve a review. Chris Rock is a terrible actor. He should stick to standup. He looks ridiculous in this movie, even as the original 'serious' CIA agent. Anthony Hopkins looks bored the entire movie, and why he took this on is beyond me. Oh wait. Lots of money. Right. Bruckheimer movies generally are the 'ooh good action..' and nothing more, sort. This movie isn't even a good action movie, with one car chase where a high end Mercedes S-Class can't even outrun a van. The van actually overtakes it(!) Right. That's realistic. There's actually a myriad of issues with this movie, the main one being why on Earth it was made. It's poor film-making. Don't waste your time. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it and in the end that's what counts. Whenever I write one of these it is to give people an idea of what I thought of the film in question. Not to tell them what they should think. I often get the impression a film needs to meet so many artistic, filmographic and whatever other criteria before I am allowed to enjoy it. Or so I have to believe from some of the reviews about Bad Company. If you are going to watch a film then read the back cover, do some internet research, read some magazines or ask your buddies and you will find out what a film is about. Then decide if you want to watch it or not. And then accept it for what it is without feeling the need to preach about it. I know this sounds like a rant but it isn't. It is merely my opinion and that's all it is worth. I did the research, decided I wanted to watch it tonight, did so and enjoyed it. Because I took it in at face value. I was entertained by Rock and Hopkins, the story and the action. It is fiction, sells itself as that and delivers. If you like either actor and want some light action entertainment for 2 hours, Bad Company will not disappoint. It didn't for me anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Rock as a CIA agent? HA HA HA HA!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning I was laughing at unintentional moments. Chris Rock's buggy-eyed CIA agent character completely ruined the mood. The movie has some half-decent action scenes though and OK suspense. Anthony Hopkins, much like the underplaying of Hannibal, pulled off a hauntingly good character that saved Rock from being too goofy. Some of Rock's jokes clicked good too, but there's absolutely nothing special about BAD COMPANY. Actually, it is too old-fashioned.A CIA agent is killed. What a coincidence, he had a twin brother whom they were both separated at birth. The CIA sell him on the old notion of saving the world if he finishes the mission his brother set out on in the first place.BAD COMPANY will only be remembered for being one of the last movies (if not, THE last) to be filmed at the World Trade Center, which ironically, the movie is centered around international terrorism and hatred towards the United States as well. With that in mind, and average performances from all involved, BAD COMPANY 's boring tendencies will make it easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) was an undercover CIA agent who sacrifice himself for his fellow spy Gaylord Oakes (Anthony Hopkins). In order to maintain the cover identity Michael Turner, Oakes has to recruit Kevin's twin Jake Hayes to pretend to be his brother. Jake is a street smart hustler and very different from his brother. Jake doesn't even know he had a brother and they only have 9 days to negotiate a nuclear weapon deal with villain Adrik Vas (Peter Stormare). There is a terrorist group competing for Vas' nuke and trying to kill him. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Julie (Kerry Washington) is leaving him for Seattle.My one big problem is that this is not funny. It's either a waste of Chris Rock or a miscast for this character. Joel Schumacher just doesn't know how to make funny jokes and Rock can't do it by himself. The movie is better off getting a tough guy to play this seriously. It's an almost functional spy thriller with some passable action. Hopkins and Rock have no chemistry at all. Sometimes the movie has good moments but overall it is not really that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BAD COMPANY stars Anthony Hopkins (born December 31, 1937, in Margam, Wales), an actor of some domestic acclaim. It also stars Chris Rock. Rocky is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I love the fisticuffs back and forth.I award it a rating of 7 out of 10. As is often the case with action movies, from an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of twin spies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Company is an amiable but derivative spy caper with Chris Rock playing dual roles. One is a Preppie CIA spy who is killed in action. The other his unknown twin brother who is a ticket scalper and part time DJ growing up in the wrong side of the city without the breaks and money that the other brother had.He is approached by Anthony Hopkins to be trained by the CIA quickly to finish the deal his brother started as they have nine days to buy a nuclear bomb in the black market in Europe. Cue some intense training and early morning cold showers as we go headlong to Trading Places land.Despite Rock playing a part probably written for Eddie Murphy its an OK but silly action comedy by Joel Schumacher. Hopkins is too old to be a CIA field agent but seems to be enjoying himself,there are a few twists and turns and Rock is not too overbearing. Its a time waster, enjoyable enough but do not think too deeply about the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a talented comic, put him in an old plot, and you've got "Bad Company," a 2002 film also starring Anthony Hopkins, Chris Rock, Peter Stormare, and Gabriel Macht. This film was scheduled for release in late 2001, and because some of it was filled at the World Trade Center, the release was delayed until June of 2002.Officer Oakes (Hopkins) of the CIA is involved in an undercover job dealing with the purchase of nuclear arms when his partner (Rock), who was the man inside, is killed. Operatives find a lookalike, Jake Hayes, a guy who scalps tickets and does about anything he can to make a living. He couldn't be more different from his lookalike, who turns out to be his twin. They were separated in order to be adopted more easily.Jake accepts the assignment to become "Michael Turner" for a lot of money, because he's just been dumped by his girlfriend (Kerry Washington) who is moving away, since Jake hasn't made it so they can get married. He has nine days to become Harvard graduate Kevin Pope, who worked undercover Michael Turner. Problems ensue, one of whom is his brother's girlfriend, Nicole (Garcelle Beauvais).We've seen this film in one form or another a million times. Chris Rock is so talented and funny, however, that he makes it very enjoyable. Anthony Hopkins is completely wasted. Not only that, but he seems to know it.This is a good rental, light, and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious or Comedic ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First ten minutes into it, I couldn't tell whether this movie was supposed to be a serious crime thriller or a comedic one. In either case, it didn't look too good.Chris Rock, who, by all means, is a great comic actor, feels out of place or at least miscast and misdirected. Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, has a more effective comedic approach. Indeed, as with many of his parts in other movies, he is able to project a lot when doing not much. His facial expressions and quiet/weary sense of humor are way more entertaining than Rock's busy and maniacal behavior.Chris Rock plays the parts of two twin brothers, one is a slick, elegant and well-mannered FBI agent who dies early on and the other, hired as his replacement, is a chess master and a street kid with a big mouth. Anthony Hopkins plays the FBI agent who used to work with the first and now has to hire the latter.One problem with the movie is that it introduces us to the training process of the hired kid, with some good scenes, but none of it is used later on.Schumacher's direction in tone and color is nice but doesn't compensate the lack of focus on character's direction and storyline.In the end, I was left with the feeling Will Smith would have been better instead, being able to project more subtlety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher's 'Bad Company' is a routine action film, that also has a sense of humor, though not very humorous, and a wanna be 'Pacey' background score. It ain't no bad film, but, it ain't no good film either.When a mission to retrieve a stolen suitcase bomb goes bad, CIA agent Kevin Pope played by Chris Rock is killed. Pope was working undercover as an arm dealer under the name Michael Turner. The CIA, who is desperate to complete the mission discovers that Agent Pope had a twin brother, Jake Hayes, also played by Chris Rock. The CIA assign the twin brother in and thus try to complete their mission.To give it's due, it has it's share of interesting moments. But, they are far and between. One is majorly disappointed by the climax, is doesn't have the thrills or the impact, you'd expect.Joel Schumacher has directed the film ably. Production values, as expected from Jerry Bruckheimer, are full-filling. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is okay. Acting wise: Sir Anthony Hopkins is just right. Chris Rock is loud. The actor is ought to keep a check on his expressions and his voice. Peter Stormare is wasted. Garcelle Beauvais looks alluring.On the whole, 'Bad Company' is strictly an average fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Good Action Movie of 2002 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me till you, for the very first time I saw (Anthony Hopkins) and (Chris Rock) together in one poster, I didn't feel well. And after I watched the movie I was convinced of my strange feeling.. and asked myself.. what exactly was that ?! Well, it's an action movie with some of comedy in it. But I think it would've been more useful if it was a comedy with some of action in it ! Specially with a comedian hasn't done (and couldn't do) anything but comedy, and a great actor who didn't do anything comic ! The irony of the idea was so funny (North by Northwest with Mr. Rock in it) but the plot didn't actually focus on it that way, so it looked like a long episode of (ALIAS) starring (Chris Rock) !! And it's not a comedy nor even a parody ?? Therefore why they didn't bring (Bruce Willis) instead ?!.. Or the new "impossible" addicted to spying movies (Tom Cruise)!! ??.. Good question I suppose ! So what you'll have is : a good action flick, a very silly misplaced jokes, unforgettable miscasting for a comedian as an action hero with nothing basically comic to do, unbelievable scenes that had The Comedian in acting ! and The Actor in action !! Let alone the non- productive chemistry between (Hopkins) and (Rock).. That was bad company Indeed ! My fair judgment : it's the worst good action movie you'll ever have !! P.S : the terrorist's speech at the end was so strong and expressing; maybe the most important monologue in the whole movie !! And all the replay of the heroes was a gun shot in the head ?.. So why did they give the evil guy the strongest words not to the heroes ? Unless the writers were convinced of his case ? So maybe it's an American action flick with a little something to say !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a believable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Water and oil. They didn't mesh. Both fine actors that don't belong together in the same film. Some things are just best left alone. Good try guys, but this fell flat for me. Hopkins came across as a CIA agent who doesn't care one way or another about life in general. I expected him to yawn while telling Rock that his twin brother died. Rock was trying too hard to be serious and funny at the same time. He just looked too uncomfortable in this role. Too stiff and too dry like a bad martini is the best I can say about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aside from the fairly standard setup, quite a good movie in my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ive read the people's comments before my own here and I have to say I dont agree with all of them.The story is very close to real life: russia has fallen apart and the russian mafia is selling out including weapons that are very much wanted by all sorts of terrorist organisations that have the money to now simply buy these devices on the black market.Even though the basic outline of the story may be a tad standard you can still create an enjoyable movie but putting in details that make the film more unique.I think that Anthony Hopkins played his role very well except for a few small places where he didnt send out the correct emotion (like when Chris Rock and the girlfriend of his brother are being chased down the hall and Anthony Hopkins very calmly says "Ok lets join the party" or the scene where he shoots a badguy in the back and then very calmly looks down the laundrychute while Chris Rock is falling down to a possible death). Apart from these 2 or 3 total scenes in all he does a good job portraying an elder operative who has the experience and starts to question the way things are a done.Chris Rock plays his role of streetpunk convincingly. As far as the comments about the implausibility of his tranformation from streetpunk to gentlemen antiquesdealer are concerned: there are some scenes where he drops out of his trained role and makes mistakes so he doesnt do it perfectly and that makes it more convincing that his training was a rushjob.All in all I give this film a 7,5 or 8 out of a total of 10. Its good at what its supposed to be: a thriller/spy film with some comical notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected much more than this movie delivered. The plot and outcome were clear from the beginning. There were few to no suprises which nearly kills the movie. I thought Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock did a great job of acting which carried the movie. I attempted to rate this movie with all factors considered, but determined that Hopkins and Rock did a better job than my rating would reflect. Therefore, I rated slightly high in honor of good performances by the carrying actors and not on the 1 rating the movies itself would have received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Anthony Hopkins I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the great roles he had gotten us used to, I can't understand why Sir Anthony Hopkins decides to take parts that do him no honor. If you want to see him wearing cheep sun-glasses and constantly chewing on a toothpick, then this is the movie for you.Chris Rock does not do a good job either, but that's no surprise. He has the Chris Tucker type of humour but he is far less successful.Bottom line is: the movie's plot is a stretch, it is not a comedy (not a good one, at least), but it is far from drama or even action, too. No special effects, no acting, no nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Company is a good movie with an undeserved bad reputation. True, Anthony Hopkins was probably doing this one just for the paycheck. Chris Rock is a little over the top, also true. But this is a solid flick with a lot going for it. The story is unoriginal but enough differences make it worth watching. The angle of Chris Rock being a gangster covering for his dead CIA brother is refreshing and fairly original. The film has some good comedy (some flat jokes too though), and solid action. Trevor Rabin's score is subtle and fits perfectly, giving the film the serious tone it needed at times. There are several intense moments and, overall, this is a film that deserves to be watched. Joel Schumaker's direction, while not the best of his career, is good, and certainly an improvement from the disaster that was 8MM, and he deserves to be commended for coming back from that catastrophe. Watch this movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

Rock is a fine comedian, but a terrible actor, as the world so clearly discovered in Lethal Weapon 3, and his acting takes a lot away from what could have been a much more fun movie. Just think of Chris Tucker in the Fifth Element, or Money Talks, and how he would have made this movie a whole lot better.</fullReview>

Nothing fits here but Chris Rock is still trying to put Shaq's foot into a Size 10D Sisman Scamper. If you don't turn this puppy off in the first 10 minutes you're either visually challenged or one of life's unfortunate human vegetables. Poor Sir Anthony suffers from guilt by association. Just imagine the pomposity of the producers who thought that the masses would be duped by such a misfit of talents. Chris, you ain't funny, you ain't cool and you cain't act.

		<shortDescription>Brainless Buddy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few filmmakers have done more to dumb-down mainstream cinema, than producer Jerry Bruckheimer. In the last twenty years he has been responsible for countless cinematic atrocities, from Flashdance and Top Gun in the 1980's, to more recent efforts such as Pearl Harbor and the mind-numbingly trite, Coyote Ugly.`Bad', is most certainly the operative word when it comes to Bruckheimer's latest offering, Bad Company. This feeble attempt at the comedy-thriller genre, is most notable for the almost total absence of laughs and suspense and the squandering of such major talent as Anthony Hopkins and director Joel Shumacher (The Lost Boys, Falling Down, 8mm). The hackneyed plot follows ticket scalper Jake Hayes (Chris Rock, in an inanely inept performance), who is recruited by the C.I.A. to impersonate his identical twin brother, who has been assassinated by terrorists. Under the watchful eye of C.I.A. agent Gaylord Oakes (Anthony Hopkins), Jake Hayes is soon transformed in true Pygmalion-style from a hip-hop loving petty criminal to an urbane super-spy, whose responsibility it is to save New York City from nuclear annihilation.The ever-so predictable antics that ensue, make Bad Company an excruciatingly tedious 116 minutes. One can only assume that Hopkins was paid extraordinarily well to tarnish his reputation with this brainless buddy-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw "Bad Company". I had wanted to see it months ago, but it disappeared from the theatres. All of a sudden it popped up again. I guess the studio wanted to give it a second chance. And I have to say, I really liked it. The script held my attention and kept me on the edge of my seat. Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, outstanding. And I have to give a "thumbs up" to Chris Rock for trying a role so different than what he normally does. He kept the comedy part low-key enough to make it believable. Peter Stormare is outstanding as the "bad guy". Yes, this is your typical Hollywood Action Movie, but I think it is a really enjoyable and entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly and predictable thriller without any originality. Far fetched Chris Rock plays a double character, Kevin Pope and Michael Turner, the first one a vagabond and the second a CIA special agent. But they are twin brothers! (what a great idea!) and Mr. Turner (the agent) was killed in action and Mr. Pope (the vagabond) must replace him for the sucess of the mission. The movie is just the abominable jokes and gags of Rock and some scenes of action and car chases; anyway, too little for a great movie. I think Mr. Hopkins loses his precious time with this mess. I give this a 4 (four).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe Schmacher did this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Should've been much better if this was just plain thriller or action movie. It doesn't have to be comedic. There's no need. This flick has Anthony Hopkins and other actors who look quite serious. If this was just a thriller about a guy who happens to be a CIA agent on behalf of his bereaved twin bro and pays back.With a help of sturdy actor like Sir Hopkins. How's that sound?! Then the lead role could be any new fresh-faced young actors.I'm SO sorry that this kind of average movie with some cheesy scenes(does he have to learn how to distinguish good wine from bad?) was directed by Joel Schmacher,who once quite a good director("Falling Down" rings a bell? How about "Flatliners"?),and he doesn't seem to get out of big Batman &amp; Robin fiasco. All down hill since then. He'd better get over it fast.And I personally like Chris Rock-he's quite funny-but sorry,he's just not right for this role. I think he should stick with what he's good at. Plus the woman who's in that Hopkins CIA squad. She's sooo un-CIA; looking so unprofessional with guns, unlike other guy members and also just READs her lines as if she's reading cue cards. I would have liked this flick if this was directed by some average director and performed by so-so actors. And I have such respect for the actor Anthony Hopkins; but I believe he'd be better off with serious roles in a small movie or tiny but important roles in a big-budget one just like he did in "MI:2" with Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok...many people I know love Hollywood movies, but this one precisely shows their needs to produce one dumb film after another. It was really sad and funny at the same time. Sad because the movie stinks. Funny because I knew everything that was going to happen later at the movie. Come on! What is going on in this world? Chris Rock can't act, Anthony Hopkins wastes his real talent, Joel Schumacher (director of the great "Falling Down") proving to everybody that some of his good movies were just a glimpse of his geniality, which he DOES NOT use AT ALL in this movie and other terrible stuff. It's the kind of movie in which there are agents who never get hit, many obvious twists and turns between the characters and really predictable jokes (most of them coming out of Chris Rock's big mouth).

Which to me seems to be shouting "run away!"I could go into the absolute piles of groaningly obvious clichés, brainless plot, witless humor and total predictability, but it would take pages.

		<fullReview>I had been warned (via various online reviews) to avoid this movie.Since it was guys-night-out to see an action movie, and since this had already quickly moved to the replay-theatre, I figured it was worth a $2.00 bet.I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed several times. There were a couple lines that seemed ill-stated or a poor choice of words to give the right punch to the punch-line but overall it was much funnier than I had anticipated.Anthony Hopkins is (as always) great. He plays a tenured agent in a bad spot with an unrelenting boss who seems young enough to be his kid forced to put up with the wise-cracks of a street-smart smart-mouth who happens to be linked (via DNA) to the agent who saved his arse.Chris Rock plays an arrogant, down-and-out, make-the-most-of-the-moment "entrepreneur" who doesn't want to say "yes" but can't say "no".Not enough fist-fights, too few explosions, too brief of a car-chase but still worth the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't agree more with what some people already said about this film: it's outright bad and full of cliches. Obviously the producers thought the recipe that worked so well for Will Smith might also do the trick for Chris Rock: a street-wise lower-class failure who gradually becomes a hero through love (to girl-friend and his fellow citizens). The bad guys partly look Arabic (at least the one in New York) or are from the Russian mafia or from Bosnia. It's all very clear so that even an audience with limited brains will get it. Especially Rock's character is so pathetic that I wonder why pc-conscious African-Americans aren't complaining? Or is this the way they want to be portrayed? I'd rather be Jar Jar Binks - he's at least cute. There's one moment when I wonder what was going on in those brains. The really (!) bad guy tells the good American guys that he's doing this because the Americans think they're so great and can rule the world and tell the others what to do. How's this supposed to sound in non-American ears I wonder? Or did they want to raise some sympathy for the terrorist before the end? But I guess you cannot expect too much thinking behind this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll tell you the exact moment I lost all believability in this film. No, it wasn't the casting of Chris Rock as a secret agent, nor was it the casting of Chris Rock as the secret agent's identical twin brother separated at birth. It wasn't the notion that Rock could actually PLAY chess, let alone hustle with it, and it wasn't the British Guy running around with a CIA badge. All of this is typical Hollywood fodder which I'm so used to ingesting, I didn't put up that much of a resistance.The real failing is towards the end. There's a car chase, big surprise, where the British Guy shoots at whatever Euro-trash accent is trendy, and Rock sits behind the wheel swerving the car around and complaining that the British Guy can't hit anything. A bad guy jumps on the hood of the car, and Rock floors it. They are easily going 40 or 50 miles an hour. Rock screams and yells, "Get the guy of the hood!!" And I sat there, amazed, that everyone working on this picture forgot simple rules of physics.I know from personal experience that if you're going 10 miles an hour and there's a guy on your hood (regardless of the Euro-trash accent) a simple jab to the breaks sends the poor fool flying. I know this.All my friends know this. All the witnesses now know this. How come Hollywood doesn't? I really could continue an entire list of complaints about the rest of the movie with colorful analogies and clever one-liners, but instead, here they are in list form. 1. Chris Rock can't act.2. Anthony Hopkins can act, but only when he plays a cannibal.3. Garcelle Beauvais got to wear clothing. This is just criminal.4. Chris Rock can't act. 5. Jerry Bruckhiemer cares about content like I care about Ricki Lake.There were two hacks at Chris Rock because he technically had two roles.And finally, who lets Joel "Let's Flush Batman Down the Crapper Because I'm Bored" Schumacher direct movies? Didn't any of those big time decision makers see 8MM? The man can direct a movie like Mike Tyson can preform acupuncture. There, I said it. I feel better. Cheers, Jon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so terrifyingly horrific that I don't know where to start. In that case maybe it's better to tell as little as possible. So: don't see it. You kind of feel sorry for Anthony Hopkins. Such a great career, so many brilliant performances and now this. His agent should simply refuse to give him screenplays like these. That way we can remember him by the sublime work he has delivered in the past.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was good. Not brilliant. Not lousy. Simply plain good. Contrary to apparently most others here, I thought Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock played well, albeit somewhat unnuanced. Sure, the plot was unrealistic and sometimes even idiotic, but so was every other movie its been compared to. It must be mandatory to the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock delivers an okay performance in this movie even though it is not as funny as one would have hoped. It has a good pace, and Rock delivers some funny jokes occasionally. Anthony Hopkins is quite anonymous and I don't think that these kind of movies should be his priority in the future. The movie is not bad nor a top movie but it manages to entertain anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie primarily because I have been a fan of Anthony Hopkins and Jerry Bruckheimer for a while, but, having never been a fan of Chris Rock it was a little hard to watch the movie without wondering when he was going to make me wish I hadn't come. So, fortunately there were enough areas where I was glad I came - 1st off, I really enjoyed Anthony Hopkins and his unique approach to this role as a CIA agent. The acting also was fine for the most part. What I didn't like was the whole idea of the CIA bringing any civilian into something this dangerous is preposterous, and I will not go into any further detail, so, my rating is a 5 out of 10. Don't pay full price for this one, I'm glad I didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think if critics would have viewed this movie for what it was...and not what they expect of Anthony Hopkins...it would have been a more favorable review.I thought the pairing of these two actors was a brilliant move!! Chris Rock had me laughing almost constantly. In fact..I have to see it again to catch the lines I missed because of the laughter from me and everyone around me in the theater. And Anthony Hopkins?? Nice to see he's not always Hannibal. He was the perfect straight man for Chris Rock.Critics claimed that Sir Tony seemed bored throughout the movie. Has anyone ever paid attention to CIA Agents...FBI agents...or Secret Service Agents?? Not exactly party monsters!! Take the film for what it is...a good action comedy that I will take my 11 year old Grandson to see....because I can!And when it comes out on video...or DVD...I'll be first in line to buy it...And I'll put it along side my Beverly Hills Cop I &amp; II, Lethal Weapons and Die Hards. And I can only hope that there will be a sequel to this as well. I'm not sure what the ratings are ...but on a scale from 1 - 10....in my book, this is at least an 8.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jerry Bruckheimer is a goof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's such a relief to see that so many contributors come away from this movie with the same low regard that I do. Quite frankly, I am absolutely sick of Jerry Bruckheimer and his self-centred approach to movie-making.Put another way, Bad Company is just another bullet-ridden ode to Jerry's ever-expanding ego. I've never met the guy, but I keep imagining one of those cigar-chomping blowhards who knows showbiz, dammit, and, with his eye ever on the bottom line, will do anything to avoid any sort of creative risk.Action-comedy? More like My Fair Lady with a few fanatical gun-wielding terrorists thrown into the mix. It's at the point where you can spot a "Bruckheimer." Hire two big-name stars, scour the music video scene for a lapdog/director and throw a screenplay at 'em. Where did Michael Browning learn to write? The School of Contrived Plots?Rock, whose trademark is creativity, is reduced to barking out lame lines about whitey not liking rap. Usually actors demanding creative control means disaster, but in Rock's case, it should have been forced upon him, like a sled dog is forced to mush. The game of chess plays a significant role in Bad Company, but for all the wrong reasons. Bruckheimer would have you believe that it symbolizes strategy and the ongoing struggle between good and evil. But for me, it represented Hollywood's never-ending penchant to exploit the apparent rift between black people and white people, and the fact that Rock and Hopkins remain nothing more than pawns.This movie truly sucks. Jerry Bruckheimer is a goof and a loser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Company: A movie filled with plots we've seen so many times before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Company" is a fish out of water tale mixed with end of the world terroism. It's a story we've seen in so many movies, you wish they will lift the bar to this already worn out genre. Will they lift they bar and add something new to this genre, something fresh? The answer is...no they don't. This is a forgettable and boring movie, a film you will forget by the time the end of June comes around.This film stars Anthony Hopkins as a old and withered CIA agent, on a mission to buy a Nuculear bomb off a terriost named Adrik Vas(Peter Stormare), until after the first meeting, Hopkins and Chris Rock now in the CIA brother, gets chased and ends up getting killed because he saved Hopkins life. Now...without the brother that set up the deal, the CIA find his brother, a street smart ticket scalper Jake Hayes(Chris Rock), and tell him about his brother and the deal he set up, they have nine days to turn him into his brother( in a sense that is) to fool the terriosts. They teach him how to drink wine, how to talk a different language, and many other boring things that you don't really care about. The rest of the movie is action scenes with bunch of shooting, and other boring scenes. There is a plot twist(sort of) in the middle of the movie, but i'm not going to ruin it for you on this review.The chemistry between Hopkins and Rock is there, they are good when they share the scenes, but throughout the entire movie Hopkins just looks bored, just looks like he has no clue why he is doing this movie, he looks like he deeply regrests it. Rock, on the other hand, is funny and works good in this movie, but he also gets kind of annoying torward the end of the movie, he still is fishing out jokes when the world could come to a end? Come on, get real!There are good supporting roles by Stormare as the bad guy, he is always good in no matter what he's in. The other preformance that is nice to watch is Gabriel Macht(Agent Seal), he is a straight arrow and is smooth, he looks and acts like he should be in the CIA, makes it fun to watch him in action.The movie just falls apart, I saw this movie two weeks before it came out(a screening) and then saw it again few nights ago with some friends, but as I watched it again, i got bored very easily with the film, and couldn't wait until the credits began to roll. The movie has a few funny moments(all from Rock) but it falls apart, you bored too easily and it feels like you've seen this movie one too many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film got panned by so many critics because it was advertised as a comedy. Yes, it may have had funny parts, but its not the main point to the story. I thought Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock played well together, and Chris Rock was great. Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence could have easily been in Rock's place, and would have made the movie terrible. Overall, Bad Company was above my expectations and kept me interested the whole way through.

		<shortDescription>It's a Jerry Bruckheimer film! What do you expect?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has worked with 1st time directors in the past. Let's recap: 1975-Dick Miller for "Farewell, My Lovely;" 1980-Paul Schrader for "American Gigolo;" 1980-John Flynn for "Defiance;" 1981-Michael Mann for "Thief;" 1982-Garry Marshall for "Young Doctors In Love;" 1983-Adrian Lyne for "Flashdance;" 1984-Martin Brest for "Beverly Hills Cop;" 1984-Douglas Day Stewart for "Thief of Hearts;" 1986-Tony Scott for "Top Gun;" 1995-Michael Bay for "Bad Boys" and John N. Smith for "Dangerous Minds;" 1997-Simon West for "Con Air;" 2000-Dominic Sena for "Gone In 60 Seconds," David McNally for "Coyote Ugly," and Boaz Yaskin for "Remember The Titans;" 2001-Ridley Scott for "Black Hawk Down;" and now 2002-Joel Schumacher for "Bad Company." I've been a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer ever since his movie "Top Gun" became a popular movie. Then, when I saw the preview for "Bad Company," starring Chris Rock and Sir Anthony Hopkins, I thought to myself, "This is gonna be a big hit! I'm definitely gonna see it." But, Joel Schumacher's directing it. Yes movie buffs, he's the same man who directed the 1997 dud "Batman &amp; Robin." But, cut him some slack. I loved "Batman &amp; Robin" and I loved "Bad Company." It was a fast-paced entertainment film.The story begins in the Czech Republic with 2 CIA agents Kevin Pope and Gaylord Oakes (played by Rock and Hopkins) about to make a deal with a terrorist named Adrik Vas (Peter Stormare). The deal is good, but Vas's terrorist are chasing Kevin and he gets killed. Cut to New York where Gaylord (the first name reminds me of Ben Stiller's character in "Meet The Parents") has to search for Jake Hayes (again by Rock) and have 9 days to train him to be agent. The only problem is Jake never knew he had a twin brother. So, Jake must pretend to be Kevin in 9 days. I loved this movie from beginning to end. It was funny and action-packed. If you've already seen the big summer movies ("Star Wars 2," "Spider-Man," "Insomnia," "The Sum Of All Fears," etc.) and wanna see something else, go see "Bad Company." I guarantee you'll love it.A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedians and bad movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Chris Rock hosting a Saturday Night Live reunion show a few years ago. He looked out at the audience of SNL alums such as Chevy Chase, David Spade and Adam Sandler and said "We're here tonight to celebrate the careers of people who have made some of the WORST movies in history!"It got a big laugh, because it's so true. But why is this? As stand-up and improv comedians, the SNL folks were brilliant. But then some rule in the entertainment industry says you have to do movies. Unfortunately, most of these comedians don't work well in mainstream movies. It's pretty obvious why not: scripts and scenes are a completely different animal than standup and improv. I'll never forget the first time I saw Belushi and Ackroyd together in a movie--I think it was "The Neighbors." Beside the fact that it was an awful movie, it was painful to watch these two comedic geniuses NOT BEING FUNNY, which is what I was used to. I wanted to see them do their thing, but instead, they had to go by a script. They were simply not meant to do that.Anyway, it's sad to say, but the chickens are coming home to roost for Chris Rock, too. (Which isn't necessarily a terrible thing, though. Eddie Murphy once said, "When you grow up poor, you learn to never take anything for granted, nor turn any opportunity down, even if it's not an ideal one. I got millions to make Beverly Hills Cop III--which was worth having Roger Ebert's thumb up my butt.")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Company is an entertaining and really enjoyable movie. Chris Rock is hilarious. As stated in an earlier review, he is street smart and cool when his life isn't being threatened. But, unless you are a trained professional, who among us wouldn't shriek and scream when they were being chased by terrorists with guns and you are defenseless? Anthony Hopkins, as a veteran CIA agent, is unreadable. But, that's how CIA agents are played in the movies. They are trained to be secretive and unreadable. So, Anthony Hopkins plays his role very well. AS for the other characters, I was quite aware of who they were and what their names were. I thought this movie was quite entertaining. I laughed through most of the movie. The writers gave Chris Rock loads of one liners and other sarcastic remarks, while Anthony Hopkins was also given some less obvious jokes to crack and comments to make. As for the effects and things like that, I didn't see anything wrong with them. Not once did I see the bad guys firing machine guns (which fire faster, but are less accurate) directly at the good guys. There was always something between them or they were moving. As for the plot, it was a little too close to reality but, I don't think that it was distasteful at all. It was a terrible thing that happened on 9/11, but we can't dwell on it forever. The number 1 movie in the country is The Sum of All Fears, in which a nuclear bomb actually explodes. If people thought that that was distasteful in the wake of 9/11, it would no be the number 1 movie in the country. But, as for Bad Company, I really enjoyed it and would gladly go see it again.</fullReview>

The plot was pretty lame, but I didn't care. I went to see how good the comedy would be between Rock and Hopkins, and I was not disappointed. I love it when Hopkins gets to be funny. There was a lot of swearing, but no "gross" jokes that I can remember, and no sexy stuff either really. There was a group of fifty-something people behind me who couldn't stop laughing and said "That was great!" at the end of the show. Me and my friends (thirty-somethings) thoroughly enjoyed it. I would imagine teenagers would get a kick out of it, too. It's not going to be a classic or anything, but I'm glad I gave it a chance.

		<shortDescription>Bad Company is 1/2 The Rock, 1/2 Enemy of the State, all in all, not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the trailers for this film are awful. Plus, I am not a Chris Rock fan, so with that in mind, I had less than no intentions of ever seeing this movie. It looked like another bad buddy movie, and I hated to see Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, make a fool of himself in such a film. However, this weekend, there weren't any other movies that I hadn't already seen playing, so I reluctantly coughed up the six bucks to see Bad Company. I must say, it was better than I expected.The highlight of this film is the directing. Joel "I Killed Batman" Schumacker did an outstanding job with the action sequences. They were (though, the situations being a little over the top, however) all were very believable, and often exciting. This is a film that doesn't have slow motion, double handguns blazing action(though it often looks really cool on screen), but more realistic shootouts. The action sequences were all well done, even to the point where the good guys actually pick up the bad guy's weapons when they kill them (I can't tell you how many times I've seen the opposite in an action film). And I must admit, some scenes were actually very suspenseful, including the opening. The comedy aspect was weak, however. Though, there were a few one-liners that had me and the audience roaring with laughter, there were a fair amount of groaners as well. Chris Rock did an okay job in his usual role, though the script did not give him much to work with. I'll admit, he was pretty good when he was in his street-smart role, but absolutely awful in the 'Don't shoot me, I'm the comic relief' role. Anthony Hopkins was a total bada$$ in this film. I think one of the funniest scenes in when he takes out several guys, while non chalantly chewing his gum...that is the signature of pure coolness (See Sean Connery in the Rock).This flick is another typical Jerry Bruckheimer outing, with fast paced cuts, each ending with a one liner of some sort. I find this editing exciting and perfect for summer films. This movie is a combination of 2 other Bruckheimer productions: The Rock, (we have another veteran actor kicking some fierce booty, an intelligence agency needing the help of an otherwise civilian(this time, the CIA, not the FBI) and terrorists wanting to blow up a city as well as gun fights galore) and Enemy of the State (another black lead stuck into an impossible situation, coming out on top in the end as well as the techno thriller aspects). This movie is almost a perfect combination of the two movies, each were well done as well.This movie is also full of cliches and stereotypical roles with no substance, but that is not important...this is an action film, not Shakespeare. I will admit, there are parts in Bad Company that may make you groan with displeasure, but all in all, it is a surprisingly inteligent film with great excitement and thrills and makes for a pretty good summer film. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

This movie is a combination of 2 other Bruckheimer productions: The Rock, (we have another veteran actor kicking some fierce booty, an intelligence agency needing the help of an otherwise civilian(this time, the CIA, not the FBI) and terrorists wanting to blow up a city as well as gun fights galore) and Enemy of the State (another black lead stuck into an impossible situation, coming out on top in the end as well as the techno thriller aspects). This movie is almost a perfect combination of the two movies, each were well done as well.This movie is also full of cliches and stereotypical roles with no substance, but that is not important...this is an action film, not Shakespeare. I will admit, there are parts in Bad Company that may make you groan with displeasure, but all in all, it is a surprisingly inteligent film with great excitement and thrills and makes for a pretty good summer film. I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, very poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the pairing of Hopkins and Rock, although ol' Sir Tonyappeared out of breath through the whole film, despite some veryobvious stunt doubles doing the heavy lifting.Chris Rock was the movie's lone bright spot, and his performanceand great one-liners were worth the price of admission. I gave it a6 for the laughs and the great scenes in Prague.I was amazed, however, by the HORRENDOUS acting by some inthe supporting cast. I can't a remember another big-budget filmwith so many stiffs getting so much screen time. (All of Hopkins'CIA colleagues were flat-out awful!)A film with a pretty good premise, but very poorly executed.(And does anyone other than me wonder why the separated-at- birth twins both ended up as expert chess players? I thought thiswould eventually be used in the story, but it was never evenmentioned. Oh well.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is another "48 Hours" or "Beverly Hills Cop". Or another movie that just has explosions, and gun fire everywhere. But still, this movie is worth the while and the money. Chris Rock (playing duel roles) and Anthony Hopkins are perfect as the two leads. They bring comedy and drama to the screen. Both play very smart,intelligent,and funny characters. As for the directing, Joel Schumacher does a great job. So, see this movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews. It only counts on what you think. Not what a bunch of old a******* think (with a few exceptions). They're just getting paid for what anybody else could do. Besides "Bad Company" comes in good supplies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huh. When I saw the trailer for Bad Company, I exclaimed, "Dear Lord! The stars have aligned to create the worst movie ever!" So today I sauntered into the theater to watch the trash by Joel Schumacher (guh!) and Jerry Bruckheimer (double guh!) starring Chris "Idiot" Rock (triple guh turbo: hyper fighting!) I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.Would I have enjoyed Bad Company as much as I did if I hadn't gone into it thinking it would rival the Holocaust and the Middle Passage for crimes against humanity? Probably not. Yes, Bad Company is riddled with cliches. Yes, it's rather simplistically written. But at its core, it's just a simple, unassuming story. The hero has an adventure, saves the world (sort of), gets the girl, and gets the treasure in the end. Maybe that's a problem for you, it isn't for me. The action sequences are competent and exciting, and some of the jokes are amusing. Just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.There are much worse ways to spend an afternoon than watching Bad Company. And, it has a great score, to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BAD COMPANY is a terrific family comedy/action movie (7.5 out of 10), a genre which is in low supply in these days of the hunt for "R" ratings. My wife and 11 year old son and I went to see a good comedic, action movie with good acting and a palatable story, and that was exactly what we got.For sure, there were leaks in the story-line. We just want to be entertained. I'm tired of all these pathetic consumer reviews that are just as critical as they can possibly be. Chris Rock played a more mature but definitely funny Chris Rock. Anthony was Anthony... but maybe a bit too much in this film for the paycheck. Funny: yes. Shoot-em-up: you bet. Car chase typical: for sure. And a story that was no more implausible than any action or thriller these days. It held together in its fictional venue to end. If you can afford the 8 bucks...go see it. If you can't, it can wait for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Company is simply bad. There is not much funny in Chris Rock's performance and Rock and Anthony Hopkins generate nary a shred of screen chemistry.Firstly, Chris Rock has nothing to work with. If tirading is somebody's idea of a funny movie, its a pretty flimsy device to build comedy around. Rock or those he supposedly loves are never really percieved to be in danger.Secondly the actors simply sleepwalk through the material. Hopkins is wasted as the stodgy white guy who doesn't trust the guy who's hip and "street smart". Riveting stuff. Zzzzz.Save your $8 and the trip to the multi-plex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with some guy friends. And I am not ashamed to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Yes, I can recognize the cliche, cheesy aspects of the plot (Jake was suddenly reminding me of Rain Man, what with his uncanny knack for remembering numbers under pressure, etc). There were a few trite little sequences; the characters were not well developed, but as others have mentioned, it is merely a movie. Meant for entertainment purposes. And I, a female drama/comedy/chick flick fan, along with my male action movie freakout friends, was thoroughly entertained. Anthony Hopkins came off as HUMAN- an aspect one doesn't always see in CIA movies. His frailty and strength were both apparent. And I was really impressed with Chris Rock's ability to not be too terribly obnoxious. He can be funny without being loud (all the time). He did the best he could with the script he was given. Come on, you can't strike gold every time. But for what it is, Bad Company was worth the time and the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they make movies like this? SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I like both Rock and Hopkins but this movie really stank up the theatre. Rock's character is completely unbelievable and the plot, such as it is, is lame at best. The CIA has nine days to take a Jersey City street hustler and make him into an art expert and CIA counter-terrorism specialist. Not likely. If Rock's character is so competent in the CIA setting at the end of the film, why is he such a complete loser?Three comments: 1. What is it about British actors and a complete nonchalance about the quality of movies in which they appear? Michael Caine, Donald Pleasance, Olivier, Richard Burton and now Hopkins don't seem to care one whit about their reputations. What's next for Hopkins? A Godzilla picture? Police Academy visits London?2. In the 'Worst Actor' of the Year category, special mention must go to Peter Stormare. He was great in Fargo, and in Armageddon but here he gave a ridiculous over-the-top performance. I was waiting for him to talk about his uncle who makes the thing that directs the bomb. Maybe, the director just wanted him to spoof his role in Armageddon, which was supposed to be comic but that would serve no purpose in this film.3. Chris Rock is a really talented comedian and on his cable show has a lot of interesting stuff to say. I hope they paid him a lot of money to be a live-action version of Jar Jar Binks. After he complained in the car chase scene about 'wanting to live to watch Oprah again' I was left wondering why they didn't have a scene in a fancy European restaurant where we could get big laughs out of him ordering fried chicken and watermelon. (sarcasm)A cinematic atrocity! 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Rock is a talented comedian, and Anthony Hopkins is one of the most revered thespians working today. So why would either of them subject themselves to the humiliation of appearing in this appallingly inept piece of recycled action garbage? I think the answer is obvious: producer Jerry Bruckheimer has a really big checkbook.Hopkins sleepwalks through the entire film, delivering every line in the same bland, mirthless monotone. And sure, Rock gets off maybe a half-dozen one liners that made me laugh, but that's low praise considering I also had to endure two hours of formulaic plot, logical inconsistencies (I can't count how many times the CIA had the villains surrounded by legions of troops with sniper rifles, only to let them escape), inane shoot-outs and boring chase sequences.There is not a single original idea in this whole film, and consequently, not a single moment of suspense or excitement. "Bad Company" serves only to cement director Joel Schumaker's status of one of the most obscenely incompetent filmmakers working today (right down there with Michael Bay and Dominic Sena). Avoid this movie at all costs.Rating: 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough for a TV movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Company has a very simple plot. A large, professional organization for whatever reason, hires a "smart but a loser" character/group, only have a few days to teach years of training to undertake a dangerous mission to save the world and make it a safer place (and no, I am not describing the movie, Armageddon). The simple plot is usually just a vehicle to deliver spectacular action, comedy, expensive computer generated scenes and maybe T&amp;A, which this move has none of. Beside a few funny moments (which can be counted on one hand, even if you have lost a few fingers in the lawn mover accident) The movie is completely lacking of any excitement (which maybe even worse is this movie is seen after 'The Sum of All Fears').Chris Rock has become less and less funny and Anthony Hopkins probably owns someone a big favor and is paying it back with acting in this movie. This movie is very disappointing considering it is directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (master of thin-plot movies with extra cliches but involving plenty of good action, comedy and fun). Hopefully he could do a better job with his protégé, Michael Bay, in Bad Boy 2.Wait for the video or better still, wait for it to be on TV. Only then maybe you could enjoy the movie. I give it a sympathy score of 5/10 for the director, producer and Anthony Hopkins. Those three usually are involved in much better movies (even for JB).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Rock plays a spy and a ticket scalper (twins, separated at birth) in Joel Schumacher's latest outing - this is supposed to be a spy film, see, and Anthony Hopkins brings the full brunt of his accomplished talents to the project; unfortunately, the story begins on the cartoon level and never rises above it - there is just no way anyone can take any of these goings-on seriously. If you accept it on that level, it's a decent-enough way to spend a couple of hours (at least to get out of the heat). No real big laughs here either, and in fact, Hopkins has the 'funniest' line in the film, when he tells Rock #2 twice -=- minor spoiler alert -=- "Get in the car, b*@$+h."</fullReview>

The diabolical thing is that they never mention religion, violence or anything that might give them, knowing that to do so would cause you to just write them off as brainwashed losers. However, some of them are very clever, and if you don't spot them, you have just bought in to their fire and brimstone morality.OK, regarding this movie; it's exactly what the rest of us would expect to see, it's fun, funny and basically pretty entertaining. Of course it's a bit predictable, etc., etc. But, hey, there isn't anyone going to see this movie expecting it to win academy award nominations. The point is entertainment and a departure from the real world for a couple of minutes. It's all that and more. Grab your gal/guy or your buds and go have a good time. I could tell you about the movie, but why bother, there isn't much to tell beyond the basic plot line, so if you're looking for something deeper, this isn't it. However, that said, this may be exactly what the doctor ordered for entertainment this evening. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not every movie can be The Rock, as much as Bruckheimer might want it to be. Bad Company is certainly not the same kind of movie, but worth checking out in it's own right.Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins perform well as counter-points to each other, although Hopkins' character is rather understated. A small attempt to add some background to his character is given, but for the most part he is simply meant to be Rock's foil. This effect was positive for me, since I enjoy a voice of reason in an otherwise screwed-up situation. The humor of this film is Rock's property, with good results as well. I found his dialogue to be very funny. However, his character did tend to whine, which got old quickly. I can forgive this since he does have some well-delivered one-liners.I was expecting a little more action, but as the plot was spun I realized it would not be the focus of the film. The plot was typical Hollywood fodder; however, I thought it was presented well. There were some genuinely tense scenes that played with my emotions. I always appreciate those.If you don't like Chris Rock, I can't imagine why you would bother with this film. If you do like him, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Anthony Hopkins is here in a very different role as we saw him in 'Hannibal' and such. He shakes good laughs out of you in his teamwork with Chris Rock. Also he makes sure the seriousness in the movie still exists. Besides the humor, we have action. Although this is the classic Hollywood-action i did enjoy to see it.

		<fullReview>This movie starts off fairly well, but goes downhill. After maybe 70 minutes, I fast forwarded through the predictable concluding scenes.You could give it anywhere from a 1 to a 4 depending on what audience is your reference point.This is the first time I've seen Chris Rock. In this movie he basically hits one note, which to me was grating and childish. He mugged unmercifully, for which the director is at fault.The seriousness of the subject matter did not mix well with the strained efforts at comedy. In Goldfinger, the producers found a way to add light touches without descending into parody.The CIA types portrayed here are a complete joke. The save New Jersey from a nuclear bomb is over the top.There is the usual over-reliance on computers and mechanical devices, and the usual hurried expositions to keep the action going, and there is the usual deficiency of characterizations. It doesn't have to be this way. It is possible in 100 minutes to create both character and action.The bad guys have bigger guns and look grungier. The good guys have smaller guns but they shoot straighter. Even machine guns don't take down the good guys. It's unbelievably stupid. The IMDb average of 5.4 (currently) is definitely on the low side, with good reason in this case.I ate no popcorn while checking this out. Good thing. It would have been a waste.How this movie found its way into my queue is a mystery to me. I perhaps confused it with another with a like title or perhaps picked it up upon some stray recommendation or from stray list.Anthony Hopkins is always worth seeing. Maybe that's how I got into this. Even in this movie, he's worth seeing. He elevates it. He is able to deliver serious lines and wisecracks with the appropriate balance. Mr. Rock's yelling almost single-handedly destroyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It turns out that there is more than one Chris Rock. Unbeknownst to Chris Rock B (a streetwise ticket tout and chess hustler but otherwise a nobody), his brother (Chris Rock A) was separated from him at birth and they were both given away to foster homes. Chris Rock A got all the breaks and ended up in the CIA, where he was doing very well until he was murder-death-killed. Chris Rock B grew up in a loving family with no money and no breaks. Which explains why he is not best pleased when approached by Anthony Hopkins (and there's only one of him) to join the CIA and help finish the deal his brother started, due to the fact that they have only 9 days left to get hold of the thermonuclear bomb they are trying to remove from the black market. Some intense training and some hard and fast lessons ensure that Chris Rock B is soon ready to play the part of Chris Rock A playing the part of . . . . . someone else who just happens to be interested in buying some heavy weaponry.Yes, it's a slick, glossy action comedy from Joel Schumacher designed to please the masses and, while I did enjoy the movie while it was on, it's majorly flawed and eminently forgettable. Why? Well, the action isn't really all that well-executed and when it does all happen it tends to happen AROUND Chris Rock, as he plays the most inactive hero I have seen in any action film I can recall. Sure, he runs and screams but he barely gets involved in any of the action until the last half hour. So does that mean that the comedy compensates for things? No. Rock IS funny and his nervous banter is pretty constant during some scenes but, unfortunately, he's the only one providing any laughs here and there just isn't enough of his wit to spread around.Peter Stormare plays a decidedly weak baddie and what we're stuck with is an action comedy with weak action and not nearly enough comedy. Which isn't the ideal result you want.See this if you like: Hollywood Homicide, Trading Places, Chris Rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Officer Seale (Gabriel Macht) is handsome, brave, intelligent, an ace biker, skilled in gun duels and at dodging bullets, and can even survive being shot in the back at close range. He's great! Unfortunately, he's not the focus of the film. That is shared by street-wise scalp Jake (an irritating Chris Rock who is followed everywhere by blaring rap music) who has to pretend to be his undercover CIA agent brother and dull (not to mention elderly and overweight) Officer Oakes (an unconvincing Anthony Hopkins sleeping through his lines) who has to train Jake to save the world from a nuclear bomb.Bad Company starts with a clichéd poetic action scene in which Kevin Pope is killed. Enter exposition overload to explain who Jake is and why he has to cover for Kevin. This gets all the information across in a short space, but is so obvious and clumsy, only a child wouldn't be irritated. However, the plot itself is pleasingly straight-forward and sense-making, which isn't often the case in action films, but it does all rest on how lucky the CIA are that Jake is basically a receptive genius. But it can't be that hard for Jake to pretend to be Kevin, since Rock's Kevin acting involves using a quiet monotone and nothing else. This touches on a vague plot hole of the film, in that why does the CIA bother training Jake to act like Kevin, and then training him to act like Kevin acting like Michael Turner (Kevin's alias)? Why not go straight from Jake to Michael, especially since they are not supposed to give Jake any extraneous information that could pop out at the wrong time? Other plot holes include why in the lengthy car chase in which baddies want the bomb that Jake and Oakes have, do they not kill Jake and Oakes when they get the bomb, and undercover agents like Oakes probably shouldn't run around as CIA officers in the middle of undercover operations. Also, there is something extremely tacky about the style in which the diffusing the bomb scene is edited, with lots of random close ups.All that aside, this is an inoffensive action film, fine for passing the time, although thanks to the two flat leads, probably not one to seek out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins and Rock Mismatched In Action Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's see, a CIA agent is killed and a long time agent has nine days to train his twin brother, who happens to be wise ass street hustler Chris Rock, so that the CIA can foil efforts by bad guys to use a nuclear device. Yeah sure. The problem with Bad Company is that the lead actors, Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, are mismatched to begin with. Hollywood thinks it can match any pair of seemingly different actors and come up with the next great buddy movie. Not so. Rock looks out of place in this film that doesn't know whether to be an action or comedy film. Rock's one-liner persona isn't believable in this film in terms of filling the shoes of his twin brother and successfully pulling it off with that persona. We don't buy that Hopkins and Rock are really in danger as a result. The role of Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as the first twin's significant other is thankless and merely serves to grab the male audience. Kerry Washington doesn't have enough screen time to be effective as the second twin's significant other. That means we're left with chases and shootouts, some of which are very good, but which come at the expense of characterization and plot. Perhaps the biggest reason why the film doesn't succeed is that it was made just prior to 9/11, and our sensibilities just weren't the same when it was finally released in June 2002. Hopkins makes it as watchable as he can. ** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER ...good talent wasted by a bad script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher has made excellent movies, and Anthony Hopkins is what actors aspire to be. Both have been wasted by a bad script.Maybe the producer was trying to make something on the lines of "Enemy of the state", but it doesn't work.An interesting plot would have made this movie gripping. Why does Hollywood always show Russians in movies as sadistic brutes? Why does the CIA have go around recruiting untrained idiots for delicate, multi-million dollar covert operations?The kind of bomb they showed in the suitcase ought to have weighed at least 80 kilograms, judging from the equipment and safety casing. But they were throwing it around as if it was empty. Ridiculous!Frankly, I am tired of this stereotyped casting of African-Americans as street-wise loafers who talk in slang and still manage to defuse a nuclear bomb (with 2 seconds left!) while the entire CIA is busy playing with guns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I watch this movie was because I had a free coupon that I had to use the same day so I had no time for a thorough look so I got the first title that came across. Let me tell you-it was a bad choice.The intentions of the creators of this movie were all about moneymaking. I know that the purpose of moviemaking for the moviemakers is mainly to make money, but in case of this one that was the only purpose. I would guess this movie was partly financed by the Prague City Hall for it looked like a big promotional clip of the city. That's on the part of the creators, but the same applies for the actors.Anthony Hopkins looked like he thought he had signed up for a different movie or that the money he was offered must have been too much to resist. Seeing him running through the streets of New York was humiliating even for me. Chris Rock in his attempt to be Eddie Murphy also had his contribution to the overall travesty. The movie would stop its flow, everybody would freeze for a moment, so Rock could deliver his pathetic one-liners in his stand-up comedian mode after which everybody kind of awakens and carries on with the script. And not to forget the villains, one word: hilarious.If you remove the word "company" from the title you'll get an idea about the quality of this flick. 5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever thought of the combination of Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins in an action film must have his or her head examined. These two are obviously in two different films. They never mix. They're olive oil and balsamic vinegar.One wonders what was Anthony Hopkins thinking when he accepted this film, which doesn't add anything to his acting portfolio. One also wonders what could go in his mind when he has to compare this piece of trash with his previous work in films, such as The Good Father, or his theatre work.The film doesn't make much sense, at times. How about the weapons being fired all the time?. Either the bad guys have no sense of aim, or their automatic rifles can't shoot a target, even at close range, as it's the case at the beginning of the film when the CIA agent played by Chris Rock dies, but Hopkins doesn't even get a scratch.Joel Schumacher's direction goes nowhere because it never makes sense either as a thriller, or a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you define bad company as being boring and lasting two hours too long then you have the perfect title for this movie.Chris Rock stars as a street hustler who just so happens to have a brother who was recently killed while working for the CIA. Anthony Hopkins stars as the crusty old CIA veteran who gets Rock to fill in for his brother on their mission to save the world.This movie is simply warmed over "48 hours". Chris Rock,being a one-trick pony,is loud and obnoxious. Hopkins looks like he is trying to pass a kidney stone. He also mumbles most of his lines as if he is being forced against his will to say the words.I echo what Rock's foster mother states in the movie-"hand me back my umbrella so I can hit you some more". If you watch this movie that is how you are going to feel about Chris Rock.Just down right awful! 2 out of 10.see "48 hours instead"</fullReview>

Every once in a while a movie will come out that by all appearances should be a success. Here you have Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, true an unlikely duo. Nevertheless, they are two people who I was excited to see together in a movie, but unfortunately, they had a disappointing script. I'm not sure if it was suppose to be comedy or an action movie, perhaps both. However, it didn't come across on either genre for me. The plot was weak, the story line lacked integrity, and it was hard for me to follow. Those things spoiled the movie for me. I was expecting something very different. Despite all of this, there was a lot of action and if you're an action movie fan, and like Chris Rocks' humor, you probably will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that makes you think "Why, oh why did he accept to do this garbage?". I obviously refer to Anthony Hopkins. His charm is 100% countered by Chris Rock's bad performance, annoying voice and out of place jokes; at least I think they were jokes since I didn't laugh one time at his wise-cracks.Make no mistake people: Chris Rock is not funny. He's one of the worst comedians ever to come out from Saturday Night Live. He's right up there with Chris Farley, Randy Quaid and Jan Hooks. Now why put him right next to Anthony Hopkins in a movie that was clearly a bad idea from start? In the end it wasn't even worth the experiment.In the first place it's a script you have already memorized: the bum that has to take the hero's place and save the world. I could've done my peace with it if the movie was well done, but not even that I got. The story is boring, the jokes are not funny, the plot is not the least believable... and I can't find more words in my limited english vocabulary to describe how awful this film was. This is the first movie starring Anthony Hopkins I regret to have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This action/comedy, with Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins, died a quick death in the theaters this spring, which is understandable, as it is a bland, forgettable spy spoof!Resurrecting, yet again, the old identical twin gimmick, Rock, a chess-playing ticket scalper, is recruited to replace his dead brother, a CIA operative, on a mission to buy a nuclear device from a renegade Russian. His new boss is played by the always reliable Hopkins, who, unfortunately, is miscast here (He is far too old to be believable in this kind of action role, and giving him a 'girlfriend' who is young enough to be his granddaughter...well, his paycheck was probably big enough that he decided to just shut off his brain and run with the part!)Part of the 'humor' here is, of course, that the street-talkin' , jivin' Rock has to fool enemy agents into believing he is a brilliant, sophisticated man of the world. Naturally, they do, which makes you really worry about the caliber of bad guys carrying around nuclear weapons these days!The film is over-long, poorly produced (it looks like a European film, with poor sound and washed-out color), and a screenplay that teeters uncomfortably between straight action and comedy. All the cliches are trotted out (the dead brother's ex-girlfriend shows up, Rock's own girlfriend is kidnapped, there is the obligatory car chase, etc.), and it all comes across as dull and predictable.There IS one frightening scene, though...at the film's conclusion, Hopkins 'opens the door' for a possible sequel! Now THAT is scary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from the poor box office numbers and even worse reviews, this will probably not be the smash hit of the summer. But is it awful? I wouldn't say so. It has its dull moments, and the plot contains very little originality, but I found it watchable and quite entertaining. My number one fear going into this film was Chris Rock. Now, I like him very much as a comedian, but he tends to have problems distinguishing when he's supposed be a comedian and when he's supposed to be an actor. That's why I was pleasantly surprised by his performance in this film. He shows a lot more discipline than I would expect, especially in the scenes between him and his girlfriend. Unfortunately, in the third act he loses it. That's when he gets caught in high-speed car chases and screams silly lines like "I wanna watch Oprah!" It's silly one-liners like that which decrease the tension of the otherwise spectacular action sequences. But overall, I was impressed with Rock, though he can still use a few acting lessons. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, but he's given a throwaway role as the snooty CIA agent who rolls his eyes any time Rock acts the least bit unprofessional, and every once in a while makes time to squelch out fragments of dry humor. The role could've been played by any fifth-rate actor. Hopkins really isn't given much to do. I didn't appreciate Joel Schumacher's dim use of lighting. It worked well in one of his previous films, "Flatliners," but in that case it fit the tone quite well. In a more upbeat action-comedy like this, I'd expect brighter lighting. But the action scenes are well-done and well-choreographed. As I said, they would've been more fun if Chris Rock were to shut his mouth. "Bad Company" is far from magnificent, but it serves its purpose. I don't suppose I'll watch it on many repeat viewings, though. But I laughed, I had fun. Overall, I had a good time. I'm not suggesting you rush to theaters to see this movie, but it's worth watching. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a number or reasons this should not have been an enjoyable. The plot is a bit simple and reliant on luck and the characters are exaggerated and a little contrived. But that type of plot and characters are essential for a good action comedy.Chris Rock actually toned down his normal on scene persona. He did swear and launch into a tirade or two, but overall it was a fairly moderated performance. He did have some difficulty really pulling off the part of the conservative brother, but that is forgivable. Anthony Hopkins character is a pseudo-stereotyped career spy. No commitments, ice water in his veins, the whole bit.Whatever the shortcomings may be or may seem to be, they don't hurt the movie. The action sequences are well done and the comedy is pretty sharp. Even Anthony Hopkins gets some laughs in his role. A few of the jokes are trite, like the rap jokes, but overall very amusing.I think the best review of the movie I could give is that my dad left the theater and said that it was better than he expected. Which in dad talk means he enjoyed it and didn't think he would. Also it was one of the few movies I have seen recently that I enjoyed start to finish. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware, spoilers! Lots of them!Tourist movie, where behind patching with money, all you can really see is lame producer stitches. Then nasty scars too. Story from Peacemaker transferred in Prague, and spiced with initial death of CIA agent who is shot by Serbs. Without him, purchase of post-soviet A-bomb can't be achieved.That agent (Chris Rock) had a twin-brother. They are adopted separately long time ago, so the other rose only to a level of scalper. Then agency (Hopkins) makes copy of a dead brother from a street bum, with all comic twists which that process bears.Dragan Michanovich (Michelle in movie) shows unbelievable hypocrisy, by accepting to pose Rade Sherbegia in this vomit; while in movie Night is dark (from his native Serbian cinematography - Tamna je noc) he sought maximum of pacifism and humanity. Here, he play's French who swindle Russian, and than he himself is played out by Serbs. Ironic, isn't it?Serbs are lead by some Dragan Adyanich, wanted for war crimes. For what else Serb can be wanted?. He dislike USA so much, that for 20 million$ he doesn't open bar, gas station, or warehouse. Like costume is. Instead of silicone boobies or Merk, he buy's a nuke! Then surrender himself to adventure, which is about to change political scene of today?But the most pervert stupidity is final intrusion of that that person (temporarily absent from ICTY in Hague). Scene is so copied from Peacemaker, that is surprise how they are not sued. Reason why they aren't, is only because Peacemaker is also washout photocopy. Whose original is lost, because it is used as toilet paper by critique of 80's. Climax of perversion is smooth flatulence, which is gushing out when Adyanich holding his funeral oration. That is stylistic figure, in capital-realism (opposition to social-realism) known as: psychopathic anti-American sermon of terrorist unaware that he will soon be dead. I quote: Your country grows fat, while people all over the world starve. You stay at home, you watch our blood spilled on television. War reduced to video game. You take sides in conflicts you know nothing about, dictating to other people how they should live?This is supposed to make Pavlov-like synapse, in every kid who hears this or similar speech, automatically branding speaker as Adyanich's clone. (Type of person known to conduct cannibalism of exhausted grannies, rape of pets, etc.).That's why is in vain to impute Hopkins (and alike) as a great actors and persons. They are just incorrigible, unintellectual, covetous droppings. Chauvinistic farce. There is no need to exhaust yourself with thought that you will ever drink coffee with them, so opinion like this can bring you to unpleasant situation.Black for me, please.</fullReview>

The stupidest scene have to be when the man is trying to kill Chris Rock while he is in the bathroom. Yeah, scream before you reach him and then run into the glass door. Way to go. The other scene i find dumb is when they meet with Peter Stormare in broad daylight and the CIA agents are placed around. Wouldn't someone like the character Peter be suspicious and probably watch his back and look around. How hard is it to spot these CIA agents looking very much like CIA agents in the middle of the day???

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a problem I have with this movie that I think the filmmakers over at Jerry Bruckheimer's company can never fix: Keeping this movie from being made. If I could turn back time and prevent this disaster, it would make my life a lot more complete. Folks, this is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen in years, a travesty of filmmaking that drags on for two hours like Chinese water torture and never eases up. The story is ridiculous because we have a spy, who is good, he dies, and what?! Y'mean he has a twin brother?! How convenient. Chris Rock tries his best to flex his comedic muscles but fails miserably as he tries to deliver these awful, awful one liners that are not only terrible, but you can see in his face that even he doesn't like the jokes. Watching him give these awful wise-cracks is like watching a dying animal and you want to put him out of his misery. He serves one cringe inducing joke after another and never stops, making this movie seem all the more awful. He constantly fumbles and jokes his way through the movie without a laugh to spare, serving as the comic relief to a movie that might have been good had it not been served with such a poor actor. Chris Rock's character Jake is the quintessential African-American stereotyped character in this movie: he's poor, uneducated, wears a lot of gold chains and is a con man. Not to mention, he shoves all these hip hop references down our throats expecting a chuckle, but all he gets is dead silence. This movie is also poor in plot with its cliché spy movie storyline that I've seen done millions of times in much better movies. Anthony Hopkins, the poor man, sleepwalks through this movie often looking tired and bored as he is forced to perform these drawn out tired monologues and terrible stunts while acting alongside Rock who can barely act. The movie also has these caricature villains who serve no purpose other than to scowl, look dirty, and talk about us "Filthy Americans" every second in the movie. We get it, you're mean and intimidating, can we move on, now? Joel Schumacher, a pretentious and overblown filmmaker tries his best to make up for the terrible script through these dramatic camera and action shots that just look gloomy and pathetic. He couldn't possibly make up for this embarrassment, no one could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BAD COMPANY (2002) * Chris Rock, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew Marsh, Gabriel Macht, Peter Stormare, Brooke Smith, Kerry Washington, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon, John Slattery. Lame buddy thriller/actioner/comedy hybrid mess with Rock as the street-smart hustling twin brother of a slain CIA op who is coerced by Hopkins as the dead sibling's partner to stop a nuclear device being smuggled into the USA. No originality, zip chemistry between the odd coupling, stiff dialogue, miscued jokes and been-there-done-that us vs. them Heroes and Villains shoot-em-up nonsense shows how big a bomb can be in the grand Hollywood tradition of bad films.

		<shortDescription>waste of time, money and film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because he gets to play the part of identical twins, Chris Rock is given the opportunity ? rare for a lead player ? of having his character die in the opening scene. Considering the quality of the film as a whole, he might well regret that BOTH characters don't get to bite the dust early on.But stuck in the film he is ? and he, co-star Anthony Hopkins, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joel Schumacher are going to have to live with the stain of this embarrassment on their records for a very long time to come (hence, the appropriately named `Bad Company'). The screenplay by James Richman and Michael Browning tells the tedious tale of one Jack Hayes, a ne'er-do-well New York City shyster, who is employed by the CIA to impersonate the twin brother he never knew he had, a brother who was recently killed in action trying to retrieve a portable nuclear bomb from some Middle Eastern terrorists. Anthony Hopkins plays Gaylord Oakes, a seasoned CIA operative whose job it is to `groom' Hayes for the mission.It would be hard to overestimate just how mediocre this production really is. The storyline is flat and unimaginative, the villains bland and colorless, the humor weak and poorly executed, the action scenes routine and strangely truncated. The `grooming' sequences are particularly unimpressive, since Hayes seems like essentially the same person after the lessons as he was before them (think of it as James Bond meets `My Fair Lady'). About the only news here is that Schumacher seems, for the most part, to have abandoned his Cuisinart-style approach to directing and editing, choosing instead to shoot and splice the film in a basically humdrum, static way. The result is a talky film in which no one says anything that is of even the slightest interest either to each other or to the audience stuck watching the spectacle. Apparently, the action film genre has become so depleted of ideas that the best filmmakers can do at this point is to concoct a fantasy scenario in which a wisecracking Average Joe gets to save the world from total nuclear destruction in time to say `I do' to that longsuffering girl waiting patiently back home. This sort of preposterous premise may work well in `Austin Powers'-like parodies, but it hardly merits serious attention in a straight action-adventure tale such as this one. And frankly, I am beginning to question the appropriateness of using the threat of nuclear annihilation by terrorists as a source for mindless mass audience entertainment. When will some gifted filmmaker finally come along to address this issue with the kind of seriousness and gravity that it so obviously deserves?Neither Hopkins nor Rock can be faulted for their performances. They do the best they can with the material they've been handed. Hopkins, in particular though, needs to start signing on to more challenging assignments before the lease runs out on his reputation as one of the world's premier actors. About the best that can be said for `Bad Company' is that it affords us an opportunity to armchair travel to photogenic Prague (remember `Slaughterhouse-Five'). That exquisite locale at least gives us something to look at for the two hours we're stranded in the theatre. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best action comedy thrillers I have seen in a very very long time.The film is just flowing from one action scene to another , with a very clear pattern of what the problem is and how it is to be solved. Anthony Hopkins is the best the actor I know (Except Morgan Freeman) to play Officer Oakes .As for Chris Rock he is the right man at the right place at the right time. The bad guys are bad!Peter Stormare is the eternal Russian bad guy, doing a good job as such!John Slattery as Roland Yates head of the CIA task force has really nothing else in mind except getting the job done no matter what it takes. Filming on location in Prague adds another taste of the X- "cold war" taste to the movie.All in all: fun,action packed,fast pacing,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie despite the team up between a CIA professional and a street hustler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't get if this movie is suppose to be a spy thriller or a comedy cause it did a terrible job of mixing both. The plot and direction is stupid, especially when it comes to the dialogue. The movie would have worked if it was spontaneous and cool but that isn't the case. The scenes that aren't suppose to be funny is way more funny than the actual scenes that is suppose to be funny. This movie just proved that Chris Rock should never play a serious character although it's short. When it comes to that part of the movie. This movie is just all over the place and isn't put together in a coherent way. The only funny part in this movie is seeing Chris Rock act like a serious character in the beginning. After that he is just plain annoying must of the way through with constant annoying remarks. There is a line that the villain of this movie says at the end that stands out, especially when this movie came out. But it just feels out of place with the rest of the movie which is unfortunate. The idea for this flick might have worked but the execution was just so darn corny and absurd in a negative way. And is mostly just poorly executed with almost no intelligence and wits. The chemistry between the 2 protagonists is alright but didn't go more in depth with it. It's just a easily forgettable movie that isn't worth a second viewing at all. This one probably tried to be another "Enemy of the State" but failed.3.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have say firstly that I never would have thought of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock in a film together, but, it happened, from director Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever, Phone Booth). Basically, while working with him, Officer Oakes (Hopkins) witnesses Harvard educated African American CIA agent Kevin Pope (Rock) killed during an operation. The agency need to finish a project that he was working on, so they recruit his twin brother, street-wise hustler Jake Hayes (Rock again) to do the job. Oakes trains Jake, alias Michael Turner, how to act and talk like his brother, his interests, his social life, and ultimately his lifestyle, ready to face the terrorists, led by Adrik Vas (Fargo's Peter Stormare). After a while, it was obvious the bad guys would discover Jake's real identity, so they kidnap his girlfriend/fiancé Julie (The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington) to get what they want, otherwise they set off a nuclear weapon. Also starring Gabriel Macht as Agent Seale, John Slattery as Roland Yates, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Nicole, Matthew Marsh as Dragan Adjanic and Brooke Smith as Agent Swanson. Hopkins and Rock do make a good buddy duo, Rock does lack a little bit of impact, but Hopkins is great as the dry witted agent, and there are some great chase and gun play sequences. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Title Tells All For the Most Part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Anthony Hopkins &amp; Chris Rock comedy espionage thriller "Bad Company," a slickly-made but superficial doomsday escapade about the CIA's war against terrorism, relies on utterly archaic clichés. Not only does "Bad Company" recycle the identical twin that steps into the shoes of the dead brother that he never-knew, but also the gray-haired spy master who must transform a rebellious rookie into a seasoned undercover agent with no time to spare.Formula filmmaker Jerry Bruckheimer of "Armageddon" and "Black Hawk Down" provides a top-notch cast, atmospheric Czechoslovakian scenery, and a giddy Trevor Rabin orchestral score. Sadly, "Bad Company" lacks slam-bang, cliff-hanger heroics, an inventive plot and intimidating villains. Although director Joel Schumacher of "Batman Forever" (1995) and "A Time to Kill" (1996) keeps the throttle on the momentum wide-open, the second-rate Jason Richman and Michael ("6 Days, 7 Nights") Browning screenplay hampers him from drumming up enough suspense and tension. As far as Chris Rock fares, "Bad Company" surpasses last years' dreadful comedy "Down to Earth." Oscar winning thespian Anthony Hopkins has done far better cloak &amp; dagger derring-do. Check out either "The Looking Glass War" (1970), where Hopkins taught another rookie spy tricks, or the Alistair MacLean epic "When Eight Bells Toll" from 1971. Nevertheless, the pleasure of watching Hopkins create a memorable character and the on-screen chemistry that he evokes with the abrasive but hilarious Rock makes "Bad Company" tolerably entertaining."Bad Company" opens in Prague. CIA agent Oaks (Anthony Hopkins of "Silence of the Lambs") and Pope (Chris Rock of "Lethal Weapon 4") are negotiating with black market Russian Mafia boss Adrik Vas (Peter Stormare of The Big Lebowski") to buy a nuclear bomb in a suitcase for $20 million dollars. Meanwhile, Vas' fearless rival Dragan Adjanic (Matthew Marsh of "Spy Game") and his multi-national suicidal hit squads want the bomb, too. First, Adjanic kills Pope. Second, Adjanic plants saboteurs in Vas' camp. Imagine Adjanic's surprise when he learns that Kevin Pope is alive and kicking in New York City! The CIA discovers that Pope had an unknown identical twin brother that authorities separated at birth. Jake Hayes (Chris Rock) suffered from a childhood illness that reduced the chances of his brother and he finding a suitable foster home, so an overzealous hospital attendant changed their names! Consequently, the brothers were split up permanently. When the CIA catches up with Jake, our hero has acquired a reputation as a chess-playing street hustler who scalps tickets. Jake agrees to impersonate Kevin for $100-thousand dollars. No sooner has Jake joined up than Adjanic's henchmen strike. Just when our heroes think that they have the situation in hand, the villains seize Jake's bride-to-be Nicole (Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon of "Double Take") and force a showdown in crowded Grand Central Station with the countdown clicking off seconds as they swap lead with each other.First, neither creepy Peter Stormare nor gritty Matthew Marsh makes much of an impression as evil adversaries. Second, Jake never proves his mettle in combat. Third, Chris Rock's jokes are too few and far between. Fourth, the CIA blunders so badly you'll wonder if the title doesn't refer to them. Altogether, solid performances as well as a whirlwind pace serve to off-set "Bad Company's" monotonous melodramatic and hoary clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BAD COMPANY is probably the worst spy thriller I have ever seen, and I've seen hundreds of them as a former film reviewer and lifelong movie nut. A CIA veteran played by a sleepwalking Anthony Hopkins must train a schlub played by a very unfunny Chris Rock to pose as an illegal arms buyer in just a few days, and don't ask why. Rock is to purchase a "thermonuclear device in a briefcase." Everything that can go wrong does, but mainly the film is a series of short scenes depicting an aging Hopkins and his crew running around interspersed with scenes of a seemingly endless army of black-garbed assassins trying to rub out Rock -- again, don't ask why. It's simply lazy writing. To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, there is a prolonged fight between one of Hopkins' agents and one of these black-garbed assassins. Problem is, we barely know the agent and have no feeling for him, but the fight goes on at great length as if this CIA guy were the second coming of James Bond. And decent supporting players like Brooke "Crossing Jordan" Smith and Peter "Fargo" Stormare are utterly wasted. What could Joel Schumacher have been thinking? I confess I fell asleep before the big finale. One firefight too many, methinks. I can only hope everyone was blown to kingdom come in the end.</fullReview>

I think the only reason I went was so me and my girlfriend could fool around in the theatre, so we had to pick some movie to see and this was it. I like both Hopkins and Rock, but this movie sucked. Utterly forgettable, stupid crap that is hard to write ten full lines about. Go see Dogma, probably the best Chris Rock movie, or anything else starring Hopkins is better than this. And go hail Satan while your at it, man, how long is ten lines? Jeeze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't that good, it ain't that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Company is a simple action story with many clichés, stupid dialogs and of course - bright special effects.Basically, we have Dr. Hanibal Lecter who trains Chris Rock how to kill in order to prevent more deaths after Chriss Rock's twin brother gets killed at the very beginning of the movie. Why do I think that it is not original and why do I think that it could've been original. I mean, look at the very first scene that I already mentioned. Chris Rock doesn't say 1000 words for like 2 minutes for first time in his career. Now, that's something to cheer for, but everything goes down. Hollywood knows that a huge part of the audience adores the constantly talking Chris and brings the twin brother, who of course is a complete loser, but after he meets Hopkins's character and some more supporting agents training Rock, he becomes the good, funny guy who is capable of absolutely anything, including killing numerous number of heavily armed terrorists.The good thing about the movie is that after all, we watch a legend. Yes, it's one hell of an absurd cast choice, but we get to watch Hopkins in another movie which will happen rarely in the future.Overall, wouldn't recommend it even to die hard action movie buffs. I just can't get through the fact that Hopkins is the main character. Come on, it's a high budget movie. That's not Sir Anthony. It's a big mistake.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-terrorist buddy adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A more unlikely pairing in a buddy-film thriller is hard to imagine, and yet the combination of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock actually works, and not entirely because Hopkins is always so reliably great. The plot is suitably complex, with intrigue and Czech and New York settings and rival groups of bad men and a stolen suitcase bomb and triple-crosses and all that sort of thing. The ostensible mismatch of Rock with a serious part is covered by a complex plot twist in which his unknown identical twin brother is killed and he steps in to save the day. Often amusing and pleasantly complex and frequently tense, the film is entertaining enough. There's quite a bit of post-September 11 mythology going on here, with the CIA reckoning the human cost of terrorism, an extremely well-coordinated emergency response, wonderful technology, and people in charge who mostly know what they're doing. Perhaps this is just wishful thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but nothing more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting, because had this not been a comedy it would have made just as good a action drama on it's own. The story is good, and well-written, but giving it the comic relief from time to time, although funny and well delivered by Chris Rock, almost seemed unsuiting to the picture.Chris Rock's humor was unmistakable for his own, and the movie would not have been nearly as funny without him. In fact, his comic styles are what saved the movie. Anthony Hopkins' character may have been what I hated most, or was it the actor himself? Either one should not have been in the movie. His character was bland and really added nothing, which is why the part should have been a bit smaller, and they should have casted someone not as famous, or as British. His character really ruined the film, and made it less enjoyable to watch, personally.The lines that are delivered, however by Rock, are the best in the film, and those are the most anticipated moments of the film. While there is some action, and great choreographed scenes for a comedy, the rest of the film sort of blends in together, and you're merely waiting for Rock's next come back line.But, because the film was well made and especially for a comedy like this, it was an interesting story with really well-written humor, I gave it a 6. There are not many films out there, that can make you laugh like this one, and definitely when you're talking about an action like this one.Check it out. It's worth the $2 rental fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Schumacher production; decent for a single viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher... a director with a pretty bad reputation among audiences, partly due to him(from the opinions of the fans of the franchise) ruining the Batman franchise, which Tim Burton had done such a good job of resurrecting/building. Many think he's an awful director, but the fact is that he's efficient, fast and cheap. He gets his movies done fast and on a reasonably low budget, compared to many other Hollywood directors. Personally, I find him to be a fairly talentless director, but I haven't seen Phone Booth(which I've heard many great things about), and some claim that his movies are underrated. So here he teams up with Jerry Bruckheimer, the famous Hollywood big-time executive producer who has made tons of newer action flicks, and puts Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins together in a buddy-comedy-action-flick about spies. There's no doubt about it; the film is fairly typical Bruckheimer action flick, and it doesn't have a lot to offer, that we haven't seen before, often better. But I think Rock and Hopkins make a good "odd couple", and they have pretty good chemistry. The plot is pretty tame and typical, and it tries to keep itself interesting by throwing in a bunch of twists. The pacing is decent, and it's possible to sit attentively through the film, once, provided that you like either Hopkins or Rock(or both) enough, and enjoy this type of films. The acting is good enough. The characters are diverse, credible and well-written enough. The action is pretty good, Hopkins has some cool scenes. The humor is good, Rock and Hopkins have some great moments together. The dialog is good, especially between Rock and Hopkins. They play characters exactly like what we've seen from them before, and it works pretty good. All in all, a decent but entirely by-the-numbers action-comedy flick, good for a single viewing for fans of the people involved in the production of the film. I recommend it to big fans of Rock and Hopkins, and possibly Schumacher and Bruckheimer as well. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Comedic Spy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock to do an action movie would be a bit odd, actually they play quite well off one another. Chris Rock is able to put more of himself into this role as a comedian but also comes off surprisingly convincing as a dramatic actor, for the thirty seconds he has to play the role. He also manages to keep up excellently with Anthony Hopkins, who still steals almost every scene he's in. Anthony Hopkins brings his unique quality of being very deadly and very silent to the title, providing the dramatic element to this film. Peter Stormare (Armageddon) rounds the cast as the typical "let's make a deal" spy movie villain. Bad Company doesn't really bring anything new to the genre, and with the talent it boasts, it doesn't really need to. Good, not great, movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Company is more an interesting look for the comic side and not for the action or story line. The story is in fact the usual terrorist-bomb-situation. First I thought this could be another movie ? la Bad Boys II that was real bad but fortunately the dialogs here were much better. Chris Rock played a very good part and his jokes kept us laughing the whole time he was in scene. If you think there is lot of action you are wrong. You have to wait the last 20 minutes until everybody is alarmed. But as I mentioned it is well compensated with funny dialogs between Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins. If you want to spent an entertaining evening this could work otherwise skip it. It is not a must see but worth a watch for the sequences of Chris Rock. Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, this definite draw back did not prevent me from liking it. "Bad Company" moves smoothly and is entertaining enough due to its constant use of humour and comic situations characters are put into. (though, humorous remarks seemed to be overdone in some scenes). Cinematography and music deserve the separate mention. And not to the lesser extent, Anthony Hopkins, who is remarkable as usual. But, why? Why the bomb's timer (or whatever it is called) has to be stopped when there is only one or two seconds remaining before everyone is blown to pieces? And why a director like Joel Schumacher has to opt for a such ridiculous, irrational unwritten Hollywood rule is beyond my comprehension. If you are ready to face and overlook the above mentioned minor flaws of the movie you will most likely enjoy its company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bad Company' got some serious bashing from other IMdB reviewers, and I wonder why. It is average entertainment film, belonging to the action comedy genre, and it does not pretend to be more. We have also certainly seen already many films based on the Afro-American street boy getting rich, or getting in touch with the rich men society. However, the humor in this film is not worse than in many of these, there are some good jokes, and they never fall in vulgarity. Logic is not expected from such movies - are we judging 'James Bond' movies by logic criteria? Acting is decent, and Anthony Hopkins seems to enjoy himself, after that many serious or psycho roles. 7/10 on my personal scale. I enjoyed it, because I took it for what it is.</fullReview>

There was sufficient action, a couple of plot twists (even if nothing that dramatic), some cheesy love story which totally failed as such, but hey that was actually the best part and lots of corny comments that I think were what kept that movie from drowning.Either it was my mood or total despair with last weekend's TV, Bad Company kept me entertained for the entire duration of the film.

		<fullReview>I was expecting a stupid unfunny film, but this turned out to be mildly entertaining, and Chris Rock had some funny lines. The action scenes, like car chase, gun fights, weren't terrible. And I liked Anthony Hopkins in this as the mentor. The best part was Chris Rock wasn't so annoying as in previous movies, like Down to Earth. As the undercover agent, he kept his voice at a normal level instead of sounding like he was yelling all the time.Of course, the ending was typical hollywood. There were no good plot twist or anything.FINAL VERDICT: Not Joel Schumacker's worst movie, but it's not that memorable. If you really like Chris Rock, then you may get a kick out of this; otherwise, there are better action comedies out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you've seen Bruckheimer before? Oh well then you've seen this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Overall impression: 4.5 out of 10: Not bad, but not original)So you like action movies? You like mismatched, inter-racial, buddy, comedy, police/spy movies? You think, hey Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins, what can go wrong? Right?Well actually this movie isn't that bad really. It's more that it is all of the same schlock that we have come to expect from both Bruckheimer and Schumacher(?). Chris Rock plays the street-wise, fish-out-of-water, in a world that he never made (you know the drill) whose highly-educated twin whom he never knew existed, dies, for some reason, and Anthony Hopkins needs him to save the world (see I knew you had seen this movie before). Anyway Rock has to become sophisticated and fool international bad guys (terrorists, I guess). He succeeds and finds love along the way (yeah, the fifth element) despite all odds (ho hum).Anyway the action scenes are mildly exciting, I guess, and the banter might be funny if you are high. The acting is decent, again I guess, despite the fact that the writing is bad. The fighter plane scene is amazing, but I think that that is from another movie.Hey if you are bored and this is on, it won't kill you. But please don't buy this movie on DVD -- it won't be worth it. No one will ask, "oh hey Bad Company, I've been meaning to see that. Wasn't that on the AFI Top 100."Whatever, I didn't pay to see it and I would've wasted those two hours anyway.Good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Bruckheimer disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* out of ****Bad Company is still slightly better than Gone in Sixty Seconds, but the point is, producer Jerry Bruckheimer is churning out crap at an alarmingly fast rate. And with Kangaroo Jack out, he's not slowing down this trend whatsoever (2001's Black Hawk Down proved to be a fluke on his part). The man truly doesn't know a good script when he sees one, and the odd part is, he typically hires decent directors and to helm these pictures, which typically follow a specific formula. You got your heroes on one side, the despicable villains on the other, a countdown clock, and lots of stuff getting shot up real good.Bruckheimer also knows how to draw in A-list actors. Anthony Hopkins is in this film. Anthony Hopkins! And he's paired with Chris Rock, who plays twins here, though the more refined, cultured one is killed off early on, and the plot has to do with the more street-wise half having to pose as his CIA sibling to make a transaction involving a nuclear bomb go smoothly. Hopkins plays his trainer, so you can see the filmmakers were opting for a mismatched buddy picture.But the point is, there's very little about this movie worth mentioning. The premise is silly, but good action movies can be made from a lack of strong plot, right? Last year there was the wonderfully entertaining The Transporter. But no, Bad Company fails from the start because it brings nothing new to the proceedings. Everything is bland and predictable, all the way down to the perfunctory shootouts. The only bright spot is an energetic car chase, but even that is marred by Rock's awful one-liners and Hopkins' unconvincing bid as an action hero.Hopkins and Rock display little to no chemistry. I cannot remember laughing once during the entire film, nor do I recall anything in the way of thrills, excitement, or fun. Jerry Bruckheimer won't be remembered as cinema's worst producer (Dino De Laurentiis, Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan have done much worse), but when people speak his name years from now, it probably won't be out of fondness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead!Sometimes a movie looks interesting when you see the trailers, but when you get round to renting the video you find a bit of junk the insults your intelligence. Like this one.Anyone who has seen the trailers for this film, or has read the other reviews, will know the basic premise. That the CIA, in an attempt to foil an unscrupulous arms dealer who is selling atom bombs for twenty million bucks, have to recruit and train Chris Rock in a mere nine days to replace the twin brother he never knew he had, who was a CIA undercover officer of many years' experience. Yeah, right! `So I have a twin brother. Big deal!' Yes, I think we would all react that way if we heard that news. Very realistic.Okay, so it's a bit of hokey fun. But it's perfectly possible to make improbable dramas without treating the audience with contempt. In this case, the holes in the plot were so huge, and the makers couldn't even be bothered to pretend that the audience would have a mental age above about twelve. I'll only give a few examples: The CIA and the terrorists have a shoot out in a luxury hotel in Prague, complete with machine guns burping out long bursts of fire. Apart from hitting several terrorists, the bullets do no damage whatsoever. The wall, furnishings etc remain totally unscathed. Even the dead terrorists somehow manage not to bleed onto the carpet. What's more, the shooting, as all good gunfights are, tends to be rather noisy. But with all the noise and killing, the local police don't even show up. We are led to believe that the CIA can go anywhere it likes, shoot whoever it wants, and no one else even notices. In an earlier scene, a man (terrorist) has fallen screaming from the roof of a Manhattan skyscraper. Next scene our heroes are in the street and passersby are going about their business normally. No one has even noticed!Maybe a few very young children or people who have lived in caves were taken in, but I think that all the rest of us knew immediately the atom bomb started ticking down to zero that it would NOT explode, that Chris Rock WOULD manage to disarm it, but of course he wouldn't manage to do it until absolutely the last moment, preferably with just a few seconds to go. And lo and behold, it all happened just like that! Gosh! By the way, wasn't it considerate of the terrorists to use a bomb that had a convenient digital display on it to tell you just how long you had before it was supposed to explode! But then I expect all bombs are like that.This movie was just plain bad. Don't bother with it.</fullReview>

This movie would have gotten at least a 9 if it was supposed to be a parody of... well, this exact kind of movie. But unfortunately, Anthony Hopkins and comedy don't mix.</fullReview>

Or was it just a whole lot of indistinguishable dark slavic-looking and mostly suicidal baddies blazing away non-stop with automatic weapons, and who simply couldn't hit the target (except once, to kill Kevin), and a couple of goodies who could not only dodge bullets by the million but also survive without a scratch major frontal car impacts when not wearing seat belts. Even the chess playing scene at the start, supposedly indicative of Jake's superior intelligence, was total crap. His opponents, who apparently fancied themselves at least enough to be playing for $20 a game, demonstrated less understanding of elementary tactics than our eight-year-old currently does. Clearly they didn't bother to consult anyone with the slightest expertise on the game. This was altogether indicative of the standard of what was to follow, and I wonder why I stuck with it for another hour from that point on. I guess this was because the presence of Anthony Hopkins made me keep thinking it must be about to get better. Why on earth did an actor with his profile and reputation ever get himself involved in an amateurish B movie like this?2/10, and only because I'm feeling generous.</fullReview>

I actually tried, after seeing the movie, to recall a scene or a sequence in the movie which wasn't a cliche. I can't think of one!The worst part however which is truly horrific on whole new levels is when Anthony Hopkins' character tells Rock's character about the nuclear bomb. What I find absolutely frightening about this is that the person who is responsible for the script actually thought that somebody old enough to watch this still doesn't know what an atomic bomb is and what it does. I could go on with this but I'll try not to. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and not worth the effort in any way.

		<fullReview>This film is rather dull. At times Hopkins' performance livens things up but frankly he isn't that well suited to an action style role. This was very similar in some ways to Enemy of The State, however, Hopkins was asked to do things they did not have Hackman doing. Essentially particularly towards the end, Hopkins was asked to pull off the incredible role of the over 60's hardman role. Hopkins at times cut an absurd figure fighting with a fit 20 year old terrorist on the outside of the car during a car chase. It was sad to see such a good actor so badly cast.Chris Rock... don't give up the comedy! His performance wasn't great, though to be fair it was far from awfull. The material he had to work with was god awfull though and he would have really had to pull something off to make this film funny. The jokes were poor, and the characters were poorly developed (if developed at all!) so there was little in the way of character centred, situation comedy laughs. The comedy relied on tired 'I'm a nigger man' style jibes from a fast talking Chris Rock. Suffice to say it doesn't really work, and particularly not in this setting since all the other characters were so unbelievebly staight laced and humourless. The other characters bizzarely didn't even react to his jokes. All in all the humour was a let down and the film was incredulous.The action was simply stupid and formulaic. The makes had obviously planned to get all the key components of an action film in and the plot was loosely tied around this playing to the demographics. The set ups seemed manidotry and banal, the combat ludicrous and smug, and the plot twists cringeworthy. For gods sake, at one point the CIA implanted a device under Rock's ear so they could hear everything he could - however, the tracking device they put on Rock's car was larger than a frizby -=huge=- and was so loosely clipped on the underside that it dropped off when they went over a bump in the road! the terrorists on the other hand implanted a Global Positioning system into his phone using a microchip. Oh god, I could go on, but there were so many stupid errors.This film isn't the worst ever, however it is dull. It's crammed with ill thought out action scenes, has a very weak plot, and abjectly fails as a comedy. The comedy fails so badly that they even drop it after about an hour and a half and revert to bad action.</fullReview>

The premise is not as far fetchedas many spy stories: a CIA agent is killed in the middle of buying astolen nuke and recruiting his street-living twin is the only way tosave the deal. There are more spy movie cliches than I wouldprefer, but there are also a few fresh ideas. In a key chase scenethe good guys lose because they are simply out fought. Even theinevitable bomb defusing scene with the red count down timer(these must be required under some Hollywood union contract)has a clever plot twist where our hero get to use his street smarts.I suspect many of the critics weren't able to follow the action wellenough to get it.

Joel Schumacher has once again displayed his "hack" mentality for film making, displaying a dull collection of images which have little heart, but only work at the lowest level. What was Anthony Hopkins thinking? Did he need to bide some time before finishing Red Dragon or something? And why would he work beside Chris Rock? Why would anyone want to work next to one of the most racist (and I mean Rock for his excessive use of the N-word) individuals in the world who has little respect for his own race and culture?

		<fullReview>That cliches and plot threads are stranded into the action and comedy, making some decent entertainment, that while does go for the entertaining, doesn't go for much else, which it could've. Directed by Joel Schumacher, it has his good humor (along with Rock's), but also has the Bruckheimer edge which entails quick camera moves and one liners even in a chase scene where it's hard enough to keep track of the cars.Here, Rock has two roles, but the first gets killed off while on a CIA mission. The other is a ticket scalper and record spinner who gets recruited by the higher ups to pose as his dead brother to make a deal and get a bomb; Hopkins plays the boss figure, Stormare the bomb seller. There is enough room for Rock to roam, and he does with his dialogue and (sometimes) acting, and even includes some of his own lines in ad-lib style (ex: I'll eat a pig's *ss if they cook it right). Hopkins does what he can, though he could've done more, and the last act seems like every other action film we've seen this side of the hemisphere. So, it's not the highlight in the director's or stars careers, yet it's a getaway for a couple of hours and its intended audience will feel averagely fulfilled. B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Risky Movie, but it Worked Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater knowing that the critics already panned the movie. But by the time the credits finished, I felt hopeful. The production, cinematography was rich and deep, there was a feeling of seriousness but with a touch of humor. The blending of comedy and spy-thriller is not easy at all to produce and play well. But Anthony Hopkins played a CIA supervisor caught in the middle between someone telling him what to do and Hopkins trying to tell someone else what to do, a rather different angle and change for him. There was a seriousness throughout this movie that made the movie flow with intensity and Chris Rock didn't come across as some super hero. He came across as a serious actor who knows something about humor.This movie was about relationships, loyalty, about a CIA that was portrayed more real than most movies. The CIA in this movie made mistakes, wasn't invincible, but pressed ahead. I loved this movie, the risks that everyone took on this movie. The critics apparently just didn't understand what they producers and scriptwriters, and what Chris Rock was trying to accomplish here. I don't like Chris Rock usually, but in this movie he really impressed me with his ability to be serious and at the same time funny. This movie was believable, even the bad guy at the end who made a strong statement about "why" there is terror in the world.But Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins really were the heroes here because what movie really was about was people and what was really important about living. Commendations go to the Director, Chris Rock, and Anthony Hopkins for making a movie, getting out of the box and pushing the envelope by making something real, not superficially dumb. Chris Rock stood up for something that usually gets swept under the rug, and that is respect and devotion. He's not even the hero's hero in this movie and he doesn't try to play a role that's over the top here. And that demonstrates Chris's integrity as a good actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE IS BAD COMPANY FOR ANYONE WHO SEES IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the sneak preview of this BAD movie and it is a shame that such a good talent as Anthony Hopkins has to stoop so low to earn a living. Rock is rock and what more can I say. If you have to see this bomb then wait for the video stores to have it for rent. As far as I am concerned this movie was a total waste of time and talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Company? Bad Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you see a movie which obviously got slammed together by a bunch of deal-makers with nary a thought (or clue) about what it would take to entertain an audience. So it is with "Bad Company," which is at least aptly named.The "story" is one cliche after another, with plenty of bullets flying (you know the sort - with the bad guys shooting machine guns and never hitting anyone; the good guys standing calmly in the line of fire and picking off the bad guys with their revolvers).On paper, pairing Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins probably seemed great (the studio moguls no doubt thought this could be another "48 Hours" or "Beverly Hills Cop"). Unfortunately, no one created characters for the leads to play. Rock (who seems more talented than the material) is sometimes streetwise, smart and cool...yet at other times shrieks and mugs shamelessly like Stepin Fetchit. Hopkins character is utterly unreadable. Other characters are strictly of the cookie-cutter variety. You won't know their names...or care.This is an action comedy with no laughs, no suspense, sub-par production values, and a storyline which is uncomfortable (if not downright distasteful) in these post 9/11 times. "Bad Company" is a bad time at the movies. VERY bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter, utter waste of time, money and celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming as it does from stable of Ultra Philistine, Jerry Bruckheimer, I should have been prepared for the worst but Bad Company left me slack jawed with astonishment at its crassness.First, let's examine what I laughingly refer to as the plot. Prague-based art dealer and all round sophisticat, Michael Turner (Chris Rock) leads a double life as a CIA counter-terrorist operative. In a botched operation against uber terrorist, Dragan Adjanic (Matthew Marsh), Turner is killed. The search is now on, led by his CIA handler, Oakes (Anthony Hopkins), to find Turner's long lost twin brother, Jake Hayes, train him in espionage, history of art and haute cuisine, and fool the Russian Mafia into handing over a nuclear device to the good guys before Adjanic can get his evil, America-hating hands on it. And all of this in, count them, nine days! Phew!If it were only the fact that Chris Rock is so chronically miscast as the Jake Hayes/Kevin Pope/Michael Turner character that makes this movie a candidate for a Thanksgiving pardon, the cracks could have been papered over and we might have ended up with a dumb but enjoyable spy caper. However, added to this noxious brew is some of the laziest, most clunking dialogue ever committed to celluloid, a leaky plot that would have a five year old with learning difficulties collapsed in paroxysms of mirth, a visibly embarrassed Anthony Hopkins and, last but by no means least, the wretched and overwhelmed Chris Rock, whose supposedly legendary one liners and ad libs are about as funny as a three day funeral.The result? Directed by the normally reliable Joel Schumacher who brought us gripping, topical and generally sympathetic stuff like Falling Down, Tigerland and Veronica Guerin, this must surely be kept squirreled away in his attic alongside Batman and Robin. In Bruckheimer's long, painful litany of truly awful contributions to popular culture, this baby takes the palm.But don't take my word for it. There can surely be no more ringing condemnation of this movie than Hopkins' statement (possibly the funniest and truest line in the whole sorry mess) in the "Making Of" puff piece that inevitably accompanies most DVD packages these days, that his agent had told him the project would be "a welcome change of pace." One way of putting it, Tony!I can't avoid the conclusion that the world would be a better place if Jake Hayes had never been found and the bomb had been detonated somewhere near Sunset and Vine.If you see this bloated piece of festive poultry coming up the street, don't just cross the road, move to another town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Company? Bad Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How boring can a film be? Bad Company is a good example. Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins star, and not either one lights up the screen. Anthony Hopkins seems very held back, like the director was telling him, "Listen, Anthony, Chris is the star. If you outstage him, we look stupid. Try to hold back a bit." And when Chris Rock is on stage, you feel like yelling "Get a life!" So my point is, if you think the title has nothing to do with the film, you're wrong. Bad Company truly is bad company to have around. Can't you see the irony? 1/4 starsJOHN</fullReview>
