		<shortDescription>A Dark Comedy that comes out shining very bright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I absolutely loved it. With each successive viewing, I noticed the characters' emotions as they coped with the dirty hand that has been dealt to them and making the most of it. I also saw the immense bond between the men as they already shared the low-class existence and a rather bleak future but seeing nothing but an opportunity to be rich. And they were all willing to endure the humiliation in front of hundreds of people to achieve it.Like M*A*S*H, the Full Monty shows people placed in a harrowing existence with seemingly no end in sight. Yet the laughs are sprinkled throughout nicely, and even though each man has their own personal fears to overcome, they find strength in each other, which makes the experience all the more fruitful.The actors were absolutely top notch, particularly Robert Carlyle. I was already impressed with his performance from Trainspotting to know that he is very capable of carrying the central figure of the movie. Peter Cattaneo's direction was inspired, and he knew the right angles to use (check out the scene when the lads were auditioning new members, particularly Guy) for perfect comedic effect.I admit that some of the sub-plots needed more fleshing out, particularly between Gaz and Nathan as well as Gerald and his wife. And as many times as I've seen the movie, I don't know much about Guy other than his love for Singing in the Rain and his obvious natural endowment that took the breath away from his mates!The music was terrific as well. I dare anyone to deny that they had to consciously stop tapping their feet when hearing "Hot Stuff" after watching this movie.I have been to Sheffield recently, so the movie holds even more personal meaning for me. And for all those complaining about the accents being difficult to understand, watch it again. It's in English not Chinese! The accents are part of the charm. I rate this movie a solid 8.5 out of 10 and worth seeing many times over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I've always appreciated in British films is that the actors look like Real People. I don't mean unattractive, but just normal everyday looking, unlike Hollywood actors who are exceedingly pretty with perfect teeth and stylish clothes, and unlimited bank accounts, no matter what their occupation. In this film, a group of unemployed steelworkers decide to put on an amateur strip show to make ends meet. It is presented as a comedy, but it does have some very moving moments, as it shows the despair and desolation of unemployment. And it subtly displays the economic conditions of Thatcher's England, where entire industries were shut down, taking jobs and local economies along with them. As in other British films, the characters seem real, like people we would know if we lived in their town. I can picture having a pint down at the local pub with Gaz and Gerald more than, say, Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still blessing the day I taped it without knowing anything about the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Full Monty about a month ago on TV and as soon as I saw it was coming up, I rushed to find a blank videotape for it. I didn't know what to expect but somehow I had this feeling that I HAD to tape it. And blimey, was it worth it! Now I watch the film every weekend and I enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I saw it. I love its style, its humour, everything. It's nice to see average people whose only goal was to get a job and in order to achieve it, they're willing to do anything. I've purchased the soundtrack as well, and I can clearly state that it's worth buying if you like 70's music. I think it's become my favourite film. It's so simple and that's why I like it, because at the same time it's greatly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how many times I've seen it, and there's been lots, I laugh so hard it hurts. The characters are so endearing, especially little Nathan, that you just love them all. The music is great, and there are moments that tugged at your heart as well as make you laugh out loud. And the final stripping scene is fabulous! Glad to see Gaz finally got in time with the music. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great British Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy combine with a great support cast to bring one of the freshest comedies in years to the big screen. Set in Sheffield after the great 'City of Steel' Days, there are more people in the dole queue, than out at work.Struggling for money the pair decide that if the Chippendale's can get the kit off and make a packet, then why can't they. They recruit some more strippers, all desperate for some cash, and promise the city the Full Monty. Now all they need is to learn how to dance, learn how to overcome there fear of the Full Monty and sell some tickets.This film is a very funny view of a struggling community in what was once a thriving city. Great characters, slick and realistic dialogue and great direction, this is one of the finest British comedies ever.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this got praised all over the place, I avoided seeing it at first because I was afraid it would be a letdown. But it's not, not in any way. This continues a tradition of sorts; while back in the 50's and early 60's, the British were known for their kitchen-sink, angry young man dramas (like "Room at the Top" or "Look Back in Anger"), now they seem to be putting comic spins on them, and it's working. Not only do you laugh (especially when Horse is at the Unemployment Office after the videotape of them dancing has been released to the public, and when he says he hasn't been up to anything, the clerk says, "That's not what I heard"), but the characters and where they come from are taken seriously and are three dimensional, so you care about them. The humor comes from real situations, not sitcom humor. A real winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bunch of losers make for a winning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great black comedy. A bunch of losers down at the job centre have no hopes of getting a job. As the film progresses, it picks up momentum as the big date approaches. Some great scenes of 80's Britain, the job centre, the clubs, the houses with paper-thin walls and low ceilings. You know what the finale is going to be, but it doesn't detract at all from the enjoyment of the film. It doesn't get political, as some other commenters have complained, but why should it? This is about the consequences of 80's Britain, not the causes. The characters are 100% believable, in their appearances and their behaviour. The fat one is the sort you see on a Saturday night in just about every city centre pub in England (and at the football matches too!). A pity some viewers from across the pond couldn't pick up the accents, that's not altogether surprising but consider that this film was probably not originally intended for worldwide distribution and if you had taken the accents away you'd have taken away also a lot of its charm.PS: Sheffield, where the film was based, is actually quite a nice town in many areas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's one to do after the factory closes and you're left unemployed? For six Brits, the answer is quite simple: go "The Full Monty" (which means "all the way"). Led by the soft-spoken Gaz (Robert Carlyle), they decide to become male strippers. Along the way, some unexpected things happen, but it's a great movie from start to finish. And it had one of the best soundtracks that I've ever heard (I'd never even heard "You Sexy Thing" before I saw this movie). With top-notch performances by Carlyle, Mark Addy, Tom Wilkinson, Steve Huison, Paul Barber and Hugo Speer, this is one movie that everyone should see. It's not only funny, but takes a look at the dying dream of eternal success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seductive, playful piece of comic gumption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Full Monty offers a seductive, playful piece of comic gumption: Six unemployed steel workers become amateur male strippers, baring themselves as an antidote to the dole. The title is British slang for "buck naked," but the film isn't about nudity, or lust, exactly. It takes as its subject the free-falling sense of desperation provoked by unemployment. As these flaccid bodies strive to exude "sexiness," director Peter Cattaneo turns their struggle into a blue-collared survival reflex, which yields a thin yet agreeable amount of emotional weight.Robert Carlyle plays a bitter but devoted divorced father trying to meet his support payments so his son will trust him, and Mark Addy just wants to provide for his nurturing wife, who worries about the secret G-string buried in her flabby husband's underwear drawer.Suffering ritual-humiliation for the sake of loved ones, these men pawn their dignity for economic survival. Cattaneo allows the script to hint at the social and fiscal conditions endured by the working-class under Thatcher, but mostly he avoids politicizing the material. Instead, he aims for rowdy, laugh-out-loud passages about awkward pseudo-debauchery. Perhaps The Full Monty settles for rather broad, coarse humor, but it has intensely pleasing charms and Cattaneo gives it an unexpected deadpan consistency. He exposes the comedy of shame, and then the comedy of shamelessness.ERIC BELTMANN</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Full Monty" ranks among my all-time favorite movies. I've watched it in excess of thirty times so far and I never get tired of it.I think there are characters and moments we can all relate to in this film. Family and job struggles, feeling lost and confused and lacking direction and motivation. Feeling insecure about one's looks. Financial strain. It's really just a wonderful story. As amazing as the premise is - working-class men doing a striptease - it is written, presented, and acted so well that you can absolutely believe the story. Tough times and desperation bring these six very different men together for money, and sweetest of all, the love of a child.I came away thinking that the characters in this film were much better off as a result of their experience. A little jingle in their pockets and a better understanding of themselves. New friends and new bonds. I can imagine that they were more confident, hopeful, and satisfied with their lives. It is an inspiring story told with humor, dignity, and warmth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unbeatable movie! I saw it at the theater in 1997 along with about 7 other women...we all went to the theater alone because our hubbies refused to take us! Seriously...I did not know one single woman in the theater that day! We all loved the movie right off...My sister bought it and we watched it with captioning, and boy had we missed a lot of lines at the theater and funny ones at that! You see with the English accents and all their slang-- you just can't understand a lot of what they are saying...Watch this movie with and without the captioning! It's like watching a movie with English being your second language, and I B.S. you not!The English working class has a different way of expressing themselves--its so charming and hilarious...I think Robert Carlysle is brilliant "Gaz". I cannot think of anyone who could have done it better. This movie cannot be beat! I bought it and recommend it to everyone!! Definitely a ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming film from the other side of the pond about a bunch of working class blokes at the ends of their ropes who decide to stage a strip show for cash. The gimmick is that they promise to go "the full monty," much to the delight of their wives and girlfriends."The Full Monty" was a minor sensation in 1997, and started a movie trend that exists to this day: the little indie film that could and makes it all the way to the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards. I don't know that it's quite that good, but you could probably fit three "Full Monty"s into one "Titanic," the film that DID win Best Picture that year, and if I had to pick one of them to watch again now, I'd pick the naked dudes over the sinking ship any day.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember this movie when it originally came out. It looked interesting, but I was younger at the time and I wasn't allowed to watch R-rated movies. Later, I finally saw this movie about three years ago on HBO. I laughed my a** off. It was so freakin' funny and I still think it is funny. I bought the "Fully Exposed" two disc DVD and I still love this movie. Yeah some people don't understand British humor, but I love it still. I grew up watching Bristish shows like "Mr. Bean" and "Are You Being Served?" I love those shows and I love this movie, I think it is one of the best comedies ever made. I highly recommend it, you will laugh as hard as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Fun Up North</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Catteno and writer Simon Beaufoy, back in 1997, offered a fresh perspective on the post-industrial austerity of life in Northern England. Not for them the poverty and despair of, say Ken Loach, but a story of redundant ex-steelworkers in Sheffield for whom male stripping is the last and only resort.The film begins with an old promotional film extolling Sheffield's virtues made in the early 1970s, when industry was thriving. Jump forward 25 years and the steelworks upon which so much of Sheffield's employment depended have long gone into liquidation. "Who wants to buy a rusty girder" is the opening line spoken by Dave (Mark Addy), as he and his mate Gaz (Robert Carlyle) steal from their long abandoned works. Another former employee is the middle-aged former manager of the steelworks Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), a man whose pride won't allow him to tell his wife he's been on the dole for six months.The film's strength is that it never sentimentalises the plight of being out of work. The six principles become a Yorkshire version of the Chippendales at the local working men's club for no other reason than they need a grand in their back pocket - it's either that or playing cards at the Job Centre or working as a security guard in Asda.THE FULL MONTY free-wheels around the streets, parks, working men's clubs, supermarkets and abandoned factories of its North of England setting. Everyone and everything looks bona-fide and real, with dialogue that's rich in the brogue of Yorkshire ("Chuffing Nora") and comic moments such as the audition scene which are spot on. The cast are uniformly good, with Wilkinson a stand-out. The director's coup-de-grace is the final freeze-frame just as the cast (backs to the camera) expose all to the audience. It's an uplifting story of team spirit, much copied since but rarely bettered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I got out of this movie was more than I expected. It first came out with a lot of hype when I was about 11 so I didn't think I'd enjoy this dark looking English comedy at all. After recently catching a screening of it I was wrong. At that age I would've enjoyed it and it's still up to date to this day. The story and characters were marvelously funny and realistic. It seems to just keep you in your chair wondering what the next blunder for the ill-fated group of friends will be. You would probably be used to seeing perfect looking Hollywood pretty boys, but this film goes to a better length and it's cast consists of average looking everyday English Joes.An unemployed steel worker named Gaz running low on funds desperately needs money otherwise his wife receives soul custody over their son Nathan. After breaking in to a strip club he gets a crazy idea. With his best friend Dave, the two of them band together a group of four more steel workers in short of greens. To make proper cash they all decide they need to do something original. To go where not many have gone before. To go the full monty. Translation strip to their bare full skin.The humor mixed with the music makes up for a very enjoyable time. It's sharp, original and witty. A classic. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've laughed so much while watching a movie. This six-pack of regular Joes really becomes very likable. And they're played by an excellent cast. Each and everyone of them doesn't look like an actor, if you know what I mean. A great comedy, but also a very touching film. There's nothing funny in the harsh economic reality that these guys (and a lot of others) have to endure. The soundtrack is excellent. There's even Gainsbourg "Je t'aime moi non plus" in it. A movie that you just want to see again! Seen at home, in Toronto, on February 11th, 2006.87/100 (***?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just caught this film again on television a couple of nights ago and found it just as endearing and charming as when I first saw it in the theaters upon its original release. The flawed characters are believable, the little boy is adorable and the situations hit close to home. Besides being a light comedy, the film in its subtle way makes an effective commentary on the wages of capitalism, or, to be more direct and precicee, what happens when capitalism takes wages away. Some viewers might find the accents and the slang a little bit tricky to follow, but they are part and parcel of the production and could not be altered. I think most people could figure it out OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few films that I would watch more than once, but "The Full Monty" is one of the very few. Every time it's on television, I have to see it again, despite having it on video and DVD.This film has to be watched more than once as first time round, you might be laughing so loud that you miss the next bit.The beauty of this film is that the humour comes from the characters and their situations, rather than being contrived, as so many other films are. The interaction between Dave and Gaz is totally believable.The main characters are all likable in their own way, they are the sort of people you could quite happily have a drink with (with the possible exemption of Lomper, who might have you reaching for the anti-depressants).Gaz and Dave, both unemployed, decide to make money by becoming strippers. Along the way, they recruit Lomper, after rescuing him from a suicide attempt, Gerald, their ex boss, who has had dance lessons, and whose job it is to try to teach them to dance, Guy, who can't sing or dance, but is well endowed, and Horse, who can actually dance. 6 guys less like the Chippendales you would be unlikely to find. Gaz, with his froggy face, Dave, the "fat bastard", skinny Lomper etc.The main plot concerns the group getting ready for their big night, and there are some hilarious scenes when they are learning. But there are plenty of sub plots, Gaz's relationship with his young son, Nathan, Dave's marital problems, Gerald hiding the fact that he is out of work from his wife, Lomper's ailing mother.The characters are believable and perfectly cast. They argue, confide in each other, display insecurity about getting their gear off (Horse actually orders a penis enlarger). The ending is a bit obvious, but there's no way it detracts from the enjoyment of the film. One to be treasured.Oh, and the music is pretty damn good, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty is the type of movie that surprises you from the get go, even though you know the general idea of the plot (6 unemployed steelworkers decide to become strippers), that's because all of them become so lovable you're rooting for them to succeed at the end of the movie in a big way.The story mainly focuses on three of the six. Robert Carlysle plays an divorced shlub trying to make a good impression on his son, A pre Academy Award Robert Wilkinson plays a meek shlub trying to protect the quality of life his wife enjoys, and Mark Addy plays an overweight shlub trying to keep his marriage going.All these characters are wonderful, so much so, you're wondering why the other three are somewhat undeveloped. Some have rather large question marks on them, like why is the black character's family is there for the dress rehearsal, like why is that? And the whole revelation of a gay romance between two characters is surprising, interesting, and also tossed into the wind.But those are minor points to s rather wonderful movie. This movie deserved all the attention it got, and it's too bad the film lost the Academy Award for best original screenplay (Damn you Good Will Hunting! lol)</fullReview>

That the guys are for the most part ordinary physical specimens (one dancer excluded) makes this fun, it's an odd sort of male-bonding thing. The characters and dialogue also make the movie special, it would be enjoyable to see the boys interact even under ordinary circumstances. The two male leads are exceptional, as is Wilkinson as the stodgy ex-boss who eventually buys into the idea. The unemployment line scene - where each "dancer" unconsciously works through their routine when their dance number is piped in - is an all-time movie sequence.

		<shortDescription>A gem of human comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying, if you're looking for slap-shtick comedy and low- rent toilet humor, this is NOT the movie for you. It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure. This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.Gaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100). But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves. The women have jobs; the men have job fairs. Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born. Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.The idea is preposterous. Only one of the six men in the new dance troupe is good-looking enough to pull it off (pun intended); the rest are either fat, skinny, old and/or ugly. But the movie's gentle suggestion is that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but so is self-respect...and in following through with their plans, they gain a LOT more than just 2000 pounds each.Robert Carlyle is good as the anchor of the piece, always pushing and planning and cajoling and begging and even stealing, as need be, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this movie work -- from Tom Wilkinson as a manager ashamed to tell his wife he's lost his job to Mark Addy as a man who's so ashamed of how fat and unattractive he is, he's driving his wife away right down to Hugo Speer and his joyful "let's have a blast" attitude."The Full Monty" is a gem of human comedy aimed not at the gut but at the sense of hope we all carry. I recommend it for anyone who needs a lift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When The Full Monty was released in 1997, it didn't make the multiplex cinemas until after the Oscar nod. A friend and I drove to an "art house" theater to see it. My friend, not normally given to undignified behavior, was literally falling out of her seat and snorting with laughter. Recently, I saw her again after almost a year of absence, and over dinner she said, "I can't stand in the line at the bank without thinking about The Full Monty and 'Hot Stuff'." That's how much staying power the film has.Not to get too analytical (a requirement for an English major), I loved the mixture of metaphor, irony, and pathos. The metaphor or symbolism of the men's emasculation by their unemployment (and the women seeming to have jobs and money) being reversed by literally revealing their manhood is unmistakable. More importantly, they regain their self worth by thinking of, organizing, rehearsing, and finally performing their own work. They are willing to do whatever it takes. They CAN be successful on their own.The irony of the men having to deal with the double standard of being judged solely on looks, especially after Gaz and Dave "rate" a couple of women they pass on the street, is delectable to any woman in the viewing audience. Wrinkle cream, cling film, sun beds, sexual "enhancement" devices...the men turn to them all, just as women have forever, and with about the same result.The pathos revolving around Gaz's love for his son, Nathan, and his despair at the threat of losing him made my eyes well up, especially in the scene when Nathan wants Gaz to go swimming with his mother and her smarmy boyfriend. Robert Carlyle's barely withheld tears should resonate with divorced parents. Based on that one scene alone, Carlyle should have won an award. Of course, Dave's crisis of confidence both in and out of the bedroom, as well as Jean's loving attempts to help her "big man," are also moving moments, especially in the final 20 minutes. Lomper's finally making friends and getting some positive attention in the factory band is also heartwarming. His desire for friends is so palpable it hurts, and his entire life is changed by the kindness of a bunch of scruffy blokes who, in another time, probably would have either been oblivious to him or among the men snickering behind his back. He even gets a love life, also ironic, for reasons I won't go into here.Some men of my acquaintance announced that the movie was the most depressing thing they had ever seen. I, naturally, had to show them the error of their ways. All they saw were a group of losers forced to humiliate themselves to make money. Some people are so LITERAL. If that's all you saw, please watch again and look for the uplifting themes that are partly the reasons for the movie's success.I can watch this film over and over and always enjoy it. I revisit the "gang" like old friends and I'm sorry when the credits roll and they are gone until the next time. Each character is so richly drawn that they become real people, not props or scenery with lines. Like a child watching The Wizard of Oz and wishing Oz really existed, I watch The Full Monty and wish that I, too, could have been in that night club audience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really clever and challenging film that toys with convention and gender situation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With The Full Monty, you have a film that entertains; humours; deals with real life issues that were very sensitive to some and also a film that takes clichés and ideas we have about certain archetypes and manipulates them. The Full Monty is really at time a very bizarre although touching look at the crisis' men faced in Northern England at the time of production although the situation was far more serious ten years previous to these events. The film plays with the notion of obligatory scenes, draws us into thinking one thing before surprising us with another and generally makes a mockery out of stereotypes.The film begins with a short series of scenes revolving around the city of Sheffield, a Yorkshire based city. It'll sound silly but I had a hard time in deducing whether or not this was genuine. Certainly the footage seems real but the voice-over was surely a 'mocking' voice; spoofing that upper-class, posh voice-over you used to get dictating the football highlights or informing us over newsreels. If the voice was genuine, why was it not a northern voice of Yorkshires respective area? The manipulation and toying with what's what has only just begun. Then there is the immediate downbeat 'cut' to thirty years later and an empty factory in a drab looking area of the world ? surely we are meant to laugh, but in doing so you are laughing at great failure and a heartache of epic proportions since so many people lost so many jobs to do with factories as well as mines.Then again perhaps this newsreel footage early on is a reason why the film did so well in America. At a time when the American cinemas were lapping up 'dark' comedies in Pulp Fiction, Fargo and Go, The Full Monty can certainly be seen as a 'realist' urban drama focusing on respective inhabitants of a certain built up area. Does it matter if it's Los Angles or Las Vegas or Sheffield if the general material is so similar? The reason the newsreel introduction is so perfectly placed is because it informs us of the setting, tells us what things used to be like before hitting us with some dark comic timing ? we are informed, entertained and then humoured.Then there is the film's primary theme. The film is about a group of men who, in times of desperation, must scrape the bottom of the barrel in order to get by. In this case, factory workers must 'relegate' themselves to the level of strippers. This idea that one archetype that is the hard bodied, macho steel worker must become a male stripper is just the beginning. Indeed, Gaz (Carlyle) the leader of the gang vents his evident hatred of male strippers very early on in the film labelling them homosexual and generally insulting them to this degree - it is a set up that he will come to regret doing. But the other members of the group act as interesting distractions of humour above anything else. Indeed, when they must dance in front of the male dominated panel during the auditions, the panel must look (or gaze) on in a reluctant homoerotic manner because if they do not, they cannot judge whether the audition is a good enough dancer; if they cannot judge that, they cannot say whether he can make the team and then there's no team which means no job and they're back to square one.So this idea that identity is something we all fabricate is raised here. British films Chariots of Fire showed us males can be track athletes; Brassed Off showed us men can get together and partake in a brass band and in a few years time, Billy Elliot showed us males can be ballerinas. It is just that The Full Monty tells us males can adopt the role of strippers on demand. But it is more than unemployment the protagonist Gaz must go through. He has is domestic issues, his divorce and the possibility of loosing his son ? there is a scene in which a social service member asks the son about 'how often does you father take his clothes off in front of you?' Do we laugh at this? Do we feel frustrated that Gaz isn't being allowed to set thing straight? Or do we do both? The film again challenges us to laugh or question how involved we are with the situation, much like the opening newsreel scene. The situation is set up, developed and then shot down again.But the film pays with convention and the obligatory. The training montage is thrust upon us before being unpredictably cancelled again when there is a sudden cutting of the music during a training routine ? apparently someone did it wrong again. Then there is the scene in the living room when everyone must bare all for the first time. The door opens and you expect it to be the home owner's wife, but the film's smarter for it to be merely that. Although the best idea the film raises is its gender point if view. When the lads look at a porn magazine, they realise that they themselves will be the object of the gaze when they perform to loads of women but they dismiss this early on ? they are male, they're different, right? Wrong, and this realisation I think should be shared by an audience who have been brought up on 'shot, reverse shot' in Hollywood films. The Full Monty challenges, informs but also entertains on several different levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unemployment is no joke (as an ex-pat Brit living and sometimes working in the US, I can confirm that with a vengeance). But sometimes, with a little vision and a lot of confidence (or desperation - take your pick), you can either find a way out of the depths of despair, or at the very least lighten the load a little, even if only for a short time. You take your pleasure wherever you can find it.This movie will undoubtedly strike chords with those who have been unemployed long term, especially in the north of England (or in the Midlands or indeed anywhere. Depression - economic, social or clinical - knows no boundaries).It's a smile, unless of course it *doesn't* strike a chord with you. Then you'll see it as a politically charged documentary with a few unnecessary laughs that ring very hollow.But this isn't another Boys from the Blackstuff and I don't think it ever intended to be. The characters in this story are less focussed on pleading "Gissajob" and more inclined to say "Gissasmile". There is social commentary, yes, and it's well made (in my opinion, obviously), but the bigger message, I think, is that when life sucks - and it can do, most of the time - you don't have to give in to the feelings of utter despair.You can fight back, you can refuse to be bowed, and for everyone in the awful predicament of being willing and able to work but being unable to find anyone willing to give you a chance, there is the possibility of finding a ray of sunshine, even if only temporarily, in an otherwise grey and depressing condition.And it's those little rays of sunshine that help to give you hope. A laugh here, a giggle there, a bit of extreme silliness once in a while - it all helps keep you sane.And that's what is enjoyable about this movie: it's the story of a group of men trying to stay sane even if it means losing some of their dignity in the process. And the one thing you notice towards the end of the story - and it's certainly capable of being true of real life - is that in raising their own spirits, the main characters here also raise the spirits of those around them.They also remind me of myself and some of my friends. I could see myself taking part in something like this, albeit reluctantly (since I'm pathologically shy), just for the hell of it.And doing something just for the hell of it is what makes this movie one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to overrate this gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has real pathos and features first-rate performances by all the members of the strip-tease group -- but especially Robert Carlyle as Bazzer. His character is unemployed, divorced, almost vagabond, and even a little depressed -- not to mention that he's a marginally-irresponsible father -- and Carlyle can carry all that range in his face alone. Terrific work, and very sensitive direction too. Probably the best little movie of its half of the decade, or at least the most memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like some other films from the UK I've watched in the past, I didn't think too much of it when I first viewed it, but after a couple more viewings I start to generate more of an appreciation for the film. I just recently bought the DVD, since it was only $9.99 at Target. I guess I wanted a little diversity, since I have nothing but American movies in my collection. Watching it for the third time, I sat through the whole movie smiling. I still don't think it deserved an Oscar nomination, but let's face it--there are many other films that got nominated (and some that won) for an Oscar that deserved to a lot less. The point is it's a funny movie with fine acting, which at the same time manages to be endearing and warm-hearted. Sure, these characters swear like sailors and don't exude a conventional sweetness. Yet we fall in love with them. They're just a group of working-class lads struggling to put money in the bank. And I think that's the glue that kept this film together--we love these characters. This is not a filthy, mean-spirited comedy--and with a premise like this it certainly could've been tempted into that route. At first, I felt the writer and director weren't using the premise to its full advantage. When I first heard about this movie, I thought the premise was brilliant: a group of unattractive guys who decide to become strippers. Sounds hilarious! Well, to my surprise the whole wasn't about their dreams to become male strippers. And now that I think of it, it worked better that way. In comedy, you have to be careful not to fall too much in love with the premise, because then it'll become a one-joke comedy and it'll fall to pieces. This is not a one-joke comedy. The stripper thing merely sets up the film. The story deals more with the friendship between these characters. And there are some great moments of truth, including one touching scene where Mark Addy indirectly tells his wife that he's too fat and ugly to be a stripper, but she completely denies the idea. The scene is not schmaltzy or melodramatic. It seems very real and endearing. Though these characters may not be as handsome or buff as the Chippendales dancers, they're not reduced to ugly caricatures. We do laugh when Tom Wilkinson says that great line, "You're too fat, you're too skinny and you're both f**kin' ugly," but we're laughing with them, rather than at them. In most of the comedies you see nowadays, characters like that wouldn't be treated so sympathetically. "The Full Monty" is a bright, funny, intelligent, tasteful comedy that will most likely keep a smile on your face. I definitely recommend it. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty is the empitome of superb British humor! This movie is about unemployed steel workers who want to make some money. So one day after checking out a strip club, and with a little help from some friends, they decide to do a strip act of their own. The Full Monty is worth checking out. It has hilarious moments, cool in-jokes, and an awesome soundtrack! My favorite characters were Gaz and the insecure red headed man. The best part of the movie was when those two burglars try to steal Gaz's TV and he and his friends stop them in their underwear! Did anyone know The Full Monty is now a musical play as well? Next time you're in the video store, rent this movie! It's a must see that will leave you wanting for more! I give The Full Monty 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Filled with Warmth and Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some moments of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry; but it also has moments that will cause some reflection. And in the end, it's actually somewhat gentle fare, considering the subject matter, which on the surface may seem wont to lend itself to a much coarser interpretation. Rest assured, however, `The Full Monty,' directed by Peter Cattaneo, is a fun-filled excursion that skirts some serious issues while warmly embracing the more humorous aspects of the human condition. It's a telling study of desperation without the misery, of loss without the moroseness, and finally it's an upbeat, uplifting tale of pursuing possibilities, and what it means to reach for the rainbow in the wake of the storm.The film opens with a clip that could've been prepared by any local chamber of commerce, touting the city of Sheffield, England, as a growing concern in the industrial market, a veritable city on the move. The story then quickly jumps ahead twenty-five years, and we find that the once booming steel business has been quieted, the mill closed down indefinitely. Which means, of course, that many able bodied workers are out of a job, and their prospects for the future are less than bleak. Among those forced to go on the dole are Gaz Schofield (Robert Carlyle) and his friend, Dave (Mark Addy), whose lives become especially complicated by their current status of `unemployed.' Unable to make child support payments, Gaz is about to lose visitation rights with his son, Nathan (William Snape), and losing his job has left Dave emasculated, leading to problems with his wife, Jean (Lesley Sharp).Then one night the `Chippendales' show arrives in town, and for the `ladies only' performance, the local venue is sold out, at ten quid a head. And after having a quick peek at the dancers for himself, inspiration suddenly strikes Gaz, who figures if a bunch of `puffers' like the Chippendales can cause such a stir, why not some local talent? Like himself, Dave, and whoever else he can get to jump on the bandwagon with him. The kicker is, Gaz knows that they're going to have to go the Chippendales one up; and that means going `The Full Monty.' If they're going to pack ?em in, they're going to have to go all the way...Peter Cattaneo is to be commended for handling so sensitive a subject and the accompanying issues with such warmth and humor. Let's face it, a story about a bunch of guys who resort to `stripping' in order to survive could have gone in an entirely different direction. But thanks to the insights of Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, the result is a film that reaches out and touches the humanity in us all. The characters are all richly drawn and delivered by Cattaneo through his actors with great care. These are very real people with whom anyone past the age of majority will be able to identify, in one way or another. And that's what really sells the film. Cattaneo keeps it all very real and down-to-earth, sets an effective pace and backs it all up with a terrific soundtrack of contemporary music. Who will be able to come away from this film NOT at least humming Hot Chocolate's `You Sexy Thing,' or thinking about the scene in which `Horse' (Paul Barber) `auditions' to Wilson Pickett's `Land of 1000 Dances?' Or when the guys, after having rehearsed for awhile, are on line at the employment office when Donna Summer's `Hot Stuff' comes on and they can't keep still. Cattaneo takes a positive approach to negative issues, wraps it all up in humility, humanity and hard work, and in doing so he gives his audience a film that is highly entertaining, emotionally involving and unforgettable.Heading up the ensemble cast, Robert Carlyle is right on with his portrayal of Gaz. He completely captures the blue collar, working class image and attitude that defines his character so succinctly. And he convincingly conveys the fact that he doesn't know one `beat' from another, as evidenced by the way he is `always ahead' of the rest, regardless of which piece of music they're dancing to.Mark Addy captures the essence of who these guys are, as well, giving a memorable performance as Dave. His is an extremely sensitive portrayal of of a man dealing with some very personal problems, which he addresses through his character quite believably. And, in Dave's case, especially, Addy manages to elicit empathy without making him unduly sympathetic, which affords him, as well as the others and the film, the ability to maintain a semblance of dignity in the face of adversity, which is essentially one of the main tenets of the story.Also turning in an effective performance is Tom Wilkinson as Gerald, the former foreman of the steel mill, now reduced to being just one of the guys, and on the dole along with the rest of them. Wilkinson brings to light the fact that Gerald's issues are somewhat different from the rest initially, but he gradually develops his character to the extent that you finally understand that Gerald is not so different from Gaz or Dave or the others after all. And it's Wilkinson's insightful portrayal that more than any of the others cements that sense of community which is, in the end, the great equalizer of the species.The supporting cast includes Steve Huison (Lomper), Hugo Speer (Guy), Emily Woof (Mandy), Deirdre Costello (Linda), Paul Butterworth (Barry), Dave Hill (Alan) and Bruce Jones (Reg). In reality, losing one's means of survival can be a devastating experience. And what Cattaneo has done with `The Full Monty' is establish a sense of hope for those who may find themselves one day in the `outbox' of life, and he's done it with style, class and that most necessary of all of life's ingredients, humor. This is a film to embrace-- and to enjoy over and over again. 10/10.    </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as bad and what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has.Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny.The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television ? the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live.But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them.I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment.It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty.Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all.The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got.The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that inspired me (but no to strip!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Full Monty' is a wonderful comedy about rock bottom and what we are willing to do to get out. Robert Carlyle ('Trainspotting' &amp; 'Ravenous') stars as a bitter father who is unwilling to go to the bottom of the job circuit after the steel manufacturing plant has been shut down. Unfortunately he has a son he really loves and to keep seeing him, he needs to pay his child support. After passing a male stripper show, he has come up with an idea. His best friend, played by the likeable Mark Addy, is supportive to an extent. Mark has lost all confidence because he feels unwanted. Part of this might be because he's unemployed, but most of it is due to his weight problems. This problem with his weight has also made him believe that he's not good enough for his wife. Another character of mention is the one played by Tom Wilkinson ('In the Bedroom'.) Wilkinson was the foreman, and is a man of pride. This pride costs him dearly as well, since he is unable to tell his wife of his unemployment. Wilkinson is major for the plot to succeed because he's the one that can instruct how to dance. There are three other charming 'dancers' in this movie. 'The Full Monty' works on a gimmick that it promises to bare all. The story weaves itself to that point very well providing humor to the bleak world that this lot is in. One scene steps out as stellar and that is toward the end with Addy and his wife. All in all, 'The Full Monty' is a wonderful watch for both sexes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty is a charming working class comedy that works well at many levels. Six desperate working-class stiffs in a dying steel town strive to reconcile their desire for dignity with the economic necessity of stripping naked for money. In a way, this could be viewed as a metaphor for all working class stiffs, who must exchange their dignity as employees for money every day. But the beauty of this film is that it cleverly shows us how this exchange always remains our own choice, and by the end of this film one has the distinct impression that each of the men would have chosen to strip for no other reason than to keep the commitments they had made to themselves and to each other.There is an interesting blend of characterization and action here, so that it is difficult to tell whether the film is character driven or plot driven. There is even a degree of suspense as we must continuously wonder "will they really do it?" It is also full of dry and, sometimes, absolutely hilarious humor that never goes over the top, even when you fear that it might. There are also some genuinely touching moments. In the end, I find myself cheering for these guys even after repeated viewings, and I therefore regard this as a "feel-good" movie of the highest caliber. In fact, the only weak point in the film is a brief Monkey-esque romp with a soccer ball that seems to have no earthly place in such a down-to-earth portrayal of real people living real lives. I highly recommend The Full Monty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great British Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant, down-to-earth British movie! It's as great as any American movies of this kind. Five men with no jobs or money turning to stripping to 'just maybe get rich'. It's a fantastic movie with plenty of funny scenes. It couldn't have been better cast with all the actors effortlessly fitting into their parts with ease. Robert Carlisle is great as the divorced, street wise father Gaz who has the idea of stripping to pay the legal charges for joint custardy of his son Nathan. The funniest parts are probably the stripping rehearsals which will make you just laugh out loud. It's a touching, honest, down-to-earth movie which you'll thoroughly enjoy with the dry humour, hilirious gags and overall fun! Fantastic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched Full Monty for the third time - and still as funny, sad and poignant as ever. Having read through some of the other comments - most of which don't rate this movie - I can only put it down to a lack of that weird unique thing - the British Sense of Humour. I can understand why Americans, Europeans etc could miss the subtleties of the film - and may lose much through the strong regional accents - but believe me - this is film is set to be a modern day classic: 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty is one of my all time favorite movies. I think the movie is hilarious. A lot of the humor, I admit, is subtle, and most people won't be laughing out loud too much, but that's what I really like about it.  The movie is set in England, in a rundown town that used to be booming because of the steel industry, but is now empty of the stuff. All of this led to a lot of lost jobs, and a lot of the men still can't find work. The story is centered around one man who is divorced, but to get joint custody of his son, he must pay child support. He and his best friend, and others who are in the same unfortunate situation get together and decide to strip for cash. They decide to go the full monty, hoping more women will show up. It's a touching story with great characters, and you find yourself rooting for these guys the whole time. The cast is varied, and the characters are as well...the tough guy, the fat guy, the sort of geeky guy--who later turns out to take on an even different stereotype...you can't lose with such a combination of characters. I think the movie is very well written, perfectly casted, and the acting is great. This movie is the first time I have seen many of the guys, and actually the only time, besides the two main characters, who I have seen on the BBC and Jack Frost. I'd give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty was more serious than I expected. It was still fun and had some laughs, but it also had some seriousness and the story of a man wanting to spend time with his son was good. The politics was subtle, but visible. The acting was good. 'Hollywood stars' are not necessary for a good movie. As for the complaints about the accents, it is a British movie. If the characters had American accents it would be unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Full Monty" directed by Peter Cattaneo first time when it was released ten years ago in 1997, became a surprising hit, and was nominated for several Academy awards. The movie instantly became one of my favorites. I don't know how close to the realities of British life it is/was but "Full Monty" is irresistible, and it features the songs of Donna Summer and Tom Jones that fit adorably to the story. I saw it again few days ago and it has not lost any of its original charm. It is funny but it is more in the realm of dramedy which is my favorite genre.Few things I've noticed this time: Nothing is more tiring than doing nothing. Men are really very sensitive and insecure creatures. They have to have respect for themselves and this is a great movie about how far the desperate men would go to regain it. I think every boy would dream about having a father like Carlyle's Gaz - he is more like a buddy, not a father.Did I mention that after seeing the movie first three times I bought a Donna Summer's CD? And...The finals scene is spectacular. Our heroes learned something during the two weeks they were preparing for the show. They learned how to like themselves the way they are and how to respect themselves and with that knowledge came something else: "coordination, skill, timing, fitness, and grace" and they were fabulous during their one and only performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When the going gets tough, the tough get go-going."Well what can I say about The Full Monty? Simply this; it is one of those films that made me laugh and cry sometimes at the same time, and more importantly it made me proud to be British. The Full Monty is just a wonderful film, engaging, funny and genuinely poignant in places.The humour is often side-splitting, and the film is filled to the brim with many wonderful moments, the part when the "would-be Chippendales of the North" absent-mindedly gyrating to the radio in a dole queue was particularly inspired. And of course the dirty dancing antics. While it is very funny, it was poignant too. The Full Monty is a film about men's emotional short-comings, and these were explored in an engaging and profoundly touching way.The script does have some hilarious moments, often verging on hysterical at times, but it never fails to be touching as well. Peter Cattaneo's direction is another plus, it is relaxed and sensitive, never taking itself too seriously. And the story is very engaging and beautifully written. Visually, The Full Monty looks lovely, the opening scene especially was beautifully shot, and the cinematography was skillful. I even liked the music, You Sexy Thing, Make Me Smile, Rock &amp; Roll, We are Family and the Full Monty all to name a few were really pleasant and entertaining.And of course, the acting is brilliant, every single person gives an honest and appealing performance. Starting with Robert Carlyle as the divorced father trying to maintain joint custody of his son, he delivers a really strong and vulnerable performance that serves as the film's core. Mark Addy, Lesley Sharp, Tom Wilkinson and Hugo Speer give terrific support and manage to be really likable.Overall, wonderful film, definitely worth seeing if you like movies that are both funny and touching. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peacetime War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The British humorist Denis Norden, noticing that many war films were about a motley group of men learning to fight together as a crack unit, once suggested making what he called a "peacetime war film" about a formation dancing team who learn to work together in a similar way. Norden's suggestion was intended to be facetious, but "The Full Monty" in fact comes pretty close to realising it, with the important twist that all the dancers are male and their dancing involves taking their clothes off. In addition, it also includes elements from three other genres- the gritty, social-realist drama about working-class people facing up to adversity, the "Flashdance" or "Billy Elliott"-type drama about how working-class people find fulfilment through cultural activities, and finally what might be called the Great British Smut Comedy, like a sex comedy but with the erotic element watered down, the sort of film in which the mere mention of sex or nudity is considered amusing.The title is a British slang expression meaning, roughly, "the whole amount", but in this context it refers to a dilemma facing the central characters, a group of unemployed steelworkers who, in a desperate attempt to earn some money, form themselves into a male striptease troupe. The question they have to decide is whether or not to do the "full Monty"- that is to say, pose completely naked. In many ways, however, they are an unlikely group of strippers. Their leading light, Gary, is too thin. Dave is too fat. Horse is too old. The oddly-named Lomper is too weedy (and suicidally depressed into the bargain). Guy is young and good-looking, but has no dance skills or sense of rhythm. The only one, in fact, with any previous experience of dancing is Gerald, but there are two problems with him. First, he is even older than Horse. Second, the others all cordially dislike him because of his snobbery. (He was the foreman before the factory closed down, and regards himself as being their social superior).Scenes of the group rehearsing their routines are intercut with subplots about the private lives of its members. Gary is divorced, and needs the money from his striptease routine to pay child support to his ex-wife. Dave and his wife Jean are still together, but his being out of work is putting strain on their marriage, and he can no longer perform sexually. Gerald is too proud, or too frightened, to admit to his wife - who thinks that he still has a job- that he is unemployed.The film is set in Sheffield, an industrial city in Northern England once famous for steel production, but by the time of the film badly hit by the decline of the industry and by unemployment. It opens with an excerpt from one of those fatuously optimistic documentaries from the sixties, explaining in the tone of voice familiar from Soviet-bloc propaganda films what an exciting, vibrant place Sheffield is thanks to the steel industry. It then cuts to shots of a depressed, run-down modern city. In fact, by the late nineties unemployment levels in Britain were relatively low, much lower than they had been at their peak in the early eighties, but even today there remain blackspots where it is difficult to find work except for derisory wages.The film has some similarities with another British film about unemployment, "Brassed Off" from the previous year, which features a group of miners facing redundancy and their colliery band. Of the two, in fact, I tended to prefer "Brassed Off", which dealt with unemployment in a more serious, less jokey way, while at the same time celebrating an important element of working-class culture. Nevertheless, it was "The Full Monty" which went on to become the highest-grossing British film of all time, whereas "Brassed Off" was a much more modest success- possibly its political stance was too overtly left-wing for the American market."The Full Monty" does, however, have some good acting performances, particularly from Robert Carlyle as Gary and Tom Wilkinson as Gerald. Gary is outwardly a rough diamond, embittered both by the loss of his job and by the breakdown of his marriage. To be fair, he does have a lot to be bitter about. His ex-wife Mandy left him when he became unemployed and now lives in comparative middle-class affluence with her new lover. Despite this, she still mercilessly pursues Gary for child support, knowing full well that he cannot pay. This is not, perhaps, a film that will appeal to feminists; Gerald's spendthrift, credit-card obsessed wife Linda is portrayed as equally mercenary. Gary also has some virtues such as his loyalty to his former workmates and his deep affection for his young son Nathan. At first Gerald comes across as arrogant and snobbish, but later on he becomes more human and approachable, becoming friendly with the other dancers as he comes to recognise their good qualities. When Gerald- alone of all the troupe- finds a new job near the end of the film both they- and the audience- are happy for him."The Full Monty" is not a particularly deep film, nor a particularly original one, relying heavily as it does on clichés about working-class life in Northern England. It is, however, an enjoyable one, sometimes humorous, sometimes touching. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FULL MONTY was one of those movies that HURT to watch: by the time I left the theater, my face was actually sore from smiling. It's laugh-out-loud funny and moving at once. The predicament our heroes find themselves in is one that all too many of us have experienced at one time or another. (I wish I'd thought of doing something like this when I was really down and out- and in better shape...) Robert Carlyle has long been one of my favorite actors- in part because of this movie (not to mention HAMISH MACBETH or 28 WEEKS LATER); he's great as the down-and-out father forced to do SOMETHING to distance himself from The Dole and all its attendant stigma. The scene of the guys standing in line listening to music that gets their proverbial engines running had me laughing out loud in the theater. (I remember a scene from HAMISH MACBETH that STILL brings a smile to my face. A newcomer to his jurisdiction comments on his name by saying: "To be or not to be- THAT Macbeth?" "No," replies Carlyle: "THAT'S Officer Hamlet.")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across a VHS tape of 'The Full Monty' at a yard sale for 50 cents, and am I glad I bought it! Had never heard of it but was immediately interested as some of my family came from that part of England. I'd read every Catherine Cookson book in print so was familiar with the accent and dialect. What a terrific ensemble cast, great soundtrack which amazed me as I normally HATE disco. I discovered Cockney Rebel in the wonderful football scene, and Randy Newman actually wrote You Can Leave Your Hat On, which I'd always assumed was by Tom Jones. I especially love the part where they're trying to "get us kit off" at Gerald's home when the Repo Men show up and panic at the sight of a bunch of men in their underwear! The final scene is tastefully, artistically, and humorously done. I enjoyed it so much I checked out Robert Carlyle as Hamish MacBeth, the film versions of M.C. Beaton's books. Also great, shown on PBS in the States.</fullReview>

Together they make a hilarious duo. The jokes are smart and funny. I love that Dave complains about Jennifer Beals' welding in 'Flashdance'.

		<fullReview>The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude.The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun.

		<fullReview>Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.</fullReview>

Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings.

		<shortDescription>Comedy That Deals With Real Issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show.The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all.In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife.The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed."The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small, well-made film that became a phenomenal hit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of ?3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city.Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late? the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy.In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness? but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty ? to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut.As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sweetest stripper movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated.The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity.The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious.I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition.And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection.Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today.Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty".And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence.And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night.This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When male strip show act, The Chippendales, come to Sheffield and the local women pay in their droves to see the show, Gaz and the rest of his unemployed pals pick up on an idea to make some cash. A one off show where they themselves will strip on the stage, the difference being that this lot will go for the "Full Monty", totally naked dancing!The Full Monty is a very winning comedy, it's preposterous in premise of course, but in amongst the frivolity and outright daftness, lies a very clever, and functional tale of personal relationships. In spite of what some American reviewers have said over the years, the picture is awash with very funny gags, it's just perhaps that the untrained none British eye isn't seeing the jokes? For instance, during the famous dole queue dancing sequence, have a look at the guy standing behind Tom Wilkinson, who after witnessing Wilkinson do his Fred Astaire act, merely puffs out his cheeks and carries on waiting his turn! It's little touches like that that say so much about the divide between British and American comedy.As I alluded to earlier, The Full Monty isn't just a comedy about unsightly men doing a strip tease. We have a group of men who each strive for something in their lives, be it strains at home or sexual identity, these guys are given sensitive emotional themes from which to regain some dignity. If there is a criticism here then it would have been nice to give the female characters a bit more flesh on their bones, but this really is about the boys after all. Backed up by a foot tapping soundtrack and boasting excellent performances from the cast, The Full Monty is a hugely enjoyable picture that rewards on repeat viewings, just keep your eyes peeled for sight gags you may have missed the last time is all. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can leave your hat on. Alternatively you can cast it into the air with all the abandon of the graduate or the homecoming serviceman. It's a terrific film, making you blow away tears with bellylaughs. Robert Carlyle leads a super cast with all the ferocity of Trainspotting's Begbie (plus a soft centre that we encounter again in the subsequent Angela's Ashes). The others plays their types as if they weren't: all manner of concealed male neuroses are documented in the melodrama, no doubt as a counter-riposte to the 90s fad of ladette-ism.Peter Cattaneo really likes the set-piece, picaresque approach to film making. So do I, when it's carried off in this manner - without fuss and with a sure grip on the pacing and larger view of the picture. There are one or two set pieces (the famous 'dole-queue' scene) which don't have a necessarily contiguous dramatic function but really let the work breathe and smile. But the film's great achievement is its triumphant escapism, the irresistibility of its humour and exuberance that leaves you bouncing out the theatre despite the testy social realism that has midwifed all the joy.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining,amusing and touching British comedy blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been asked and speculated why THE FULL MONTY was such a massive box-office triumph not just in the UK but throughout the World.The whole initial premise of the film must have had the producers and distributors wondering if they would successfully recover their costs;a modestly produced effort set in unattractive locations,with a cast of talented but predominately unknown actors,allied with a rather melancholic storyline at it's centre.That it became a gigantic critical and financial achievement is due to accomplished handling all round.It's story reeks of gritty social realism;set in mid-1990's Sheffield,like scores of other Northern working-class towns and cities blighted by the process of de-industrialisation under Thatcherism,it tells the adventures of several unemployed former steel workers,led and inspired by Gaz (Robert Carlyle),a divorced father under financial strain,to follow in the footsteps of far more supremely toned and endowed male strippers to go "the full monty" in earning much needed income. The end results could have been relentlessly glum,even tawdry and tasteless given the stripping element in the main plot,but actually come across as likable,charming and funny thanks to sympathetic,believable characters,a bright and witty script with occasionally hilarious knockabout incident,and serious passages which are well-handled and a relevant counterbalance to the comedy on show.The performances of the principals (Carlyle,Mark Addy,Tom Wilkinson,Steve Huison,Paul Barber,Hugo Speer) are uniformly excellent,as is the sharp script from Simon Beaufoy and near perfect direction by Peter Catteneo.What a shame that Beaufoy and Catteneo have come nowhere near repeating anything on this scale in the years since.There was perhaps an element of luck and sheer coincidence at the time it was released why it became the awesome hit it blossomed into (late summer 1997);Britain was swimming on a tide of change and optimism with a New Labour government that had overwhelmingly stormed to victory in a general election a few months before (as it was to turn out,the basic truth was that the process of Thatcherism would more or less be continued under new PM Tony Blair in the years to come,but most were oblivious to this at the time),but perhaps the most telling factor was the tragic death in Paris of Princess Diana which took place the day before the film received it's UK nationwide release.Despite the morose components of it's plot,THE FULL MONTY undeniably was a light-hearted,optimistic piece with a famously "feel-good" ingredient which the British public greatly needed in the midst of the unprecedented national mourning following Diana's grievously premature demise.It was impossible to find any other relief from this saddest of happenings throughout the rest of the UK media at the time,as the story inevitably dominated television,radio etc. for weeks afterwards,at the expense of it's usual output.The vast technological explosion of digital TV,mobile phones,DVD's and the internet was still a year or two away,so watching THE FULL MONTY at the local cinema was the temporary diversion that millions of UK citizens turned to.This could have been one of the reasons why it was also a success in other countries,including the US,a remarkable achievement as British regional comedy is usually a non-starter with the Americans (mainly because of the accents involved).I would like to think though that THE FULL MONTY was successful simply because it was extremely well-done and very funny,with story and characters that people from all corners of the globe could identify and empathise with.Whether or not it's accomplishment would have been more humble without the above mentioned factors will always be debated,but there is a curious relevance a decade later in the UK;the preponderance of service-style employment (touched on here when Addy finds work in a supermarket) has,if anything become even more excessive in the years since,with soulless,impersonal shopping centres and retail parks mainly being built on the sites of former factories which used to employ millions in seemly stable,full-time and generally well-paid manual jobs,which now employ millions in mainly casual,part-time and lowly paid positions,to the detriment of the traditional British high street,which is vanishing as quickly as the traditional working-class did under Thatcherism.As well as being a very funny social comedy,THE FULL MONTY could also be looked on as a moving summation of the end of an era;council estates once being areas where the working-class lived have now mostly become ghettos for the underclass.With traditional industries (like steel making) more or less gone,there are very few opportunities for residents on these estates in the 21st Century,and social fragmentation and polarisation has led to a sense of aimlessness and hopelessness,which has developed a "Chav" culture so hated and reviled by UK tabloid newspapers,rather odd as Thatcherism (which they mostly praised to the extreme) began this gradual process in the 1980's.THE FULL MONTY is surely the last hurrah for the decent and dignified working classes from this period before the rot really began to set in even more under New Labour.RATING:8 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic British film, Hilarious!, This is one my favourite films of all time, the style of the film and characters were so realistic. As Robert Carlyle is a favourite of mine I found it hard to dislike this film. The attitude/personality of the film was great! Such real abuse in the performance such as Gaz needing ?700 to get his kid back, its a pretty realistic story.Mark Addy done good aswell as: Dave, his sadness was quite pertanent to real life as well. Very tearjerking at times, But all this did not change the comedy. Robert Carlyle can be so many sorts of characters, such as horror, He creeped me out in the beach and other films, programs.Peter Cattaneo done a great job to create a unique men stripping, drama, comedy. Very unique indeed, At the end I noticed a star under Daves legs as it froze when they chucked thier hats off?...Rent the video now, if you can this is a 5*****star rating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw The Full Monty, I had trouble understanding the accents at times but as the film progressed, it became a little more clear. Since then, I've seen The Full Monty numerous times. I love this movie!! As you see the film, you see 6 down and out on their luck men who turn to stripping to make a bob or two. Along the way of preparing for the 'full monty', the six men form friendships and show what amazingly round characters they all are. The reason I love this film so much is because of the fantastic job Simon Beaufoy did on developing characters. Each character changes in some personal way before the end of the movie and as I watched this movie, I loved each character more and more and almost wished to know them personally. Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, Tom Wilkinson, Hugo Speer, Paul Barber, Steve Huison, William Snape and the rest of the cast are simply brilliant, amazing actors, and each proves that there is no one else who could fit the character as well as they do. Also, fabulous directing by Peter Cattaneo, who does a brilliant job with his direction and Anne Dudley, gorgeous job of instrumental and happy-go-lucky 70's tunes. Cheers to this film! If I had to rate it 1-10, 12 1/2 sounds appropriate to me. With kudos as well. :)</fullReview>

I first saw this film when at 13, I illegally snook in to watch the 15-rated movie. Despite the average bloke decides to strip plot line, this remains one of the most realistic films I have ever seen and also one of the funniest. The characters are all very realistic and the problems they have were and are genuine problems that Yorkshire people have, the personalities are spot on too. The accents of the characters are good too, many of them are from Yorkshire but scot Robert Carlyle has a convincing Yorkshire accent, well done to him. I'm not going to go on about the film's plot, just know that this film is hilarious and very human. As soon as the video came out we bought it and watched the film 5 nights in a row.I recommend that Americans search for a DVD copy with the original audio, It's annoying that the studios decided to change the English used in the film for the USA though, we are quite accustomed to watching American films with unfamiliar slang, so it hardly seems fair that this and Trainspotting had to suffer in this way.Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Full Monty" is one of those movie ideas that takes off and flies. Thoroughly British at its inception, it's now been turned into an American stage musical. The theme of working men discarded by Capitalism is practically a movie genre and Britain's post-industrial wastelands are prime territory for such films. However, we Brits are not alone in being shafted by our politicians and big employers and that's what gives this film international appeal.Despite the film's grim foundations, it's a laugh-out-loud comedy which has that all-important feel-good factor. All the main male characters have demons of redundancy and inadequacy to confront and I defy you not to cheer at least internally when they step confidently up on stage and begin to strip at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the seventies, Sheffield was taken to be one of the richest cities in Great-Britain thanks to the heavy industry. But as Oasis said the year the movie was launched in 1997: "be here now". Sheffield was a victim of the crisis and as a consequence, a lot of factories had to close and loads of working-classes found themselves on the dole. But some of them don't admit defeat and are ready to do anything to manage. One of them, Gas is in this situation. With, a little help from his friends, he's putting on a strip-tease show that must enable them to earn at least 10000?..."The full Monty" is a little wonder. As it was the case with "Toto le héros" (1991) by Jaco Van Doarmel, it's a movie that manages to make comic a dramatic situation. The success of the movie is based on a clever making, a quiet but often caustic humor and a spicy performance. Besides, the director makes the actors likeable.A lively and funny movie where the grey and bleak sky of Sheffield contrasts with the goodwill and the courage of the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched the DVD I rated it a 9, but now, on a second look, I got a bit bored. But the Bonus Features on the 2-DVD package were good, especially the language lady, Laura Wright, who told us about the changes that Fox asked for coz they thought American audiences wouldn't understand the English idiom. Like "top"? and "works", and DIY? and "lassie"? and "twat"? But strangely, no mention is made of the phrase "There's none so queer as folk" ? My guess is that no one could come up with an explanation? Yet just about everyone else in the English speaking world would know it simply means... "Some people are strange" (we all would have learned it from Coronation Street on TV?) My guess is that that phrase and the scene were simply deleted from the US release.The commentaries by the director and another by the producer were awful. I got the impression that neither were actually watching the film, and were just babbling away? OK, Pasolini (producer) did at least mention Emily Woof who got four scenes for a total of about 3 minutes on screen. This is a boys or males film and the ladies hardly get a look in.The story is straight forward, factory workers made redundant, no job, no money, so... when they learn that the women of their lives are prepared to spend money on seeing a male strip-show, they decide to have a go too.It takes quite a bit of organising, they arrange a venue, they have to practise all the actions, get the right costumes, and then actually do it. - Something that most of us wouldn't do, no matter what? There are some touching scenes. The foreman, Gerald hasn't even told his wife he has no job. But she keeps spending, and the savings are disappearing. Gaz, (Robert Carlyle) is behind in the maintenance payments to his ex-wife,(Emily Woof) others are depressed and suicidal.The acting is great and there are quite a few quotable lines, but it is still a bit slow, so I've gone down to a 7.</fullReview>

What makes the film so great is its casting of actors who are clearly not models. Robert Carlyle struggles for visitation rights with his son. Mark Addy plays a security guard worried about his weight. Tom Wilkinson lost everything to taxes and is harassed into giving dance lessons. Paul Barber might have once been a great dancer. After endless days at the job bank Carlyle suggests a one night strip tease, which leads to side-splitting mayhem. Great concept with an inspiring take on the average male but director Peter Cattaneo does careful cutting. Carlyle is fantastic in a role that is so different from his role in Trainspotting. Addy upholds the overweight people with a wife who looks beyond. Wilkinson loses his marriage when taxes become unbearable but he ultimately pulls everything together. Barber has back problems but can dance better than any of them. Steve Huison plays another member of the group and his mother passes away at one point. This is one film to cheer for but it also presents perhaps the best comedy situations in a film the whole year. No one need be ashamed of their physical self after these guys deliver the full monty. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Cheeky Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six unemployed steel workers form a male striptease act. The women cheer them on to go for "the full monty" - total nudity.I have not seen "Magic Mike" yet, but that and this are the only two films that come to find that focus on male strippers. In fact, strippers in general tend not to be the focus of films. Many films have strippers in them, but how often are they the central focus? Anyway, this film is very endearing. The stripping is humorous and not really as central as the development of the characters. By far the funniest part is when the men are all waiting in a line and their song (Donna Summer's "Hot Stuff") comes on... watch them subconsciously gyrate in public!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Movie With Lots of Heart That Has An Impact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Full Monty is not just for women, Britons, and homosexuals. I am non of these and I found this to be a great flick. It just happens to have male strippers from England. The movie is about the struggle to make ends meet, loyalty, and self esteem. These are serious issues, but only Brits could give each a silver lining. Well not just Brits, they just do it the best.As a comedy, I did not find the movie to be very funny. Some bits were humorous, but not much. It was mostly "smart," rather than "funny." It is rare for me to like a comedy that I did not find funny as this one did. Mostly just Brits get this kind of humour as it is plagued with British slang. I don't care that it wasn't very funny, it was still amusing, enjoyable and clever. Judging from the reviews, I might be the only one that thinks so.The Full Monty is about a group of men who worked at a steel plant that went down under and are now unemployed. Gary "Gaz" (Carlyle) loves his son and must find employment for unpaid child support payments in order to gain any sort of custody and wants to be with him no matter what. But his son is reluctant to bear witness to his father's misadventures. This subplot is perhaps the best one. His best friend, Dave (Addy) thinks that his wife has fallen out of love with him and must deal with being overweight. They stumble upon a strip club and see hundreds of women paying to see Chippendales. They get the idea to to become strippers themselves and go full monty (completely nude) to offer something new. They find the most unlikely guys to help: Their former foreman and choreographer, Gerald (Wilkinson), has lied to his wife about having a job and is worried about his impotence; Lomper is an ugly redhead who once contemplated suicide; Horse is a former disco dancer who still has the moves but not the looks; and Guy can help out most with the looks. That is what I love about this, the lead characters (Gaz, Dave, Gerald) are deeply written and the rest are deep enough and memorable. Despite being an English movie, there is no real offensive nudity. Just a few scenes with shirtless guys and butts briefly shown. That was the one element I was unsure about before watching this. I'm sure the Unrated version is worse. As a movie, I liked how everything was built up. But what makes this such a wonderful film is the themes of unemployment, loyalty and self-esteem. A bunch of guys with no jobs have to resort to do something anybody can do just to make a buck. In the beginning, we see Gaz and Dave stealing metal from the plant and trying to sell them. That is how desperate they are. The guys are too scrawny and too ugly to be strippers, but they do not care. Gaz needs the money fast or else he will lose the most important thing in his life. The others need money in order to keep their pride alive and keep their families together. That is were the self-esteem factor ties in. They know they're ugly and not lean, so they have second thoughts about following through. Dave is overweight, so he has the biggest problem image-wise. They have hit the rock bottom, so they feel completely worthless. At first none of them are up to it, but they have nothing to lose so they take risks and build up their confidence. Admirability towards these men grows. They are loyal and band together, but must stay together when the going gets tough. Each have their own reasons for joining, but all have the same reasons for thinking about quitting. Each man is a piece of the puzzle that is needed for a successful show and a rebuild in their lives.Not just one of my favourite British comedies, one of my favourites in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty is a "right good laff" (to borrow the parlance of its protagonists). Although the dialect may occasionally bewilder viewers unused to north-England speech, the humour doesn't need any translation. Gaz is down on his luck and is possessed of an endless supply of far-fetched money-making schemes. Inspired with a visit by the renowned Chippendale male strip-show artists to his hometown of Sheffield, and impressed at the huge amounts of money they make by seemingly just taking off their clothes and prancing around a bit, Gaz decides this is his ticket to some fast cash. Part of the reason this film is likeable is that humour and realism go hand in hand. From the depressing backdrop of an industrial town with high unemployment, Gaz manages to cobble together a troupe of six unlikely strippers, including a suicidal security worker, a man with a dodgy hip, and a well-endowed bathroom repairman. These guys aren't super-studs, they're just ordinary blokes who are willing to give it a shot, and maybe, just maybe, get rich. The film begins with Gaz and his friend Dave becoming marooned on a partially submerged car in the middle of a canal (the unanticipated result of one Gaz's plans), and the originality of the comedy continues throughout. So fresh is the humour, that the occasional moments when it sinks to the level of slapstick and cliché, disrupt the natural feel of the movie. The funniest sequences involve the self-titled 'Hot Metal' strippers - who have trouble comprehending dance moves unless they're related to positioning on a soccer field - attempting to master the strip-tease bump and grind (accompanied by a fabulous soundtrack of retro tunes, including Donna Summer and Hot Chocolate).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film that puts a smile on your face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This good-humored, jovial and cheerful comedy is (alongside with "Trainspotting") one of the finest British movies of the 90's. It can be watched many times and it's always just as funny, charming and even moving experience. "The Full Monty" is a simple little everyday drama with a heart. Acting is incredible, ingenious Robert Carlyle is unsurpassable and the other guys (especially Mark Addy and Tom Wilkinson) are having quite terrific performances too. I would have never guessed that a story of a six jobless fellows who are forming a male striptease act would be so touching and enjoyable but what do you know - if a script and the actors are good enough like in this case then I guess great movie can be made out of any silly story. And this movie is a perfection. "The Full Monty" is an ultimate feel-good movie that'll definitely put a smile on your face.</fullReview>

Not the accent itself but more it was spoken quite softly. But was an excellent comedy altogether with great music..had 'hot stuff' running through my head all the time with the dance steps...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie rolls in a light mood, the social problems it tackles are very obvious. By selecting a rather comic plot, it makes easier for the viewer to be introduced to the life of the unemployed in industrial England. I really think that if handled differently, this could be a very depressing film. But thankfully, it is very amusing to watch, without forgetting its initial purpose. Kudos to the writers and directors who managed to approach a much wider audience than expected, by using the male stripping scenes, so that they could pass their message.</fullReview>

The humour ranges from subtle to outrageous and the film is refreshingly stark (please forgive the pun !). I don't think Hollywood could have equalled it or even come close -- not without the overall results having looked ''sterilised'' (oops, another pun !). Well worth the Oscars and nominations it garnered and congratulations to the makers of a reviving British film industry that seemingly gets better each year. Buy it on video so you can share it with friends who may have missed it the first time around (rating = 4 stars of 5).</fullReview>

(So did the bloke sitting behind me, trying to explain to his girlfriend why he was laughing so much before the 'proper' funny bits) Half the fun when you watch it again is seeing the build up to the punchlines.Another bonus for me was the fact that my english literature teacher kept telling us how him and Mark Addy was best friends at Drama school! I think he's a bit depressed now that Addy is famous and he's stuck teaching us English Literature for our A levels!The humour is great, but there are some touching moments too!

		<shortDescription>A new perspective on post-industrial austerity in Northern England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Cattaneo and writer Simon Beaufoy throw a new light on austerity in post-industrial Northern England, where 6 unemployed steelworkers restore to strpping as a last resort. Whereas the Irish film 'The Commitments' had virtually the same plot, that showed life on the dole as a bit of laugh and became tiresome in its smugness, 'The Full Monty' is far superior as it takes the plight of the characters seriously. Gaz (Robert Carlyle) loses custody of his son; Gerald (Tom Wilkinson) is too ashamed to tell his wife he's been made redundant, and Dave (Mark Addy) is unable to communicate with his wife. Beaufoy's screenplay never looses sight of the damage unemployment can do to the working class. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Tom Wilkinson - one of England's most underrated actors - a standout as Gerald (he won a British Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for the role). Cattaneo freewheels the camera through the parks, social clubs, job centres, supermarkets and abandoned steelworks of Sheffield, whilst the screenplay is rich in the authentic brogue of Yorkshire (Carlyle, the only non-English cast member, speaks like a Yorkshireman born-and-bred). The film's global success - in the cinemas in 1997, and on video in 1998 - is remarkable considering the utterly local Northern Englishness of it all. This isn't an especially great movie, and it wears none-to-well on repeated viewings, yet, of its kind, it really is a stand-out in a mainstream cinema so often obsessed with style, celebrity and materialism. Also, it is refreshingly cliche-free.</fullReview>

This is a very European film and combines traits both of comedy and drama. Its characters are ordinary people, and watching them we may discover much similar within ourselves, our friends and aqcuaintancies. We become in some sense involved in their story and what they do both entertains and teaches us something.

		<shortDescription>Short, sweet comedy with heart...and skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Male nudity is not the main dish served in "The Full Monty," it's just the building block for comedy and drama. It's mostly the idea of it and then some shots of men in thongs and bare bottoms, but you never get what the title alleges. I suppose depending on who you are, that will get you to watch the film or disappoint you."The Full Monty" is a straight-forward British comedy accompanied by some family drama. A couple unemployed steelworkers (Carlyle and Addy) struggle to make ends meet when they take notice that there's money to be made in stripping. They bring some other men into the mix, including Tom Wilkinson, and form a group, keeping it silent from there families, except Carlyle's character from his son, who tags along.The real heart of this film is that these men are doing this for noble reasons: Carlyle wants joint custody of his son, Addy's character is dealing self-confidence issues and Wilkinson's character doesn't want to disappoint his wife's vacation plans. While they all lie, they come to terms with that in the film. Then there's plenty of British humor to go around as these men deal with humiliation and desperation.The biggest problem with this film is its 90 minute run time. While I'm impressed with what director Peter Cattaneo and writer Simon Beaufoy fit into that short time, the plot is awfully simple for this type of film and the characters aren't nearly as tapped into as they could be. The humor is also somewhat limited and there's definitely potential for more."Full Monty" is a nice, quick, change-of-pace comedy that takes a good idea and does a solid job of turning it into a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recognizable characters and a nice story make this a very fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still wondering what made me decide to watch this movie in the first place. I'm a straight guy and the last thing on earth that I want to see is a bunch of male strippers. It's probably because this is a comedy and because it received so many awards and was nominated for a lot more of them, that I decided that perhaps this wasn't just another chick-flick, that it might actually be worth a watch. Now that I've finally seen it, I know for sure: I should have watched it a lot sooner.When six unemployed and not exactly good looking steel workers from Sheffield in England, see how their women love to watch the Chippendales, they get the idea of a lifetime. Since there are no jobs in the region and no hope for a better future, they will become strippers themselves. However, there will be one big difference. They will go one step further than the Chippendales, they will go completely nude. But before it even gets that far, they will need a lot of practice and determination, because coming up with the idea sure is a lot easier than actually doing it...What makes this movie so good is that the characters all look very familiar. These aren't guys the size of the average fridge. No, these are 'normal' looking men. One of them is too skinny, another one too old, a third one too fat... And the fact that they aren't billionaires, but ordinary guys with every day problems and concerns makes it all a lot more realistic and makes it a lot easier to like them. And I guess that's where the main difference between Hollywood and Europe can be found. In Hollywood it seems like they only want to show perfectly shaped and/or highly intelligent people, while over here they want to use the ordinary guy or woman.But when the actors playing in it can't give away a nice performance, a good and recognizable story with normal characters is never enough to save a movie. Tom Wilkinson and Robert Carlyle are probably the best known ones of the entire cast, but the other actors did a very nice job as well. In fact, I find it quite hard to pick one out as a favorite. I really liked them all, just like I loved the entire movie. Overall, this is a very funny movie with an excellent story and some fine acting in it. Despite the fact that I'm a man and that many man don't seem to like it all that much (probably because they don't even want to think about the idea of male strippers), I must say that I really did like it. I give this movie a score between 7.5/10 and 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS British cinema is an inconsistent arena. With so many failures over the years, it could be easy to cast aside British cinema as a mistake. With superb films like 1997's "The Full Monty" however, we see proof that the industry is alive and well.Robert Carlyle is Gaz. Made redundant when the steel industry dies in Sheffield, Gaz spends all his time job hunting with his friend Dave (Mark Addy). One day he strikes upon the ultimate financial idea. For a one off time, Gaz suggests they become strippers. Unlike normal strippers though, Gaz has a rare suggestion, they'll go the whole way, they'll go "The Full Monty"."The Full Monty" is perhaps the finest produce to come out of Britain in a long time. With some superb performances by Carlyle and Addy, it flows easily with countless moments of hilarity. It never fails to satisfy and it always entertains.At the same time, the film also contains a wonderful selection of songs which the audience find themselves compelled to sing or tap along to. With a soundtrack like that, it's hard not to be impressed.All in all, as far as British films go, "The Full Monty" is one of the the finest. With quality acting and direction, it benefits as well from a magical, humorous script, and a mouth watering soundtrack. If you choose to watch any British film, this should be one of your top few choices.</fullReview>

From that moment on the movie was hilarious. I actually sat up on the couch and gave my full attention and I finished this movie smiling and giggling. It was a slow start I will say that much....but it definitely makes up for it in its development. It was tastefully done, it became rather funny, and by the end I was emotionally invested in the characters and individually rooting for them concerning there different issues.

		<fullReview>I have to admit that this is probably my favourite film ever. That's a pretty self-indulgent choice, and part of it, I confess, is probably because it's British. America does make a lot of great films, but watching something set in your own country does stir you up more, and that's a fact. Although I'm not from Sheffield, I love what we see of Sheffield culture in the film. I also love all the characters, because they seem to make such an unlikely combination but they end up going so well together. They have their flaws, but deep down they're NICE; OK, it doesn't usually turn out that way in real life, but it made me desperate for them to succeed and it's really important that there are characters you can care about in a film. Looking through other people's comments, it seems that a fair number hold the view that The Full Monty is a shallow film, owing its success to the constant anticipation of men taking their clothes off. As a woman myself, I can't claim to be free from bias. However, I do feel that it's a harsh and undeserved judgment. Although a comedy on the surface, the film isn't all light-hearted and it does raise a lot of very serious issues, such as the impact of the steel industry's decline on communities. The various men all have low self-esteem for different reasons, and this isn't to be taken lightly either. Plenty of people really do feel terrible about themselves, often with little genuine cause; anyone who says that kind of thing isn't serious and important needs to think again.At the end of the day, The Full Monty has a good plot, super characters and great music. It is funny and entertaining, but also strangely thought-provoking. I sort of missed out on it at the time of its release, but now that I've seen it I'm extremely impressed; perhaps the acid test for a film is that it adds interest to a rainy day even on the seventh or eighth viewing, and this certainly does that for me. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The surprise...a low budgetmovie with not one star (well Robert Carlyle was Begbie in Trainspotting) and it ends up being one of the movies doing the best and it has 4 Oscarnominations. Of course that's exagerrated, but it deserves it as it's just the kind of movie that had the luck to be picked up by the large public, but believe me I can easily sum up 20 or 30 British movies who can compete with it, the entire filmography from Mike Leigh for instance. But this doesn't take away the fact that The Full Monty is brilliant. Not big art but it's the kind of movie at where you never give a glimpse to your watch (my fave method to see if a movie is good or bad) and it's ridiculous! The story doesn't have to be retold : some unemployed steelworkers notice that their wifes are going to a Chippendalesshow and the idea arises to do it themselves....and no, they're not Chippendales, there's a fat boy, there's a redhaired boy who resembles to Mick Huckinall from Simply Red, there's a pensioner..... I adore this picture and it only would be a better place if we can avoid more the Hollywoodpaths....some Brits say it's the best British movie ever. Forget this type of exagerration, The Full Monty is just a magnificent experience and lovely soundtrack too!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But, this movie is one thing. It IS funny. There is a lot to like about this movie starting with the acting. All of these guys are very good actors, and the characters are people we all can associate with. In addition, the single female lead, Lesley Sharp (playing Jean) is really good. She provides a great balance to this movie. However, it is the overall sense of humor in this movie that I find so appealing. Imagine the BALLS necessary for a group of VERY ordinary guys to go out on stage and strip. The scenes leading up to the performance are some of the funniest moments in movie history.Anybody who says this is not funny stuff just doesn't have a sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRILLIANT COMEDY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that they made a movie about five guys dancing striptease, i said to myself, boooring. But after i saw it, i was speechless. I can't remember when i laughed sooooo much after seeing a movie. Why? Well, partly because it's European and that's why more realistic than "Hollywood-pop-corn-comedies". I must say, that it's one of this movies when you enjoy every second and when it's over you're sad. Because it's too short. But, it's not just a comedy. It's a story about friendship and about hope, even if you're unemployed and living in a Sheffield. Add brilliant story, acting, camera and you get one of the best comedies ever made. And surely deserved... ...10 out of 10.</fullReview>

If only the British could pump out more comedy like this one, we'd be doing okay.

		<fullReview>The key thing about The Full Monty is that it isn't. A group of men undertake to take all their kit off for local fame and fortune, and we (the cinema audience) are invited to travel down the path with them to that destination. But we don't! As the film finishes and the men remove their clothes we are left with a back-view only...Just as, on this obvious, direct, and central level, the film chickens out, so it does on the equally fundamental- if less visible- issues. The humiliation, exploitation, and anxiety inherent in being unemployed in Thatcher's Britain are made manifest; good gags and excellent acting enable us to look at them: this is an achievement. Unfortunately, the achievement is vitiated by the way we are invited to inspect them. We are shown a picture of exploitation and waste which is lacking any portrayal of the exploiters or the wasters, or of the mechanisms by which these processes happen.As a result of this, we end up with an image which is ultimately quietistic- what is happening is inevitable. It needn't have been done this way. Compare the film 'Brassed Off', a comedy set in an equally down-at-heel north of England- in this the connections are made: the Thatcherite strategy of closing down the coal industry (and, thereby, large parts of the north of England) is laid bare. Brassed Off manages to be equally humorous, equally insightful into relationships and the realm of the personal, and yet doesn't systematically miss out on the political in the way that The Full Monty does!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny; although not quite up to expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Full Monty was a very funny film, although I believe that "Waking Ned Devine" was slightly better. Robert Carlyle gives by far the best performance in this film and shows why he is in such great demand today.I had read and heard a lot about the problems people had understanding the accents of the actors. This claim is quite groundless. Unless you have been totally isolated and never heard a dialect other than a North American, you won't have any problems with it. The soccer references are great fodder for those English Football fans. My personal favorite - Oh, Ah Cantona... was a surprise.The story is original and plays well throughout the film. The only slight problem I had was the father-son relationship that posed an initial problem and wasn't properly closed. Ending the film during the performance did nothing to tie up any loose ends. Did Gerald get his wife back? Would Gaza get to see his kid?I would recommend this film to any comedy fans, although it is a mostly cute type humour. Watching "Waking Ned Devine" first would also enhance a film viewing.7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big, BIG letdown...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Full Monty must rank as the most unamusing British comedy ever made (and we have made some distinctly awful ones). The central plot (six men made redundant so strip to make some cash) is patronizing and in the worst taste, as for a film which is considered to be part-comedy, part-social observation it looks at the central characters from an astonishingly right-wing angle.SPOILER: The character Reg, who auditions for the troupe and fails (He can't "get his kit off properly") is discarded from the film once he has provided a 'laugh' at his situation; the situation being that he has no job, no future and fails at this last-ditch venture. I'm sorry, but I don't find this very amusing.Only the 'enterprising', Thatcherite characters are successful in this movie, which might well have carried the motto "who dares wins". The Full Monty carries the message that it doesn't matter what ill-fortune comes your way, one must be daring, entepreneurial, and business minded. Not ONCE does the movie cast a glance at the reason why the men are redundant, that isn't on the agenda. It's just the way it is, and one must adapt to it. Again, I didn't find this very funny.ANOTHER SPOILER: The films condescending outlook is complete in the scene at the JobClub (which is nothing like the real-life JobClubs, these lads get off lightly in comparison) when only one in six men knew what 10 x 1000 was, and even then he took time to do the mental arithmetic. It has become a regular feature in these 'sympathetic' British working-class comedies; the working-class are allowed to drink, smoke, swear and even expose their genitalia, but they are still unable to think.The final indictment of the film is the hastily drawn characters. They were basically cardboard-cutouts, with Gaz (the 'lad'), Dave (the 'fat one'), Gerald (the 'one with the problems') and three other pointless characters. Robert Carlyle (a fine actor) struggled with such an under-developed character, and other great British actors (Tom Wilkinson and Lesley Sharp) were given little to play with. 'Raining Stones', 'A Room For Romeo Brass', 'Smalltime' and 'Riff Raff' offer social commentary and many belly laughs. The Full Monty tries, but offers neither.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely Comedy About Serious Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Full Monty' is a lovely comedy that uses clever humor to tell an engaging story about modern England's economical reality concerning mass unemployment and the dole system. The characters must be the most ordinary, normal-looking bunch of dregs ever put together in a movie, full of resourcefulness and wit to overcome all their problems through some hilarious solutions.The plot is remarkable straightforward, a testimony to the skills of Simon Beaufoy, who can weave an interesting story without too much complexity and twists. Six unemployed men decide to organize a one-night strip-tease show to make money, and the catch is that they'll go completely naked just to get an edge on traditional male strippers. The story focus especially on Gaz, who needs 700 pounds to win custody rights over his son Nathan; then there's Dave, a man who has issues about his fatness; Gerald, Gaz's and Dave's former boss; the suicidal Lomper; Guy, the only one doesn't have a problem about showing everything, only he can't dance; and Horse, who tries to live up to his name.Robert Carlyle is undeniably wonderful in this movie! I loved his Begbie character in 'Trainspotting;' Begbie is in fact one of my all-time favorite characters and he says some of my all-time favorite lines in cinema; and Carlyle is just as great playing Gaz. Mark Addy isn't any worst, and then there's the mighty Tom Wilkinson, great as usual, possibly the only actor of the bunch who seized the opportunity to make it big in Hollywood.I love 'The Full Monty' because amidst the jokes the director Peter Cattaneo and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy manage to challenge lots of traditional values and stereotypes. Machismo is quite the target here as Gaz and his crew are forced to perform a profession that for them is only suitable for women. The way Gaz makes fun of male strippers at the beginning of the movie is a clear evidence of what a blow the whole show is on their male egos. Then they begin to see themselves from the point of view of women: for the first time in their lives they will know what it is to be seen just as a sex object. All of a sudden their game of giving a mark from 1 to 10 to each woman they saw on the street blows right in their face. And Horse's dilemma is just wonderful: being a black man called Horse, everyone else thinks he is well-endowed, only he's not, and it makes for one of the funniest scenes in the movie.In the end, though, the movie is really about unemployment and how it forces people to do things they otherwise would not do. One can see these are desperate men in pretty tight spots; my heart is especially with Gerald, a middle-aged man who's to embarrassed to tell his wife he's lost his job so he keeps pretending he has one for six months and keeps going out in the morning every day to 'work,' when in fact he goes to the job center. His crisis is to me the most heartbreaking in the movie.I can't recommend 'The Full Monty' any higher: it's a fun comedy and an interesting drama about very normal people in the middle of very real problems. It should struck an emotional chord with most people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film close to the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Yorkshire lass born and bred and growing up near Sheffield, it is very easy to see why I enjoy this film so much: its close to the heart. The scenes were all too familiar and I have walked down a fair few streets in the film.For those who haven't seen it, the basic plot is that six unemployed ex steel workers are desperate for jobs and begin toying with the idea of stripping. What ensues, is simply hilarious. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there are some very funny moments, and some very touching ones as well, particularly relating to desperately getting money for Gaz's (Robert Carlyle's) son (William Snape). The actors are top notch and manage to carry off the Yorkshire accent, which I know from friends trying to imitate it, is not an easy one to pull off. Of course for the born and breds like Mark Addy, it wasn't too tricky. But of course there are always variations within regions but the Sheffield accent sounded good to me.I didn't have a particular favourite character, each one had their reasons to either laugh or cry at their plight and misfortune.This film is like marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Many may not understand it because of the highly localised plot and characters. But if you can see past that you get a film that will make you laugh and make you go aww. And the ending is definitely worth holding out for.8/10</fullReview>

This cannot be spoken of as the "English version of Trainspotting or Twin Town", it would be a national disgrace. The scenario is awful, the characters patronised and as uninteresting as any ever, the acting is one bright spot but even the attempts of a fine cast to brighten it up are wasted by the degradingly inept script. It was also not remotely funny to anyone with a sense of humour able to take in more than toilet humour and self-deprecation, 12 year olds are welcome to it but the hype is one big big cheat on the rest of us.

		<fullReview>This film, as far as I see it wasn't a hit. The film at times does have it's moments, like scenes where the boys are practicing their strip act, and drive the hired muscle out their friend's house by being half naked. I can understand why the film was so successful in the UK, using typical situations and dialects that appeal to the drama viewing audiences over here, but compared to the likes of TRAINSPOTTING and LOCK, STOCK &amp; TWO-SMOKING BARRELS doesn't present anything revolutionary in British cinema diection...though they seemed to know it pretty well when I was in Japan, and it was something like NUMBER #3 or #4 in the rental charts at the time (videos are too expensive to buy in Japan, so the majority just rent them out). The plot may seem a bit insucnificant to American viewers, and indeed a little slow geting off the ground, but, and this is the trickey bit, is what the film is saying to the people of Britain. The backdrop being the fact that the working class in the 1980's have took a slump because of the demonic Thatcher , and now these people are so desperate to graft, they'll do just about anything that get them money without too much agro. It's not so much a story about stripping, but more about desperation, deprevation, and graffting. Indeed it can be said that this is DEFINATELY not a film for democrats or conservatives. OK to watch if your British, but teh dialect wil seem incomprehensible to foreigners. Worth a watch though for the chuckle ***7/10***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about males taking off clothes -cannot- be bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's with the above phrase in mind that I went to see this film. Turns out I was right in the end. However, be warned that this isn't what all the hype will lead you to expect. Seeing trailers full of men in small slips, and video boxes smeared with "award-winning super comedy bla bla bla" all over them is rather misleading. It's not the kind of comedy where you spend the entire film in a fit of hysterical giggles. The Full Monty makes you smile rather than laugh out loud (unless you happen to find the idea of men with no clothes on so wildly exotic that it makes you laugh insanely). It's more gentle approach will probably disappoint a few, but there's a lot to like in return.The characters, for instance were surprisingly likeable. The type of a "bad boy" inept father who does try his best and cares for his offspring underneath is something that's been done to death, but it's rarely worked better than with Gary's character. Dave's insecurity about his weight was also something that made his character very sympathetic. Touches like these made me take to the characters, their weaknesses made them likeable, and their portrayal never seems all too cliché. A very pleasant surprise was how the number 1 cutest blokey and the number 3 cutest blokey fall in love (ranking based on my own personal standards, so it's not too much of a spoiler, I hope ^^). Awww, innit sweet? I was hoping something would happen between them all along. Then again, I might just be biased in favor of this cast because they get their clothes off a number of times... Still, they're a nice bunch, and very entertaining to watch (imagine the horrid machos we'd have had if this had been an American flick, for instance).Two more things on which the publicity has exaggerated are the skin-showing, and the humour. While our boys do take their clothes off a few times in the film, it's not a total arse-fest. We never see any proper, full frontal nudity, in fact (which -is- disappointing, but oh well). Then again, the idea (and the main joke of the film) is that our improvised strippers aren't exactly mister universe, even if Guy does have one great body (and Gary's really rather cute as well).The humour and gags are also much more slight than the hysterics-fest that all the hype promises. There are chucklesome moments in there, but it's overall quite mild. The idea is probably to point a slightly mocking finger at social issues such as unemployment and the distress it brings, which it does quite well when you stop to think about it; if it's impossible to make money with proper work, one might as well resort to stripping and make a small fortune. Ignoring the hype is really the best approach when seeing this, as the risk of disappointment is high. It is, however, a very nice film that you can easily grow fond of and enjoy re-visiting, only that's not really hot marketing talk. Well worth the effort of checking out, at any rate. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to turn of the TV during a severe electrical storm so I haven't yet seen the ending of THE FULL MONTY, but from all that I did see it manages to be a good mixture of comedy and drama with a lot of touching moments along the way.Thanks to great leading performances by ROBERT CARLYLE and TOM WILKINSON, it's original enough to keep you watching and wondering how the whole thing will play out. But I have the feeling that this will find a much more receptive audience among British film-goers than those here in the U.S. who are not accustomed to seeing an unlikely bunch of men vying to become male strippers.One of the film's greatest moments is the employment line scene, where the unemployed are lined up while a disco is playing one of the songs they've rehearsed. Their subconscious takes over, and little by little each man starts stepping in time to the disco song.I have to catch this again to see the complete film, but I can understand the appeal it has for audiences here and abroad--except that, in my case, I found it necessary to switch on the caption feature to catch some of the British slang which does not fall easily on American ears.Touching and humorous, although a bit slow-paced in spots, it has me waiting and wanting to see the final act. All of the bawdy humor is strictly in British style.One criticism: The gay subplot seemed to come out of nowhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Astonishingly successful British picture that seems to be little more than a TV drama dragged out to 90 minutes for a cinema release.Film tries to be a realistic look at life for working class middle-aged men in a run-down city ( Sheffield in this case ) who show their Dunkirk spirit in fighting back against the system.Humour is mixed with poignancy but the two never quite gel - laughs are surprisingly few despite the storyline of unemployed men forming a strip group to earn money and regain their pride and manhood. The social comment aspects also disappoint being too contrived and forced, merely leaving the audience flat. The characters are all stereotypes and none of them are fleshed out enough for us to care for them. Robert Carlyle fresh from his success in 'Trainspotting', is the main character, a father whose wife has left him for a new man. He needs money to keep joint custody of his son - touching, but the son is miscast as a well spoken, well-groomed, intelligent 12 year old.'The Full Monty' is a pleasant 1-dimensional film which flows along quite nicely. It falls uncomfortably between two stools though, not funny enough to work as an out and out comedy and not gritty enough to work as a social drama. Ken Loach's 'Raining Stones' has much harder hitting realism and is funnier in the process.Whatever is said, the film clearly struck a chord with the public, but, unlike 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' which was also average but had appeal which was clear to see, it is difficult to know what 'The Full Monty' had to merit its success. Pleasant but lame.BEST SCENE( by a mile ) - the guys going through their dance motions in the dole queue.</fullReview>

It's just a bunch of male yobs wanting to show off their naked bodies and is plainly boring and unfunny. If you're looking for a good British film try 'Bean' or 'Johnny English' but not this crap</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An earthy story that gave credibility to realism in films. Ordinary people could connect with the characters. A maturer generation who had grown up enjoying 70's music suddenly found that their first love was now en vogue, and the commercial exposure of the Job Club scenario made the unemployed experience all the more real. They took us on a journey with them all the way through the film, and what an enjoyable journey it was. This film could arguably be the turning point for saying goodbye to Job Clubs for the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Full Monty was something of a letdown for me. As someone who is native to Sheffield (and is also an ex Steelworker who suffered redundancy) I was expecting something funnier. After classic kitchen sinkers such as "Kes", I was really looking forward to this film, but most of the humour left me cold. Perhaps the humour was a little close to home for me. One thing I can't understand is why the Americans love it so much. God knows what they made of Sheffielder's in general</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to sit through this movie because I had to, but I definitly wouldn't see it again. The "humour" was a little to dry and boring and the movie was predictable. While I will give the writter credit, it was an original idea..just not a GOOD original idea. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are looking for a good comedy. I find that the movie dragged on and there wasn't much of a climax or resolution, at least not good ones. In addition, it just wasn't all that funny...I think this flim had potential, but undoubtedly failed to live up to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is it that the huge majority of voters rate this as an 8 or better? I agree that it has likeable characters and it is cute. Ok, cute, cute, cute. But, that hardly makes a movie outstanding in and of itself.I laughed only a few times when they danced. That was unique to be sure, but it represented only a few minutes out of the hour and a half.My largest objection was that it was very difficult to understand what they were saying. I watched it at home, but without other noise. Perhaps (and I say that with doubt) in the theater it might have been easier to understand. Their accents are very heavy English and loaded with terminology that I didn't know.Adding to the problem were the customs and societal nuances that are specific to the people and the area. I'm sure if you lived there, it would have been a much better movie.I toyed with a 6 but decided that it would have been punishment for something beyond the movie's control. My expectations were too high going in. So, I think a 7 is fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, but not as good as they want you to think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were employed as a film critic for one of the major Network affiliates, newspapers, or magazines, perhaps this movie might seem like a quiet break from many of the truly horrendous movies I'd be forced to see. And perhaps, being a pretentious intellectual, as so many critics are, I'd decide that any movie with the slightest hint of technical know-how must be bad. After all, art is sloppy, and undefined, or something to that vague effect. And then, finally, I'd decide that if it was British, or that it had at least one element that was sort of original, I'd overlook the fact that every inch of this film was predictable and obvious. And I would do that because I'm supposed to support any movie that isn't "Hollywood". That's what would happen if I were a critic, I suppose.But, as you can clearly see, I am not a critic. I'm a movie fan. Now, don't go getting the idea that I dislike this movie. Not by any means. But realistically, can we jump on every little independent movie as being "true" film, or art, simply on the basis that it is, in fact, small? My problems with the movie stem from the obvious nature of the script. While characters were mostly good, some of the performances were not. And when there came major plot points, they seemed to be recycled out of a million other movies. Not necessarily better ones, but the ideas had been done before. So while I appreciated the originality of the basic idea, I couldn't imagine that the actual story arc or character development would ever break free from the old standard of a formula it rested on. And it didn't.I did laugh, however. A couple times. But all the humor was intent on just being revealing about these characters, and not having a good time with the exploration of them, which for me created a lightly pleasurable comedic experience, rather than the full laugh-a-minute time this material could have provided. I guess if you wanted everyone to think you're smart (regardless of the reality either way), you might say you found this movie very funny. I wont argue that it's amusing.My final note is on the Oscar fiasco. Did this get the sympathy nomination? Certainly. But in terms of a complaint, I must protest that this beat Danny Elfman for musical score. The music in the Full Monty was mostly old dance mix hits, and when it wasn't, they filled in with generic British sitcom scoring. The Oscar is for best original score, which is something this movie provided little of, in quantity or quality. Elfman's scores are always more dynamic, powerful, and worthwhile, and even if this wasn't his best (it wasn't), it was still far better than the bland background filler noise that got the sympathy win.I don't hate or dislike this movie. All I really want is to point out that not every "Great new independent feature" is going to be a definitive moment in film history. Sometimes, in backlash to Hollywood, a nice little movie like this one gets blown way out of proportion. It's the same (though not nearly as bad) as when mediocre fare such as Deep Impact makes ridiculous amounts of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score).I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed.Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way!The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that.But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything.I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating).This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either.My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.</fullReview>

For a drama it's not very dramatic. But the characters a good. They're all likeable. They're all good guys down on their luck trying a final desperate measure to save their lives from mediocrity. Altogether this makes an incredibly nice film. Nice people doing nice things to make other people feel nice. Fellas, this is a chick flick - be warned.

		<fullReview>Sleeper hit from the UK concerns several ex-steelworkers from a drab, dead-end town who are hoping a stripping gig will rescue them from hitting bottom--the only trouble is, these klutzy, out-of-shape guys aren't exactly from Chippendale's! Well-made movie does take a little while (maybe a few sequences) to find its rhythm, but it has a streak of melancholy underneath that helps level out the comedy, making it less silly and more immediate and appealing. Nicely directed with terrific performances from all the male players; however, the roles for the women are one-dimensional and their sub-plots just get in the way. Anne Dudley's music score won an Oscar, though the film relies much more on disco hits from the '70's to pump up the action. Flaws and all, the picture is quite enjoyable. *** from ****</fullReview>

This guy has zippo personality and about as monotone as Ben Stein. The movie was totally unrealistic. The type of women that go to mens strip joints, do not want to see overweight, unkempt, wrinkly men. They want to see Charles Atlas. The film basically mocked the unfortunate of life. It was simply a mean spirited film, sprinkled with lousy humor. To me this movie was nothing more than laughing at the fat, pimply face nerd that walks down your hall in HS. I guess one can somewhat accept the non political correctness if the jokes were somewhat funny. There was nothing going for this movie. You had a complete failure- Bad plot, boring acting, and the only joke in this movie was on me , for wasting my time. Music was good and probably the lure for many people.

		<fullReview>You have to be a Yorkshireman and to have been out of work in the 1990's to hate this film as much as I do.Basically it's message is 'let's laugh at the silly working class people' Aren't they funny when they are out of work? They dance in the dole queue to piped music and become male strippers when there is no proper work to be had. (tee hee)The director's next film (Lucky Break) was about how funny it is to be in prison. Human misery is cue for comedy lite to this guy.The nasty hidden agenda about this is it provides cheap laughs for people never likely to be in such a position. Worse still it provides people who have never faced a life crisis of this sort with the facile perception that anyone can pull through such a situation if only they have a sense of humour.Its patronising attitude towards Yorkshire people is right up with those movies where everyone who lives in a Southern State is called Bubba, has a girlfriend named Peggy Lou and an IQ you could count on your thumbs.Rating 0 out of 10 (In my my 'Worst Movies of All Time' Group)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Called by many "the funniest film in years", but this is just not so! "The Full Monty" is actually a little light on laughs, especially when you go in expecting a barrel full.Simon Beaufoy's script is too obvious, and it takes too long to get going. The little known cast do well, though Robert Carlyle's immense talent is wasted. The fact that the idea is so darn hilarious saved the whole film. It's amazing how a clever, original concept can save a movie, even turn it into a huge success.The girls are bound to love this, and the guys won't mind a bit. For real laughs go back to "A Fish Called Wanda", "Ruthless People" and even "Dundee".Sunday, January 18, 1998 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema</fullReview>

What's more, you read the storyline and you already know what's going to happen in the finale; I mean, it's not as if they're going to have rotten vegetables thrown at them, is it? The film wasn't anything new as far as storyline goes, but it is "uplifting", as one of the members is overweight and has a difficult time accepting his own appearance.I'm sure this movie would appeal to an entire audience; to an individual person, that's a whole other story.

		<fullReview>I find it most interesting that the vast majority of the laudatory comments come from the United States,the English generally are rather cooler towards "The Full Monty",possibly seeing it as yet another manifestation of the Film Industry's obsession with Northern England's bleak housing estates and deserted factories.Please,enough already,what about the bleak housing estates and deserted factories in Essex?Surely the makers could have gone to Dagenham and found their "representative" selection of unemployed workers,fashionably diverse as they are. One fat bloke,one thin bloke,one black bloke,one queer bloke.....I suppose if they were making it in 2006 they'd include one Muslim bloke. I don't think the film advances the cause of the long-term unemployed by portraying their plight in the terms of soap opera.The single parent,the the middle aged man with a secret,the clichés roll on relentlessly. The women are either mousy or brassy,I strongly suspect real life Northern women are mightily fed up with such stereotypes still turning up on screen and misrepresenting them forty years after most of the English "slice of life" dramas have quietly slipped from the memory. Of the male characters only the likable Mr Mark Addy is believable in his role.Mr Robert Carlyle narrows his eyes and looks anxious in an attempt to emulate a man on the brink of despair.His portrayal seems to have pleased a lot of people who presumably have had very little contact with real desperation. One day I will go to the cinema and watch a film about life in the north of England that isn't insulting my intelligence and patronising a significant percentage of the UK population.Going by the success of "The Full Monty" and "Billy Elliot" it may be a bit of a while yet.</fullReview>

I can't give a super analysis of why I didn't get into this. Perhaps, for me, one of the main problems, is the slow movingness of the Plot. This is a very long movie(or SEEMED to be) and I just could not get into it At all. Nor did I find It particularly funny. I actually like and appreciate movies that are similar to this but something just failed to click for me here.I want to give this another chance because I didn't hate it, just was a bit bored and didn't have the patience for it because it develops slowly. I think the movie really needed to movie at a brisker pace and also I was hyped up expecting a perfect 10 so perhaps I will give this one another shot. I much preferred last year's Calendar Girls which was much faster moving in nature, but I do think the premise of Monty was a scream. We'll see how it goes on another viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was forced to see this for my English class the last day before the Christmas break... it's so bad, I actually would have preferred a surprise test/exam. The plot moves so slowly that I had to look at my wristwatch several times every couple of minutes, to make sure that time was actually passing. It's also quite possibly the most repetitive I've ever seen in a movie... every five minutes, one of the main characters is saying 'I can't strip because *yak yak yak*' or being roasted by their girlfriend or wife for something or other. And, come on, don't tell me you hadn't figured out the ending from the title, or even the cover. The ending is unsatisfying, it leaves more loose ends than any other movie I've ever seen... put together. The acting is mediocre and the characters are poorly written and almost completely alike. None of them are likable in the slightest. The humor is poor slapstick and the old ignorant-gags that we are supposed to laugh at(someone says "you could kill yourself by drowning." the guy replies "I can't swim"). The movie is so bloody predictable... it starts out with them talking about how strippers must be fags... and ends with them stripping. Ridiculous. Are we really supposed to like these people, feel with them? They don't want to work for a living, because they were fired from one job... so, instead they decide to strip. Oh, wait... that's not exactly enough plot for 90 minutes... lets have them change their opinion about stripping every few minutes... still not enough? How about we throw in a few poorly choreographed stripping sequences that have some bad slapstick and other lame attempts at humor? We made the 90 minute mark? Good. Now... what do we have? One of the most pointless and boring movies ever made, that's what. The character development is bad, and obviously just thrown in to make the movie long enough. We don't care about these characters. And do the film-makers really expect us to care about the hardship they go through in the film? They're trying to strip for money! For Christs sake, it's not like they were doing some big personal project and were held down by 'the man'. They were trying to take off their clothes for money. And every single joke that you can imagine that there would be about their sexuality and looks is in there. Like my one line summary says, this might be somewhat entertaining for women and the British... but I doubt anyone else will really like this, even slightly. I certainly didn't. I recommend this only to members of the two aforementioned groups. Anyone else should avoid this, but in particular viewers of just slightly intelligent films should stay away from this.

		<shortDescription>I saw it for free and still felt ripped off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot to ruin a free movie, and the Full Monty had plenty of awful and cliched crappy dialogue. The story is a pathetic attempt at humour, and considering England is capable of producing Monty Python, I do not see how anybody who has ever laughed at a clever movie could find even a sole laugh in this monstrosity. None of the characters were interesting nor well-developed and the plot was painfully predictable. What a waste!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>utter rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complete rip off of the superior stage production of 'Ladies Night'. Five guys, butt ugly, ageing and gross, decide to earn money by giving the ladies a thrill by doing a strip act. They can't dance and haven't got an erotic bone in their bodies so the finale is vomit inducing. Leave the video on the shelf and check out your local stage theatre and see five guys turn from ugly ducklings into beautiful swans, with great music, brilliant audience interaction and bodies and strip routines to get the temperature soaring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rubbish, Boring and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard how good and funny The Full Monty was supposed to be, I rushed out to see it. I felt totally ripped off coming out of the cinema because of how over-hyped it was. It was totally unfunny, boring and totally pointless. However, Robert Carlyal's performance was the only good thing going for it. AVOID!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My what a nice idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of famous British actors cruise about being ugly &amp; stupid. A lovely (true) story about a load of jobless blokes who quickly realize that if they get their bits out they'll receive loads of publicity. Please let this film be forever cast into the realms of late night Cable TV. If I kill someone and goto hell, I will expect to be seeing a lot of this 'film'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 2 cents worth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to comment on this movie, but since it bored me to sleep TWICE, I can't say I've seen it! With all the hype and recommendations, I was expecting to be laughing my posterior end off. But, I ended up falling asleep twice during the movie. About the only movies I can think of that were more boring are "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Punch Drunk Love".Now, to be fair, I'm sure part of my dislike for this waste of my time is the fact that I usually don't enjoy movies where the characters speak with heavy British accents. But, I can't blame my passionate dislike for this waste of film on that!On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this a 1. It's rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film some time ago when it was on TV and to put it simply... it made me ashamed to be British, it's absolutely AWFUL!!! I cannot believe it won an OSCAR!!! it sells itself (to the female population I imagine) on the fact that there will be naked guys bodies left right and center but this doesn't happen until the very end! The storyline is very weak, 'council house trailer trash' and cheap and to add insult to injury they insert a gay subplot WHY!?!?!?!?! I believe this movie made a lotta money in this country, god knows why, it says a lot about the 'movie going' public doesn't it! DO NOT WASTE 2 HOURS? OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS RUBBISH! go and see Four Weddings And A Funeral... now THAT is a movie to be proud of!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Full Monty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most funny, touching and interesting British films for ages. BAFTA winning Robert Carlyle is Gaz, a man who tries to be a good Dad for his son, Nathan (William Snape), it is just that his Mum hardly wants him to see Gaz. He tries to think of many ways to earn enough money to earn custody rights, and then he has it, The Full Monty! He gets his best friend big Dave (A Knight's Tale's BAFTA nominated Mark Addy) and a bunch of other men to join him in his quest for short fame and lots of money. Through the process they practise dancing to famous sexy tunes, stripping and many other giggly moments. Also starring BAFTA winning Tom Wilkinson as Gerald, Paul Barber as Horse, Steve Huison as Lomper, Hugo Speer as Guy, BAFTA nominated Lesley Sharp as Jean, EastEnders' Dave Hill as Alan, and Coronation Street's Bruce Jones as Reg. The little "Hot Stuff" dance in the queue is the big highlight, it is is just annoying that Prince Charles had to do it too. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Anne Dudley, and it was nominated for Best Director for Peter Cattaneo, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA Audience Award for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 23 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 32 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 34 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just not that interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't hate the movie. I just was surprised at all the hubbub about it. It was a little movie that was mildly diverting at best and yet it got so many kudos. I guess I have to give it a few points for being original and some decent acting by a bunch of unknowns, but I just didn't find myself caring about them or the plot. I would not have gone to the theater to see this nor would I have bothered renting it. In fact, it was on HBO or some other pay channel and that's why I saw it. And, that's exactly what I recommend. See it if you want, but don't bother PAYING to see it, as there are better ways to spend your money. Another little film in which you also get to see an ugly old man's butt is Waking Ned Divine--a much more interesting movie and certainly worth paying to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is A Comedy ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered in the Summer of 1997 THE FULL MONTY was hyped to the high heavens as a hilarious comedy where the unemployed Yorkshire lads are in the job centre ( Also known as " Joke shops " in Britain )start dancing to HOT STUFF by Donna Summer . Other oft shown scenes are the auditions and the final scene where the lads strip off on stage . But after seeing the film I was shocked that anyone could describe this as a comedy . THE FULL MONTY isn`t a comedy at all it`s a dour social drama about the disenfranchisement of men with some funny bits that you`ve already seen in the film`s trailers. It`s as if the screen writer had completed writing a sentenious drama about male unemployment and at the last minute the producer had demanded a few lighter moments in the script. Sorry but I didn`t think much of this film and fail to see why it received so much promotion and praise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage; An Insult To Decent Brits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a big disappointment. What good is going to the theater to see a movie and not being able to understand half of the dialog? It's ridiculous. The principal actors in here had Cockney accents which are very tough to discern. That and too much rough language, even with scenes involving an 11-year-old boy, made this a disgusting movie. No wonder the critics loved it. Crude language, sex remarks and literally stripping in front of an 11-year- old is a sick message only filmmakers and critics would enjoy.This is a very offensive one-joke (men stripping) film with characters one could care less about.....so what's to enjoy?The fact that it won an Oscar is no surprise with what garbage has attained that status in recent decades. I have a British friend who said this movie made him "ashamed to be called a Brit" and I don't blame him. He shouldn't worry; hopefully people won't classify a whole country because of the sick people who make films.This is not recommended to anyone with the slightest bit of class or taste.</fullReview>
