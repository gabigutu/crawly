		<shortDescription>A moving, well-crafted, and visually breathtaking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fictionalized historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Years in Tibet is to the true story what the Sound of Music is to Maria Von Trapp's autobiography. Maria writes in the second volume of her autobiography that she wanted to sue the film makers, and I wonder whether Heinrich feels the same. I thought it was an excellent film that did a great job of conveying accurately what Lhasa looks like, having earlier seen a book of photographs from British expeditions around 1910. And I am glad it generated some sympathy for the plight of the Tibetans. But having since read Heinrich's autobiography, it appears that virtually every event in the movie was made up, including the business with the watch. I don't understand why, because the true story was fascinating, with lots of drama. What is wrong with the minds and egos of people in Hollywood? If they want to completely distort the original facts, don't call it non-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time last night after hearing a great many people recommend it to me. I don't know why I waited so long! This is a soul stirring movie that is perfect in its simplicity. I don't think it's the best performance Brad Pitt has ever offered, but he was quite good. David Thewlis (an amazing actor who never receives as much praise he deserves) gave a perfect performance. But the real beauty of the film is the Tibetan people and their lifestyle. The cinematography was breathtaking and perfectly matched the mood of the film. I loved this movie so much that I'm going to buy it immediately. I love uplifting epic types of movies and this is truly one of the better ones I've seen in a while. In fact, it's one the better movies I've seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. The movie does a great job of showing the Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple in Lhasa as well as the rural villages of Tibet. Not to mention the breath taking views of the Himalayas.Yes, Brad Pitt's accent wasn't exactly his best but it's forgivable when watching the movie. His acting was superb, portraying Heinrich's transition, which is what the movie is all about.The movie did lack qualities of the book, the ending was totally wrong and somewhat disappointing. And the whole Nazi part in Austria was completely unnecessary.Besides a few minor details, the movie is well worth the 2 1/2 hours especially if you are interested in the Chinese seizure of Tibet and the Tibetan culture and people.(Free Tibet!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Years in Tibet" was a pleasant surprise. Sporting an Austrian accent that got slammed by some critics, I thought Brad Pitt was pretty good as an arrogant Nazi who finds himself captured by the British during a failed expedition to the Himalayas and is later stranded in Tibet after escaping from a POW camp. He finds his humanity in the forbidden-to-foreigners city of Lhasa, especially after meeting the 14 year old Dalai Lama. Echoes of "Lost Horizon," "The King and I" "Last Emperor" and others abound, but the movie is "old Hollywood" in the best sense with magnificent scenery (widescreen advised: the mountains and countryside of Argentina and Canada stand in for Tibet). The heart of the movie is the relationship between the blond Aryan golden boy and the young "Kundun," with a performance by the young Tibetan actor playing the latter that is so charming he nearly steals the whole film. An engrossing blend of fact and fiction, the picture manages to avoid condescending to the Tibetans and over-reverent preachiness. Wrapped in an excellent production, this epic story makes entertaining viewing. One question: how did the young Dalai Lama come by his love of movies in that remote location?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good. I love watching it every so often, and learning new things that I missed the times before.The film has a great amount of interesting facts, and takes place in the 1930's through '50's. There are times when it is; magical, spiritual, enlightening, sweet, sad and poignant.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys interesting and true stories. If nothing else watch Pitt with his masterful portrayal of this real life character, who faces hardships, physically, spiritually and emotionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reaching the Summit of Human Conscience and Consciousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a panoramic film exploring the wilderness of Tibet through the consciousness of an arrogant Austrian climber (Brat Pitt). As Pitt challenges Nanga Parbet, the ninth highest mountain in the world and one of the hardest to climb, the political chaos of late 1930's and 1940's, and his own demons, the nature of mankind is revealed as layers of civilization are peeled to reveal an inner self paradoxically more powerful and yet more vulnerable to the ebb and flow of inhumanity. His own philosophical journey is a reflection of political machinations of the time, the ontogeny recapitulating phylogenetic change of western civilization resulting in a complex modern world forever coiled for violence and warfare.This film has a European pace unsuitable for those addicted to action figure movies with huge budgets and high body counts. I recommend it as a "good view" similar to a good read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Unique Adventures Of The Twentieth Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tibet has certainly fascinated people all over the world. The hidden land in the most forbidding place on the planet not at either pole. In its day Lost Horrizon made quite a bit of money for its author James Hilton. But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.Brad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.In 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.Brad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.One thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. The cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.Tibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.It is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.It's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long but still worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with this film, and indeed with many films set in the outdoors, is that it's too long. Maybe it's because I'm a product of the city and the suburbs, but to me, most movies set in the outdoors that don't use the scenery to advance the plot or set the mood, but rather just want to gaze at it, bore me quickly. It's like, "Yes, it's beautiful, let's move on." Also, though I like Brad Pitt, he doesn't always do the job with his Austrian accent; even when he gets it down, you're always thinking, "That's Brad Pitt doing an Austrian accent," rather than, "That's Heinrich Harrer." And that whole subplot about Harrer missing the son he's never seen doesn't work.Still, there is much to like in this film. In many of these "white men in strange country" movies, the emphasis is on what the white man teaches the people in the other country, and that's somewhat condescending; here, it's on what the people in the other country teach Harrer, yet his story isn't made more important than the story of the Tibet people. Also, though his accent doesn't convince, Pitt is convincing as Harrer in the physical sense; he looks like a former skier and like the blond, blue-eyed ideal of the Nazis. And finally, he's convincing in taking us through Harrer's transformation.Two more things; one, someone in their comments wondered how the Dalai Lama knew so much about Western culture. According to the book, Harrer found the Dalai Lama to be quite curious about the world around him, so he studied what he could. Also, the film meets head-on the controversy about Harrer being a former Nazi; it doesn't soft-pedal his past at all, which makes his transformation that much more convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insane Intolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it take some time to get moving, this is a truly captivating film. It's about redemption and pain. It's about true events which cast the Tibetan culture against the Chinese's land grab. We have the Buddhists on the one hand, and the godless hordes on the other. The die is cast and all we can do is watch. This is a movie about a selfish character and his comrade who find respite in the Himalaya's in the temple of the Dalai Lama. The gentleness and trust of the people is betrayed by one of them but it really wouldn't have mattered. There is a nice relationship developed between the young Lama and Brad Pitt's selfish, pig headed Westerner. Apparently there are elements of truth to this story. One feels so helpless in a world like this with so little one can do. It finally gets to what the Buddhists preach. Absolute dedication to their beliefs down to the last person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Wrong Description In This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to fight against this movie and the 14th Dalai Lama. By contrast, I love this movie and I don't hate the Lama. What I wanna say is about the details of that part in Tibettan history. For some reasons, this movie has given some wrong stuff about the historical facts. 1.In this movie, the first meeting between Dalai Lama and General Chang Jingwu happened before the Changdu Battle. It's wrong. Chinese didn't send an envoy before the war. In that time, Chang was an officer in CPC's Central Military Comitee. After Ngawang Jigme had surrendered, Mao Zedong decided to sent him to meet Dalai Lama. And in the movie, they met in Lhasa, but in the really history, the place was in somewhere called Yadong (in Chinese accent) where Dalai Lama fled to after the Changdu Battle. 2.In the movie, when Chang Jingwu met Dalai Lama for the first time in 1950, he shouted "Religion is Poison". Wrong again. The man who said this slogan in front of Dalai Lama was Mao Zedong and the year was 1954. Before 1950, there is not any Chinese in Tibet, so China was going to CONVINCE Dalai Lama to accept the occupation instead of governing an unfamilliar colony itself. They didn't want to force him to flee the country in that time although they did it nine years later. So, General Chang didn't say that terrible sentence in 1950. 3.In the movie, young Dalai Lama took the power from other old powerful tibettans before the war, was because of the appeal of Tibettan people. No. He got the power because necromancer said yes. Tibet was not a modern and democratic country. 4.In the movie, Tibettan army's defeat was because the surrender of Ngawang Jigme. It's unfair. In the Changdu Battle, Tibettan army lost about 6,000 soldiers and they had only 8,000 before the war. In Tibet, solider was a job for the people who were despised by others. So the army couldn't attract real good people to protect their motherland. And there is another important reason: before 1950, Tibet had a very long time without any war, and China had just suffered a bloody civil war so the soldiers were all veterans. Tibet couldn't fight China. Jigme had no choice. 5.In the movie, Chinese army did the massacre when they just entered Tibet. Wrong. They didn't did it until 1955 and the real climax of the massacre was from 1960 to 1972. For some reasons, Chinese army wanted to be kind in the beginning of the occupation. Some Tibettan political prisoners also said that the Chinese army did thing well in the beginning. But when Mao begun to try to be an evil in the mainland of China (in about 1957), the soldiers in Tibet was beginning to work as there leader. Sorry for my bad English writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the DVD and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how WRONG it all was told:when they enter Lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in Tibet, so they greet back... in the book Harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in Tibet and they may do it in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book Harrer mentions, that no one in Tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living buddha"?? childish... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not European designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was OK for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. I'm very disappointed by this "adaption" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Seven Years in Tibet'is one of the greatest movies I already watched in my life,specially because it is based in a real story.Austria,1939. Heinrich Harrer is having a discussion with his wife,Ingrid Harrer,because she does not want him to go to the Himalayas,since she is pregnant and feeling lonely. Henrich is a rude,impatient and insensible man,but also a famous mountain climber who is a hero for the Nazi propaganda. He is going to climb Mt. Nanga Parbat at the Himalayas with Peter Aufschnaiter(the expedition's leader) and other men.Months passed and they finally reach Nanga Parbat,defined by his own words 'as a national obsession'.Because of his proud personality,Heinrich had problems with Peter during the expedition Saddly,the expedition failed because of avalanches,and since they are in war times,Heinrich and his team were all made prisoners from the British,since all enemy allies from Germany are enemies from the British Empire.(what means Austria,Heinrich's country)They manage to scape,and Peter and Heinrich has success in entering in Lhasa,the Forbidden city of Tibet where Dalai Lama lived. There,he will make friendship with Dalai Lama and learn important lessons for his life,what will make him a better person.aka "Sete Anos no Tibet" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating photography can't hide a misguided movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Seven Years in Tibet' tells a story that is truly captivating but focuses it's energy on a character that isn't. We know about Heinrich Harrar, the cold and indifferent Austrian mountain climber who left his pregnant wife to go and climb Nanga Parbat, an extremely difficult peak in the Himalayas. The first hour of the movie deals with his trek with his guide Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis). These scenes are pretty much predictable and the question of why this mountain was so important to Harrar goes unanswered.World War II breaks out and Harrar (Brad Pitt) stumbles into the city of Lhasa, where resides the 14th Dalai Lama.The scenes in this city are captivating. The Dalai Lama is seen as a smiling wide-eyed kid interested in Western culture. He likes this stranger from the west and asks him to build a movie theater. Harrar obliges. We also understand that the Dalai Lama is under threat by China who want this tiny remote land for reasons he can't quite understand.This is an interesting story. So why does the movie spend so much time focusing on the less interesting Harrar? When the movie takes us to Lhasa I was so captivated by it's world that I was hoping that the movie would fill me in on questions about why the Dalai Lama had to go into exile. It is all for naught. Maybe the film should have focused more on the relationship between Harrar and the Dalai Lama and done away with the scenes of his mountain climbing. Those scenes don't establish anything or answer the question of why Nanga Parbat was so important with a war brewing so close to home. 'Seven Years in Tibet' is a misguided effort that has it's focus in the wrong place.</fullReview>

The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize it foraltering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it isnot a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, reaction,realities, and changes in EVERY main character. It vastly altersthe real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (which demeansthe culture of Tibet) to Harra's music box gift, to Harrar'schange of heart, everything about this movie is false - exceptfor the amazing photography. I understand that the shots of thePotala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However,changing a real story about the relationship between two people,one of them very important to this world, in order to build up amovie star is sad</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it hadn't been that unnecessarily long, this would have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad that the movie had to be 139 minutes long. It's not that I can't handle movies that are that long, but when watching longer movies, I expect that it has something to say during that extra time and that's where it sometimes went wrong with "Seven Years in Tibet". It just seemed to keep dragging on forever without contributing to the story.It needs about 2/3 of the time to show what a bad guy Heinrich Harrer actually is and only 1/3 of the time to show how he changes and gradually becomes a good man. All he thinks about is his career as a mountain climber. In 1939, just before World War II, his wife is pregnant with their first child. Harrer doesn't want to take up his responsibility and 'flees' from her by going to Tibet, where he will try to conquer Mount Nanga Parbat in the Himalayas. Because he is an Austrian and because the Nazi's already have taken over power in Austria, they will use his successes to prove that the Germans are the best race (I hope I don't have to explain the entire Nazi ideology to you, but that you paid enough attention during history class). During his attempt to reach the summit he is arrested by the British and taken to a POW-camp. After several attempts to escape he finally succeeds and together with Peter Aufschnaiter he succeeds to reach Tibet. First he is his old, bad self, but gradually he changes his lifestyle and becomes more 'Tibetan'. He even knows to get the attention of the very young Dalai Lama and becomes friends with him during the period that the Chinese took over power in Tibet.I don't know if all that is shown in this movie actually happened or to which extent some parts have been made up. Of course it is all a bit politically 'colored' (the Tibetan question is still not solved until today and so there will always be people who will choose China's side and say that what is shown here is completely wrong), but that doesn't mean that this movie doesn't carry a powerful message. But even without this message of being a good husband and not being a career driven jerk, the philosophical Tibetan approach to problems... this movie is very nice eye candy. The landscapes are absolutely stunning and Tibet really looks like a place that certainly is worth a visit. The acting is very good and it all looks very believable. So despite the fact that this movie dragged on from time to time and that it should have been a bit shorter, this still is a very nice film. I give it a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this probably was a just a propaganda piece for the Dali Lama, I found it a surprisingly good story.Nice to see Brad Pitt in such a restrained role. Unlike Christianity, the religious matter here is treated with reverence by Hollywood but that aside, it remains an interesting story of Henrik Harrer (Pitt) his adventures getting to Tibet with his friend " Peter Aufschnaiter" (David Thewlis) and then his relationship to the young Dali Lama.The film is as pretty as you would expect from one in such mountainous surroundings . There are really nice colors in here and the movie looks just great on DVD. The story bogs down a bit in places but not for too long as it tells of Harrer's escape from the Western world and from participating in WWII. He winds up spending seven years in Tibet, hence the title.Finally, I thought the soundtrack was good, too, featuring an instrument I don't know but love its sound. The cinematography in here, and justifiably, gets a lot of attention, but the music is great, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stunning visual and emotional tale,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Ronald Colman raised the bar of expectation by his not so chance encounter with Shangri-La in the 1937 movie rendition of "Lost Horizon", we have been trying to find our way back. Thanks to movies like "Seven years in Tibet", we can focus on the real issues rather than paradise revisited.With the release of the movie version of Heinrich Harrer's "Seven Years in Tibet" we are presented with a different story - one less fairly tale...Jacque Annaud's...film allows us to move away from the fantasy created by "Lost Horizon"... Annaud succeeds in bringing Tibet to life, to make it more human, more real.As much as the story is Harrer's, it seems inevitable that the focus moves away from him and onto the Dalai Lama. The book reads like an outsider looking at things from the outside in. The focus of the book, is all Harrer. Luckily, film has an ability to visualize the books cannot ever provide - a real immediate feel. The movie is everything and it at times almost feels like it will slide into Indiana Jones. However, the power of Tibet saves it. It almost feel like Pitt and Thewlis are out of place. The real stars are the set, the landscape and the Nepalese extras. Filmed everywhere but Tibet, the film does give its western audience a real soft landing, one that they will not get with Scorsese's "Kundun"... Hollywood does need to supply a demand and we demand epic scenes, high priced talent, a sense of the exotic. As if east meets west and the fusion of the two is greater than the sum of the parts. For the attention to detail, I can't help but sing the praises. If you can stomach Pitt's fake Austrian accent, the film is a visual delight. It would be a tempting fantasy to hope that we can preserve it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable and well made film but not sure about the accent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film which starts in 1939 with an Austrian expedition to the Himalayas. Brad Pitt plays the role of a most obnoxious Heinrich Harrer, who wrote the book that the film is based on. In the film, Heinrich is on a journey of inner discovery from the obnoxious, egotistical Heinrich the celebrity to a Heinrich caring for his fellow man and a realisation of how important the wife and the then unborn son he left behind in 1939 German controlled Austria were to be to him as he went on his boys outing to the Himalayas. The filming locations included Argentina, Canada and Austria with the high mountain scenes being filmed in the Himalaya themselves. Locations, photography and acting are all of the highest quality. The soundtrack is simply fantastic with original music by the seemingly inexhaustible John Williams and other music from some of the worlds finest classical composers. Brad Pitt sounds more Dutch than Austrian to me and became slightly irritating in places but his acting cannot be faulted. It looks as though he performed a lot (if not all) of the stunt work himself. The film is long at over 2 hours but that is the nature of the beast which covers the seven year passage of self of Heinrich. There are certain historical inaccuracies which do not detract from the enjoyment of the film as the film was not made as a documentary or historical document. I don't know how this compares to the book as I have not read it. As far as film is concerned, just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good one -- worth another look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed this film the fist time around and saw it for the first time last night on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised. It seemed to me that some extraordinary effort went into creating an accurate portrayal of the forbidden city of Lhasa, and the lives and culture of the Tibetans who are at the core of the movie. On the acting side, Brad Pitt was not quite totally believable as a German but, accent-quibbles aside, he did inhabit the character in a way that was compelling and interesting. I thought the supporting cast of Mako and (mostly) Tibetan unknowns was good and the use of these unknowns added credibility to the movie. The scenery was as beautiful as you would expect it to be -- breathtaking shots of the Himalayas dominating throughout much of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I find it hard to believe this movie is rated so lowly. It is at least a 7.5 in my books. Its far from perfect, but how many films out there actually question your beliefs and your actions and allows you to reflect on how you can live your life better? How many films make you want to know more about the film, the location, the people, the characters? Trust me, this film will make you more inquisitive and curious and probably open your eyes to the world beyond your borders.Again, it is far from perfect, but watch it and try to see where I'm coming from. If you do not share my sentiments then, at least Brad Pitt's excellent acting and the gorgeous cinematography will keep your interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching story of an unhappy and lonely man who finally finds peace within himself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The portrayal of Heinrich Harrar by Brad Pitt was very well done. I was touched from the beginning when Heinrich was beginning his ascent up the mountain. He was such a lonely man, someone who was not at peace with himself and could not love anyone. He was a very self-absorbed individual who needed those years in Tibet to become a human being, one who cared for others as well as himself. Definitely a movie I will watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Has A Beginning. It Doesn't Have An Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: The true story of an Austrian mountain climber called Heinrich Harrer and his experiences in Tibet, mainly his friendship with Dalai Lama at the time of China's invasion of Tibetan land.You'll love Seven Years In Tibet if: You want great cinematography aaaaaand that's it? I honestly can't find any really good thing about it besides the wonderful scenery. The great snowy mountains and the barren fields of Tibet look wonderful, (although in reality what we see is Peru). What else? Nothing really? while there isn't anything really bad in here, I can't think of anything good either?You'll hate Seven Years In Tibet if: You want a movie that has a conclusion, is more historically accurate and if you expected a better adaptation of the book. What is the movie supposed to be about? Most people think it's the way Heinrich changes from a complete Nazi a$$ that doesn't care about anything to a humble, "changed" man through his relationship with Dalai Lama. The problem is that while that does happen we don't see how! How in the heck did he change? Why exactly Dalai Lama wanted to meet him? Because he knew a lot of things about the western world??? Others think that it was a movie that had to do with China's invasion in Tibet. Another failed attempt IMO. While I'm no historian I feel that the movie tends to have a propagandist style, with Tibetan monks and Dalai Lama portrayed as "angels" and Chinese as the evil invaders? Okay, lets say I'm stupid and didn't manage to get the point of the movie? let's say there is something really good here. Unfortunately the pacing of the movie destroys that too. We see Heinrich in the beginning boarding a train, then we see Heinrich climbing the mountain, then we see him get caught by the British, then he escapes, then he climbs more mountains, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then? then he meets Dalai Lama, he becomes a great guy and returns home. Sweeeeeet!FINAL VERDICT: And The Moral Of The Story Is? (3.2/10)[+] Very good cinematography with great mountain landscapes.[-] A story with a beginning but no real ending. Veeery slow pacing. Slight historical inaccuracies. Very different from the far better book.Also Check: American History X (1998) ? Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987) ? Defiance (2008) ? Kundun (1997)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels Like Seven Years of Boredom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Years in Tibet (1997): Dir: Jean-Jacquacs Annaud / Cast: Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, B.D. Wong, Victor Wong, Mako: It seems like it took seven years to view, or perhaps I drifted off to sleep (not difficult under the circumstances) and woke up during the following presentation of the film. Title regards seven years of a man's life and what he turned his back on. Had the director turned his back on this film then perhaps viewers would have been spared the extreme boredom. Set in 1939 Brad Pitt joins an expedition to scale Nanga Parbat. They are taken prisoner by His Majesty's Government in India where Pitt makes several escape attempts with inappropriate comic appeal. One capture takes no more than a quick stabbing then he is off and running again. When in Tibet they compete for a female tailor. Then the Dalai Lama enters the picture etc, etc. Throw in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and this film would be complete. Predictable and disjointed with horrible directing by Jean-Jacquacs Annaud. Pitt is miscast and Thewlis is cardboard. Together they turn in one of their worst performances and are joined by veteran actors B.D. Wong, Mako and Victor Wong who also ought to fire their agents after being part of this crap. Theme regards consequence particularly when Pitt is denounced by his son. Viewers should do the same with the film. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Lies Beneath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It is better to travel well than to arrive." - Buddha Based on a true story, Jean-Jacques Annaud's "Seven Years in Tibet" stars Brad Pitt as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer. As he lived in Tibet between the years 1944 and 1951, Harrer witnessed China's "invasion" of Tibet. This "invasion" forced the 14th Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, to flee into India. "Seven Years" was released in 1997, the same year as Martin Scorsese's "Kundun". Both films present idealised portraits of theocratic, late-feudal Tibet. They romanticise Buddhism, fawn over the Himalayas, and pine nostalgically for Tibetan customs and traditions. In the hands of Annaud and Scorsese, the more radical and so interesting aspects of Buddhism are also ignored. Orientalism (portrayals of the East by the West which generally exhibit cultural bias and/or ignorance) typically represents Eastern cultures as inscrutable and mysterious. The West is offered as a bastion of logic, empiricism and science, whilst Eastern cultures are deemed esoteric, mystical and superstitious. In "Seven Years in Tibet", however, Harrer and the Dalai Lama take turns inhabiting the roles of "student" and "teacher". Elsewhere they ridicule each other's fussy customs and traditions, whilst also displaying a shared interest in science, geography and engineering. This is perhaps not surprising. With no holy writs, no deities, and with its interests in scientific enquiry, Buddhism's always been one of the more science-friendly "religions". Annaud's film climaxes with the Chinese army marching into Tibet and massacring Tibetan soldiers. In reality, this battle did not occur. Before his film closes, Annaud also informs us that over a million Tibetans died at the hands of "evil Chinese communists", a cooked number which most serious academics reject. Scenes like this make "Seven Years in Tibet" a covertly political film, the Dalai Llama presented as a saintly figure unjustly torn from his people and so deserving of political reinstatement. That the Dalai Lama leads only one branch of Tibetan Buddhists, and that the only people calling for his "return" are the unelected Tibetan royals who exploited Tibetans via a repressive military-ruled feudal state, are messy realities ignored by Annaud. That the Lamas speak for themselves and not the Tibetan people (just as every group of privileged exiles has turned to the United States to help them return to power, the Dalai Lama received CIA funding for a number of years), that half of Tibet's population were serfs or slaves before the Chinese arrived (the rest were under the autocratic rule of the Tibetan aristocracy), and that Tibetan peasants sided with Communists and aggressively attacked Tibetan-theocratic institutions, is likewise ignored. Indeed, Tibetan peasants were some of the most radicalised Communists in China precisely because they suffered heavily under their previous rulers. This is not to defend the actions of China ? certainly the Lamas were capable of reforming Tibet themselves, certainly every populace deserves to be autonomous if it so wishes, certainly China's migration policies affect how Tibetans now vote on issues of independence ? but to highlight the fact that Annaud has presented a sanitised portrait of the region.Most big films "about" Buddhism avoid the "tenets" of Buddhism. In "Seven Years in Tibet", Harrer and the Dalai Lama share a number of cute scenes, but philosophy largely remains off-topic. A better director would fully exploit the possibilities that this material lends ? why does a character like the Dalai Llama, who renounces the ego, selfhood and private property care about quaint systems of land ownership and leadership? Didn't exile make the Dalai Llama a wiser man? etc ? but again Annaud only cares about the superficial. The film costars Jamyang Wangchuk and David Thewlis. 7.5/10 ? See "The Last Emperor", "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring" and "Into Great Silence".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time. I knew it was not a hit... I knew there were many people pathetically ripping this film apart. But the trailers made me see nothing to complain. Finally I did see this movie... And by Jove, I was astounded by its utter simplicity. There are no melodramatic moments... no harsh musics raising a staccato. The movie begins... and ends... in the most unpretentious manner. And that's its beauty. Only one with the right "eyes" can see this movie.Brad Pitt has given a finely nuanced performance, he is as subtle as is required. The other person who caught my attention is the traitor... his character shows the plight of many in the Indian subcontinent. On the whole, this film gives a real account of what actually happened... no embellishments... no down-playings. If you are tired of all the superhero action flicks or the Almighty American Animations, this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirit versus oppression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, I didn't pay much attention, so I didn't pick up the most important details. Second time I was drawn in and then I could really enjoy this movie. "Seven years in Tibet" follows the story of an Austrian alpine star and his life in Tibet. His encounter with Tibet, its culture and people is highlighted very well by the excellent director Annaud and the scenery is incredible.Brad Pitt excels in one of his first solid roles and makes this a worthwhile experience along with David Thewlis, B.D. Wong, Mako, the beautiful Lhakpa Tsamchoe and the young actor playing Dalai Lama. There is humor, drama and tensions here as well as tragedy and political intrigues. Wong is especially effective as the treacherous Ngawang Jigme, the man who becomes the main responsible for his country's fall. This subplot is the most interesting in the film and shows us how traitors have existed and will exist anywhere in the world, even in such a religious and "pure" country as Tibet.All in all, it's a very strong experience and enriching one also. Here we see the everlasting battle of the spirit against oppression, but in contrast to other such movies, this one has a more pessimistic ending. Oppression triumphs. This is clearly one of the most important movies of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story about a living deity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This spectacular film set in the main in Tibet begins in Austria just before the start of the second world war. 7 Years in Tibet is a memorable if not riveting movie of a living deity which transforms the belief of the watcher. The wonderful background drops and scenery and equally dramatic music are superb as the story follows the progress of Heinrich Harrer (still living today) and his relationship with the current Dalai Lama, as a young boy. The peaks of the Himalayas and in particular Nanga Parbat never understates the achievement of this fine film. The Lhasa set is convincing and the spirituality felt throughout the film crescendos to a moving close. You are left with the feeling that you must know more and that wisdom transcends all. Watch it and watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable - Good Scenery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This biographical movie is about real-life Austrian (and Nazi) mountaineer Heinrich Harrar (Pitt) who is unfortunately scaling peaks in British India when WWII breaks out in 1939. Interred in a British POW camp he and his climbing companion (Thewlis) eventually escape and commence a tortuous travail through India into Tibet and all the way to the forbidden city of Lhasa. There the two men make friends, including the young Dali Lama, and find enlightenment.The best thing about Seven Years in Tibet is the breathtaking high mountain scenery. How disappointing to learn the movie was shot in the Andes and not the Himalayas. The story is also compelling following Harrar as he morphs from selfish pig to generally nice guy. Unfortunately it's sometimes awkwardly told, and is over-long. And finally the use of English language dialogue as variously English, German, and Tibetan was as off-putting as Pitt's on-again, off-again German accent.All in all a very ok film, not rip-off from the dollar bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>long with limited tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1939. Austrian Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) is climbing the world's 9th highest peak Nanga Parbat in British India. The mountain has become a German Nazi obsession after previous failures have left 11 dead. He's self-assured but selfish. He leaves behind his expectant wife. Heinrich wants to attempt a summit but Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) takes the team back down. When WWII breaks out, the team is arrested and put into Dehra Dun P.O.W. Camp. His wife leaves him. Heinrick escapes with Peter. Tibet is forbidden to foreigners. Eventually he sneaks into the city of Lhasa where they meet the young Dalai Lama.This is a long movie without much drama. Lots of things happen but I don't really care about much of it. It looks beautiful. I can't really invest myself with Brad Pitt's character. Even as they starve in the mountains, I didn't get a sense of tension. It's a long beautiful fascinating story but a bland watch. I don't care about Heinrich or his relationship. The Chinese invasion has a bit of drama but it could have been so much more compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie based on a true story about a German mountain climber who hid in Tibet during World War II. Moreso, it is about the final days of the independence of Tibet and more of a protest against China's invasion and war crimes in Tibet. Even with that, the movie focuses on the character and we watch how he changes during the time he spends here, and how he grows to understand himself.The movie begins with him running away from his responsibilities to his wife. His wife is about to have a baby, but he really does not want to be around. Instead he wants to climb Mount Everest and be the first person up there. This attitude ends up pushing his wife further away from him, and he discovers later that when he wants her, she is no longer there to help him.This is important as it develops his character, but moreso it has to do with his son. He is imprisoned in a British POW camp in India and as such he never gets the chance to see his kid. Even though he has no interest in fighting the war, he does not want to be a prisoner either, so he constantly tries to escape, finally succeeding with a larger group, but being a very independent person he insists on going off on his own. But what we learn though is that even though he independent, he also is foolish as he squanders all of his food.Tibet comes into it as he wishes to flee there to escape the British. Even then, the Tibetans do not want them in their land because they are simply foreigners, but they manage to escape there, and soon are welcomed in Tibet, especially since they are dying and hungry.The main changes come when the Dali Llama decides that he wishes to meet with this German. He finds this guy's world interesting, and he comes to see the Dali Llama as the son that he never had, but the thing is that the Dali Llama knows that he is not the guy's son. As their relationship grows, so does his understanding of himself, and in the end he finds the courage to return to Germany and to see his son.It is a long movie, but not only is it insightful, and we begin to feel for the plight of the Tibetans, it is also well made. Many films based on true stories generally fall down, but this is quite well done, and I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impeccable scenery and story, definitely worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I wanna say that it is not easy for a mainland Chinese to watch such movie that were strictly banned domestically. Just because the recent protest occurred in Tiananmen Square made me eager to discovering the truth behind the so-called "news". I've heard from my US colleagues that Brad Pitt has been refused to mainland China ever since his acting in this film, and I once told my US friends that the only place I wanna pay for a visit within this country is Tibet and Xinjiang, of course, both are notably "question area" with a great deal of political related conflicts. Tibet, with its beautiful scenery and culture and religious charm, has attracted a lot of people all over the world to see this heaven land, the highest plateau on earth, the closet place to reach the gods in sky. I was amazed by the stunning views in this movie, as well as the mysterious religious-based culture it showed, the ceremonies and the kindhearted people there. And it truly broke my heart when comes to the plots that the liberty troops invaded this holy place and made it as part of people's republic of China. Though without showing the audience too much bloody scenes, the moment that the communist party delegates step on the gorgeous prints the humble monks are praying for, is just like a needle stamp into my brain nerves and I trembled. Furious with such bandits to ruin others' religious belief so easily and without regret, angry about how they are acting and no wonder that so many years has passed, these group of people are just exactly the same as 60 years ago. A lot of officials nowadays are just the way like the delegates in this movie- rude, arrogant, disrespectful, no manners at all. Shame on me, oh gosh. I don't know why the paramount leaders always have this desire to control other race and expand the territory. Those people have their own culture and religious beliefs, they are totally different with Han ethnicity, from head to toe. Why bothers controlling their homeland and trying to brainwash to make everyone like an ethnicity that actually has no religious no beliefs at all? I cannot understand any single one massacre in human history, though I know the saying, every nation is built on blood and tears. And as a result of retrieve Tibet, there are Han Chinese crowd in Lhasa and as a consequence of protests that never stops in Tibetan, there are tons of liberty troops quarter in Tibet autonomous region and can put down every single "counter-revolutionary" riot by military force immediately. I know there are racial discrimination between Tibetan and Han ethnicity nationwide, Dalai lama's expelled from his people and homeland (which is a taboo topic within red China), how situation deteriorates to today is never my or a peace-loving person's wish. Apart from the politics inner depth of this movie, the loving and honesty Tibetans moved me a lot. How I wish this holy place, the reputable nearest city (Lhasa) to heaven, will never ever destroyed by anything from outside world, neither party itself nor Western civilizations. The world needs colorful cultures and races and religious beliefs, thus will leave something valuable to our offspring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography, otherwise mostly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's that fact that I have read the book 3 times, but having read other books and seen the corresponding films this one was particularly bad. It starts with the main character, Heinrich Harrer, played by Brad Pitt. I'd have expected much more of a world class actor. He doesn't behave like an alpinist, nor does he resemble an Austrian in general. However, in defence of Pitt, the screenplay is probably the worst bit of this film and as such probably a difficult task for any actor. When Harrer was invited to the premiere of the film, he mostly praised it, but only because he was a polite and humble man - much to the contrary what Becky Johnston (the screenplay author) made of him. She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience. Anyone who has seen Werner Herzog's "Rescue Dawn", would agree that an escape story can be done much better with a much lower budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there "enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion." And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one.7.4/10</fullReview>

He and a fellow escapee, Peter Aufschnaiter,played by David Thewlis, make their way to the Forbidden City in Tibet, where Peter finds a wife and Heinrich befriends the Western culture-obsessed teenage Dalai Lama,portrayed by Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, the spiritual leader of his Buddhist nation. As Heinrich waits out the war, his friendship with the Dalai Lama begins to transform him from haughty to humble, but a crisis with China looms.The film ends with a series of title cards that list figures that quantify the death and destruction as a result of Chinese occupation. Harrer kept a good relationship with Dalai Lama after his flee from Tibet to India.The story was characterized as a road picture,epic and spiritual journey of Harrer.It is a beautiful film with a story so typical-yet-unusual coming-of-age of a man who becomes a better person.Although the relationship between Harrer and Dalai Lama was lacking,it manages to become interesting due to the extra-ordinary performance of Brad Pitt.Because of it,the film does not fall short in both satisfaction and entertainment despite this shortcoming.</fullReview>

Beautiful and unforgettable,If you have not seen this yet you should! loved it. This masterpiece, still makes me curious every time I see it. Brad Pitt does an amazing job portraying an Austrian, even down to his accent. The cinematography is extraordinary, and the direction is quite good.

		<fullReview>I have neither read the novel nor have I seen the other film-version of this. Furthermore, I don't know the actual history, so I don't know how accurate this is. This has clear pro-Tibet, anti-Chinese(and, to an extent, negative towards Communism) agenda, but first-hand accounts of actual events are always going to be colored somewhat by the personal views of those providing them, so it could be argued that it fits and makes it all the more authentic. It follows a self-centered and arrogant mountain-climber as he goes through a journey(well, not only one, and of course, the literal one that he embarks upon is the less interesting). Respect is paid to the religion and traditions. The plot and pacing are good, and this is never boring. There is a measure of war-action and genuine, effective suspense, though neither are the focus. If those are what you're going for, look elsewhere. The acting is all excellent. This has beautiful imagery, and the cinematography and editing are impeccable. The DVD comes with a well-done and insightful making-of featurette of about fifteen minutes length, and two theatrical trailers, all worth the time. This has a little violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to fans of drama. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise, let down by everything else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This had the foundations to be something truly special. An Austrian mountain climber leaves a dying marriage to explore the Himalayas in British India, but with the onset of World War II is forced to flea through inhospitable terrain to Tibet where he is befriended by a doomed world leader.Fantastic, how could such a unique and complex plot go wrong? Well believe me, they found a way.10 minutes into the movie and I'd already given up on the script, it was dull from the first line and barely improved after that, no point waiting for a witty or insightful remark because it isn't coming.Then there was the editing. Seemingly important scenes are over in a heartbeat while pointless scenes are dragged out. Moments that seem like big twists are immediately and coincidently reversed just 5 seconds later, it's all a bit of a mess. The film never really flows, it limps along, takes a sudden leap, then limps again.Brad Pitt isn't too bad but the supporting cast is pretty hopeless, the acting quality would barely compete with a daytime soap opera, and the elevator music soundtrack just makes thing worse.If you like a bit of culture and funky scenery then it might be worth a look, but otherwise Seven Years in Tibet will feel like seven years in solitary confinement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is great. It touches your heart and your soul. It helps to give faces to Tibetans and their plight. It speaks about the German invasion and an individual's struggle towards becoming themselves. I thought it was amazing. To see a man, who would not take no for an answer or accept that he could be held down. Continue to fight despite what others said and learning who he is gaining peace in his objectives towards life and achieving his goal. Planting the Tibetan Flag was an awesome contrast to the beginning when he was told to plant the flag with the swastika. The movie contained depth and broaden/confirmed my perception regarding why we are here. Maybe I am simple but I thought it was great. There is more to life than this, if I could give it all up and lead that lifestyle my life would be good. Only thing I hated to see was the oppression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But What about the Nazi SS?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a visually and emotionally impressive film, with a fine lead performance by the versatile Brad Pitt and an amazing performance by the young Tibetan Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, who plays the Dalai Lama aged 14 (and whose younger brother apparently played the Dalai Lama aged 8). The film is very beautiful to look at, and the Buddhist atmosphere is convincing, with a great deal of attention to ritual detail from a Tibetan production adviser. But the film raises many disturbing questions and doubts. I have not read the book, but the consensus of opinion from several reviewers seems to be that this film is highly inaccurate and that many incidents are entirely made up by the screenwriters. However, I am more troubled by the Nazi issue. Heinrich Harrer was a member of the SS, and although he is admitted in some sources to have been a sergeant, he may well really have been a commissioned officer. In the film it is admitted that Harrer was a committed Nazi when he was in Austria, which is very honest, but nothing is mentioned about the SS or that he would therefore have been under SS military orders when he went to Tibet (indeed, he could not have gone in any other capacity, since he was in the SS and had met Hitler). Harrer's internment by the British in India during the War was thus not of an ordinary harmless Austrian mountain climber but of a soldier of the SS, which was a very serious matter in wartime, and the film glosses over this entirely. Instead, Harrer is made to appear an unjustly imprisoned man, which is very far from the truth. Few viewers of this film can possibly be expected to know of the Nazi obsession with Tibet or the reasons for it. Nor is the depiction of Tibetan Buddhism as a wholly good institution accurate. The true facts are very different. There were thousands of monasteries in Tibet and some contained 'good guys' and some contained 'bad guys', to put it in its simplest terms. There were sects of Tibetan monks, doubtless a small minority, who were 'on the left hand path' and involved in black magic. They were sometimes called 'the Yellow Hats' by the Nazis. People like the Dalai Lama, who hate things like black magic and believe in love and gentleness, were strongly opposed to them. In other words, Tibetan Buddhism was anything but uniform, it was diverse. Hundreds of 'Yellow Hat' lamas went to Germany during the 1930s and 1940s, and three hundred of them committed ritual suicide in Berlin just as the Russians were invading the City at the end of the War, and their bodies were found all lying in rows not far from Hitler's bunker. These 'evil lamas' were in league with Hitler, and were controlled through the SS, of which Harrer was a member. It was their 'job' to use their spiritual black magic powers to help the Nazis win the War, and Hitler became annoyed with them at the end because he believed they had failed him and that their mystical powers had been ineffective. The Nazis believed all kinds of crazy things, and the SS was the occult core of the Nazi movement, with its head, Heinrich Himmler, being totally obsessed by such matters, including his Tibetan lamas. Among the bizarre beliefs of the Nazis was that there were 'secret chiefs', hidden spirits of gigantic, super-human size, in command of the dark forces, who resided in deep caves beneath the Himalayas. The Nazis sent various expeditions to Tibet in the 1930s, and some of them were received in Lhasa, or at other places which were friendlier than Lhasa. So it seems that Harrer was somewhat less than candid in what he revealed about this, and that the film in turn is even more obfuscating on the issue. Probably it is true that Harrer really did reject his Nazi past after his years in Tibet, but although admitting to a Nazi past to a certain extent, there was no advantage to him, and indeed there was considerable personal danger, in giving any fuller details. After all, his former colleagues would certainly have taken reprisals against him if he had told the true full story about SS penetration of Tibet. It was acknowledged at the top of the Nazi leadership by such occult fanatics as Himmler and Hess that Hitler was being inspired, perhaps even manipulated, by the primaeval 'dark powers' who resided beneath the mountains of Tibet and who would grant the Nazis dominion over the whole earth if they received enough blood sacrifices. The real reason why millions of people were killed in the gas chambers, by no means all of whom were Jews, was not a simplistic anti-Semitism at all (though that was put about for mass consumption, and the anti-Semitism was real enough), but was as a black magic 'blood sacrifice' to the 'dark powers' in Tibet. Hitler and Himmler believed that if they fed the evil spirits inhabiting the caverns beneath Tibet with the souls of millions of humans, the evil spirits would then grant them rule over the earth as their representatives, and at the same time they would be 'making a New Man' of pure Aryan blood. The SS leadership celebrated black masses and many strange sexual rituals and performed human sacrifices. Himmler was the Grand Master and he and his twelve chief subordinate initiates actually worshiped Satan at Schloss Wewelsburg. Concealing the truth about Harrer's original SS membership does no one any good. Indeed, the contrast between Harrer's true SS past, as opposed to the sanitized version of it which says he was merely a Nazi sympathizer, and his later attitudes does him far more credit than he has ever received. Maybe we should look at it that way, and not be too starry-eyed about Germans in Tibet in the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far cry from the book, but worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heinrich Harrer's written account of his time spent in Tibet is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read, but clearly was not easily adaptable to the big screen, since many details in the movie have been fabricated for dramatic effect (for example, Harrer's personality comes across very differently in the book). However, most of these details pertain to the main characters (Harrer and Aufschnaiter) and their interactions with each other, and not the nature of their surroundings. Also, the most important section of the movie, in which Harrer serves as a tutor for the Dalai Lama, seems to correspond well to the events described in the book. I'd advise reading the book and watching the movie, as the movie provides visuals that the book lacks, and the book provides insights that the movie lacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True to the spirit of Tibet, with an incredible attention to details (both at materialistic and spiritual levels), this movie is a remarkable achievement. The challenge undertaken was all the more impressive that the main characters portrayed in the movie (Heinrich Harrer and the Dalai Lama) were still alive at the time the movie was made (50 years after the facts !), because of the political sensitivities involved in the making of the movie and (as a partial result) the various locations involved in the film-making. In the end, one has to wonder how everything was orchestrated for the movie to appear so seamless, so fluid.Beyond the beautiful scenery and story, the movie also stimulates a genuine reflection on cultural clashes, spirituality and materialism, personal goals and true achievements. At times moving, at times funny, it manages to subtly superimpose the destinies of a people and the main characters.</fullReview>

Was he believable? Yes. Was the story believable? Yes, in fact, how much do any of us think about Tibet and the struggle their citizens endure? Is this the greatest movie I have seen? No. But it did register "yes" on my only true test..."Will I see this again?". "Yes" movies have a story told in a congruent manner. The experts trashed the story, while I found it to be interesting. I have a suspicion the author's Nazi past had something to do with the negative reviews, though the Nazi part has little to do with the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vibrant tale of a caustic climber's change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heinrich Harrer is not a nice man. Driven, you might say, but overall not the most gregarious of individuals. His single-minded mission: scale a particularly difficult Alps peak in Austria. Of course, when he does so he abandons his girlfriend and their unborn child, but hey - you have to have goals in life, right? But this isn't a simple tale of a man finding himself on the mountain. You see, poor Heinrich's dream of scaling the peak isn't realized. World War II breaks out and he's taken off the mountain by Allied forces and imprisoned. He breaks out and attempts to visit Tibet, completely closed off to foreigners. Starving and cold, he eventually gains admittance, and through luck somehow becomes friends with the young Dalai Lama. It's the relationship between the two of them that changes Heinrich from a bitter, selfish, and self-absorbed young man into a diligent, thoughtful and courageous adult. At the Dalai Lama's bidding, Heinrich introduces movies to the Tibetans, and he teaches the young spiritual leader all he can about the Western world. Perhaps the most appealing thing about this true-to-life story is the casting of Brad Pitt as Heinrich. The man with the six-pack abs is not usually the first choice when it comes to the pensive roles, but Pitt pulls off the feat with style and a real sense of class. What's more, his character's transformation is gradual and perfectly plausible; it's not one of those one-minute-he's-a-jerk, the-next-minute-he's-a-saint transformations. This isn't easy for an actor to do, especially one with Pitt's maligned reputation. Mix in delightful cinematography with sumptuous scenes of Tibet itself, and you got yourself a fine movie. Don't think of it as overburdened drama, think of it as a spiritual odyssey. The true purpose and nature of this odyssey, however, remains unknown to our protagonist until he visits the ancient city of Tibet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the first thing that needs to be mentioned is the accent. Brad Pitt's Austrian accent is quite poor, but he does a good enough acting job that he nearly makes up for it. The music and visuals are great, although about average for John Williams. The main draw for this movie is watching Harrer's transformation from arrogant prick to thoughtful man. I haven't read Harrer's autobiography so I can't comment on that, but I like the somewhat subtle uses of historical events throughout this movie. The secondary character, Peter, is another interesting character and acts as a moral foil to Harrer's arrogance throughout the first hour. The scenes with the Dalai Lama were funny and emotionally touching, but the child actor laughed way too much in the first few scenes with him. To wrap it all up, Seven Years in Tibet is an emotionally gripping film with a clich but touching plot and above-average acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film succeeded in doing something remarkable, namely, to portray all the main characters in poor light. Far from being faithful to the book (on which it is based) it lowers the stature of Heinrich Harrer, Peter Aufschnaiter and HH the Dalai Lama. Some new dimensions have been introduced being Harrer's longing for his son, a Love triangle, and competitive nature of friendship between Harrer and Aufschnaiter. None of these things were present in the book. Another disappointing part of the movie is that very little coverage has been given to the part describing the duo's escape and subsequent success in entering Tibet.Though, not everything is lost because this film succeeds in attracting international attention to the plight of the Tibetan people and the tragedy that befell Tibet. For this I give it 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tibetan version of "Lawrence of Arabia."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Lawrence of Arabia", the scenery (Tibet and the Himalayan Mountains) add to the appeal of this film. But there is also a story line connection -- a British office/Austrian mountain climber with personal psychological issues becomes adviser to Prince Faisal/the Dalai Lama. That's about as far as I can stretch the analogy because Lawrence led the Bedouins to victory over the Turks while Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) was not a military adviser and Tibet was had no victory over Communist China. I thought that Brad Pitt did a splendid job of showing arrogance, disdain and sensitivity at the appropriate times of the story. David Thewlis is perfection as Peter Aufschnaiter, a more disciplined and sensitive leader of a German mountain climbing expedition. Harrer, who already is recognized as a champion European climber, is a member of Aufschnaiter expedition to conquer Nanga Parbat in British India. During the climb they encounter adverse weather conditions. Harrer want to continue to a higher level that he hopes will be above the storm, but team leader Aufschnaiter insists on descending instead. At the bottom they are imprisoned as enemy aliens as World War II has begun and Germany is now an enemy of the British. (Note:Austria was annexed into Germany before the Allies declared war on Germany.) They plot to escape but have limited options of where to escape to. Tibet is the closest independent nation but no foreigners are allowed in Tibet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully filmed and well scored, Seven Years in Tibet narrates the story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer's journey (both physical and spiritual), his experiences in Lhasa, and his friendship with the child Dalai Lama. Heinrich Harrer's transformation from an emotionally immature and egotistic narcissist to an enlightened and more sensitive man parallels the story of Buddha's path to enlightenment.. Buddhism's underlying doctrine is that of compassion and it offers it's adherents a way of living that will remedy the suffering of the human condition. Harrer's discontent is his suffering. Prior to his journey to Tibet, Harrer's marriage is falling apart and he openly resents Aufschnaiter, the leader of the expedition to the Himalayas. Through his friendship with the Dalai Lama and the detachment from his "European way of life", Harrer learns to leave behind his selfish tendencies. He grows to regret abandoning his pregnant wife in favor of his own ambitions and manages to overcome his jealousy of Aufschnaiter for marrying Pema Lhaki. The wisdom that he gains from the Dalai Lama and Buddhist teachings even drives him to leave his beloved Tibet to return to Austria in order to make amends with his wife and son. As he deals with the challenges of scaling Nanga Parbet (the ninth highest mountain range in the world and the death of dozens of mountaineers before him), as well as the political turmoil of World War 2 Europe, he so too deals with his own demons and, despite not formally converting to Buddhism, adapts the clarity of a Buddhist way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Brad Pitt is definitely not one of my favourite actors, I think he definitely deserves credit where credit is due. I feel he did an excellent job in this film. I could not imagine anyone else in the role of Heindrich Harrer. Really, though, that bleached-blonde mop isn't the best thing about this movie. This film showed the purity of the former Tibet, where foreigners were not allowed, where outside influences were shunned. The Tibetans were and are a gentle people, but they have been corrupted by imperialistic Westerners (and Communists) so that they are no longer the otherworldly people they seem in "Seven Years In Tibet."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, if slightly one-track</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. I put it in the Cry Freedom genre, although if anything it is better than that. I cannot understand people saying it is too long. The whole point about the opening sequence is to set up the contrast of the ego-centricity of Heinrich with the humility of the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan people. Without that beautiful contrast the film would lose its meaning. There is a delightful portrayal of Tibet and its people. This becomes the film's only weakness: it really is a cause celebre, and therefore slightly one-track. But the spiritual insights engendered soar above that problem, without ever being as 'in your face' as Cry Freedom was from a decade or so ago.A truly superb film. It comes close to being in my top ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An editor may have been sorely needed during the first hour of the film, but if you made it 40 minutes in chances are you stayed. The scenery was breathtaking as were the costumes and the seeming authenticity of the setting. Once again Pitt tackles a role involving a foreign accent (of sorts) and does an admirable job; appearance-wise it certainly wasn't difficult to impersonate an Austrian skiier, but the sequence of the changes that took place within the persona of Heinrich Harrer over the years as the story unfolds was well portrayed. Even the uninformed will now know something about Tibet and its plight as both a nation and a people. The ethically and morally bankrupt political apparatus that depicts the ruin and exile of what's created before the viewer is stark, moving, and unforgettable. (Rating 4 stars of 5.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story's of a Nazi German expedition to conquer Nanga Parbet in Himalayas. That should have been another example of the leading role of uebermensch in the Goebels's propaganda machine. The expedition is led by a selfish, edgy chap with his own unsteady background of sacrificing his wife and their to be born son for the trip to the mountains and glory. 'For love and glory' with one part missing. Folks fail to reach the peak, and are interned by the British, which triggers a line of escape tries. When he and his deputy manage to reach Lhasa he finds himself in another universe, where he is able to live with a little help of his growing up friend Dalai Lama. In the meantime he signs divorce papers and and thus makes one of his mates a pa to his son. When his deputy with clear conscience manages to fit in by marrying a cute, wise native girl, he is being cast about Dalai Lama as if in search for forgiveness of his son who he's lost for good at the moment. There are so many parallel themes and motives in the movie, that one couldn't possibly grasp, and review them in a few lines. The film is touching and underrated. If one wishes to go over the river and into the trees, try it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably unlike the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a theory that if choosing between a book and a movie made from that book one should see the movie first because if the book is read first the movie is bound to be a letdown. While there are rare exceptions to this adage ("The Green Mile" e.g.) none is more true than "Seven Years in Tibet." Brad Pitt shows his acting chops, but the departures from the story of the book will cause hand wringing in the unsuspecting viewer. In the actual story: (Note SPOILERS ahead): -Harrer was not married, had no child to write to, no wife to leave behind and seek a reunion with. -Harrer was not particularly arrogant a person or in conflict with his fellow mountaineers before their capture. He seemed to be apolitical despite recent revelations of Nazi membership and simply self-absorbed. Thus, he did not need the "redemption" of his personality that the movie depicts. -There was no beautiful woman competing for the affections of the two Westerners. Aufschnaiter apparently never married, or if he did, Harrer made no mention of it and told of his own lack of inclination to form relationships with women there. -There was no palace intrigue related to the Chinese invasion. -The Dalai Lama appears only peripherally until near the end of the story. Although he and Harrer clearly bonded, this bond was described at the end of the book and did not form the basis for Harrer's immersion into Tibetan culture.One could ask what Harrer himself, in hindsight, thought of Germany's treatment of foreigners, particularly in view of the way the British treated him despite his many escape attempts ("sporting"); what he felt at the defeat of Naziism; how he might compare his feelings about Chinese aggression with his feelings about Germany's policies; what he sees of Germany's position in the post-war world, such as its democratic government and its United Nations roles in the Tibetan issues of Chinese occupation. None of this is mentioned in the book or its Epilog, though sufficient time has passed that a coda to the movie would have been possible and valuable.The move seems to have taken the title and run with it, but the story was left behind. Nice scenery, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Brad Pitt in many films like 12 Monkeys and Fight Club, but here he is not in his best form. His accent is just lousy and really unnecessary - in fact, I believe it hindered his performance which should have been much better than what was delivered. He is a particularly intelligent actor relishing obscure roles, but this role either did not require enough strangeness for him to really shine, or he just couldn't deliver the nuances of the changes in his character at that time. The movie is beautiful in and of itself, although overly long and tedious. While pretty to look at, it offered very little emotionally. It basically told the story of the Tibetans, albeit through Pitt's character's eyes, but it did concentrate, and that unabashedly, on Pitt's character's transformation. That said, I definitely could identify with the character, and felt enlightened and encouraged by the transformation itself.Without a doubt, the actors portraying the Dalai Lama stood out and were absolutely believable. Great casting for that role. I would give this movie a 6.5 because the film lacked the power and impact that this kind of film could have had, but it is important enough to see, especially for foreign relations neophytes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lack of character in Harrer is a problem and produces a film that is OK but doesn't do anything well (Minor spoiler regarding final shot of film)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fleeing the pressures of his family life, Heinrich Harrer joins an expedition to climb the Himalayas and raise morale in Nazi Germany by claiming it as a victory for Hitler. However, he and the others are captured by the British army during the climb and sent to a POW camp. After many attempts at escape, Heinrich and a group of others manage to escape. With his friend Peter, Heinrich reaches Tibet only to be turned away. They get away from their guides and return to Tibet in disguise and are taken into the Holy City. After some time Heinrich is granted an audience with the young Dalai Lama, beginning a journey of discovery for both of them that continues through peace and occupation by China.One of many films of the period that sought to raise awareness surrounding Tibet, this film is reasonably effective in that regard despite being deeply flawed in others. In terms of delivering a broad history of Tibet and China this film is reasonably OK and is interesting if simplistic. The focus on the (true) story of Harrer helps gives the film structure but also creates weaknesses of it's own. Focusing on this character makes the film more about him than Tibet itself and he isn't really very interesting (although early events in his story here are). The film fudges over his Nazi beliefs and would have us believe that he is nothing to so with any of it ? a stand that many have attacked as simply not true but one that was needed to sell the film to modern audiences (and get Pitt on board!). I have no problem with them leaving this out; no, my problem with Harrer is that he is mostly bland and his tale is played OVER Tibet rather than being used as a gateway into the wider story. It is not uninteresting but it is a little overlong and the story is hard to really buy into emotionally because it is such a flawed mix.The direction uses the scenery well and also produces some exciting early scenes on the mountain, but the bigger battle sequences failing to really spark into life. In fairness to what the film was trying to do, a big part of the problem is Pitt himself. Early on he tries to play his character a little unpleasant (I assume to make his transformation more obvious) but he only comes across as his usual swaggering, slightly arrogant character. This doesn't sit well with me and I didn't rate his performance very much at all. And I don't care if his pronunciation of 'Himalayas' is correct, it's still hilarious and I was very glad when he stopped saying it! Pitt's failure to make a person of Harrer is a major reason that I wasn't ever engaged in the film and the final shot of him with his son was just a perfect example of how uninvolving his character had been. He is rather hammy, prone to irrational traits in his character and unsuited to the film.Thewlis is better but given less to do ? however his flirting with Tsamchoe is not convincing. Wong is poorly used and his famous face in such a role is a distraction. Wangchuk is good as Kundun and is fun but how true to reality his portrayal is.Overall this is an OK film but it doesn't do anything particularly well. The stuff about Tibet is told in very broad strokes and will not tell most people anything that they don't already know. The focus on the character and story of Harrer also fails because he is not really an engaging character; part of this is due to a flawed script but a bigger contributory factor is a pretty poor performance from Pitt, who doesn't suit the role one little bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say my english is not very good. I have seen the comments of others on movie 7 years in Tibet and would like to say my opinion. Of course the movie is long, it shows a long period spent in Tibet and follows the book. I am deeply interested in buddhism and Tibet and for me the movie is beautiful. I am not interested, for example, in films about mafia and for me the movie "Goodfather" is nothing. Or for example "The raging bull" - why should I be interested in the life of some boxer, even if film is very well made and with good actors? Those films are full of actions because show such theme and that is what people like, such is this world. And "7 years in Tibet" is not such film. And why anybody should be interested in the chinese occupation of Tibet? The same was with my country, during our fight for liberation the world has sentenced us to death. Such is this world. The truth remains, "7 years in Tibet" is beautifil film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a Brad Pitt movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's a fascination with the Dalai Lama. Maybe it's the breathtaking Tibetan landscapes. Maybe it's the lively characterization of the Tibetan people. Any way you look at it, in spite of its faults this film is an engaging, intimate portrayal of a young spiritual leader in his formative years and the people of Tibet in a time of cultural metamorphosis and impending political subversion. Brad Pitt's performance as the Austrian Heinrich Harrer is commendable, if not the highlight of the film. The extroversion of his character is believable, humorous at times, at other times painful. This is a story of growth, change, evolution and upheaval on many levels; personal, spiritual, cultural and political. Though predominantly Western in perspective this film still takes a thought provoking look at Eastern thought, values and culture.</fullReview>

His German accent is apparently coached by Schwarzenegger. We never read the book, but some of the dialog is simply atrocious. The " Nazi " beginning is totally ridiculous and not necessary. Even civilians wear swastica armbands. The ending of the film is totally wrong, it just does not fit the time, location, mood of the fifties in Austria. From a dramaturgical point the ending - as the beginning cheapens the film. The young Dalai Lama is wonderful and so are all the palace interiors and rituals. The various action scenes are badly directed AND cut. The whole movie needs some heavy pruning. A strong, merciless, editor could save the film without reshooting one scene !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really bad piece of disinformation and propaganda. Harrer is depicted as ant-Nazi, while in his real life he was very proud of the honors he received from Hitler and the photos where he appears with the Nazi boss. As a matter of fact he did not leave Tibet until 1950. Why did he remain there? Was he acting as an "adviser" for some Western power? Was he scared of going back to Austria and being summoned by an anti-Nazi courtroom? Or was he even more afraid to fall in the hands of Chinese judges? After all, he was a Nazi, allied with the Japanese, who had invaded China and killed thousands and thousands of innocent Chinese people. And Aufschnaiter? Did he really remain in the Himalayan areas because he had "married a Tibetan woman"? Or was he similarly afraid to go back to the West? After all, he had joined the Nazi Party in 1933. And so on. Movies should be respectful of History and not play with It and twist It as if It were a toy to use for political amusement.</fullReview>

The Movie is Flat, Despite the Snowy Peaks and Defiant Hills. The Film Never Gains any Attraction Beyond that of Postcards Until the Movie's Star Meets the Lama. Yes there are some Interesting Cultural Displays but a lot of it is Superficial and Boring (like the ice skating) and have Little to do with the Encroaching Chinese and Spiritual Beauty Within the 14th Incarnation that is the Personified and Deified Dalai Lama, Tibet's Spiritual Leader.The Actor Portraying the 14 Year Old Lama could have Taught Brad Pitt Something about Acting. Like doing More than just Smirking and Tilting the Face and Brushing Back Long Bottled Blonde Locks. Overall, the Ending is Rushed and should have been a Climax of Powerful Military and Political Suppression but is Over so Quickly it is Almost an Afterthought. So the Film is Focused Throughout on All the Wrong Things and it Renders the Movie Limp and Long with More Filler than Fact, and the Result is a Noble if Failed Effort to Make the Case for the Tibetan People and the Dalai Lama. Based on a True Story but this is Hollywood Gloss Misused and does Little to Inspire Ire and Bring Light to the Injustice. The Great Spiritual People of Tibet Deserve Better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scenary's the real star of Seven Years in Tibet: the film begins with some excellent mountain climbing sequences, and the bleak but gorgeous Himalayan skyscape looms high above all subsequent action. But Brad Pitt, in the lead role, is as wooden as his accent, with none of the charisma he later showed in Fight Club, though David Thewlis is predictably excellent as his companion. Unfortunately, the film's depiction of Tibetan society seems idealised; and most crucially, the everyday reality of life in Tibet for the German mountaineers is dealt with only sketchily, in spite of the film's great length and in spite of the fact that it's this that underpins the development of the characters throughout the story. But the story itself is good (and tragic); and the film gets enough right to make you want to know more about the land and its history.

		<fullReview>OK, Seven Years in Tibet. It sounds like its going to be a bit of a four hour epic and you get a bit aprehensive before you start, but honestly there is no need to at all.Brad Pitt, our lead for the film, is an Austrian climber and a member of the pre-ww2 nazi party. He is married and has a child due in less than a month, so what does he do he runs off to climb a mountain. Thats obviously what you'd want to do.His character is absolutely arrogant and you don't like him at all. The film then centres upon this and shows us how he develops with time and the factors that influence this change. His son is born without him present and due to the lack of love he expresses to his wife she divorces him. Pitt is then arrested at the start of the war and breaks free from a prison camp and final stumbles into Tibet and the sacred city. Well we don't want to give it all away, so I'll stop all that plot development stuff right there.The big stunts, high adrenalin action is not there in this film at all. But it doesn't suffer at all as a result. To me this film is all about the script and the characters in them. Pitts performance is brilliant, the best that he has ever given. There is nothing that you don't believe about the way he portrays his character. The way he develops it throughout the film is great to watch. When you couple this with the true story on which it is based you have a great film on your hands.Well worth a watch, who'd of thought it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie for the depiction of Tibetan culture. I have never been there, but the scenic beauty captured in the movie inspires me to visit that place. It is not the best movie, but at least someone has made an effort to bring out the plight of the Tibetans. I have been to Dalai Lama's monastery in India, which is home away from home to Tibetans since 1959. They are peace-loving people. Why should their country not be freed. Their cause has been quite under-rated at the global level. "Seven years in Tibet" brings about awareness of the situation of Tibet. There are some flaws in this movie. The length makes is dragging. It fails to represent the reality and modernism of Tibetan culture. Some say that there is a discrepancy in the portrayal of characters and their real selves, and that the facts have been twisted, that the Chinese never landed their plane in Tibet before the war etc. But I look at it as an attempt to bring the Tibetan issue to light. So even if some people were not actually as shown in the movie, the history remains intact. Tibetans and others who are under oppressors need more such attempts to provide them a mouthpiece for voicing their issues to the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dramatic Triumph.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitt gives us a moving portrayal of Heinrich Harrer, a man torn between two worlds - that of his commitment to his wife in Austria (under the flag of the Nazi's) and his passion for mountain climbing. Annaud successfully covers Heinrich's hard journey through the Himilayas until he finally arrives in Tibet. From there, Heinrich comes to terms with his pompous ego - his materialistic ideals - next to the backdrop of a sacred country on the eve of an invasion from the Chinese communist forces.A little dramatically incoherent in the preliminary scenes, the film suggests it could have gone for longer (hopefully a Director's Cut may be available). The Tibetan culture itself could also have been examined more closely.Nevertheless, the film is a dramatic triumph from its stunning photography to its inspiring score by the master John Williams, with stirring cello solos from Yo-Yo Ma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pitt's character spend most of the movie running away from everything and pushing away anyone who wants to be near him. He finds himself in Tibet and you expect him to have a revelation about life, but he never does. This movie has no inspirational value. A better movie to spend your time with is: "The Razor's Edge". The movie would have been better if they spent some time on his life before the trip to Tibet (to see what he has to run away from other than fatherhood). Though Pitt performed well, you just feel like his character is a shallow and uninteresting person. The best part of the movie is the scenery and seeing how people of Tibet live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lizzen, I haf a gret idea for zis movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, here it is: "Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama." What we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between French, German, American, and British for over 2 hours. Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. But just to make sure the viewer doesnt fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero learns from his young proteg a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves dont seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. And last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a "political" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort. So, zat ist my idea. Vat do you zink? Can ve make zis movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's an attempt here to capture the symbolism of the child as the spiritual leader of humankind. After all, the child is older than the adult by a generation and therefore, evolutionarily speaking, the adult's elder. The idea that a child might be wiser than the adult is plausible since the child is not yet corrupted by the prejudices and delusions of the current society, and may see things more clearly than we can. If I had made this film, I would have worked on those ideas. Still I doubt success since what is really necessary is an illumination of Tibetan Buddhism, which is beyond the reach of a general audience.What Jean-Jacques Annaud does is keep the camera on his star, Brad Pitt, and hope Pitt's charisma will carry the film. It does not, although Pitt does a commendable job, his accent fading in and out notwithstanding. It's just that without any real tension in the story, the film is just a picturesque travelogue, and not a very good one at that. There is no attempt to come to grips with Tibetan society nor with the issues surrounding the Communist aggression. Annaud does work hard on the relationship between Harra and the Dalai Lama, achieving unfortunately a sort of Western mid-brow comprehension. I was going to say news magazine comprehension, but it doesn't even reach that. Harra shows the kid how to work gadgets and trades some superficial knowledge of the world while learning humility and social responsibility. The unavoidable irony that Harra plays the father to the Dalai Lama instead of his own son was agreeable although acted out with entirely too much familiarity. Worse fault though is to just present the child as the Dalai Lama without attempting to show why a child is chosen in the first place. Just to illustrate how far from the reality of Tibetan Buddhism this film was, let me ask the question, why not a girl?(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>A Slow Paced Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it depends on what you were hoping to find with this movie, but I found "Seven Years In Tibet" to be a slow-paced disappointment. I was hoping to come out of this with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Unfortunately, aside from learning that Tibetan Buddhists respect all life and won't harm it (down to and including the lives of worms) I really didn't find much reflection of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality here. There were a lot of Tibetan customs portrayed, but I personally found little depth and no real explanation or exploration. (And, even the Tibetan Buddhist commitment to reverence for life and non-violence is obviously conditional, since the Tibetans apparently had no qualms about forming an army in a desperate attempt to beat back the Chinese.) One gets a picture here of the deep reverence in which the Dalai Lama is held by Tibetans, and of the somewhat xenophobic attitude of the Tibetans, but I found little more.The movie revolves around the experiences of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who, on the eve of World War II, sets out to conquer one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas to plant the Nazi Swastika flag on its summit. Harrer was a difficult to define character. He certainly didn't come across as a devout Nazi (he insisted on calling himself an Austrian rather than a German) and he seemed to have little interest in the swastika flag that was presented to him to plant. While there might be some admiration for him on that basis, he's also an unsympathetic character as the movie starts, leaving his wife and yet unborn son in the midst of a difficult relationship. Failing to conquer the mountain, his team descends to India just as the war breaks out and he's arrested by the British as an enemy alien and sent to a POW camp, from which he escapes and makes his way to Tibet - his time and experiences there being the primary focus of the movie. Harrer clearly "finds himself" (if I can use that term) and becomes attached to the country, the people and the Dalai Lama in the process. As the movie ends, this takes on an overtly anti-Chinese (or, at least, an anti-People's Republic of China) feel, as the Chinese brutally invade and conquer Tibet - an occupation lasting to this day.)Brad Pitt was good in the role. I have no complaint with his performance. In fact, all the performances were good, especially that of the young actor who played the 14 year old Dalai Lama. There's some spectacular scenery (which, unfortunately, is not actually of Tibet, the mountain scenes being shot as I understand it in Argentina and Canada.) I simply would have liked a more fulfilling look at Tibetan Buddhist spirituality, and so came away somewhat disappointed with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was well-acted and the scenery and costumes were impressive. But either the story line of this film or that of Kundun is bogus.I suspect that the Brad Pitt character was far less important to Tibetan history that suggested here, but perhaps more so than in Kundun, which shows NO Western tutors or acquaintances of the Dalai Lama.I saw both films and would say that this one has better scenery and the plot was more suspenseful. From what I know about Tibetan history,though, Kundun was more accurate historically and was filmed in Asia, whereas Seven Years was filmed in Peru. Both films seem too be quite sympathetic to the Tibetan plight of being a nonviolent people having their country taken over by force. An aside: Buddhism is the worlds' ONLY major religion of Aryan origin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Years in Tibet" is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Brad Pitt portrays a character (Heinrich Harrer) who runs away from his problems, and at that, is a very confused and lonely man. To climb the mountain he's at is a national obsession, and earlier expeditions have all failed. When bad weather hits, and snow comes tumbling down, the plan backfires and he and other men run into many obstacles before Tibet lays before him. This movie is considered to be a drama, but toward the last hour it's a comedy. This adventure is a wonderful true version of how a man comes to peace with himself, and the world. In the movie, he learns the values of friendship and love, and ends up doing what is the best for himself.Highly recommended. This is a wonderful story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AN OUTRAGEOUS DISTORTION OF HISTORY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Heinrich Harrer was a Nazi.Secondly, Harrer was in Tibet in the first place because he was fleeing from his responsibilities to his family. The man was a complete and total opportunist.Thirdly, the cutesy little Dalai Lama spouting kitsch philosophy like some Tibetan Kahlil Gibran is absolutely untrue to life. There is no record whatsoever of the little Dalai preaching generalities to Harrer. Fourthly, all observers (including the Dalai Lama himself--see his autobiography) agree that the arriving Chinese were not at all the studiously rude boors depicted in the film, ordering Tibetans around with scowls on their faces and going out of their way to disrespect Tibetan customs. Even Hitler would have been polite on such an occasion, if only for the sake of his dignity.Fifthly, the Chinese did NOT make a diplomatic visit to Lhasa prior to the 1951 invasion, as depicted in this ridiculous film, and if they had done so, they certainly wouldn't have been stupid enough to trust the Tibetans to build them an airplane landing field, since the Tibetans had no experience with aviation. Nor, in all probability, would a Chinese plane have been lucky enough to have landed safely on a field constructed by Tibetans. Nor would the Chinese, having made it there by some miracle, have departed after a five-minute conference with their Tibetan opposite numbers.Sixthly, Brad Pitt gives the impression that this is his first attempt at acting. He's pathetic.The cause of Tibetan autonomy is not served by a film which creates a fantasy and invites viewers to confuse it with historical reality.This is a pretty film to look at, but worthless as drama or as a depiction of history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To enjoy this film, you have to look past some boring parts, Brad Pitt's bad accent and David Thewlis' lackluster performance. However it is visually stunning, scored perfectly, and other than his accent, i felt for Pitt's character. The story is about an austrian mountain climber, who becomes friends with the Dai Lai Lama at the time of China's conquest of Tibet. The screenplay is not great, as the film has its boring parts, and does not flow all that well, the direction is decent, but apart from the great cinematography, thanks to Robert Fraisse (The Notebook, Hotel Rwanda), the direction isn't all that good and I thought the film could have been much more interesting, if only the same kind of effort that went into the cinematography, score and pitt's accent(only kidding), went into the direction and screenplay. It was a decent effort, enjoyable film but can't watch it too many times. 8/10 #209 on my list of all-time favorite films</fullReview>

Before this movie came out, I had never heard of Harrer, and the movie does a very good job telling his story. It shows how he started out working with the Nazis to try and take over parts of South Asia, but then befriended the Dalai Lama and had a change of heart. So, even though Brad Pitt's Teutonic accent isn't the most believable, the movie does a good job showing how a person can change. The cinematography almost is a character all on its own, with the Tibetan landscape. A very awe-inspiring movie. Also starring David Thewlis, B.D.

		<fullReview>The background is totally not like what the movie show.Briton is the first country which invaded Tibet in 1900s.the British robbed the Tibet and seized a large number of fresco and other valuable treasures to fill their museums. And Tibet has been a part of China since the Tang dynasty(700 A.D. or so),its a province of China for more than 1200 years. A country should not be divided by the boundary of nationalities.China has 56 nationalities, so we should divide China into 56 pieces? sh**it! A country's territory should be decided mostly by history but not by the distributing of nationalities. The Communist Party in this movie was described as demons.that's funny.I cant imagine that under the leadership of demons a country could get a Unprecedented economic growth since the last 50 years,which make China become the 3rd biggest economical existence of the world. funny , thats so funnyby the way ,Brad Pitt is so cool so pretty as before, I like that guy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Pitt did a great job of portaying the Austrian climber, Seven Years in Tibet is not a movie worth watching. Most of the movie is boring, with unattractive script and what felt like empty moments when nothing happened. The attempt to potray the Chinese invasion was somewhat unsuccessful, and the approach was a bit childish. The director attempted to trigger emotions, but, his attempt was largely a failure. I found it so boring, that to me, it DID seem like I was sitting at the theater for seven years. Thats seven years of my life I'll never get back.</fullReview>
