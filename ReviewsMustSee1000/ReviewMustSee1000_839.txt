		<shortDescription>Who would be a cop?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dark, moody movie that explores the angst of 3 cops. One, on an undercover assignment, realises that the more time he spends with crooks, etc., the more likely he will become like them. His request for a transfer is promised, on condition that he "brings in" Mr Big.Another, a "good catholic", has more kids than sense and desperately needs to improve his fortunes if his family is to survive.The third, an older, reticent, solitary man on the brink of retirement is totally without illusions about his job or his place in society. Doing his time and collecting his reward (his pension) is all that matters to him. He is aloof and uncommunicative with his colleagues, biding his time until he can quit. Only with an attractive hooker, that he sees regularly, does he show any sign of humanity. All 3 are. basically, decent men working in indecent scenarios and their respective paths cross in a way and at a time and in a place that "we can all see coming" but is no less moving for that. There is a kind of poetry to this, albeit on the darkish side. that lingers . Watching this requires some patience at the beginning, particularly with Richard Gere, whose role as the older cop, asks him to be almost a silent participant in the events, but whose performance grows as the stories unfold. But all the cast are excellent. Cheadle, Hawke, Snipes, D'Onofrio and an eye-catching turn by Ellen Barkin as "the agent from Hell" See this................... 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is clichéd cop film only in setup, not in execution. The scripting and a plethora of strong performance elevate the familiar veins that make up the films structure. In fact, three of the most standard-order plot lines are utilized; and undercover cop who blurs the line between righteous and corrupt, a drug cop who exhibits no blurring in his corruption and an aging veteran slugging it through his last week on the job. These cops are played by Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawk and Richard Gere respectively and each gets equal screen time in a triple thread story that eventually converge on one fateful night.Director Antoine Fuqua's latest treads a thin line between tragic and gritty and outright depressing. This is a gloomy film to be sure, everyone is either a cop, murderer, drug dealer or prostitute (sometimes many of the above) and there is no glimpse of sunshine, so to speak, in Fuqua's Brooklyn. I am a big fan of Fuqua, from his John Woo-esquire debut with The Replacement Killers to the classic cop drama Training Day, to the very underrated Bruce Willis war actionier Tears of the Sun, he is more than a competent auteur and always brings out solid performances from his leads.Hawk (who plays the increasingly corrupt Sal) is perhaps the strongest of three leads, but Gere and Cheadle are very convincing in their roles as well. Unfortunately, despite the admirable development of these characters, the aforementioned ordinary narrative leaves little question about where their respective paths are headed. We also get a blazing comeback from the one and only Wesley Snipes as a criminal and friend of Cheadle's Tango. Rounding off the talented main players are Brian F. O'Byrne as Sal's fellow cop and friend and Will Patton as Tango's lone remaining contact to the just world he feels is fading away. As I have iterated many times, it is the stellar work from the key players that makes Brooklyn's Finest worth your time.The drive behind these three cops is equally compelling. Sal has 5 kids (with 6 and 7 on the way) and is swimming in debt. Through a real-estate contact he sets up a deal to move his growing family to a larger house, only if he can get the big score of drug money he needs. As the date approaches for him to come up with the money he grows increasingly desperate. Gere's Eddie is a burnt-out cop who has all but lost respect for the job, and his fellow cops have all but lost respect for him. His only remaining duty is to escort a rookie around for his final 7 days but things go far less smoothly then he could have hoped. Finally there is Tango, a UC who has lost all his ties to the real world. His wife is filing for divorce and he wants to be made detective first grade a.s.a.p. and spend the remainder of his days behind a comfortable desk and away from a life of crime. In one of the best sequences, Tango is asked why the sudden urge to get out. He tells of a night where he was pulled over by the cops for speeding and legitimately considered killing them. He wants out.If only the despair had been laid on a little less thick and the stereotypes that make up the three main characters polished with a bit more inventiveness, Brooklyn's Finest could have been a classic in the making. Instead we get only what we would expect; a gritty, bloody and well acted police actionier.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well-rounded cop thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest rests on the strong character portrayals of the lives of three ordinary men struggling at different points in their careers. What they each share is the New York Police Department as a workplace.Life isn't perfect - it never is. We always have to give something up in order to do something else - it's called choice. Therein lies man's fatal freedom.Sal (Ethan Hawke) gave up the possibility for flash when he became a cop. He has a growing family with numerous kids but lives in a decrepit, run-down house where the wood mold is causing his pregnant wife lung problems. His NYPD salary isn't sufficient for him to move to a different abode.Can we judge him? It is a context that bears for some humanity from our part. He will do things in the film, but it is difficult for us to point our fingers from a high horse, for we aren't in his situation. Does the end justify the means? While doing undercover work in prison, Tango (Don Cheadle) is saved from death by an inmate, Casanova Philips (Wesley Snipes). The event forms a bond between them. Now Casanova is back out and the force want Tango to send him back in. By taking this shortcut to Detective first grade (read: becoming an undercover agent), Tango is forced to deal with harsh consequences, namely the fact that his wife is in the process of leaving him, and that other than Casanova he has no friends.Eddie (Richard Gere) is retiring and is a morally decadent seemingly useless member of the force. He gets teased by his younger co-worker cops, and seems fed up with his life. We see him put a revolver to his mouth in the morning.Even though he is 7 days away from retirement he must take care of young rookies, fresh faces new to the NYPD. Eddie doesn't get along well with them.It is unclear what happened to his wife, but Eddie now seeks solace in the womanly comforts of a lowly Chinatown hooker.These grotesquely authentic lives are laid out with the aid of a soundtrack that simultaneously sets the pace and follows the psychological states of the main protagonists. The tone of the music will change, for instance, when a particular character is in a tight situation, a situation where he is again confronted with choice.All the actors in this film pull off magnificently intense portrayals. Especially worthy of mention are Cheadle, Snipes, Gere and Hawke -- who once again shows that he can enter the mind of a struggling cop like no other.A steady-paced, involving thriller definitely worth a gander. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Righter and Wronger ways of genre film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua aims high within the limitations he has for Brooklyn's Finest. By that I mean the film is fairly low-budget, or at least middle of the road (my guess is twenty million), and it was shot on location in Brooklyn and places around. He also has a script that has its share of clichés and potential pitfalls for cinematic treatment. It's surprising how well the film comes off with the elements, and they are ALL familiar: the cop just nearing retirement (Gere), on his way out, who has to shepherd a rookie through his first days on the; a corrupted cop (redundant mayhap) that is scrounging for any money he can on raids (Hawke) needs it for a slightly noble cause, a new house for his growing family; a cop undercover (Cheadle) has to choose promotion or loyalty with a criminal takedown on the horizon.Three very recognizable types, and the tropes are there, at least on paper. But where Fuqua sets himself apart, as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day, is to imbue importance (not pretentious but just enough for serious effect) in the direction of scenes, and in casting. The actors take material that could be trite and unconvincing and even stale post-Lumet-cop-movie stuff and make it their own, compelling and heartfelt, and true to the extent that the genre allows. There's real tragedy felt with Hawke's character, albeit he may overact just a bit in some scenes, since this corrupt cop wouldn't be so bad if he could get what he needs ("I don't want God's forgiveness, I want his help," he says in confession), and likewise real conflict with Cheadle's undercover, who has been embedded too long in the trenches, and wants to help the criminal who once saved his life (Wesley Snipes fantastic in an older, slightly wiser version of his character in New Jack City).And then there's Gere. One almost forgets Gere's successes when he's starring in romantic-comedy junk like... well, what's he been in recently for starters. But then one looks at Unfaithful, Days of Heaven, The Hoax, I'm Not There, among some others, and one sees Gere is an underrated presence, a guy who when given material to shine in does very well as an everyman, more than just a typical pretty star. With his role as the on-his-way-out cop, he gives one of his best performances, worn and weary, but strong and good as a cop whenever he can see fit, who at one point makes a mistake that he won't cop to (watch Gere when he's interrogated about his rookie's mishap on a convenience store scuffle and it's something of genius work). It's intense and believable, and even tender and sorrowful work, like when Gere's character is around a prostitute he's fallen for.Back to Fuqua though - this is a filmmaker who knows what he's working in, and wants to transcend it. Perhaps his idol for this kind of production was Sidney Lumet with his cop films: make something dramatic and tragic, and never lose the grit, but add panache with the directing. He knows the conventions and has to stick to them, sometimes for weaker or just expected effect. But watching his style in that last reel, when all three stories that have been going back and forth (ocassionally intertwined) come together at one project building. There's a scene where Hawke is personally raiding a place. Watch the camera in this scene, where it stays put in one spot for seemingly a minute. It could almost be a Tarantino move, something self-conscious but purposeful for the action, the psychology of the emotion of the scene. His work with better material would be astonishing. As it is, it's just good, inventive film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooklyn's Finest Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would you steal bread to feed your family? As Dwight from The Office would say, "it's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male." For Sal (Ethan Hawke), a dirty narcotics officer in Brooklyn's Finest, the answer is clear. Only instead of bread, he is stealing drug money and killing anyone who gets in the way. He needs the money because his pregnant wife is sick from the mold in their home so he needs to pay the down payment on another house he is going to buy. Hawke plays the role with great intensity, just as he did in director Antoine Fuqua's previous movie, Training Day. In that he co-starred with Denzel Washington, only Denzel was the dirty cop, and Hawke played the rookie officer who didn't like what he saw. He got an Oscar nomination for that role, but is just as good, if not better, in this movie. Sal is just one of the three conflicted cops who walk a fine line between cop and criminal. One is Eddie (Richard Gere), who is days away from retirement, and has what is probably the most eventful week of his career. His job is to oversee rookies in the mean streets, and sticks a gun in his mouth a couple of times throughout the course of the movie. His only sources of pleasures are his whiskey and frequent visits with a hooker. The other is Tango (Don Cheadle), an undercover cop who is so deep into the criminal life that he struggles with his own identity. He's been asking for a desk job for years and desperately wants out of the drug beat. The only way he can get out and receive a promotion is by betraying a close criminal friend, Caz (Wesley Snipes). The problem with movies like Brooklyn's Finest is that they often fail to add any depth to their characters in the midst of all the mindless violence. But the great acting from Hawke, Gere, and Cheadle separates this one from the crowd, and makes it a watchable action thriller. And while may not be as good as Training Day, it still shows the rough side of being a cop, and that they may not be as innocent as they appear to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say straight away that the cast of this movie contains ALL of my favorite actors. I thought I was going to be in for a treat, maybe my expectations ruined my conclusions.The biggest problem with this film (in my worthless opinion) is that it is portrayed as dramatic and yet there just seem to be soooooo many holes in the plot that the overall impact is reduced, almost to the point of being farcical. I won't give anything away but I don't believe that 'gangsters' are THAT stupid, I watched the TV show 'The Wire', which I thought was excellent due to it's balanced perspective. This film portrays the cops as being crooked, lifeless and aggressive morons whilst the 'gangster' are simply gun toting foul mouthed idiots who struggle to walk upright, let alone be career criminals.By the time the final scene began I found myself struggling to stay awake because the 'drama' had become so Tepid and predictable.Very very average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloomy and Bitter Police Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Brooklyn, New York, the veteran policeman Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned lonely man that will retire in seven days. The catholic dirty detective Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a family man in despair that needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. The undercover detective Tango (Don Cheadle) is affected by the long period he has been working infiltrated in gangs and has requested to be transferred to an office. Their lives and fates are entwined when Eddie retires and sees a missing girl that has been kidnapped by sex traffickers and he has to take a decision; Sal has to make the down payment of the dreamed house and he does nit have enough money; and Tango is assigned to frame the drug lord Caz (Wesley Snipes) that saved his life years ago and has become his friend. "Brooklyn's Finest" is a gloomy and bitter police story with a cast that is a constellation of stars, some of them with minor parts. I watched this film with great expectations, but unfortunately the screenplay is not original, too long and sometimes confused. The three stories are very well known by viewers of this genre and the narrative is cold, without emotions. The director Antoine Fuqua could (or should) have made a better feature with the available budget and cast. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Atraídos Pelo Crime" ("Attracted by the Crime")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a respectable piece of work but unfortunately we've seen it all before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gritty, profane, and extremely violent thriller centering around three disparate New York cops: a cynical twenty-year veteran playing out his final days until retirement while struggling to keep his sanity (Gere); a conflicted undercover torn between his commitment to the job and his loyalty to the streets (Cheadle); a desperate family man who has his morale put to the test while trying to provide a stable home for his wife and kids (Hawke); director Fuqua's attempt at a police morality tale is well-crafted, strongly acted, and sure to grab your attention with intense, in-your-face violent action, but it doesn't offer enough new insight to transcend the familiar, seen-it-all-before limitations of this genre. Hawke (reteaming with his Training Day director) stands out with an unexpectedly edgy performance. The violence?while expected for a film of this genre?is still tough to stomach at times. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Draws you in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Draws you right in from the start, builds tension to a climactic point late in the film. In the middle, you get to absorb a lot of NYC atmosphere which somewhat compensates for the formulaic nature of the film. You've seen it all before, there's no new ground, but its done in a way that will hold your interest.Grim, adult movie themes highlight only the heavy issues that burden cops in this big city.Cheadle, Hawke and Gere all develop very burnt-out, empty looks in their eyes that help make this film more believable than it really is. Lives have fallen apart (the personal lives of these cops). The script makes it clear that the job is rough on cop families, it makes this point almost to the point of overkill.The women of this film are resigned to the belief that "its a man's world". They have bought this belief system almost totally. And yes I include Ellen Barkin's middle-aged super-boss-cop because she tries to be just like men in order to get to the top of this man's macho cop world/underworld environment.Gere is subtle, very nuanced and effective in his role. Hawke is incredibly explosive in his role of a man desperately overstrung, or at least in need of a good vacation. Cheadle's mixed-up about-to-snap performance works perfectly with Snipes who gives a fine, mature, theatrical style performance. I'm ready to see more of the mature Snipes as his career progresses.All the acting here is great and it overcomes the generally "seen it before" nature of the production. This is basically similar to Greek tragedy, so if you view it that way you won'be let down by the relentless grimness that is here from start to finish. Entertainment value highlighted by enough tension, plus the studied pro performances rate an 8 rating from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent cop flick, but it is not something very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The police corruption has been a recurrent subject in cinema from its beginnings.Classic films such as Scarface (1932) or The Asphalt Jungle reported the reality of the cops who are seduced by the easy way of crime, betraying the trust from the people and the law they swore to protect.However, in that times, the corrupt cops were the villains; but the perspective changed in the 70's thanks to movies like Shaft and Electra Glide in Blue, which showed that the ethic and the rectitude could become into obstacles in order to combat every time more violent and crafty criminals.We can suppose that those anti-heroes arose as a consequence of the dissatisfaction people felt with the authorities, and with the sad reality that the pure and incorruptible heroes of yesteryear were not credible anymore.Needless to say that real life has gotten worse in our century, and the cinema has adapted to that with films (and TV series) where the line between heroes and villains is every time more diffuse.All the previous paragraph takes me to Brooklyn's Finest, a cop flick in which director Antoine Fuqua runs a similar field to the one he visited in Training Day 9 years ago.The result is competent and interesting, but not highly memorable.Brooklyn's Finest has a provocative premise, and thanks to screenwriter Michael C. Martin, we have many interesting scenes of moral disjunctive, fights with the conscience and impossible decisions.But the problem is that that structure feels a bit diffuse, and I could not find the point in common which impulses the three stories this movie tells (besides of the ethical conflicts the three main characters face).In other words, I was interested in the characters and their dilemmas, but the secondary scenes which may add texture and "realism" to the story tired me a little bit, because they divide our attention without a justifiable cause and they unnecessarily stretch the movie.In spite of that, I liked the film, mainly because of Fuqua's solid direction, which is always disciplined and absolutely free of any tricks which are not necessary in order to create suspense.As for the cast, Ethan Hawke feels a bit over the top in his character, while on the other hand, Don Cheadle is perfect as a cop whose divided loyalty is not because of simple ambition, but because of the lessons life has brought him in both sides of the law.Richard Gere could interpret even asleep the character of a veteran who is tired of fighting an endless war, but I think he keeps doing it well.As for the supporting cast, I liked the performances from Will Patton as the classical "suit" who only wants results; Ellen Barkin as a cop/politician who is more interested in her career than in the fulfillment of justice; and Wesley Snipes, who makes his return to mainstream cinema after various years of starring in atrocious action movies made straight to DVD.As a comparison point, I liked Brooklyn's Finest more than Pride and Glory, but less than Narc and Dark Blue, because they had had more concise and compact screenplays.However, despite the fails from the screenplay and the fact it is not highly memorable, I can recommend Brooklyn's Finest as an interesting cop flick with good performances and interesting ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ethan Hawke's greatest movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strong movie with powerful performances by the entire cast, especially that of Ethan Hawke whose portrayal of a corrupt police officer carries this movie and warrants special recognition. Richard Gere's performance in some ways is reminiscent of Paul Newman's performance in Fort Apache, the Bronx, that is, of an older jaded police officer who has lost all hope yet perseveres. The movie relies on perpetuating all kinds of stereotypes to move the story along and suggests a level of corruption and violence that if plausible would render our society inoperable. Yet the story works, mainly due to the great acting and the fast paced action which manages to keep the audience's attention. One is kept wondering how the various subplots will work themselves out and who will survive the maelstrom that engulfs all concerned. Don Cheadle also gives a credible performance as an undercover police officer and Wesley Snipes gives a surprisingly measured and multifaceted performance as a street gangster. All in all, a powerful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well made with that gritty feel to it that Antoine Fuqua is renowned for. A decent score by Marcelo Zarvos, interspersed with rap and other 'street' tunes sets the tone. All the performances were excellent; in particular Richard Gere as the world-weary Eddie, Don Cheadle as the street-wise Tango and Ethan Hawke as the up-tight Sal. Wesley Snipes did a great job too as Cal, as did Brían F. O'Byrne as Sal's partner, Ronnie Rosario. Also worthy of note were; Will Patton as Lt. Bill Hobarts, Michael Kenneth Williams as Red, Shannon Kane as Chantel and Ellen Barkin as Agent Smith. Oh, and look out for a nice little cameo from Vincent D'Onofrio as Carlo.I must say that the critics must have had a bad day or something when they reviewed this one. I'm usually pretty much in agreement with them, but I think they missed a trick here. Yes, the three threads don't tie together in a neat bow but they're not supposed to; that's life, it doesn't always go the way you want it to (seldom does actually). The performances are great and there are some really superb visual moments too. I liked the plot, yes, maybe a little haphazard here and there, but not as bad as some would have you believe.

		<shortDescription>Verdict: Righter and Wronger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. You know how sometimes watching a movie feels like being immersed in a different world? Brooklyn's Finest is like that, and that different world is like the twilight zone. It's just like our world, but there's something horribly wrong about it. In this twilight zone?called "Brooklyn"? everyone is selfish and aggressive, violence is everywhere, and there's a constant level of tension in the air. Talk about depressing. Walking out of the theater was like breathing air again for the very first time. It felt good? but what does that say about the movie?OverviewIn Brooklyn's Finest, "right" and "wrong" have very little to do with anything. There are no heroes and no villains?only actions and motives. The film follows the stories of three Brooklyn cops and puts their lives under the microscope, revealing the inner-conflicts that are broiling beneath the surface. Each cop is trapped in a figurative cage of their own making ("Be careful what you wish for?"), and the over-arcing story is about their struggles to escape, and the consequences that follow.Looking at the plot, the film doesn't follow any standard Hollywood formula, and it doesn't meet the expectations it cultivates in the first half. You might expect plot points to twist and tie together brilliantly at the end, but they don't. They get close to each other, but barely touch. The tension doesn't ratchet up and lead into an explosive climax. Instead it felt fairly constant throughout the movie. In a way, the film-making style is transparent and doesn't try to manipulate the audience at all. Everything just is.Brooklyn's Finest is an exploration of motive and violence in a seedy culture that I'm not sure actually exists. If dark, pseudo-realistic crime dramas intrigue you, then give this one a try. Moviegoers looking for a standard Hollywood Blockbuster fix may be disappointed, however.CastOne reason to consider seeing this movie is the acting. The leads are all operating out of their comfort zones?Richard Gere is lacking his usual sophistication (still has a thing for prostitutes, though), Don Cheadle is thuggish and aggressive, Ethan Hawke is hardened and speaks with grit in his voice, and Wesley Snipes is, well? not an action hero. They all succeed in delivering convincing performances that feel true to life, and I enjoyed that.How to enjoy this movie:* Expect to walk into a dirty world full of depression, prostitution, drugs and violence.* Focus on the subtle character acting.* Keep your eye out for what's "righter" and what's "wronger." You'll know what I mean after the first 20 seconds. The remaining two hours of the movie are all exempli gratia (cases in point).Weak points:* The plot's not brilliant and doesn't culminate in some amazingly clever climax.* The ending doesn't entirely resolve in a satisfying way.* You may want to take anti-depression medication with you to the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Since "Training Day" became a hit, director Antoine Fuqua has been one of the directors that escape harsh criticism from the Hollywood elite. He is a master of intense moments in time, but I believe many of his movies lack continuity. "Brooklyn's Finest" is no exception. The film follows the unconnected stories of three cops. Richard Gere is the stereotypical veteran cop who is one week from retirement and begins the film with a gun in his mouth. Ethan Hawke is the desperate young cop whose family just keeps growing (his wife Lili Taylor is pregnant with twins) and he longs to provide better arrangements. Don Cheadle is the undercover cop who, if he hasn't already crossed the line, is dangerously close.The best scenes are with Cheadle and Wesley Snipes, who plays a just released from prison hardened criminal. Their dialogue rings true for an undercover cop trying to play both sides and remember what's right. If not for Ellen Barkin's histrionics, the worst scenes would be watching Richard Gere show off his full repertoire of three different facial expressions. Poor Ethan Hawke looks like no one let him eat or shower for 2 months prior to filming. The boy looks sad.Even though we know it's coming, the final act where the three stories intersect is pretty interesting and make for a satisfying shoot-em-up ending. Brace yourself for some hardcore street violence and language and a meandering soundtrack. The film funnels to the point that there is a very fine line between right and wrong for law enforcement types. I prefer to keep the faith that this is a serious exaggeration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stirring depiction of cops on the edge, this may just be Fuqua's Finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest tells three respective tales of a trio of very different people more broadly connected to the police force of New York City; three people who each alike want 'out' of their respective lives and lifestyles within the force, three people who live and operate in very different capacities therein the force, but look forward to the new ventures and pastures to follow thereafter their leaving. The film is a masterstroke of crime drama storytelling, a film whose runtime is never too long and whose sheer scale is never overwhelming; a film whose ability to balance each strand, ranging from everyday 'on-the-beat' cops to undercover narcotics agents, is close to faultless. As far as American thrillers that may or may not contain a good deal of second unit stuff go, it is a breath of fresh air; an appealing, story driven piece with any one of its three strands most likely making decent enough features on their own.Director Antoine Fuqua establishes the uncompromising characteristics that dominate the nature of his film's world during the opening scene, an exchange set in the confines of a parked car in the dead of night. One man speaks to another about how he was justified in recently breaking the law out of self defence. The other man, Ethan Hawke's Detective named Sal Procida, then proceeds to shoot him dead, but only for the large amount of ill-gotten money he had with him ? something which will ease his financial woes made apparent out of his unhealthy wife and large family who're all living in a building unfit for them. Above anything else, it is a perfect opening to Procida's strand; a strand built on moral grey areas and he loots and kills for sake of someone else's struggles. Waking up not so far away is Richard Gere's character, he too is a police officer named Eddie Dugan; a single man who sleeps with whisky beside his bed and unloads an empty pistol into his mouth upon getting up. The man is not far from retirement and in a bad state. Finally, Don Cheadle is an undercover narcotics agent named "Tango" Butler; a man deep in the world of housing project-set, African American run drug rings whose efficiency and professionalism is epitomised in a slick, singular take as the camera glides through their interior base of operations from the quasi perspective of Cheadle himself.Fuqua toys with his audience in so much he allows for the least intelligent; least likable and probably most aggressive of the three, in Procida, to want what's best for other people moreover himself. In providing this character with a family, it allows for Hawke's character to occupy the screen without risk of our interest or fondness for the man waning; it allows for his story to play out without the danger of it transferring into an anonymous, bland tale of an anti-hero undeserving of his job title going through the motions. That's not to say his is the best of the three, for Butler's story about working undercover and the apparent brethren he shares with those shady delinquents, as relationships with his police superiors wane, is often shattering. Wanting away from this life of constant fear and danger, he learns the only way to do such a thing is to bring in the boss of the entire outfit: Wesley Snipes' gangster named Caz.The reemergence of Snipes is a curious detail, a man who himself has recently served time in prison and here plays someone who is fresh out and back amongst his kin anyway. Seeing him turn up carries with it an odd air of realism: as if akin to his character suddenly reappearing amidst his own here on set, so too is Caz the wanted man who can finally be nailed by a federal department if Butler plays it right. In this regard, the casting is a masterstroke, and it is impressive that the sudden reappearance of the actor does not soften the impact of the film up to this point nor beyond it.There are thoughts and writings that, in recent years, and something born out of the events of 9/11 in New York City, those more broadly orientated towards jobs in the fire department or police force often always come in for heroic depictions when featuring in American films. Some, the likes of Ladder 49 and such, have almost exclusively revolved around said folk in said roles. Jim Sheridan's 2010 remake of a Danish film entitled "Brothers" inexplicably featured a composition of a fire station façade during its opening montage, a shot you might say was designed, sub-consciously or otherwise, to implement both a sad and romanticised tone from the off. The film is not about firemen ? far from it, but it's meant to induce melancholia what better way than to exploit the iconography of a fire station. If you want to see it in this particular way, you might read Fuqua's film as a piece going past all of that and cutting to the grit of the thing: a New York City-set project about those in roles depicted in less than flattering ways and living less than heroic lifestyles where previously we've witnessed otherwise. However you might see it, the film is a more than substantial effort .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tortured soul of Training Day in NYC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Ayer probably wishes he wrote this movie instead of going on to do butcher an amazing James Elroy story and turn it into the painfully interesting Street Kings.Brooklyn's Finest is dark, gritty and brutal. The opening scene is the biggest indication. You get character development, chatting and not going into plot and what is going to happen next and then you get a bullet through the skull. This shows you what you're in for. Story with violence driving it.The three main cops (Gere, Hawke, and Cheadle) are vastly different from each other. Gere plays a veteran pushing retirement who drinks away his past and only adds to his pain and has a vice that would he perfect for the vice squad. Hawke plays a very Denzel- in-Training Day-like character, the major difference is that Hawke's character rationalizes his actions as a means to better his family life. Cheadle is probably the least corrupt of the three and is the character with the larger moral conflict. The three do not ever work together once throughout the film and their paths cross at multiple occasions but mainly in the finale.Wesley Snipes is amazing here. His character is very reminiscent of Ni?o from New Jack City, but much more grounded and less neo-noir. Wesley makes a very good bad guy and the way he stares at characters commands fear and respect. Ellen Barkin in a small role is very much an amazing ice queen who isn't afraid to tell you to your face she will blackmail you as she is in bed with you.Antoine Fuqua had amazing success with Training Day and since has been really been receiving underrated praise for his direction. Tears of the Sun and Shooter were films that I enjoyed fully. His style is almost homage like. Crane shots, medium shots, very little tracking, and cut-backs. It works because it helps tell the story and show reactions. Fuqua has an amazing talent for using brutal violence and not being shy about it. Bullets penetrate and exit a body with blood spurting out, but it isn't to a "shock value" effect as much as just to emphasize the brutality of the story.Story-wise the "separate stories that finally intersect" is used well here as these are three unique characters with their own unique story. The ending is somewhat shocking and predictable, but it leaves you satisfied. If I may be so bold, it is almost a commentary for racial tension that many New Yorkers exists within the NYPD and the racism that is very much there as well.Unlike Street Kings, Brooklyn's Finest doesn't type cast nor does it miscast it's actors. Everyone plays their roles perfectly, and Richard Gere gives his darkest performance ever.If you enjoyed Training Day and wanted more, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Acting, Superbly filmed, but it gets completely derailed in the 3rd act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major spoilers belowI bought this movie on what I recalled was a recommendation of a friend of mine. I recall him saying that the film was really really good. (he's someone that's rather hard to please in terms of movies) So as I go to put the movie in, I sent him a message asking if this was the film he liked. He said "I did like it, but a few things happened that really irritated me, so it wound up just being okay." I took that with a grain of salt because like I said, he's hard to please. But I also kept it in mind while watching the film. Everything was filmed well, dialogue, characters and situations were all complex and interesting...then comes the end. The last 15 minutes of the film has our three main police characters all cross paths but never actually meet in one apartment project. One is there because he desperately needs money for his family, so he goes on a killing rampage looking for drug money, and he finds it. Then he finds two bullets into his back for his troubles. Our next character was the undercover cop who was having great difficulty with choosing his career by setting up the man who saved his life, but also the man he was sent to put away or tipping said man off and letting him get away. But said man gets killed in a drive-by. So our undercover character got his promotion for all the evidence he had gathered up to that point and didn't have the guilt of having to arrest the man who saved his life. So what's he do? He goes on a killing rampage against the people who did the drive-by and is in turn shot twice in the back by an officer arriving on the scene...which made no sense because he had already finished shooting everybody, the officer made no attempts to tell him to freeze or drop his gun, the cop just bloody shoots him!Lastly we have our burned-out retired cop who was on the verge of committing suicide until he sees one final act of redemption and decides after a career of minding his own business and keeping his head down that it was time to step up and he winds up rescuing three captive prostitutes and killing one of their captors in the process...then the movie ends.I still really enjoyed the film, I still recommend it, but if you haven't seen it yet, and have read this far, you know how it ends so I say watch it for the first two acts and at least you'll know what to expect from the ending, perhaps it won't bother you as much as it did me. I plan to watch this again in the near future to see if maybe the ending won't bother me as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but meandering and inconsequential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest tells three cop stories. Richard Gere is a jaundiced old timer with a week to serve until retirement. Ethan Hawke is a family man and a good cop apart from the fact that he needs more money than he earns. And Don Cheadle is undercover, wants to come out, but is being played dirtily by his superiors.Everyone in this film is compromised - it is not a film of goodies and baddies, it is a film of baddies, some more and some less.The performances are all good, and the stories are all interesting, but a) I expected them to intertwine, but they didn't. They all come to their respective climaxes in the same building, and Hawke's and Cheadle's stories meet each other, but Gere's is independent. And, once they'd finished, it all seemed to be a bit inconsequential somehow.I would have welcomed subtitles in places - the black slang often completely defeated me (apart from the ubiquitous m*****f*****, of course). Plus the movie seems to have ushered in a new fashion for shooting victims to dribble blood from their mouths. This became predictable by the end.And I was somewhat unconvinced when Gere shot someone from about 6 feet away with what looked to my untrained eye like a .38 (the shot went right through the left side of the man's chest), and the shot man then gave Gere a thorough trouncing.But it is a long film, and it held my attention throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest explores the underbelly of police work in some of the most unbecoming neighborhoods. Three police officers who have no connection to one another are going through their own personal crises, until they end up at the same place, at the wrong time.Richard Gere rehashes his police character role albeit in less than flattering circumstances. This time he's a cop without illusions. He's completing his 22 years on the job and has no expectations about his service or the life awaiting him after retirement. Perhaps his crowning glory is his achievement after retirement.Don Cheadle another officer is deeply embedded in the drug world. He's being asked to do more than he's prepared to do and eventually he loses his sense of identity. There are only gray lines in this film; everything is marred by malfeasance, violence and scandal.Ethan Hawke is a man on a path to destruction. His wife is sickly and about to give birth to twins. The house is too small and he can't provide for his family's needs on a cop salary. He takes on more dangerous drug busts and eventually is consumed by his own corruption.The film is high quality, albeit unrealistic. It glorifies the handgun and over-emphasizes several themes, but it does a good job at captivating viewers' attention</fullReview>

A totally upside down, back and forth worthless, boring, confusing, not to mention, pathetic! movie. With that being said, i really don't know how to rate this. I recently saw this film with my wife 2 nights ago and well, she fell fast asleep, and i couldn't get into it until after about 65 minutes, when it started getting a little more interesting. I don't want to spoil anything, but honestly, if your looking for a movie thats gonna entertain you and make your Saturday night a well worth of staying home, DO NOT depend on "Brooklyns Finest" because honestly, it wasn't so fine, as most of these people are saying. Like i said, it was all over the place. They should of done a better job at piecing the movie together, instead of scattering everything into 1 big pile of !@#$ like they did. Anyways, all im saying, is that this could of been wayyyy better. Very disappointing, if you ask me.</fullReview>

But the slow passes isn't something i am all that happy about, it's good in the beginning to get under the skin of the characters, but halfway through it should have stepped up a couple of notches and that should have lasted to the end.Well it's definitely worth a watch, but it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat as others have written, it did give me a story, but it also left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a compelling tale of the dedicated cops of NYC, those men who work the mean streets and are affected day after day by what they see. They each have their own issues that they must deal with, and they don't all deal with them that effectively. Overall, the film does have a feeling of familiarity but it *also* has a feeling of real authenticity. That's thanks in no small part to some very sharp acting and no-nonsense, no frills direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua rarely lets melodrama get in the way of honest storytelling. He never glamorizes the world of either the cops or the crooks, and, with the help of his cast, creates some characters who live in a "shades of grey", realistic universe.Three different stories of three different lawmen are told, all of which converge at the same location late in the film. Ethan Hawke is Sal, a man with a family who robs from criminal scum because his salary can't cover the expenses of caring for an ailing, pregnant wife (Lili Taylor) and moving to a better residence. Don Cheadle plays Tango, an undercover cop unhappy with the fact that he's being forced to build a case against an old friend, Caz (Wesley Snipes) in order for him to make detective. And Richard Gere has the role of Eddie, a veteran uniformed officer who's due to retire shortly and who has become a very world weary and jaded type.The first rate ensemble also includes Will Patton as Tangos' demanding boss, Ellen Barkin as the uncaring, ambitious Agent Smith, Michael K. Williams as the lowlife Red, Brian F. O'Byrne as Sals' comrade Ronny, and Shannon Kane as Eddies' gal pal Chantel. There are cameo roles for the lovely Lela Rochon (who in real life is Mrs. Fuqua), and Vincent D'Onofrio. Everybody involved delivers a fine performance, but Cheadle and Gere are particularly good.Screenwriter Michael C. Martin and director Fuqua aren't afraid to get grim - overall "Brooklyn's Finest" has a very serious tone - although in the end, they also are able to inject some level of hope and redemption.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Gritty Cop Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is an appropriately dark and gritty cop thriller that reminds me very much of 2001's Training Day. Maybe it's because Ethan Hawke starred in both or maybe Antoine Fuqua directed both films, or maybe it's because both films deals with the same theme of corrupt cops, old vs. young cops, and the such. But all the same, this film is very intense and features some great acting and some powerful action scenes.Fuqua's film tells the story of three NYPD cops who go about their business in different ways. There is Tango who is an undercover cop in a hard-nosed crime precinct and is looking for a way to use his friend Caz, there is Sal who needs money so he can move his pregnant wife and kids away from their moldy house, and there is Eddie who is a week away from retirement and loves his alcohol.The acting is very intense and effectively carries the film. Ethan Hawke probably delivers the best performance as Sal and we feel sympathy for him even though his motives are not exactly legal. Don Cheadle delivers a strong performance as he usually does. Richard Gere also does a good job even though I connected with his character the least.Overall, this is one intense cop film which has all the intensity of Training Day. Even though the fore-mentioned film is superior, this film still holds it own. Led by strong acting and some good action/police drama, this makes a very effective cop thriller. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent police drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three police officers one problem - how do you deal with the job? For one, how does he get through his last week when he is far beyond caring; another can't make ends meet on a police salary; and another is so embroiled in the machinations of his uncover character he starts to forget he is a cop.None of these themes is unfamiliar - ever since Hill Street Blues tried to inject some realism into cop shows, TV has been full of 'ain't it a shame for cops'. More recently, The Wire made such good television, one began to wonder just why anyone would go to the cinema to see a police movie when you can get something so real and high quality at home.But the strength of this film is not its originality, it is the atmosphere it creates and the portrayal of people trying to get through the day. Some have given up, others have turned to crime, and some others have become so committed that their dedication has gotten twisted and out of control.Maybe because television has raised its game so much, thanks to HBO, we judge films by a more demanding yardstick. Nevertheless, Brooklyn's finest is a top-rate film. The acting is wonderful and Richard Gere is simply superb as the cop who has somehow lost his soul.I would urge anyone to give it a shot. It is saddening to see how little revenue the film has made at the box office; its director Antoine Fuqua deserves greater recognition and I for one look forward to his next project with great anticipation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Extremely brutal cop movie that takes place in and around the crime and drug ridden Van Dyke Housing Projects in Brownsville Brooklyn. It's in those projects that the three NYPD cops that the movie focuses on end up under completely different circumstances in what turns out to be the most brutal and bloodiest scene, the "Van Dyke Massacre", of the entire film!There's narcotic detective Salvator "Sal" Procida, Eathen Hawke, who's need for money has become an obsession with him. With a sick wife Angela, Lili Taylor, and two kids with two more on the way Sal has turned to crime in order to support his family. With a major narcotic raid, that Sal's to be part of, at the Van Dyke Houses to take place the next evening Sal decides to do it solo and get the cash, drug money, that goes along with it! It's when Sal's friend and partner in the narcotic squad Ronny Rosario, Brian F. O'Byrne, gets wind of his insane plan and tries to stop him is when Sal snaps and makes things, his raiding the Van Dyke drug den, even worse that they already are.There's undercover detective Clarence "Tango" Butler, Don Cheadle, who's been put into the dangerous and unenviable position by his boss NYPD police Let. Bill Hobarts, Will Patton, to set up his friend who had saved his life in prison, where he was undercover, reformed drug dealer Caz Phillips, Wesley Snipes, in a narcotic string. Caz trying to go straight is the target of the overly ambitious city narcotic agent Smith, Hellen Barkin. It's Agent Smith who wants Caz busted in order to get herself a promotion that can lead in her becoming the first woman New York City Police Commissioner. It's when Caz is about to change his mind, with Tangos urging, and not go through with the deal that Let. Hobarts and Agent Smith had him set up with that the narcotic gang that he was supposed to make the deal with ended up doing the job for them!The third cop of this "Trifecta" is the soon to be retire patrolman Eddie Dugan, Richard Gere. With only a week left for him to put in his retirement papers Dugan ends up losing one partner who was gunned down and another one who was involved in an unnecessary shooting, when Dugan left the scene to make a phone call, over a youth stealing a candy bar from a bodega. In what was the worst shock of all for him Dugan had his long time lover hooker Chartel, Shannon Kane, who thought of him only as a paying customer dump him after he tried to get her to leave the oldest profession and go live with him in the country!***SPOILERS*** It's when Dugan, after being kicked out of the cat-house by Chantal, spots a young woman whom he earlier failed to rescue from her pimp that he finally got his "Mojo", or courage, back and attempted to do the right thing. This lead Dugan, who was now retired, to the Van Dyke Projects where the girl was being held by her pimp where both Sal and Tango were headed for for entirely different reasons! As brutal as they come "Brooklyn's Finest" isn't for the meek or weak of heart. Overly long-133 minutes-for a cop movie and despite its pitiless brutality the film in the end does make its point: Crime doesn't pay it's those who commit, police &amp; career criminals, it who are the ones end up paying for it! And in most cases, like in the movie, with their very lives!</fullReview>

Another cops vs blacks with drugs movie not even trying to be authentic and with nobody remembering it was made two years from now. Gere, Cheadle, Snipes and a bunch of other seasoned actors waste everybody's time by accommodating the producers of this flick to create the biggest pile of clichés this genre has to offer. Characters you've all seen before in much better productions ('The Wire' came to mind several times) in situations that are lifted from movies and series in which these situations weren't exactly fresh to begin with. No characters are built, no story background is offered. It just barfs the whole thing in your lap and somehow expects you to be amused by it. Completely ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest (2009): Dir: Antoine Fuqua / Cast: Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle, Wesley Snipes, Lili Taylor: Excellent cop drama thriller about image. It follows three distinctive cops who are poised to go the wrong directions. Richard Gere plays a veteran officer of 32 years who is a week away from retirement but hates his job. His only friend seems to be a prostitute. He guzzles liquor in the morning and forces himself to undertake the daily tasks, which includes rookie training. During one of his down moments he is redeemed when he comes across a sex dungeon where three women are held prisoner. Ethan Hawke plays an officer who is married and has two children and twins on the way. He murders drug dealers and steals the money to pay for a home for his family. Unlike Gere who will find redemption, Hawke further falls from grace until ultimate consequence take effect. Don Cheadle plays an undercover officer who yearns for a desk job. He is promised such if he sets up a criminal friend who just got out of prison. When he decides against the setup it is too late and he learns what true law corruption is. Wesley Snipes plays a criminal whom Cheadle is reluctant to bring down due to a past friendship. This is one of the best performances by Snipes who is not guilty, but deemed guilty only by law officials. Lili Taylor plays Hawke's wife who is pregnant with twins and worried about their living conditions. Directed with insight by Antoine Fuqua who previously made Training Day. The film examines the flaws of these officers and the duties they are assigned to fulfil. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

However, Ethan Hawke and Richard Gere convinced me from start to finish that these characters exist and they are human which I do identify with completely.

Tango Butler (Don Cheadle) is an undercover cop told to bust Caz Phillips (Wesley Snipes) who once saved his life.I really like Gere's performance as the rundown cop. It may be that I find his character the most compelling. It would be perfectly fine to only follow his story. Director Antoine Fuqua has shown his skills in this genre. However Cheadle's character is a bit too cliché and Snipes is channeling from another era. Hawke is also not quite that compelling. He needs more intensity or more pressure. Of the three stories, I like Gere's the most and Cheadle's the least. It all averages out to a middling movie.</fullReview>

It is still a really good movie and I think everyone should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Multi-stranded narratives and dirty cops can go either way. Fuqua has some experience in the genre, so he is capable of handling this material very well. It's nice to see a film, with so much going on, paying equal respect to the characters and their stories. I was pulled in to each one, and never found myself thinking "get back to blah blah blah". The performances are incredible from the 3 leads. Hawke and Cheadle have some powerhouse moments, and Gere is able to bring a withered and quiet role to life. For me, it was Snipes that stole the show. It's about time this amazing actor was given more, meatier roles. Every line he had was delivered with a charisma that is lacking with so many actors today. The films only downside is a rather forced, contrived ending. Everything happens at once and the pace stumbles a bit as tension is raised for one character and not for another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one film that has to be one of the best films of 2010 it is Brooklyn's finest. the film has an all star cast Richard gere Ethan hawke Wesley snipes and don cheadle. the film has 3 plots. ricahard gere is a retired cop who is traing new comers with no success and trying to find a missing girl. Ethan hawke is a crooked cop who is stealing money from criminals in order to buy a new house. don cheadle is an undercover cop who is trying to unravel a drug ring led by Wesley snipes. none of these stories connect in the movie. they might cross paths for a few seconds but thats it. one of my personal favorites.Rated R for bloody violence throughout, strong sexuality, nudity, drug content, and pervasive language.2hrs 12min/132min.327 uses of the f-word ***1/2/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Find</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually post reviews when I'm grumpy about some "film" I've just watched and found lacking. In this case, I can only recommend "Brookly's Finest" so very highly (I've never seen a perfect movie and I'll only rate a handful at 9, so 8 is my high grade). The acting is believable, the cinematography appropriately dark, and very well done. (artistic cinematography is wonderful--as in "Chicago" or "October Sky"--but often the only requirement is to tell to the story, and this one succeeds without a hitch).The story is engaging and timely, and the surprises come along at just about the right pace. Director Fuqua IS apparently enamored of having bullets whiz in from instantaneously anonymous shooters, and even one more of those scenes would have been one too many. As it is, I expect it will (or has) become one of his trademarks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Finesse Here Brooklyn's Finest ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three cops, two of them going rogue very quickly, almost come together at the end of the film.This is an absolute searing drama with Ethan Hawke, Richard Gere and Don Cheadle in fine form as the policeman watching over the tough streets of Brooklyn.There are so many subjects in the film. Racism, drug dealing, and police out of control due to the fact that how much can they take any more. The dangers of going under-cover are obvious, especially if you're an under-cover black officer.We see Richard Gere retiring after 22 years and how cold the final act of retirement is. This makes us see bureaucracy at its worst to a cold and indifferent police force. We see his ultimate redemption after a mediocre career in the force.The language is foul beyond belief with the f-word used almost continuously by both the cops and the bad guys galore.Ellen Barkin, looking a lot heavier, is appealing as a top lady cop, foul mouth and ready to do battle with any of her subordinates. We even see the problems of urban housing with exacerbating asthma due to what's in the walls of our homes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is a gripping, performance driven, showcase that questions conscience, morality, and the decisions that blur the lines of right and wrong. "Its not a matter of right and wrong, it's a matter of righter and wronger." Brooklyn's Finest opens with these words and this is the overriding theme of the entire film. The movie applies these terms to the situations of a trio of officers in three different departments of the NYPD as each of them are confronted with the difficult tasks of upholding the law.Brooklyn's Finest is packed with excellent performances. All of the main characters of the story are portrayed exquisitely. Chedle, Snipes, Hawke, and Gere are each at their best as they show us the lesser known side of the lives of a police officer. There are a number of scenes were there are challenges of morality. The movie profoundly exhibits each characters constant battles with their conscience. Sal (Hawke) has a very moving scene were he is in confession, the priest asks does he want God's forgiveness and Sal says "I don't want his forgiveness, I want his help." this is a prime example of the challenges of morality that each character in Brooklyn's Finest faces. The characters are not connected nor do they know one another. Their paths rarely intersect within the movie with the exception of the occasional brush by.Brooklyn's Finest offers a more real perspective on three different, distinct aspects of life that face these police offers. Each one is bound by a different, trying, aspect of everyday life that all people have experienced. Family (love), Friendship (loyalty), and self preservation (duty) are just some of themes that are addressed within the movie.If you watch Brooklyn's Finest with the expectation that this is similar to New Jack City, King of New York, or Carlito's Way then you will be disappointed. Brooklyn's Finest is none of those. It's as good as all of them but in it's own way. This is more like Traffic or Crash but set in the midst of a crime setting. What Brooklyn's Finest is, is a movie about perspective and morality. This movie is more about the tough choices that police face and how each day of the job is an opportunity for them to question their morality. This is a film about hidden truths not the glamorous side of the police but the hard choices that questions each one of them. Brooklyn's Finest divulges into how easily slim the line is that separates someone from being the hero or the villain in the eyes of every individual based upon perception and choice.I really liked this movie. It was extremely different than the usual police film. Every situation in this movie is a chance to question one's morality and then it offers each character a choice. This allows the audience to judge each of the characters choices based upon our own interpretation of morality. Does the end justify the means? This is what this movie asks us and then it ends with leaving us with the same words than it began with "Its not a matter of right and wrong, it's a matter of righter and wronger." There are a number of scenes were there are challenges of morality. The movie profoundly exhibits each characters constant battles with their conscience. Sal (Hawke) has a very moving scene were he is in confession, the priest asks does he want God's forgiveness and Sal says "I don't want his forgiveness, I want his help." this is a prime example of the challenges of morality that each character in Brooklyn's Finest faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After this seedy, dark, cop drama ended my friend turned to me and said "That was like every other movie I've ever seen, rolled into one.". I couldn't agree more. These storyline devices have all been used before: There's the undercover who's in too deep. There's the cop on the edge of retirement who is compelled to do one more good deed which will put him in harms way. There's the cop who is corrupt enough to take the bad guys cash and let them escape...During the scene when Richard Gere is asking the hooker to run away with him I didn't know if I was watching The Wrestler, Pretty Woman, or Any Given Sunday. The undercover story felt like The Salton Sea, Rush, or Infernal Affairs. I recently saw Bad Lieutenant (excellent) and I couldn't help but think of this in comparison to the crooked cop. Maybe I've seen too many movies but I really feel like I need original ideas and creativeness to bring a movie to full marks. Great actors and great acting are not enough. All in all it's a pretty dark movie, full credit for exposing a truly chaotic landscape of cops, bad guys, poverty, prostitution, guns, and drugs combining to form one large, nasty, unpredictable brew. But it's been done before.</fullReview>

Thanks to the directing, a decent story and an intriguing plot, this movie is a really good watch, and has a pleasant moral that doesn't necessarily forces itself onto the viewer.

		<shortDescription>Training Day 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film was not a sequel, the similarities between Training Day and Brooklyn's Finest are virtually unavoidable. First off, both movies concerning police corruption were directed by Antoine Fuqua. Second, both films were shot on location in some of the most infamous neighborhoods such as the Van Dyke housing projects in Brownsville, with real-life gang members from Brooklyn and Los Angeles. And thirdly, in both films Ethan Hawke played the role of a cop in search of a promotion with the goal of moving his wife and child/children into a nicer home. Just this time around Ethan's on screen character, Sal, was on the other side of the fence. While both films were unflinching in their portrayal of what takes place on the mean streets of gang neighborhoods, I must admit that Training Day was superior to Brooklyn's Finest. However, rare is the case when sequels turn out to be better than the original. And unfortunately we often draw comparisons to films which have similar story lines, yet are basically very different. In other words, Brooklyn's Finest was still a praiseworthy, good cop/bad cop film, despite higher expectations aimed towards the director of Training Day.When Carlo was shot in the face by Sal during the opening scene, I figured right off the bat that this film meant business. While I do not find delight in the portrayal of senseless violence on the silver screen, this opening incident made it clear in the minds of moviegoers that Detective Salvatore would do almost anything to ensure a better life for his ill wife and five children, including the accepting of blood money. So why didn't Sal and his wife opt for abortions of their unborn twins? While Sal was a corrupt cop who was on the take, he was deeply religious, so abortion was out of the question. I'm just wondering how he could justify in his mind that murder is the better alternative? For these reasons I would have to say that Ethan did a phenomenal job portraying a man who was torn between doing what was right and the wrong he believed he needed to do.Don Cheadle was very convincing in his role as a deep cover narc. Tango was so immersed in his role that at times he almost forgot who's side he was on and began questioning his own identity. It got to the point where it was driving him crazy and begged his superiors that he wanted out of the game ASAP. His prayers would be answered when he was finally offered a deal for a cushy desk job if he agreed to do one last drug deal--but this time he would have to betray his friend Caz--who had saved Tango's life once before. Yes, Caz was a drug dealer who was recently released from prison. Yet by the conversations he had with Tango revealed that he wanted to go straight. Sadly, Caz would be shot dead on the street by a gang member working for Red, while soon after, Tango would be killed by friendly fire as Rosario did mistaken him for a gangbanger.In addition to great directing by Fuqua and powerful performances by Hawke and Cheadle, I also felt the need to give props to first-time screenwriter Michael C. Martin for his taut and intelligent script. The one-time subway flagger who worked for the Mass Transit Authority gave moviegoers a true feel of what it's like to experience life through the eyes of a New Yorker, being that he himself hails from East New York. While some have called this film cliché in its depiction of everything having to do with narcs, drug dealers, informants and renegade cops, in my opinion, there hasn't been a whole lot of films, outside of a dozen or so, with similar themes which could be considered superior to Brooklyn's Finest. The only ones that come to mind are Training Day, L.A. Confidential, Narc, The Professional, The Departed, Colors, Serpico and Bad Lieutenant. So if you are a fan of this sub-genre like I am, Brooklyn's Finest will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best cop dramas of the decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is Antoine Fuqua's (Shooter, Training Day) latest film and along with Training day stands as one of his best films. The story revolves around three Brooklyn cops who have chosen completely different paths within the department but their paths converge together for an intense climax. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a tired career Veteran of the precint with drug problems. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover cop looking for his way back to a comfy desk job. And Sal (Ethan Hawke) is doing whatever possible to get money to pay for a new house for his wife and kids.Brooklyn's Finest is one of the best cop dramas of the decade, with very strong performances by the three leads. The film is very violent and visceral giving you a taste of what it's like to be a Brooklyn police officer. The cops are treated like garbage while on the streets risking their lives for only a small wage. Although the film has realistic aspects to it, many of the situations are very unrealistic, and real life cops would never respond to things the way they do at points in the movie. This is really the only flaw for me, but people who don't care about authenticity will enjoy this film nonetheless for the great characters and story.Brooklyn's finest should be seen by any fan of the genre, and really any moviegoer in general. Trust me you won't be disappointed by this spectacular film. Even though it's not entirely realistic many will love it for what it is, a good old raw in your face cop drama. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooklyn's Finest becomes Brooklyn's corrupted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film critics have dismissed this film as very cliché and predictable. I'm afraid they are wrong. Mixed reviews upon this website from audience reviewers so far. I couldn't criticise it. I just didn't think it was higher than an 8/10. This follows the story of Sal (Ethan Hawke) desperate to obtain money through narcotic drugs raids that he specialises in for his family so they can get a bigger house as his wife is pregnant and is suffering from breathing problems because of mould on the walls, Tango (Don Cheadle) who has been undercover so long is torn between his loyalties as the man he is meant to bring down he helped out in the past and officer Eddie (Richard Gere) who wants to retire. This a great film that cleverly meanders it's way through the three stories as the three cops do intersect one another at various points. It is excellently shot, very gritty and raw and excellently acted particularly by Hawke and Gere, the script though may have seemed basic was good enough and the story was interesting as the characters had some substance in terms of their motivations for becoming corrupt. The exploration of police corruption, crime and race is explored well. This was a interesting, well made and acted film and the ending as some have said wasn't predictable. It's long but worth the long haul and it's well worth seeing even if it has been underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale Of Three Cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the day any film that mentioned Brooklyn would inevitably have to mention the Dodgers. But this is Brooklyn where the Dodgers have been gone now for several generations. A sadder Brooklyn to be sure and a much meaner one, especially for the police who have to patrol the seamier parts of it.Brooklyn's Finest takes its technique and its story from the Academy Award winning Crash and the Seventies classic Report To The Commissioner. It's a three track parallel story about three Brooklyn cops, Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, and Ethan Hawke.Gere is the veteran beat cop who gets a pair of rookies to train in what is his last week on the job before retiring. He's unattached and looking to a comfortable, but barren retirement bereft of friends and families. That extra disposable income is getting disposed of in the hands of a lot of hookers.Don Cheadle is an undercover cop working the narcotics and he wants out really bad, but his superior Will Patton just keeps getting him to go for one more assignment. Cheadle is well aware of the temptations that can befall the guy undercover, that he could start to identify with the people he's infiltrating. On this last 'just one more' Patton brings in FBI agent Ellen Barkin who has but this one scene, but it's a beauty to get Cheadle to take down one of his running buddies in the undercover world, Wesley Snipes.Finally we have Ethan Hawke who is a member of the Narcotics Squad, the guys who come in like SWAT and raid drug operations and see a lot of money get vouchered into evidence. For a guy who is having some financial problems the temptation is overwhelming, especially when in a key scene involving a poker game among the team members we learn just exactly where that vouchered money eventually goes.Gere, Hawke, and Cheadle all wind up in the same project apartment building in East New York/Brownsville, all on different missions in the climax. What the result turns out to be is a shocking commentary on the absurdity of certain laws and the enforcement practices therein.Brooklyn's Finest is another product from the creative hands of director Antoine Fuqua who piloted Denzel Washington to an Academy Award in Training Day a few years back. Brooklyn's Finest isn't quite as good as Training Day and none of the players just dominate this film the way Denzel Washington did in Training Day. Still it's a good no frills look at law enforcement in the borough of homes and churches which is what Brooklyn used to call itself.I recognized quite a bit of the location shooting both in Brooklyn and in Manhattan. I'm sure the folks who live in East New York never thought they'd ever see a movie company filming in their mean streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good to Great Acting not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Cheadle (Tango) and Ethan Hawke (Sal) give borderline great performances as police officers trying to save their lives and the lives of those they love. Both men see that the lives they are living are costing them everything and want out. And for both the way out takes them down dark paths. To get out, Tango has to betray a friend, a man that saved his life. In Sal's desperation to get out he betrays everything he was supposed to stand for. The other lead, Richard Gere as Eddie, sleepwalks through his role as a retiring cop who has already lost everything and is now just sleepwalking through a life he just wishes would end. The one with nothing to live for is the only one to survive. I just didn't see enough here to build a movie on. The only unifying element to this movie is that the ending action all happens on the same block. In some ways it reminded me of There Will Be Blood - A transcendent performance by Daniel Day Lewis in a movie that had little or nothing else to recommend it. Honorable mention to Brian O'Byrne as Ronny, Sal's best friend and almost savior. Honorable mention as well to Ellin Barkin as the psychotic Agent Smith who seemed determined to abuse insult and threaten for no good reason the man (Tango) whose help see needed to get her next promotion. There could well have been three interesting movies here. As a single movie it was just a mess. Great Acting! Lousy Movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean, WTF?????? So many better cop films are getting their main plots stolen from them wholesale...Cop counting the days to retirement, trying to get out alive, while being ridiculed by younger cops, that's Robert Duvall's character in "Falling Down"! Another cop trying to get out of the s--t of undercover work, "The Departed"! Yet another cop stealing drug money to try and fix his dire situation. Denzel Washington in "Training Day". Not the same details, mind you, but close enough, and that movie was made by the same fuquing director, and that movie was great!The script is god awful! Practically every single possible piece of dialog that has ever been said in every possible cop movie that has ever been made has been said in this movie.Granted, the first 2/3 of the film isn't that bad, it just seemed like your basic MAJOR suspension-of-disbelief-type blockbuster, but once you get to the third act, you'd practically have to lobotomize yourself to be able to grasp the amount of bulls--t that takes place.Richard Gere walking towards the camera, freeze-frame, fade to black? What is that supposed to mean????? Even though Don Cheadle's and Ethan Hawke's characters were killed, they weren't killed in the line of duty, and their families probably won't receive their $100,000 insurance payouts, notwithstanding the felonies they were both in the middle of committing. Also, the film seemed to forget that Richard Gere's character was retired! Even though he saved those 3 girls' lives, he probably would've still gone to jail for murder and vigilantism! Not to mention that had Cheadle and Hawke survived at the end, they both would've been discovered for their respective crimes and did hard time as well! I mean does this fuquing director know anything about the law? (Ok, I'll stop making fun of the director's name for being so close to that other word that I can't type here. But after seeing that ending, I wanted that fuquer to give me my 2 hours back!)The only redeeming quality about this film is that somehow they were able to get such a great group of actors together, yet every single character is so poorly written, to say that the characters were one-dimensional would be a compliment! Had this film been made with no-name actors, this would've been considered the worst cop film of all time, hands down. However, since it had such great actors attached to it, it's only destined to be known as a blatantly unoriginal cop movie with a cliché script that drastically mistreats it's talented cast.In simple Hollywood terms, "Brooklyn's Finest" is to cop films, what "Envy" was to comedy. (Look for my review on "Envy" to see what I mean.) Avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Brooklyn's Finest, the story is not new: 1. Three separate cop stories hit us in the face. 2. Each cop has a demon to temper. 3. Which affected cop will prevail? I wonder what real police officers think of this movie. (See starborn1's review.) It is evident that the screenwriter did not do his homework and study his subject. Because the screenwriter did not study his subject, Brooklyn's Finest appears unpolished and stereotypical. And this story won a second place prize in a screenplay contest? I shudder to think who the readers are at these contests.What a shame that the screenwriter did not polish his script, because the guy has some talent. He can weave a story, just not a story the audience cares about.Although Hawke, Gere, Snipes, and Cheadle do their best to carry their plots intelligently, the lack of authenticity impairs Brooklyn's Finest.</fullReview>

Subsequently they revert to their fallback plan. Their fallback plan is usually includes more graphic violence and more sophisticated ways to show people getting shot and killed. Hollywood do better if spent more time on stories and writing and less on special-effects technician's skill at showing bullets tearing through humans. The movie is just another case of Hollywood's presentation of style over substance, creativity,thoughtfulness, imagination or integrity.

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest must be the finest Pimps Whores and Drug Dealers residing in Brooklyn.One cop counts the days to retirement, one cop needs money and one cop wants out from undercover to a desk job. Good thing there weren't anymore cops or the movie would be even longer.For exposition, each cop had somewhere to go to talk. For Hawke it was the Priest in the confessional, Cheadle had the supervisor in the restaurant, and Gere had his hooker.Gere had about a week left on the force. The movie felt like real time. It may seem incongruent but individual scenes were too short and too long. The shootings were too quick, the dying dragged out repeatedly.Hawke would risk everything to get his wife out of the mold infected house. Maybe he didn't steal enough to move, but it looked like he had enough cash for some serious mold abatement and an addition for the children that seemed to pop-up continually.The lead actors were all convincing and the supporting cast was strong. Surely Wesley Snipes was speaking about got going back prison from experience. Ellen Barkin was barkin'. In case we didn't recognize Barkin, Richard Gere sang "Sea of Love" to his hooker friend, one of a few light moments in this heavy dark piece of work. The director, Antoine Fuqua deserves some praise for capturing the performances and juggling the three stories.The dialogue was riddled with profanity. The Fuqua word was shouted by everybody at everybody. The movie was in your face with extreme close-ups. The close ups of the money made the hundred dollar bills look fake.Prominent product placement included the black BMW, Fila logo on clothes and shoes and frequent religious symbols. Perhaps there was a disclaimer from Fila in the end credits, but who could stay that long, considering the clear-out the theater, lyrics of the song over the end credits. The use of the religious symbols in the film would not make the Pope proud.If you like violence, blood, vomit, spitting up blood, and hookers cleaning up between clients this movie is for you, everyone else should stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got inspired to talk like a gangster while I watched this, as it has quite a lot of gangster lingo.Nawmsayin'? You know, I found this movie right here to be like, you know, it's like entertaining and sh*t, but it's nothing special nawmsayin'?It prolly won't get stuck up in yo' head like a hot slug, seemsayin? But it's aait, B. It's aait.OK, seriously. This movie is pretty entertaining. The acting is good, it's nicely paced. The action is solid. I like the sound design. Good, crisp, shooting sounds and what not.I do got some beef with the plot, though. I appreciate what they're trying to do here, but it's just a little too much. Some of the stuff that happens make you think like, damn, those are some major ass coincidences! It's just not believable. And that's not something I'm usually bothered by, but since this is supposed to be realistic and grimy, it kind of pulls you out a little. Now, it is cool to see each main characters "story", and it is rather engaging, but the story as a whole is just a little hard to swallow. There are also some, how to put it, inconsistencies with some of the characters. Not that much, but enough for me to notice. Anyway, you can do a lot worse than this, but there are better alternatives out there too. At the moment I got a thing for these kinds of movies, cops, gangsters, corruption, the works, and I think "Street Kings" is a way better movie. Although not totally the same. "Training Day" is also an obvious pick. And I like "Sabotage" too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is an urban morality tale where director Antoine Fuqua visits themes he dealt in Training Day and here includes Ethan Hawke now playing a veteran cop with money troubles, a large family, crummy house and tempted to steal drugs money to makes ends meet.Richard Gere is a cop on the verge of retirement playing it safe much to the annoyance of a new partner he has to babysit and it looks even his colleagues have little respect for him. Gere's only comfort is a close relationship with a prostitute.Don Cheadle is a cop in deep cover, maybe undercover for too long, he wants out, a promotion but he trusts his superiors less than he does the gangsters he is mingling with.Like the film Crash, the lives of these three cops and their storyline collide and it may not lead to a happy ending.The story is not original and difficult to do with a fresh twist so relies on its performances. All three leads with a supporting cast that includes Wesley Snipes and Ellen Barkin do well, even the minor roles are effective.I guess Gere is probably too old to play even a cop on the verge of retirement but he seems to be the heart of the film, someone who burnt out years ago but wants to find long term happiness when he retires and makes one last attempt in being a cop and take a risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Cast But The Movie Isn't A Pleasant Viewing Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that I found anything particularly noteworthy about "Brooklyn's Finest." The title gives the clearest signal as to what it's about: NYPD officers in Brooklyn - one (Richard Gere) just a few days from retirement and largely uninterested in the job and so playing out the string, one (Ethan Hawke) struggling with finances as he awaits the arrival of twins, and one (Don Cheadle) hoping to get out of undercover work and be promoted to detective. They aren't connected to each other, but they get unknowingly caught up in the same drug investigation, and the movie morphs into yet another of those "unrelated stories that eventually intersect" plots. No, I'm not really a big fan of that format.The leads are strong enough. Gere, Cheadle, and Hawke all do well enough, and they all pull off the challenge of being largely unsympathetic characters who at the same time have sympathetic elements to them. They all have their own personal demons and challenges. Add Wesley Snipes into the mix and you have a solid cast. It is, however, quite heavy on clichés. The police are untrustworthy and unreliable to say the least and pretty much every black character is either a drug dealer, a pimp or a prostitute (or at least is sympathetic to them.) Eventually (and interspersed throughout) this descends into little more than a blood bath. Most importantly, it just really isn't that interesting. Every movie needs a redeeming character for the viewer to identify with and root for. This movie had no redeeming characters of note.Overall, this is really just a reasonably well-acted but largely unpleasant movie. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you were a cop, earning minimum wage, unable to support your wife and 3 children (with twins on the way), and were constantly surrounded by drug money that you collected from the busts you made? Would you be tempted to take a bit? What if no one would ever find out?This movie is about a group of Brooklyn cops that are weaved into a complex set of events that sees them each questioning their own honour, integrity, honesty and commitment, with deadly consequences. It explores the fact that all good people are capable of bad deeds if pushed far enough, and that all bad people will become worse if pushed.Stunning performance from Ethan Hawke as a desperate cop who needs money urgently and faces an emotional / mental downfall as he spirals further and further into the world of corruption. Don Cheadle throws in a great performance as an under cover cop who has been under cover so long that he doesn't know where his loyalties lay anymore.Disappointing performance from Richard Gere. His depiction of an alcoholic cop who is close to retirement and has lost the will to live is not convincing, but this is down to the lack of background to his character.Overall this film does not bring anything new to the genre that has not already been covered in better movies such as Training day and Precinct 13,both of which star Ethan Hawke.It is an interesting movie with some powerful performances, but is very dark, gloomy and ends without any answers. Good guys get killed, bad guys get killed, no retribution, no justice, no winning, just gloom.It feels like this movie needed a better ending. Whilst it is eventful, violent and gripping in some scenes, it doesn't have the impact that many of the previous movies of this genre have had.The quote in the summary by the way is from Training Day. A much better filmDisappointing 6/10. I do not recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest Believe it or not: law enforcement officers have lives outside of the police force. Unfortunately, due to their low wages and departmental cutbacks most of their free time is spent bouncing frat-boys from clubs and tazering disgruntled mall patrons.Luckily, the trio of trained troopers in this intersecting crime-drama found other means of offsetting their paltry weekly wages.With a pregnant wife suffering respiratory issues, officer Sal (Ethan Hawke) looks to fund a new home with police ceased drug money. Meanwhile, undercover officer Tango (Don Cheadle) hopes to solidify a promotion with his next drug bust. Elsewhere, apathetic officer Eddie (Richard Gere) continues to neglect his police duties. Now, each of the officers must face the realization that the badge they are wearing does not absolve their sins, exempt past allegiances or condone complacency.Cluttered with every cop cliché there is, Brooklyn's Finest is clumsy. With equal attention paid to each of the overlapping narratives, neither account receives enough emotional oomph to make a significant impact.And while a world without dirty cops sounds like heaven, just remember that without them future hosts of G-20 summits will be solely responsible for hiring their own racist goons to beat up protesters.

		<fullReview>We now live in a post Wire world, so a cops and gangster flick needs to be good. And this is good - cinematic timing, acting and scope. This is a tale of morals, played with three cops. Accuracy and intelligence is somewhat jettisoned for emotion and theater. It adds up to great entertainment.Clichés do run riot, and maybe the reference to video games is a clue that the director does not trust the audience. But the acting of Hawkes, Gere and Cheadle is fine enough, and they transcend the material. Somewhat the inverse of the Departed, where the intricacy consumes the performances.In the final moments, the three characters descend into hell (the projects) for their final reckoning. This film is not a classic, but is worth the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and miserable viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another 'corrupt cop' thriller, of which there are so many these days. This one's directed by Antoine Fuqua, who made TRAINING DAY with Denzel Washington, so he has some experience in the genre.BROOKLYN'S FINEST, while telling a complex and inventive story, never grabbed me the way it should have done. It may be because the production is just too miserable for its own good. The whole film takes place in darkness and even in the daylight scenes, the faces of the actors are shadowed.The relentlessly downbeat script and frequent moments of harsh violence add to the overall experience, which is depressing. The tropes and themes that all been explored many times previously and, while the film certainly keeps you watching, I didn't come away from it feeling awed or wowed in the same way I did watching STREET KINGS.Still, the acting is strong, especially from Richard Gere who plays a VERY different character from those in his rom-coms. It's a real surprise to see him taking part in scenes involving a prostitute which are a far cry from the glossy fantasy of PRETTY WOMAN. Ethan Hawke, one of the most haggard-looking actors on the planet, fits his hangdog role like a glove, and only the overrated Don Cheadle proves a weak point. Watch out for Wesley Snipes in a decent cameo, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah-h-h Brooklyn. It was once referred to as the Borough of Churches. In this movie it is the borough of viciousness and corruption with lotsa cops and bad guys and you can't tell one from the other even with a program.One thing they all have in common is extensive - VERY extensive use of the 'f' word. No one seems able to express himself without inserting that at least three times per paragraph. I was using my calculator to count the number of times I heard it, but it smoked out from so many numbers.The 'f'ing movie was plenty exciting, offered plenty of action, and seldom let up. I know, I know - it mirrored real life. One thing, it probably irked the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Somehow, Bronx's finest, or especially Queen's finest don't have the same ring. And, of course, we know that people in those boroughs are saint-like.The acting was uniformly quite good, everyone digging in with fists flying and guns blazing. I was ready for violence, but I wasn't Gere'd up for so much excess.I notice a vast difference of opinion among the critics, more-so than usual, comments ranging from it sucks to it's brilliant.I'm in the middle, somewhere. If you want a ton of blood, guts, shouting and cursing you will enjoy the hell out of this f'ing flick - otherwise, re-run some old Road Runner cartoons. OOOps, they were somewhat violent. But, they didn't cuss - unless you consider "beep-beep" a nasty phrase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooklyn's finest? More like Brooklyn's weakest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) In Brooklyn, amid drug deals, violence, casual racism, poverty, housing projects, and corrupt cops, we follow three officers: Tango, African-American, working undercover, believing he's earned a promotion to a desk job but told he has to set up the bust of an ex-con who saved his life; Sal, who'll commit murder to get cash to buy a house big enough for his family; and, Eddie, the precinct's oldest beat cop, a week to go before retirement, assigned to mentor an earnest rookie. Can this end well for any of the three?I had high hopes for this picture, mainly due to the impressive cast that filled it. Instead, I was heavily disappointed with a pretty dull movie, that was much too overlong for my liking. The performances are what kept this bearable for me. They clearly tried there hardest, but the movie really did them no favors. The storyline has potential to rank among some of the greats as far as cop films go, but the pace is just very hard to get into, and I felt a lack of likability among the characters. Gere deserved his fate, and I really didn't care what happened to the others.Performances. Richard Gere is fantastic, no doubt about it. He usually is, but his character isn't very amiable. Don Cheadle is excellent as well, but I also found his character too shady. Only at the end did I start to feel sympathy for him. Ethan Hawke gives the best performance here. He is absolutely wonderful, and he is who I sympathized the most with, I felt for him at the end. Wesley Snipes is strong in his limited screen time, proving he still has what it takes, if given the shot. Rest of the cast is either good or adequate.Bottom line. Very much average, and it had the potential to be so much more. Worth a look I suppose, but the running time with the inconsistent pace is very frustrating to get through.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest Don Cheadle Ethan Hawke When Ethan Hawke and Antoine Fuqua of Training Day come together again with a big name cast including Wesley Snipes amongst others, it means this film has a lot to live up to. Does it deliver? Still undecided.It's a cop tale, Brooklyn New York, drugs, corruption, prostitution it's all there. We follow the lives of three main characters in three separate narratives. Richard Gere plays a soon to retire street cop who's living out the remainder of his unhappy life on a day to day basis at the bottom of a whiskey bottle. Ethan Hawke is an under pressure narcotics cop with a young growing family, he drinks way too much coffee and is struggling to make ends meet on the domestic front while Don Cheadle is an undercover detective on the brink of losing his mind. The film is rather like watching Arsenal play Accrington Stanley in the FA cup 4th round, there's no points for guessing what the end result will be, but you'd still watch anyway just to see how many goals they get.There's some balanced performances, Ethan Hawke does a fantastic job of looking worn out, tired and on the ragged edge without his acting being over the top. Richard Gere is good too and although he seems to wander through the role without much diligence there is a couple of strong scene's including the latter one with his romantic interest. I'm not a fan of Don Cheadle, for me the terrible Ocean's trilogy ( how could so many big names have agreed to make those films? oh yes.. Money ) ruined his acting credibility, it was healthy to seem him in a role like this, though I still don't think he really grabbed hold of the character and pushed it far enough, it's a very safe, standard performance when it needed just that little bit of mania in the eye. Honestly, if Don Cheadle came up and pointed a gun at me on the street I think I would laugh. Wesley Snipes was incidental.There's nothing outstanding about the film and given the four big names in the cast you think they'd be competing to upstage each other. Only Hawke develops his character enough to stand out and only his performance is worthy of top of the bill.The film is engaging however and does hold your attention, there's some action but it's not over the top A-typical Hollywood stuff and there's not one single car chase, though a little too much coincidence (which hopefully the viewer forgives) as this is what eventually leads all three paths to cross. It's not a great leap of imagination to figure out how it will end but as cop films go it's a pretty good one. Training Day however it is not.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest desperately wants to be NYC's rendition of L.A. based "Crash" (2004). Crash had more characters to invest in but manages to keep the audience engaged in most of their lives as they end up intertwined with other character's predicaments. In this version of desperate lives meet desperate situations, the pay-off is hollow.Tango (Don Cheadle) is a walking, talking stereotype of an undercover cop who is trapped on the mean streets of NYC. His daily life of drugs and crime has caused enormous strains on his personal life and eaten away at his eternal soul. How will he escape his unfortunate destiny? Can he pretend to be loyal to his street gang and his evil BFF: Caz (Wesley Snipes) while trying to eliminate them at the same time? Tango and Caz. Sound familiar? Meanwhile, Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a cop (surprise!) who is married to a pregnant wife who is about to give birth to their 4th child and she is also suffering from a serious respiratory condition. He wants to buy his family a new home, but how will he come up with the down-payment for a mortgage on his lowly SWAT salary? In addition to truly sad stories, Eddie (Richard Gere) is an aging cop who has fallen in love with a prostitute. What should he do?These problems need to be resolved and everyone needs to somehow find numerous ways to become involved in the other characters' lives, if it at all possible. The audience is all set for a roller-coaster ride of good vs. evil, conscience vs. greed and love vs. lust. It should be a joyride mixed warm and fuzzy feelings! Don Cheadle does his best to make us sympathize with his character's dilemmas. It does seem like he's in a no-win situation for him. He's an underrated actor who can carry films at times (Hotel Rwanda or Traitor), but he usually needs a good supporting cast to compliment his skills. Tango is hard not to root for though he's seemed to gone "in too deep" and become too attached to his beloved gang of thugs. Hopefully, he will see the light and make the right choices before it too late. Will Caz discover Tango's betrayal or will he have to pay for his life of crime? So many questions, so few answers! Hopefully, Sal will find an honest way to get his well-deserved money. Hopefully, temptation will not get the best of him. Hopefully, the hooker will say "yes" to Eddie. Hope, hope?is a dangerous thing.You will need to watch this cliché?movie to find the answers. However, I will provide one clue to this puzzle: this a Hollywood movie. So it must have a Hollywood ending?right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day and age you are gonna do a gangster flick set in Brooklyn it has to be something special. With a cast this strong this movie should have been much better. The characters are clichéd variations of numerous movies made in the 90's. I think the movie should have been much shorter. It doesn't offer enough quality action moments to keep you interested and yet the shallowness of the characters makes it difficult to take it seriously. There is something lacking with this film and I would say that it is originality. If this film was made without the big names such as Ethan Hawke, Wesley Snipes and Richard Gere it would go straight to video, and thats exactly where you should look for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest (2009)The impossibility of survival, really, is the story of these three gritty street cops in the worst crime areas of Brooklyn. They range from the corrupt to the principled to the downtrodden--Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle, and Richard Gere, respectively, and more or less convincingly. It's filmed in an intense, direct way, the plots interwoven until they finally converge (improbably) at the end. Unlike a stylized movie like "Crash," this movie doesn't really have room for coincidence like this--it's too much about being real, a kind of updated "French Connection" without the steady, gripping, cinema verite style that holds up the earlier classic.This is filmed in straight up dramatic fashion, and you may feel you've seen most of the plot elements before: the narcotics cop tempted by all the money, the loser cop who finds a prostitute with a heart of gold, an undercover cop not supported by his higher-ups. But it's all happening at once and is often pretty exciting stuff. It's not a bad movie, but it never rises up, not by new ideas, not by a new way of looking at old ideas, and not even by perfectly executing a familiar kind of movie. So in little gaps, and gaffes, it never quite climaxes the way the climax, with all its drama, would like.The director, Antoine Fuqua, has had some decent work before this, including "Training Day" also starring Ethan Hawke, which rises above what we have here. I say this because even in films that don't quite work there can be elements--certain plot lines, or certain scenes, or a style--that make it interesting anyway. That begins to happen here. The hard core busts are fast and filled with fast cutting drama in a scary way. But the action adventure, masculine films in Fuqua's resume are also revealing for his limitations, too. And some of the scenes here, especially the black drug culture stuff (with Wesley Snipes, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg, yes), and the prostitute interactions between Gere and Shannon Kane, are so false you want to go get some popcorn.But you don't, because the next scene might just work, and work well.</fullReview>

A house, lacking in square footage and number of bedrooms, and also infested with wood-mold, sends a veteran cop down the path of totally insanity and a complete mental break-down. I would hate to see him with a bed-bug infestation in his house or Chinese drywall!!! 2. When people get shot in the film, they tend to spit out several pints of blood.3.

		<fullReview>Some interesting ideas spoiled by way OTT dramatization: if police work was anything like this there would be no cops ever. It's emphasis on action over acting is grinding - here was a chance to use an amazing cast and make a film to rival the Departed - instead we get a regurgitation of every cop movie since the 70s.There are good performances from everyone here - even though Ethan Hawke is the spitting image of Kevin Dillon from Entourage here - but really Gere and Cheadle are wasted - there is not enough nuance and too much in your face - we did really like Snipes here - he seemed to have the perfect balance between the script and the action - he is a much better actor than people give him credit for - and more serious roles suit him well.All in all, ghetto clichés abound, and make the whole thing feel like a cheap crime thriller - and it really does lack the depth and especially the gaps that would have lifted this to a whole other level. Some silence, introspection, thought would have helped.Watchable as a police thriller, but sadly lacking as a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best that can be said about Brooklyn's Finest is that the acting is, with the possible exception of Ellen Barkin's angry-Fed character (although this could be rightly blamed on the script), completely competent. However, there's much wrong here, namely: The film lacks a center. Do we really care about any of these characters? Richard Gere's character is easily dismissed; he's a burn out who's ending an un-illustrious 22-year career in uniform--- we see him do no actual police work and there's nothing to indicate he ever did anything on the job except patronize hookers. Again, Gere's competent in an thankless role. Wesley Snipes looks happy to be doing something other than being evicted from Vegas casinos and starring in home gym infomercials. He's somewhat sympathetic, but it's another thankless role as a drug lord. Don Cheadle does the best turn here, his ambition to make Detective 1st Grade is seriously compromised by his affection for Snipes' Chaz. Less thankless, but muddled. Chaz's enemies are his enemies, but we don't care. Barkin's character is crawling up his backside in typical fashion. No surprises. Ethan Hawke's motivations are illogical (at one point, NYPD rookies are incorrectly said to earn a $20K starting salary--- it's really $44,722 + overtime). He's uber-Catholic but kills at the slightest monetary provocation (oye, over mold?!). The story--- which is more like 3 characters in search of a plot, grinds along until they converge in a Crash-style finale that defies motivational logic (Gere finally does actual police work after he retires??? Hmmm... I find this hard to believe). And who lit this film? It's easily the darkest (and I do mean dark...) movie I've ever seen. It's really hard to see what's going on and you'll be sorely tempted to adjust the contrast on your TV. In the end, you'd be more entertained by The Shield (pick any season). This was an unpleasant experience, all for reasons beyond the actors' control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so Fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is your typical cop drama movie that we have seen plenty of times before. It really has nothing new to say. It has the same tiring characters. About to retire cop. Undercover cop. Bad cop. It is filled to the brim with blood and violence and countless uses of the F word which after awhile got a little sickening. The only thing going for it is the cast. If it were some no name actors, I don't think anyone would care to see another same old cop movie. Gere was good as the (yawn) retired cop but he has put his acting talents to better use elsewhere. Ethan Hawke plays just the opposite of what he played in Training Day. This time he is the (cliche) bad cop who goes around stealing drug money to support his wife and family. Cheadle is the undercover cop who (no surprise) has no real friends except for Wes Snipes, the drug dealer he is supposed to bring down. This is definitely not a movie with any comic relief. It is nonstop drama that gets too old for it's own good. At times if not all the time it can be very depressing. Your best bet is to find a better movie to see and wait to see this one on DVD or cable. There are not too many surprises. You will only find yourself saying that you have seen it all before. Pardon me while I yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrelentingly Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciate dark films, in fact it's an attribute I commonly look for in a movie. When it comes down to it, I'm cynical at heart. So while the literal story of a dark movie might not be incredibly realistic or believable, in a lot of ways I still consider it to be true to reality, true in its depiction of the world as it is, often cold and unforgiving. But this movie is something else. Not to shower it with hyperbole, but Brooklyn's Finest is bleak enough to make The Road look hopeful and optimistic. Watching it I wasn't sure if this was a good or bad thing. Good people die, bad people die, and those fortunate enough to survive the plot might as well be dead for all the happiness they have. When it took on a "Departed" vibe in the third act, I decided I liked the movie. Not for having instances of black humor or being stylish like The Departed, but it did share one key plot device. This device isn't inherently good on its own, but it helped me to realize how emotionally invested I was in each character. And on that note, Cheadle and Hawke dominate this movie. Gere and Snipes did competent jobs, but the former two truly occupied their roles. It seems like Fuqua wanted to push the envelope with this one. The stories him and guys like David Ayer create have become familiar territory to the point of being clichéd and tired, so I feel like he attempted to differentiate this one by really pushing the boundaries of the R- rating. Not that we haven't seen this content before, but there's just so much violence, nudity, sexuality, drugs, etc. it becomes extreme. And while it did start to feel excessive and unnecessary, I'll concede it helped to solidify the movie's dark, foreboding atmosphere. The movie is intense. Filmmakers have honed in on editing and photography techniques that clue audiences in to something bad that's about to happen, and Brooklyn's Finest is no exception. But something interesting I noticed, and I'm not sure if this was intentional, was that there were several of these moments where the climactic act of violence or whatever never came. But it wasn't anticlimactic, it just built the suspense that much more. Each time another moment like this comes around, you're not sure if someone is about to bite the dust or live to fight another day.Brooklyn's Finest is definitely not a film for everybody. It's dark and depressing. But even in such an extreme example like this, that can be so much more true to life than whatever crappy feel good comedy is playing right now. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sorry I watched this movie and l feel like I wasted my time. Actually, I only wasted half my time because it was so depressing and offensive I had to turn it off half way through. As a retired cop (from the West Coast of the United States) who lived in NY for a while, I am always disturbed by movies that portray NYC cops as a bunch of retarded, deprived, corrupt and sociopathic individuals who don't know how to string more than three words together without inserting the F word. Such portrayals betray the profession and contribute to the low opinion so many already have of cops. If movies like this accurately portray the behavior of the average NYC cop, I feel very sorry for the people of NYC. I also find it disturbing that so many other reviewers seem to think this kind of trash is wonderful. The otherwise great actors did themselves a disservice by appearing in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, Boring and Miserable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, I'll say I went in to this film not expecting much. However, in the past I've been pleasantly surprised by some films I've gone into with the same attitude. "Brooklyn's Finest" was not one of those. It didn't even come close to reaching my meager expectations. It's awful. The one thing that sums up this picture best is a thought that crossed my head somewhere around the 1:50 mark...I don't think one person in this film has smiled. I made a conscious effort to notice that for the remainder of the film and I still came up empty on the ol' smile-o-meter. Yes...it's that depressing and that miserable. I get it Mr. Fuqua. This is supposed to fit in line with the overall mood of the film. A tense drama works best when no one shows their pearly whites or even hints at so much as a smirk. If that's the case, I won't hold it against the film. I'll just put it out there as a warning.Mood aside, there's little to smile about anyway. The script makes little to no sense and there's nary a clear-cut plot line to be found. Mostly, it's less about the story and more about character sketches. The problem is that the characters aren't interesting. You'll get the entire sum of Richard Gere's character within the first 10 minutes of the film. In fact, within the first scene. His story is not interesting and most of his scenes are a complete waste of time.This could be the worst role I've ever seen Don Cheadle play and it shows (and yes, I saw "Volcano.) He's not very good at all, nor believable. I guess the two go hand in hand, but it's worth noting that he falls flat in every regard. He might as well have had the words "I'm acting" stamped across his forehead throughout the film. It's that transparent. Not that he has much to work with. The plot line surrounding his character is as convoluted as they come. It's almost as if a completely different movie collided into this one and they became entangled. Then, to make things worse, they chopped key scenes out of the original material. I'm sorry. I didn't get it and I couldn't follow it. I did understand he was suffering through some major angst, about what I didn't know...but then again, so was every other character in this mess.As for Ethan Hawke and his story line. I liked it the best of the three, but before you get all excited, that's not saying much. I understood his motivation and his plot line was probably the most focused. Then again, that's not saying much when it's being compared to the complete garbage of the other two-thirds of the script. I also sort of liked his character, but that's probably because his motivations are actually clearly explained. Otherwise, he's not really a guy you'd want to hang out with...especially since it seems he hasn't showered in quite some time. I get it Mr. Fuqua...he's driven to be a dirty cop (not a spoiler), so let's make him look physically dirty. Ha, ha. Film school is awesome.Hey, I did mention the word plot earlier? I did and I mentioned it wasn't clear cut. Basically, it's sort of a "Crash"-type idea. Follow these cops around, get the idea that they're miserable then have them sort of come together at the end. Really, they just end up in the same vicinity, almost as if the writers couldn't think of a way to actually have them come together, so this was the next best idea. That's it. There's some other underlying stuff, but you can tell it was just tacked on. There are some ancillary characters, but they're just tacked on as well. Existing only to add to the gloom of the whole affair. Yep, you guessed it. They're miserable, too.As you may have noticed, I gave this film a two out of ten. You may be asking, "This sounds like a one out of ten type review to me." I'd agree with you. The aforementioned "collision" of characters (if you can even call it that) at the end, probably the last twenty minutes, is the only time the film becomes somewhat compelling and interesting. Of course, that could just have been in comparison to the rest of the film. In fact, it is. You see, the same ending tacked onto the end of a decent film would almost be laughable. However, in the context of THIS film, it provides a modicum of entertainment. Given the dreariness of the preceding 110 minutes, it was welcome refreshment. Of course, it's not the most satisfying refreshment. Almost like walking through the desert and finding a warm six pack of Mountain Dew. Not what I'd prefer, but at that point, I'll take it."Brooklyn's Finest" is just awful. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and I just watched "The Descent: Part II" last week, which was pretty darn bad. Oh, and I also saw "Cop Out" and "The Book of Eli" within the last month. I'd watch any of those three over "Brooklyn's Finest" any day. In fact, I'd rather drink that six pack of Mountain Dew than even walk past "Brooklyn's Finest" in a discount DVD bin. No, not watch it or purchase it. I don't even want to be near the actual product. That goes for satellite "rays" or signals traveling through cable or fiber optics. Just put the yellow police tape around "Brooklyn's Finest"...there's nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Training Day, but Damn Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for crime drama/thrillers/whatever it might have been that I saw Batman at a very young age and loved it. It might be because of the moral complexities that crime films seem to be steeped in, (The Godfather, Goodfellas, Se7en, Touch of Evil, Reservoir Dogs) or it could be because of man's baser instincts needs us to indulge them occasionally. Who knows? All I know is that when 90% of the country was watching Alice in Wonderland I took this film in instead.Brooklyn's Finest starts off with a slow draw into a car where Sal (Ethan Hawke) and Carlo (Vincent D'Onofrio) are discussing Carlo's latest trial. Not long after Carlo is finished discussing the judge's verdict Sal shoots him in the face, and takes off with a bag full of cash. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover looking for that last bust at a promotion, problem is that he has to bust Casablanca (Wesley Snipes) the man who saved Tango's life in prison. Eddie Dougan (Richard Gere) however is just a week away from retirement and truly does not give a good goddamn about any of it. He wants his pension and he'll gladly look bad taking it.All of these men are integral parts of the story not one of them is bigger or more important than the next. Sal is a NARC two kids on the way to add with the three he already has, an asthmatic wife, in a house that has wood mold. If he wants to get out it won't be because of a payroll increase; but that drug money lying out in the open will do fine. Tango's marriage is virtually done and he is starting to forget what team he's playing for. When pulled over on the New Jersey turnpike he thinks, "why not let my boys blow this guy away". And Eddie is assigned a new partner as an initiative by the Mayor to train new cops. It's not long before these men's lives explode into conflict and I'm not going to cover any of that because it needs to be seen through fresh eyes, not recapped on a website.The film's flaws come from a lack of originality and a few scenes of clunky dialogue, but the trio of Gere/Hawke and Cheadle all make up for that and more. It's interesting that Ethan Hawke's career didn't take off in a bigger fashion, but it probably stems from his subtle nature. He is not a stick of dynamite, but a fuse slowly burning.It is clear from the film that we are implicated in the actions of these officers. Several of the scenes of towards the end Hawke, Cheadle and Gere directly acknowledge the camera. We put them out on the streets, we put them in harms way, and we look the other way when the sh_t falls on their heads.http://nevermindpopfilm.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll notice I gave this film 3 stars. Because Richard Gere was 1/3'd of this movie, he gets those 3 stars. Where I'm going with this, is the film was a combination of horrendous and atrocious - horrocious. I'm not sure how many of the people writing these reviews worked on the movie, but I would venture to guess it's close to 100%. This was most likely a combination of 3 scripts to make 1 movie - the only problem is that all 3 of those scripts sucked. When you see the opening scene of Gere, hopefully you'll laugh at the cliché of 1/2 Riggs, 1/2 Murtaugh and that will carry you for the 2+ hours of "Brooklyn's Finest." There is one genius scene with Gere and a prostitute where he talks about a rookie cop he's taking around. But I'll let you see that scene so you can laugh the whole ride home with your friends. I love Cheadle, Hawke, Gere and Snipes in general. On their own, they've done a lot of good movies - but this one didn't work. Too many story lines with no development, no twists and a complete downer. I don't feel very good after this movie. If the goal of this movie was to make you humble and to look at life with a greater respect - it does nothing but make you depressed. Luckily, I can laugh this one off. Wish it was better, really do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(52%) This feels to me very much like a more crime related version of 2004's love or hate best film winner "Crash", with its similar themes surrounding both the good and bad things all people are actually capable and willing to do. On a plus side it's nice to see Wesley Snipes in a solid production playing a real character, and he's actually quite good here. So too is the cast in general which has bags of experience, star power and talent. On the down side though this overall is a touch too ploddingly slow and about 20 mins or so too long, but the interconnecting ending is worth the wait even if it is a little too neat and contrived to be necessarily all that believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harsh Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wire" has rendered even crime films deemed "classics" trite and outdated. "Brooklyn's Finest", a crime film which at times seems to outright emulate "The Wire", fares even worse. Set in Brooklyn, New York, it charters the lives of several loosely connected men. One's a corrupt detective (Ethan Hawke) looking to steal drug money for his family, the other's a depressed cop (Richard Gere) on the way to retirement, the other's an undercover officer (Don Cheadle) who finds himself unwilling to betray a friend.The film's aiming for Greek Tragedy, its audience positioned to be stunned by the tragic fact that Hawke loses his live breaking the law for a somewhat noble cause (his family), and Cheadle loses his because he turns his back on a manipulative institution in favour for helping a criminal and friend. The grand irony is supposed to be that Gere, who despises the police force, who is the ultimate cynic, who has turned his back entirely on that which has turned his back on him, becomes the great white hero, busting some gang-bangers and rescuing some women on the very night he retires. Whether you find this material affecting or not will largely depends upon how tolerant you are of clichés and contrivances.The film was directed by Antoine Fuqua, whose best film remains "Training Day". His work on "Brooklyn's Finest", in contrast, is forced, slow and derivative. The film's mode of interlocking segments have been in vogue over the past few years ("Crash", "Magnolia", "Babel", "Syrianna" etc), possibly as a result of the hyper-link boom and a rise in sprawling television dramas (and the death of Altman and serious novels?), but Fuqua's attempts at scope and gravity are amateurish. The film boasts a fine performance by Wesley Snipes, a horrendous performance by Cheadle and features a genuinely tense climactic scene featuring Richard Gere. The rest of the film is filler, which tumbles cynically toward a calculated, lazy blood bath.4/10 ? Worth no viewings. For better pulp, see "Harsh Times" and "Street Kings". For serious crime drama, look far elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three very recognizable types, and the tropes are there, at least on paper. But where Fuqua sets himself apart, as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day, is to imbue importance (not pretentious but just enough for serious effect) in the direction of scenes, and in casting. The actors take material that could be trite and unconvincing and even stale post-Lumet-cop-movie stuff and make it their own, compelling and heartfelt, and true to the extent that the genre allows. There's real tragedy felt with Hawke's character, albeit he may overact just a bit in some scenes, since this corrupt cop wouldn't be so bad if he could get what he needs ("I don't want God's forgiveness, I want his help," he says in confession), and likewise real conflict with Cheadle's undercover, who has been embedded too long in the trenches, and wants to help the criminal who once saved his life (Wesley Snipes fantastic in an older, slightly wiser version of his character in New Jack City).And then there's Gere. One almost forgets Gere's successes when he's starring in romantic-comedy junk like... well, what's he been in recently for starters. But then one looks at Unfaithful, Days of Heaven, The Hoax, I'm Not There, among some others, and one sees Gere is an underrated presence, a guy who when given material to shine in does very well as an everyman, more than just a typical pretty star. With his role as the on-his-way-out cop, he gives one of his best performances, worn and weary, but strong and good as a cop whenever he can see fit, who at one point makes a mistake that he won't cop to (watch Gere when he's interrogated about his rookie's mishap on a convenience store scuffle and it's something of genius work). It's intense and believable, and even tender and sorrowful work, like when Gere's character is around a prostitute he's fallen for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Antoine Fuqua takes to the underbelly of Brooklyn following three police officers that are forced to make life changing decisions. Duty takes a diverse definition with these three. Eddie Dugan(Richard Gere)is a cynical, burnt-out cop just days away from retirement and has no enthusiasm about being assigned a rookie while his mind is only on retiring to a fishing cabin in Connecticut. Sal Procida(Ethan Hawke)is a cash-strapped narcotics office fighting his temptations of scoring some extra cash from drug raids. "Tango" Butler(Don Cheadle) is losing sight of honorable police priorities as an undercover narcotics cop, who starts finding sympathy with a notorious inner-city dealer played by Wesley Snipes. To serve and protect wears thin. This movie lumbers along and easily gives cause for disappointment. The supporting cast includes: Will Patton, Shannon Kane, Brian F.

		<shortDescription>The Story of Three Cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BROOKLYN'S FINEST as written by Michael C. Martin and directed by Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Shooter') provides an intense study of the live of three Brooklyn policemen and details how they are all on the brink of being burned out by the grisly requirements of their work in one of the most crime infested areas in the country. Richard Gere is Eddie, a veteran cop with seven days to go before retirement who is assigned to a couple of Rookies to be a role model: Eddie's only moments of tranquility come from alcohol and from steady encounters with hooker Chantel (Shannon Kane in one of the film's finest roles). Don Cheadle is Tango, an undercover narcotics division cop assigned to a sting operation driven by the only female detective Ellen Barkin that involves a old friend Caz (Wesley Snipes): Tango is consumed by conflict and is mentally worn thin by his work. Ethan Hawke is Sal, married to diabetic Angela (Lili Taylor), pregnant with twins: Sal has tried everything (even dirty cop tactics and maneuvers) to get enough cash to move his growing beloved family to a better home. These three stories weave simultaneously throughout the film and finally come together in a surprising twist at the end. The film has the look of the subject of the movie: everything is dark, dirty, infested with vermin and all manner of crime, and intertwined with mean streets. It captures the grit of the story and manages to allow us to understand each of the main characters. There is a point of contention in the writing: a vast portion of the script is written (and subsequently delivered) in street talk so foul that it becomes annoying. Most of the dialogue within the gang scenes is not understandable: turn on the subtitles and the mystery of what is being said is not clarified at all. This may make the film more realistic but it hides the simple ability to communicate verbally in the slang of the streets. There is a considerable amount of unnecessary, sycophantic brutality and violence, but then that is what the film is about. There is some fine acting here, but be prepared for a lot of noise and violence. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Brooklyn's Finest" tells the story of three (Brooklyn) cops of varying importance and the way in which their screwed up lives intersect. Think "Crash" plus "Training Day" minus "significance." Richard Gere is a washed up patrol cop on the brink of retirement who never does anything that calls for extra effort or paper work. Don Cheadle is so deep undercover that the line between cover and reality has become blurred. And Ethan Hawke is a narcotics officer whose family is quickly dipping below the poverty line. All three are close to the breaking point in their own way as the tensions of the city take them through shoot outs, crooked take downs, and kidnappings. Director Antoine Fuqua puts together a slow moving, worthlessly complex, grim plot that none of his characters seem capable of properly navigating. And then it all mercifully ends.Generally speaking, I'm a fan of Fuqua's work. "Training Day" is one of the best cop movies I've ever seen, complete with an iconic performance by Denzel Washington. "Tears of the Sun" is far from great but I find it to be an above average war movie that tackles tough content with relative realism. And "Shooter" is one of my all-time favorite "guilty pleasure" movies and one that I find myself watching more times than I'd like to admit. Fuqua displays an understanding of his subject matter that few directors do.But..."Brooklyn's Finest" is an extreme departure from Fuqua's recent catalog. The setup takes forever to get settled in, the characters are wholly unlikeable, and the connections between these unlikeable characters are questionable at best. Characters that are supposed to represent a gritty, authentic take on crooked cops in a corrupt city come across as cliché caricatures instead. In addition, the story is as common as they come. Gere is a burn out who spends all his money on prostitutes and booze, Cheadle can't bring himself to turn in his new bad-guy buddies, Hawke is killing and stealing to support his family and blah blah blah. The whole of "Finest" plays out like a bad episode of "NYPD Blue" only with more cursing and less Dennis Franz-related nudity (at least it has that going for it). When finding it hard to phrase how I feel about a movie, I like to pull inspiration from the great scholarly works such as "Billy Madison." In the words of Billy's principal, "At no point in your rambling...were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought." (Perhaps the classic "...sound and fury, signifying nothing" would seem more sophisticated but I just like "Billy Madison", okay?) That's how I felt about "Finest." It strives to matter but it simply doesn't, instead reveling for two hours in the Pointless Abyss, leaving the semi-resurrection of Wesley Snipes as its only legacy.My site, the Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the story had plot inanities every few minutes it's difficult for me now to list more than a few. But oh what a stinker this film is! 1. An urban drug business making multi-thousands a day without any people on the street serving as lookouts? 2. Hawke in a room by himself with tons of drug cash for the taking but he doesn't close and lock the door behind him? 3. A whore who gives a favored client a key to her business address which allows him to enter when she's er-ummm, entertaining clients? 4. Two bad guys, not at the same time, facing a gun toting Gere who they don't take seriously? 5. One of 4.'s bad guys, shot in the heart-area at point blank range, continues to fight Gere and almost wins the fight? 6. Why didn't the anguished Hawke use condoms instead of getting into such a predicament that leads him to murder six or seven people to support his children and wife? 7. Gere, elderly looking, as a uniformed policeman after '20 years service': did he join the force when he was forty? 8. How did the 3 principals, at film's end happen to converge at the same place at the same time. Illogical, illogical, illogical. I'll say this however.....the photography, sound design and editing were very good. To sum up B.F. is the worst film I've seen in the last year in which I've seen about 200 movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dirty cop, a jaded-retiring cop and an undercover cop walk into a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dirty cop, a jaded-retiring cop and an undercover cop walk into a movie? Grab onto the handrail this is a bumpy ride, and not as humorous as the first line might have you believe.Brooklyn's Finest addresses a particularly rough period in the roughest neighbourhood of one of the rougher cities in America from the perspective of three of the cops in the area.Richard Gere is Eddie. In the usual cop film cliché he is a week from retirement, jaded and worn down by years of dealing with the grind of crime, drug use and depravity.Ethan Hawke is Sam. He has lotsa kids (and I mean lots), significant financial issues and a yet-again pregnant wife who is growing sick from living in sub-standard conditions.Don Cheadle is Tango. An undercover cop who has been under a little too-long for his own sanity, away from his wife and friends. His position is further compromised by the release of his long time friend and scummy criminal Casanova (Wesley Snipes).Now I know that movies need conflict and things to overcome to provide tension and action but just writing those brief summaries felt like I was visiting the Cop-Movie cliché warehouse. Cramming all of these ideas and problems onto three characters seems a little much.Things come to a flashpoint in this particular Brooklyn district when a cop guns down a young black male in an apparent robbery committed by the cop. This occurs in one of the most troubled areas of the city, in fact 20 yards away a gang bags drugs for sale while the investigation is in full swing. Coupled with this is the fact that the cops seem to be losing control and respect in light of the killing, lacking manpower they decide they have no alternative but to team rookies with more experienced cops in the hope that they pick up the ropes quickly.To further the predictability of the plot - Eddie gets assigned a gung-ho rookie who feels that Eddie is getting out because things are too tough for the old softie? - Sam's efforts to move his family into a better neighbourhood are thwarted through lack of funds? - Tango's boss comes in and bluntly orders him to take down Casanova or risk a long dangled promotion out of the undercover role? As the movie progresses you can pretty much guess what will happen next, but really that isn't a big problem. For all the clichés and predictability Brooklyn's Finest is actually OK, it eschews big explosions, exhilarating car chases and massive shootouts in favour of more realistic actions and reasonably clever plot events, and it keeps things pretty simple in a stereotypical way so that the audience can keep track of everything. And how does it do that? ALL THE BLACK GUYS ARE BAD AND ALL THE WHITE GUYS ARE COPS.I don't think that it means to be racist, but that's exactly how the film pans out.Another cop film where desperate times call for desperate measures, life ain't fair and sometimes no-one actually wins.For my gentleman readers, there is also a fair bit of nudity, some of it rap-video extra quality.Final Rating ? 6 / 10. A standard rating for a standard movie. It takes all the clichés but handles them well. Not a great movie but a good, albeit unfocused cop story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is a cynical, ironic title as, it would seem from this movie that there is no one fine, whether they're cop or criminal, in the borough of Brooklyn. Everyone is using, robbing and/or killing everyone else. It's like that old John Lennon song: "Everyone's hustling for a buck or a dime/I'll scratch your back and you knife mine." Director Antoine Fuqua is back on Training Day territory here both in subject matter and with star Ethan Hawke and he has a real feel for the street milieu. Richard Gere is on familiar ground here too wearing the same uniform he had on in Internal Affairs (it's a credit to his genetics that he doesn't seem a day older 20 years on from that movie).There are three stories; Richard Gere plays a burnt-out veteran cop one week from retirement (haven't we seen this movie before? The "cop-a-week-from-retirement" is as bad a stereotype as the criminal doing "one last job.") He is forced to train in rookies and his experienced callousness clashes with their youthful idealism and forces him to re-examine his life.Ethan Hawke plays a Noo Yawk, Catholic, Italian-American dirty cop (count those clichés, people). His name is Sal and he has kids named Vinnie and Vito (yes, really, it has all the ethnic depth of the Goodfellas episode of The Simpsons). He is desperate to move his pregnant wife to a better, healthier home and so he decides to kill drug dealers and steal their drug money every time his team makes a bust (as you do).Don Cheadle is an undercover cop wrestling with the guilt he feels about setting up a criminal (Wesley Snipes, good to see him in a major film again) he is close to. It's this story that works best.The three stories connect at the end and it leads to some highly unlikely coincidences. Just as Richard Gere is about to blow his own brains out in a car, a missing girl he remembers from a police notice board appears behind him. And the three main characters find themselves in the same slum project at the same time going after three different sets of criminals. You can see the tragic ending coming, but there are some surprises.The main problem with the film is that there's no one to root for. There are no heroes until the final scene and by then it's too late. There are only bad guys and even badder guys. It's a world of perpetual darkness and it does stay with you after you've seen it, but the clichés and stereotypes blunt it's impact and make it too much like other movies like The New Centurions or Fort Apache: The Bronx. File under missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché can still work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cliché" is used here not as a criticism, but just in a neutral sense - three NYPD stories that have been told times and again on screen.Ethan Hawke plays a victim of poverty, with a meager police salary insufficient to provide a decent life to his family: kids growing,kids on the way and wife whose health suffers from harmful substances emitting from the old house they live in. The solution seems to be the drug money lying around in ready cash that he comes into contact with almost daily.Richard Gere is the very model of a stereotype, not just in the force but in every other calling, one who has muddled through a career and is now a week from retirement. While some such charactersmay take their own inadequacy stoically, this protagonist is so troubled that he puts a loaded gun into his mouth, but fails to discharge it probably because he is too weary of everything. One big irony that at his retirement, the only memorial ? a watch ? he receives is not from the force but from his favourite prostitute.Don Cheadle is another familiar case, an undercover agent who "wants his life back". There is also the cliché situation of the agonizing dilemma whether to betray a man (a drug dealing boss played by Wesley Snipes) with whom he has developed a true friendship. One thing perhaps not typical (at least not as portrayed in movies) is that this undercover agent drives a BMW and lives in a reasonably plush apartment and is purportedly even allowed to spend some of the drug money (so as not to blow his cover). One can't help wondering why he is in such a hurry to want his life back.Antoine Fuqua skilfully flows these essentially unrelated three strings through the movie. Even the climatic ending that has all three converge at the same location is quite haphazard, so don't expect sophisticated, convoluted inter-connections as in "Bable" (2006). But even without that, the individual stories have sufficient human drama (or some would say melodrama) to sustain the audience's interest. Three (or four, if you like) capable actors have done the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments but ultimately disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is a super hard, gritty cop thriller. Its dark as tar. It starts with an excellent scene between Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'onofrio that ends unexpectedly. It sets the movie up really well, but from that point onwards things become relentlessly grim. Despite excellent acting from all involved (particularly Gere and Hawke)the movie is a difficult sell.Essentially about the unpleasant reality of life in an inner city police force, it examines the injustices and corruptions that push these people to the brink. What lets the movie down is a lack of momentum and no particularly likable characters. Whilst you feel for their various plights, the characters come off as unpleasant. Antoine Fuqua who has previously shown great flair and dynamic with these kinds of movies lets us down here. Despite the many shootings and beatings the move doesn't really pack a punch and feels very static at times. And the ending feels very, very contrived.The movie has its moments dotted throughout and I wouldn't say don't see it. But there is a lot of talent here that doesn't quite come together to create a satisfying whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wesley Snipes stole it for me despite his small role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't quite sure what was going in the opening, yet I had a feeling what was coming. After that scene, it didn't take long for me to soon get wrapped up in each of the three New York police officers' (Cheadle, Hawke, Gere) lives. I was actually surprised it wasn't until the end that they came together at the same location, each of them with different motives for being there. Brooklyn's Finest is somewhat like three movies in one, flipping back and forth between characters' story lines.Gere's character probably could have been removed without the movie skipping a beat, but I found myself rooting for him. He just wanted to retire and get through his last week on the job, yet stuff kept falling into his lap. Wesley Snipes stole it for me despite his small role, though. I would have liked to have seen more of him. Cheadle and Snipes as notorious figures in the drug business is a great pair. Hawke is pretty good as a crazy cop under desperation to support his family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only if The Wire never been on TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always love movie with complex different stories and characters which could all intercepted at the end with logical explanation. This movies is good in the sense of high tension drama about the thin line between right or wrong. Story of a Narcotic cop (Ethan Hawk), who love his family desperately and will go to hell for that cause. A undercover cop (Don Cheadle) whom is in deep the job with the fear he never get out of it mentally. And finally an old cop (Richard Gere) whom lost faith in everything and only live but without feel of his existing. The acting is very good even the supporting cast with Wesley as the head gangster even with Sal's (Ethan) sick pregnant wife and Eddie's (Gere) long time China town "paid girl friend". The plot, screen writing are logical and smooth. But, how on earth the casting people thinking to get Michael K. Williams on the cast. No problem at all with his acting and to be fair there is not much for talented Mr K. Williams to act as well. But the worst is bring back the memory of the classic The Wire. So many borrow from the TV series make hard to not compare. I know people will say they are all about cop story but for god sake the final ending when a cop shoot a cop by seeing a gun in his hand. It really spoil the whole things. But anyhow, overall it worth watching but not so much memory afterward</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On display in this movie are three remarkably dark, bleak and grim tales that ultimately intertwine with one another. The movie is a downer from opening until end but it was captivating all the way through. I usually hate monotone grim films that you know aren't going to end well but each lead actor really delivers an amazing performance. The acting saved me from the bitter waste of time delivered by each story itself. The pacing was poor and sometimes even awkward. I often found myself saying, "Why the heck do we need to see this?" or "Why didn't they cut that whole useless scene.

		<fullReview>Training Day was a superb film, which showed remarkable directing ability and had a story you cared about very deeply.Brooklyn's Finest is none of those things. Sure, its acted well... Don Cheadle is amazing and so is Ethan Hawke, who showed great versatility as an actor by playing so far out of type. Richard Gere turned in a very good performance too, but unfortunately I just didn't buy him as grizzled old beat cop who never made anything of himself. He's too pretty and sophisticated looking and there are far better choices out there for a role like this. Even Wesley Snipes played his part well, although he was underused.The film itself is a near-disaster though. Three story lines about three very different kinds of cops all intersect at the same housing project. OK fine, I can buy that. What I cannot buy is utterly cliché dialog, the lack of character development and the general apathy in storytelling that is apparent here. The Ethan Hawke story is the most believable, and even that is plagued with things that you just shake your head at.The director begins this film pretty much mid-story and doesn't take time to explain a lot of details, very much in the style of Michael Mann... except Mann is an exponentially better director, and when he does it you appreciate the brevity and the maturity of the style... in this film you just get frustrated.There is little here worth watching beyond the performances of the cast. Its too bad they didn't have better material to work with, as this really could have been a great movie.</fullReview>

They are there, but there for a reason--to accentuate the thread that is not a cliché. The marker for that thread is the gun with no bullets, which goes from beginning to end, at which point it does carry a single bullet. Outstanding cast, even Ellen Barkin as about the meanest woman I've seen portrayed on screen.It is brutal, but it does take place after all in the worst pigsty (precinct) in Brooklyn.Fuqua has been turning out some great stuff:Brooklyn's Finest Shooter King Arthur Lightning in a Bottle Tears of the Sun Training Day</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Cops, Stupid Drug Dealers, Stupid Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love NYC cop movies, don't get me started on classics like Fort Apache the Bronx and the French Connection. Well guess what, this movie ain't them by a LONG shot but it certainly tries to fake the funk.The movie is not a total disaster. It's shot well, acted well, and has a cool vibe to it overall. Just check your brain at the door because this movie is more full of holes than the countless gun shot victims that pepper the film. Police are not this stupid, rookie cops are not this stupid. Drug dealers are not this stupid! The movie portrays new cops like they are helpless babies. I'm sure they're wet behind the ears but come on. One of them is even supposed to be a marine returning from Iraq and yet can't handle Brooklyn after the year 2000. Not only that but they complain about starting pay being 20k a year. Starting pay for NYPD is 40k a year and DTs would be making over 90k! That would be plenty for Sal (who I assume is a DT) to put a down payment on a house which in his neck of the woods you can get for around 160k.Brooklyn is one of the richest places in the US, most of it is very nice. Projects in Brooklyn, while usually elevated in crime are NO WHERE near this riddled with crime. Also if you've ever been to the PJs, they are teeming with people outside at all hours of the day except when cold as hell or raining. This should be a love letter to NYC, instead it sounds like a story written by someone who has never been there, has never met a drug dealer and has certainly never met a cop.Oh I should point out that Wesley Snipes was excellent as was everyone else (5 points for cast). But seriously Sal (Ethan Hawke ) wear a friggen condom you've got like eight kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three different Brooklyn cops, three different sets of issues, three different endings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see a movie like this I naturally wonder how closely it might relate to real life? Are there really cops like this who work undercover in the midst of crime gangs? Are there really cops who look to steal money at drug busts? Are there really cops who will point-blank assassinate someone then go home to hug his kids? My hopes for basic goodness in the world hopes not, but my get tells me probably so.This is a violent movie with lots of profanity, so those with a tender constitution may not be able to get through it. But if you do, all the actors are superb.Richard Gere is Eddie, only seven days away from retirement. We never get much in the way of details but it is clear that he is not particularly admired by his own department. He is assigned a new trainee, he is not happy about that, and he doesn't do a particularly good job. But when things go wrong he insists on taking responsibility.Don Cheadle is Tango, veteran cop looking for a promotion and working undercover in the midst of an old friend, the drug boss recently released from prison, Wesley Snipes as Caz. Tango is conflicted, he is determined to do his job, in fact eager to do his job, but he has a certain allegiance to Caz.Ethan Hawke is Sal, seemingly the most conflicted of the three. He has a wife and kids, and twins on the way. They desperately need a new home, but money for the down-payment is tight. There is a very interesting scene where Sal is in the confessional, seeking forgiveness but not wanting God's help.Vincent D'Onofrio is one of my favorite actors and here he is Carlo. It may be the shortest role he has ever had.Ellen Barkin seems to have disappeared from the movie scene, at least the ones I have been seeing, but she is here as Agent Smith and she is a very tough cookie here.Pretty good movie, the lives of the three featured characters converge on the same housing project at the end of the movie, and their experiences are quite different. The critic Ebert has a good, balanced review.SPOILERS: Sal has stolen some cash from drug busts, he plans to use it to get the new house. His deadline is up, he needs a bit more, goes to a suspected drug operation, kills a few crooks and finds the money, but as he is gathering it the young man who was the outside "lookout" finds him and shoots him in the back, Sal dies on the floor. Outside the same building in the project, Tango is gunned down on the street after Caz dies. In the same project Eddie tracks down a kidnap victim forced into prostitution, perhaps making up for his lack of concern before. In a showdown inside he subdues the two thugs and frees the three women being held captive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faux-gritty...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's finest follows three different police officers in three completely separate story lines. If you're thinking at this point "oh dear, yet another highly artificial film following the success of Crash" well, you're kind of right. The three stories each have interesting potential, the cast is stellar and director Fuqua is as stylish as ever but the whole never takes off in any way, shape or form and the writing by Michael C. Martin is both lackluster and lacks credibility. One story features detective Salvatore Procida (Ethan Hawke) who feels unable to provide for his family. Things are about to get worse because his wife is pregnant with twins and her health is deteriorating due to the wood mold in their home. We see this veteran detective balance his life between his family, his work as a police officer as he starts to increasingly prey upon drug dealers and criminals to pocket dirty money. Hawke does a decent acting job but the writing doesn't leave him any chance. Procida is a deeply religious guy wearing leather coat and gunning criminals down in unrealistic fashion. At one point, we see him leave his prints all over the place while committing criminal acts. What takes the cake is the weak attempt at rationalization by Fuqua and Martin. During a poker game between Salvatore and his cop buddies, they lament their poor wages and the $20000 starting cop salary. My guess is Martin pulled this number out of a hat or his research was lacking. The NYPD will never be mistaken with a road to golden wealth but cops will do more than 20k even during academy and a detective like Procida should have no problems buying a new house as a detective, provided he manages his finances remotely decently. Another story follows on Eddie (Richard Gere), a jaded and depressed patrol officer who is about to retire. The first scene featuring Eddie sets the cliché tone when we see him get out of bed, immediately drink dry whisky and then "rehearse" his suicide by pulling the trigger of an empty gun he shoved in his mouth. Eddie seems like an uninspired amalgam of all those tired cop veterans we've seen in countless movies. Sad, lonely, alcoholic, hated by other cops, divorced and who has given up making a difference. At several points in the film, we see him turn a blind eye to crimes committed. Gere was the most convincing actor to me but has to deal with the most predictable storyline as well. There are also various enormities going on, including learning that Gere has been 22 years on the job (we're talking about a 60-year old man here) and seeing him shoot a guy in the heart who then wrestles with him as if this was a Schwarzenegger action flick. Unintentionally funny doesn't even begin to describe this. The last story is the one with the most twists and turns. This time it's about an undercover agent, Clarence Butler (Don Cheadle). The clichés are still there. The line between his job as a cop and his life as a fake criminal is blurring, he is longing for his wife and a normal cop job. Cheadle is usually amazing but here, he is lackluster. He pulls the despair as a cop but his act as a ghetto tough guy is a caricature that lacks any menacing presence. This guy would not have survived in this world in real life. Once again, the film's credibility is shattered in this storyline as Cheadle's superiors do and say things that no higher ups in the NYPD would EVER say in the face of an undercover agent. Wesley Snipes makes an appearance here but is totally misused. Michael C Martin's script was originally a draft for a sequel to the action film New Jack City and it shows. Fuqua tries to inject the style of Training Day in there and the influence of The Wire is prevalent. But none of the influences match the originals. Brooklyn's Finest doesn't explore the characters or their issues enough to be a drama, it doesn't have enough action to be a Hollywood blockbuster either. It's trying to be too much and ends up not being anything except three story lines that poorly attempt to show the system is letting down our police officers and turning them into crooks and losers. The film is stylish and at times interesting but remains flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another cop story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three police officers have different agendas. Eddie Dugan (Gere) just has 7-days to go before retirement and wants an easy 7-days, but he is saddled with a rookie in one of the worst areas of Brooklyn; Tango (Cheadle) has been an undercover cop for much too long and feels under appreciated; and Sal (Hawke) feels he needs to do more for his pregnant wife and kids.This could have been a really good movie, but too much of the movie is shot in the dark. I opened more lights. Didn't help. Some daylight shots and some humor could have made this more enjoyable. The music was good. With too many of the scenes shot in the dark and it's summer time too, I felt I had to take a shower every now and then. You could almost smell the area and feel the stickiness of summer humidity. I guess that's saying the cinematography was good. And, it was. We get the picture that Precinct 65 in Brooklyn, NY is one of the worst places to work and corruption abounds everywhere. ( I have no idea if there really is a Precinct 65 in Brooklyn so I am hoping this is all fiction)Seems all cop movies now have that tendency to mimic CRASH and the principal actors are required to meet at the grand finale. Well, "meet" here is a relative term. They don't really meet, but they all get to the scene. They don't know each other. See?All acting performances are first rate and this includes Wesley Snipes as Caz a drug dealer and Ellen Barkin as a tough FBI agent.This is just another cop story that could have been better presented. Can't help but think that Ethan Hawke plays in too many cop movies that one day he will wake up and drive himself to the nearest police station and ask for an assignment. HA !Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is really not a very good movie. The acting is terrible, but not as terrible as the writing. I don't know who wrote this example of movie stupidity but it reeks of a white guy trying to write about black characters. Nothing is realistic here. I suppose in some post-apocalyptic New York people commit crimes right in front of the police and then tell them to go blank themselves when they intervene, but I don't buy it. And here we have Richard Gere playing a veteran cop with only seven days left to retirement who seems to be as meek as a lamb, not knowing how to handle the ruffians on the street. And Ethan Hawk, who plays a corrupt cop trying to steal as much drug money as possible, but so obviously in broad daylight in front of everyone that only Brooklyn's Dumbest couldn't see it. And then we have Don Cheadle, the undercover cop torn between his loyalty between the department and his newfound gangster friends (ala every Honk Kong movie ever made), blabbing hokey dialog until we can't help but laugh. The editing is worse than any of it, by the way. It's as if we can actually hear the director shouting "action" and "cut". Just rubbish. Pure caca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much I can write in this review.

Antoine Fuqua had a winner with Training Day, and while Denzel's character is better than any characters in Brooklyn's Finest, this movie is more engaging overall on sheer entertainment value. That's not to say that these character's aren't spectacular because all four of these guys (Wesley Snipes, Don Cheadle, Richard Gere, and Ethan Hawke) do a wonderful convincing job.The script and plot are full of tension and conflict that will pull at your heartstrings. The buildup is very cleverly crafted and the payoff is definitely satisfying, if not in the way that we expect. By no means is it a classic, but damn it's entertaining!

		<shortDescription>A somewhat captivating cop drama about 3 crooked cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the main reason I decided to check this movie out is because it's made by the same guy who directed "Training Day". Now this isn't good as "Training Day" but it is still worth a rent, it's a pretty good cop drama about crooked cops. In fact it revolves around three cops with almost no connection to one another, slightly come together near the end. In another words the title of this movie is one big sarcasm, since it portrays the cops as being dirty and hypocrites. The dangerous streets and ghetto atmosphere and realistic criminal vibe is what mostly drives this movie, even if some aspects are not very realistic. This movie would have been better if there was more of a connection between the three cops and weaved the story together a bit more. The portrayal of the pressure and stress of what comes behind the shield is done well and the acting is really well done as well. Besides the good vibe of this movie though, there is just too much cop cliché, in fact the whole movie has a bit too much clichés in it's script. This movie has some captivating scenes and performances but there really isn't that much positive things I can say about the movie as a whole. It's just forgetful and yet it's still worth a rental.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb acting; vastly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I created an account here at IMDb solely in order to contribute a review of this film. Just finished watching it and was stunned by how good it was. I hadn't heard much about it, but now, having seen it, I'm wondering why it isn't more widely talked about and why it was overlooked for Academy Award nominations. The multi-thread, intricate plot is reminiscent of "The Wire," as is the interconnectedness of the lives of vice cops and the drug dealers and users with whom they interact. But what struck me most was the phenomenal acting: Lili Taylor and many of the other supporting players (you'll recognize more than a few faces from "The Wire") are superb. But Gere and Hawke are especially powerful and touching. These are actors I haven't thought particularly highly of in the past. That's probably why I just now got around to renting this on DVD. But they are extraordinary here. It's a shame they were overlooked for Oscar nods: these are among the most skillful and subtle performances I've seen in years. It's not "Raging Bull"-style showy acting; just excellent, quiet work in which each actor completely disappears into his role. Also phenomenal is Ellen Barkin as an amoral, self-serving, foul-mouthed, utterly unlikeable detective. Just goes to show that good actors will rise to the occasion when they are given decent material. A good, suspenseful, adult film that deserves more acclaim and a bigger audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheadle, Hawke, and Gere play three cops that each on their own way are living a life on the edge of morality- without realizing it.Cheadle's character is the most interesting in the movie. He is an undercover cop deep in the world of drugs. He realizes he is too deep and wants a desk job. He's promised that by his handler, if he does one more job- courtesy of the Feds: jail a good friend drug lord who just got out of jail, and who also saved his life. That drug lord is played by Wesley Snipes, in the best performance of the movie. Will he or won't he give up is criminal friend? Hawke's character is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He's got 3 kids and twins on the way. His wife has asthma due to mold in the old house. He's obsessed with buying a new large house and obsession that is making him sick. He thinks about financing that purchase by stealing drug money from raids. Will he or won't he steal that money? Gere's character is a cop about the retire in a week. He's a loner who doesn't care about his job or anything else, except a prostitute he has fallen in love with. He is assigned to train rookies but there's probably no worse trainer than someone who doesn't care. His first trainee ends up dead, but with another trainer, his second trainee gets involved in an unnecessary shooting- that gets Gere kicked out. A prostitute he sees being abused ends up missing. This somehow rattles him, but more so, when his prostitute girl refuses to leave with him. When he sees another prostitute being dragged away he reacts. How far will he go now as a cop removed from the force? These three characters who don't have a connection will cross paths, while crossing a road in an unlikely unraveling of the stories.This movie is very intriguing. Cheadle's story is in particular entertaining. Hawke's not so much because he's a train wreck waiting to happen. And Gere's character is a dull jerk. It is a long movie but you do get involved and want to find out how it all ends. The ending works but perhaps it's not satisfying, but it's hard to write a satisfying ending when the audience gets so involved with these characters. There are other minor weaknesses with the script. But particularly annoying is the music in this movie. It's overbearing and doesn't fit the scenes. Most if it is a rip-off of that exciting orchestrated music in the Bourne movies. Overall, a very entertaining and engaging movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a bad season in the movies right now. From an assortment of forgettable and truly ridiculous sounding films, we settled on this one. I read Antoine Fuqua's name on the little plot synopsis sheet they put out the theater, so I kinda knew where this was going.The movie doesn't break any new ground. Most of the time it felt like a two-hour long Third Watch or The Shield episode. Still, the film's moral message gets pretty well, with a rather depressing ending, or bittersweet at its best.Don Cheadle is perfect. He nails his undercover street character pretty well, demonstrating the talented actor he is. Can't say the same about Ethan Hawke, who just looks like an extension of his previous Training Day (also directed by Fuqua) character. Richard Gere is really inexpressive most of the time. Wesley Snipes is also good, but not really memorable. The rest of the performances, coming from unknowns, are decent. Constant cussing and stereotypical African-American slang grace the script, and along with the action scenes, make for an entertaining experience. Unfortunately, the "tender" scenes kinda drag a while, particularly that scene with Gere and the hooker.If you like those corruption in the police movies, you'll enjoy it, still, it's all been done before. The three simultaneous story lines are anything but new, and overall, while you might find the death of two of the main characters shocking, it's not that groundbreaking.It's decent enough to watch a few times, but it's not an instant classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A tangled character study, involving some hard bitten cops in the titular New York precinct, including Eddie (Richard Gere), a gentle, passive patrol cop on his way out who tries to steer new recruits in what he sees as the right direction, Tango (Don Cheadle) who's been undercover too long and formed too close a bond with recently released drug king Cazanova (Wesley Snipes) and Sal (Ethan Hawke) a narcotics detective who's in deep with money worries which are pushing him over the edge into corruption.Antoine Fuqua's latest film is another nosedive into how awful it apparently is to be a cop in the poorer parts of New York, showing everything in raw, unflinching detail. Almost like a replay of the (fairly) recent Pride and Glory. The trouble is, each scene seems to be competing to be as intense and dramatic as the last, and what you're left with is a string of heavy sequences that fail to connect together and produce an engaging or coherent whole. Which is unfortunate for the film in itself, because it's not as clever as it thinks it is and it's easy to see a lot of it coming from a mile off. There's some well written characters and in one of his better performances, Gere cuts a sympathetic figure as the timid, world weary cop on the edge of retirement and there's intense stuff from Cheadle and Hawke in their respective roles. Snipes makes some impact in his first big screen role in ages, but it's as if Fuqua has been cautious with his presence, giving him only very limited screen time. The whole thing feels as if it's taking forever as well, and at 132 minutes is rather, shall we say, overlong. A good idea on script that turns out all or nothing on screen. Training Day it ain't. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another good cop vs bad cop from director Fuqua</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua is rapidly heading into my top 10 directors list and this is another fine example of his talents and work. Great casting and storyline that pits the story of three N.Y.P.D officers and their different trials and tribulations that accompany this ever so thankless and emotionally pounding job that they do. Nice to see Wesley Snipes back on the big screen considering the last movie he made that made it and not directly to video was Blade Trinity. Its so sad to see a major star like Snipes career take a downward spiral as his has in the last 5-6 years, so i hope he gets better jobs in the future. A highly underrated actor to say the least. One of the cops is portrayed by the always great Don Cheadle the other of the three being Richard Gere who has also been an enjoyable presence to watch in film. Fuqua always cooks up a great dirty cop vs good cop type story as he did in the ever so excellent Training Day and always offers a stellar cast that he uses to their fullest capabilities without wasting any of their screen time. Wouldve liked to see more of Vincent Donofrio in this film however but ill take what i can get another underrated star. Neverthought too much of Ethan Hawke who rounds out the three officers whose story is played out here up until Training Day was released and now i have a new found respect for him an actor who seems to be upping his game with every new project he works in. Over all another intense very well written project from Antoine Fuqua.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prince of the Dark Blue City meets The Departed Street Kings on Training Day, Serpico...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it had been made ten years ago, Antoine Fuqua's Brooklyn's Finest would have been a major critical hit, a box office smash, and would probably have taken home a couple of Oscars. But in 2010, after a decade of 'cops are evil' films and TV dramas largely initiated by Fuqua's own Training Day (2001), Brooklyn's Finest comes across as far too clichéd to be anything more than just another David Ayer-flavoured piece of 'popo' bashing. This is admittedly a shame, as the film features committed performances from its leads, who are in no way to blame for the predictable storyline and unimaginative roles in which they have been cast. Richard Gere turns in his best performance in years here, in a terribly hackneyed 'old timer with a week to retirement' part that channels everything from Morgan Freeman in Seven to Robert Duvall in both Colors and Falling Down. Don Cheadle plays another cop movie staple, the 'in so deep he might not be able to come back' undercover operative, terrified he is going to be found out, and strung along by uncaring and disinterested superiors; if this all sounds familiar, that's because Leonardo DiCaprio did it so much better in The Departed. As Cheadle's target, Wesley Snipes gives us a 'twenty years later' take on his Nino Brown character from New Jack City (in which he shared an almost identical relationship with an undercover cop, there Ice-T), and Will Patton takes the boss role played by in The Departed by Martin Sheen (with Ellen Barkin, obviously looking for something to get her teeth into, in the Mark Wahlberg part). Ethan Hawke, meanwhile, who played the clean-cut rookie in Training Day, here panics and sweats a lot as a worn-out narc forced to steal drugs and cash to provide for his wife and about a dozen kids. Hawke, sympathetic actor though he generally is, comes across here as impossible to relate to, saddled with a character who whines endlessly about his tiny house and terrible luck, and yet is apparently too stupid to simply buy a packet of condoms. Personally, I enjoyed Brooklyn's Finest, and viewed in isolation, Fuqua's film can be regarded as a well-acted ensemble drama; a cops-only Boogie Nights or Magnolia, as it were. But if you've seen Training Day, Dark Blue, The Departed, Street Kings, and especially TV's The Shield, you will not fail to be struck by the utter lack of originality on display here. The actors' efforts are enough to recommend that you see Brooklyn's Finest, but the screenwriter's reliance on other, better movies for inspiration may make you wish you hadn't bothered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooklyn's Finest (2010, R)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect something of the detail of "The Wire", an HBO series about urban Baltimore, you will likely come away with disappointment for "Brooklyn's Finest". Both portray the shady sides of law enforcement, but "The Wire" better immerses you in the city underworld from the viewpoint of drug dealers on the street and special investigators tracking them. It also dealt with corrupt and vigilante police, politics, unions, education, and more. The TV series format gave it sufficient time to give you an insider look at the city environment and the main characters. "Brooklyn's Finest" only has time for three individual cops, which it follows as independent vignettes for most of the movie, but even with this limited focus, it still fails to make the characters serve as convincing examples of its sarcastic title.None of the three are the "finest" examples of cops. One is uninspired and 7 days from retirement (Richard Gere), one is deep undercover and wants a desk job (Don Cheadle), and one is desperate for money to support his kids and wants to rob drug dealers (Ethan Hawke). You almost want the movie to add seven more for variety, or at least include a few more criminals for another point of view. Wesley Snipes plays a recently released drug lord, but he mainly exists as a friend and associate of Tango (Don Cheadle).Ethan Hawke reunites with the director, Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day"), as one of the detectives, named Sal. But the way he lurks around on drug busts, you would think he's an outright criminal. He participates mainly to search for cash and ponder whether it's worth taking some. He supports many kids (the official website says he has 5, but it isn't clear from the movie) with twins on the way. Additionally, his moldy house is possibly harmful to his wife's asthma and their unborn children. He's desperate to get money for a down payment on a new house.Don Cheadle has a straight forward role as an undercover detective, named Tango. He goes so deep undercover, he starts to question his loyalty to the police. He wants a promotion to get off the streets, but his superiors use carrot and stick treatment (threats of criminal charges and incentives for a promotion) to coerce him to setup his friend, Caz (Wesley Snipes), who watched over him while he was in prison.The upper levels of the police chain of command are also shady in this film. It portrays them planting evidence and playing politics. But they have their limits. When a crooked police officer shoots a young student, the police crack down and start placing rookie cops in dangerous parts of the city. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a veteran with the job of training some of the newbies. But his idea of police work is to do as little as possible, keep the car windows rolled up, and avoid making arrests outside his precinct. Both his rookies don't have a chance in this city. They are idealists and want to make a difference.Eddie's flaws are an addiction to prostitution and frequent thoughts of suicide. Even a bad guy, who helps run a sex slave business, recognizes Eddie's face from the frequent visits he makes around town. However, the plot seems to get very thin the closer it gets to the third act and Eddie doesn't seem nearly as interesting as the other two lead characters. He seems the most contrived of the three, but none of them feel thoroughly developed, perhaps because they don't clearly relate to a central message or because they aren't convincing as people making difficult moral choices. The choices become as subtle as a massive shootout and as a series of dramatic acts of madness that seem to come out of nowhere.But it starts out with high potential. In an interesting discussion between Sal (Ethan Hawke) and an informant, Carlo (Vincent D'Onofrio), we hear a lengthy story about a judge who let a suspect go by finding his actions "righter" than they were "wrong", suggesting degrees of lawfulness and rightness. Most of the movie is shot in the shadows with limited light, giving the actors half lit faces to reinforce the moral ambiguity the cops experience and the extreme situations they face daily.Are the moral choices these characters make difficult in their situations? Tango (Don Cheadle) is an excellent undercover cop before he goes way out of bounds. Perhaps corruption in his chain of command pushed him to such extremes, but it's difficult to get a sense of his decision with so little coverage of his character. Sal's actions are so over the top, you want to check him into a psych ward. With the manic way he acts, he appears a bit more crazy and self-destructive than intended probably. Can't he get a sanitary house for his wife he can afford? Are his problems mostly self-caused with the way the plot unfolds? It's almost as if he wants to create difficult moral choices for himself, or, perhaps, he subconsciously wants his wife to collect the $100,000 life insurance he's worth if he dies.The movie lacks a common thread to link its story together into a pleasing whole, and it lacks the sort of detail and pulse pounding plots regularly seen in "The Wire" (you might notice a few cast members from that show in minor roles). "Brooklyn's Finest" would likewise be better as a TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, with great acting from Gere, Cheadle &amp; Hawke (I think it's his best role so far). Snipes wasn't bad at all either. Music is fantastic, keeping the tempo perfectly with director's pace. It's not just another "cops movie", that's for sure. We get to understand much more the people in similar position, people with real pressing problems. People with ruined psychology and nothing to hold on to. People whose lives are destroyed and don't know how to come back.I really liked that not all of them died in the end. Killing them all is the easy way, I prefer endings where this is not used easily. The only thing I didn't like was the ending "freezing" in actor's face. A simple fade-out would be much better and I wonder why a director like this chose this "silly" in my opinion way. Nevertheless this is no big deal.All in all, it's a classic in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-observed but inconsequential urban morality-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antoine Fuqua here reproduces the solid form of Training Day, constructing an exciting thriller with a muddied moral centre. He's particularly hot on the look and feel of the hoods-in-frame, a nasty at- ease-with-their-ill bunch. He's helped by a number of actors still radiating role-heat from the Baltimore forge that was The Wire. The inevitable Michael K Williams is excellent and matched by Hassan Johson, for all of the brief opportunity he has on the bigger screen.Fuqua has bigger aspirations though and this is where he falls down. The film is a three-way morality play where good men who stray pay heavily but the soiled can find redemption. Deaths are rendered in randomly arty fashion, as if Fuqua is trying to invoke the closing shot of Antonioni's The Passenger, but to no purpose. There's more moral resolution in Herzog's recent 'Bad Lieutenant' and this is because the German director built the arguments into the rest of the film. Fuqua has given us verismo urbanity but little to deserve a grand ethical statement. Don Cheadle is notable above all other leads, otherwise the picture's disposable. 5/10</fullReview>

Come on, killing more drug dealers is not the way to go! And then how does Tango manage to get a penthouse on his police salary? This movie, besides having a lot of blood splatter, shows us paradigms of financial management and mismanagement. Eddie? He coulda and shoulda loaded his weapon with more bullets as he was following the sex slave transport van. Then instead of seeing a nicely staged fight (showing off how fit Richard Gere is), we'd have some more splattering as he emptied his revolver into the big guy. Still, the movie is gripping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excuse for gratuitous violence and sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of watching this movie, I realized what it really was--Antoine Fuqua's excuse for gratuitous violence and sex. Yep, that's pretty much all it was. With a choppy, poorly-developed plot and criminally poor characterization and utilization of some of the best actors in the business, that's pretty much all this movie could be, and I refuse to believe Fuqua meant it to be much more than a vehicle for him to get his pre-pubescent jollies off with a lot of "gore and 'hore," if you will. This predictable film was clearly Fuqua's attempt to mesh his own 'Training Day' with Scorcese's 'Departed,' filled with dirty cops and a tale in which almost everyone dies in the end. How original!--not. Spare me.My 6 rating is more a hat-tip to the superb actors in this film who tried their darndest to make it resemble something "clever" from a director who is clearly lacking in the clever department. None of the characters are really fleshed through well, but to the extent that there is nuance, Hawke's. Cheadle's and Snipes' characters offer much more than does Richard Gere's. Gere's character was probably the most blah character he's ever played--and should never play again. And I'm assuming he's the "star" of the picture...which is the problem. When the "star" of the film has the most forgettable role, it's a problem.And when the plot is disjointed with all kinds of dots disconnected, even when the inevitable "showdown" between the main characters occurs in the end, it's a problem. Before long, you realize this story never really had a chance. Clearly, not much effort went into the story; it could not have been the director's focus, else it wouldn't be so lacking...which circles back around to what was the focus.Blood and killing and too-long sex scenes. That's what you will get when you see this film. If that's your thing--and judging by the high IMDb rating, it's a lot of folks' thing--then this is your movie. If, however, you are looking to be challenged and surprised and transformed, my apologies.Not a horrible film, but not Oscar worthy by any stretch of the imagination. Pay for your 10-buck movie ticket at your own risk. Don't say you were not warned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a generous six out of ten. I don't understand why it's getting an upper 7. IMDb viewers are more reliable than movie critics, so I went to see it based on the 8 that the IMDb community had given it at the time. I wasted 2 tickets and my date never called me back again! I'm not much of a movie critic, but my rating usually follows the norm when it comes to action movies. What makes an action movie a 7 or above is our connection to the characters. This movie had none of that. Ethan Hawke's character wasn't developed, and you didn't care if he or Cheadie lived or died. Richard Genre was even more miserable in his performance. I wanted him to die first so that the other two actors could get more movie time since Genre was as depressing to watch as his character acted.Don't see this movie! I haven't seen the new Matt Damon movie, but if I were someone who wants to see an action movie, I'd take a gamble on that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one viciously brutal movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) The story revolves around three New York police officers over one week. Eddie is a patrolman played by Richard Gere who only has 7 days left before he can pull the pin and retire. Eddie has seen it all, and he has become so disenchanted with life that he must find some reason each day not to blow his own brains out. Undercover cop Tango played by Don Cheadle has been on the streets too long, causing him to protect Caz (Wesley Snipes) the drug kingpin target he is out to catch. Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a narcotics cop who is under tremendous pressure to provide a healthy home for his pregnant wife and two children. This stress from home and the temptation of all that drug money at his job is causing him to jump back and forth from being a good cop to a bad cop. In the end, all three police officers will eventually come together.(My Comment) Overall, this is one viciously brutal movie. It delivers the worst side of life and the people who must combat it. Set in the gritty neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York, the film shares with the audience the violence, the crime, and the sex trade on these streets. You can see why some of this badness may rub off on these three police officers over time. Under these rough circumstances, it is sometimes hard to distinguish between right and wrong. What is unusual is that all of the characters in this film are not necessarily good people. You may connect with some of them, but others you don't care about and you are happy to see them taken out. These three cops have very different lives that connect to each other in a final bloodbath. The dramatic performance of all of the major actors (Gere, Cheadle, and Hawke) individually was fantastic. However, this bloody cop drama is a little depressing. (Overture Films, Run Time 2:13, Rated R)(6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This realistic crime drama revolves around three police officers - undercover agent with moral dilemma, crooked father of a small flock stealing drug money and a retiring coward seemingly unprepared for any heroic deeds.You are offered with a vision of weak and internally fragmented Police that generates frustration amongst its officers. They are underpaid, entangled in games that go beyond their paygrade and down-to-earth after long, unproductive service. Such picture generates anxiety in its own right, however soon becomes significantly smothered by clichéd character models. The solid performances in three leading roles literally make these clichés even more pronounced.The second major complain is that the storyline seems flat and develops very slowly. When the climax is finally about to arrive, it's ridiculously pseudo-dramatic, predictable and disaoppointing.Overall solid effort, but won't blow you away with its dynamics or story.</fullReview>

There is never a kicker, there is never a reason why these three men are the most significant. They don't meet until they end up in the same place at the same time coincidentally at the end of the movie.With a good cast, you'd think that the film wouldn't have been so horrendous, but it is. Ethan Hawke's accent doesn't work out, Richard Gere seems to be highly bored until he gets to raise his voice, the only one who seems to do what he can with the material is Don Cheadle, but he is constantly dishing out lines such as: "these streets have an expiration date on 'em." And the worst part of the film is... it is so cliché! Everything! You got your retiring cop who wants to go through with one more rescue mission, you got your corrupt cop who wants to steal money to help his family, and you got your undercover cop who is trying to be convincing as a gangster.Please, just don't waste your time.</fullReview>

And they all are at the top of their game. Of course you might expect something different (or not), when you watch this. Maybe a different sort of conclusion/ending, but I do think that it works very good as it is.

		<fullReview>There's a bit of Jim Davis from Harsh Times in Ethan Hawke's Sal. But while David Ayer's (superior) film was carried to its conclusion ably by a wild, fearless central performance, Michael C Martin's script keeps deviating to less interesting characters played by less interesting actors, like Richard Gere's burnt out Eddie. Gere still exudes that strangely boring aura. Heck, he looks indifferent even when he's undergoing fellatio, so why we should care I don't know.A 'Best Of' package of clichés still makes for a cliché, and Fuqua's film has the lot: the aforementioned burn-out; the undercover cop wanting out (an unconvincing Don Cheadle); the gang boss with a heart (an impressive, unrecognisable Wesley Snipes). There's even a drug scene with White Rabbit playing in the background.Fuqua simply cannot resist making his monsters alluring. Hawke's performance is at once remarkable; snivelling ad desperate. But in the final act, with his leathers, his prayers, and a loving bit of lighting, he ends up looking like Travis Bickle in a remake of Taxi Driver directed by Robert Rodriguez.There are good cameos (Vincent D'Onofrio) and bad cameos (Ellen Barkin), and there are cameos that remind you that all this stuff was covered much more effectively in TV's The Wire (Michael K Williams). But there are none to dispel the feeling that this is nothing but a flashy, starry, unnecessary retread of heavily-trodden themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Training Day" director Antoine Fuqua's new bullet-riddled NYPD thriller "Brooklyn's Finest" suffers from too much irony. Three seasoned New York City policemen struggle against forces beyond their control to ensure their survival, promote the prosperity of their family, or live by code of loyalty. Indeed, this gritty urban shoot'em up, starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes, recycles the usual inventory of clichés about the boys-in-blue both on and off the beat. The origins of multi-storied police procedurals like "Brooklyn's Finest" can be traced to either those post-Watergate, Joseph Wambaugh-inspired law and order street epics, such as director Richard Fleischer's "The New Centurions" (1972) and director Robert Aldritch's "The Choirboys" (1977) or director Sidney Lumet's police yarns, including "The Anderson Tapes" (1970), "Serpico" (1973), and "Prince of the City" (1981) Predictable, disillusioning, even humorless, this Overture Films release manages to surpass earlier convoluted cop dramas such as "Pride &amp; Glory" (2008) with William Norton and "We Own the Night" (2007) with Mark Wahlberg. Not only do the protagonists in "Brooklyn's Finest" radiate minimal charisma, but also the cops in supporting roles appear nothing less than incompetent. One guns down a fellow cop by mistake. A rookie cop dies in the line-of-duty and other rookie botches an arrest and kills an African-American youth. While he musters enough momentum to keep this 125 minute cops versus drug dealers saga crackling along at a brisk clip, Fuqua cannot compensate for "Sleeper Cell" scenarist Michael C. Martin's lackluster narrative that delivers virtually no surprises. Mind you, there are a couple of jolts that will catch you off guard, but good as they are they do not salvage this film. Worse, parts of "Brooklyn's Finest" emerge as incoherent, and Fuqua never gives us a chance to warm up to the characters. This is not the kind of cop movie that lures in recruits. Technically, this proficiently produced chronicle about crime busters in the Big Apple paints law enforcement in ignoble colors."Brooklyn's Finest" chronicles the lives of three NYPD cops. The action opens with Sal (Ethan Hawke of "Training Day") chatting one evening with a criminal, Carlo (Vincent D'Onofrio of "Full Metal Jacket"), in a sedan near a cemetery. We learn Sal is an overworked, underpaid tactical narcotics cop with a growing Catholic family. Not only does he have three children, but also his asthmatic wife, Angela (Lili Taylor of "High Fidelity"), who is suffering from wood mold, is pregnant with twins. Worse, Sal's house is too small for his brood and he is struggling on a cop's salary to make ends meet. Of course, the ends don't meet for Sal and he turns to crime. He kills gangsters for their illicit money and he ponders taking money from drug busts, but his misguided, well-intentioned partner tries to get him not to. Sal is desperately trying to come up with enough cash to get his family into a bigger house. White-haired Eddie (Richard Gere of "Internal Affairs") awakens in bed alone at the start of a new day and practices suicide by jamming his service revolver into his mouth. He is seven days away from retirement and universally reviled by members of his own department because he has descended into the depths of alcoholism. Eddie does his best to keep out of action. He has been beating the mean streets of Brooklyn so long that he has lost his desire to be a cop. He finds himself stuck with mentoring rookie cops and he cannot stand their enthusiasm or their inexperience. Finally, Tango (Don Cheadle of "Traitor") is an undercover narcotics officer who is separated from his wife. Tango has been undercover so long that he is beginning to think like a mobster. He pleads with his liaison, Lt. Bill Hobarts (Will Patton of "The Fourth Kind"), to take him off the streets. In fact, Tango served a stretch in prison as an undercover cop and bonded with a big-time gangster Caz (Wesley Snipes of "Blade: Trinity") with whom he sympathizes because the gangster has been given so many wrong deals. The upper echelon want to arrest Caz and send him back to jail and they call on Tango to inform on the man who saved his life while in prison. Tango refuses to help them, especially a tough-as-nail female cop, Agent Smith (Ellen Barkin of "Ocean's Thirteen"), who is prepared to exhaust every possibility to put Caz back behind bars and perhaps even worse.Director Antoine Fuqua and scenarist Michael C. Martin carefully build the pressure with which these cops have to contend. Ironically, these guys run into each other occasionally during the action, but they are not acquainted with each other in any way. For example, Eddie and a rookie cop are entering a store when Tango emerges. They nudge each other and you can see Tango's hackles rise. Tango is so messed up that he contemplates killing a couple of New Jersey State Troopers in one scene. Eddie struggles with the two rookie cops that he trains to stay calm under pressure, but they cannot control themselves. Like Tango, Sal has gone too far and searches for opportunities to take advantage of drug dealers, gun them down, and appropriate their cash, but he never seems to be able to acquire enough cash to buy his dream house. Unfortunately, when the pressure cooker of tension explodes in the last quarter hour, audiences get no relief and little closure from the outcome. Fuqua and Martin spent more time moralizing about the fate of these three than entertaining us with snappy action scenes. Ironically, everything works out, like the initial dialogue between Carlo and Sal about the warped way that wrongs making rights and rights making wrongs. What little closure "Brooklyn's Finest" provides at fade-out is not enough to make you feel good. Instead, this handsomely produced, atmospheric, well-acted cop drama brings you down more often than it gives you a boost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Training Day", but still a great movie with terrific performances and a good storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Brooklyn's Finest.The film is a crime/drama about three intertwining stories of police officers in Brooklyn, New York.It stars Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes.The first story features Ethan Hawke, a family man and police officer who has about 4 kids and is expecting twins.He does not have much money so he decides to start killing drug dealers and stealing their drug money.But how long can he keep it up before he gets caught or killed? The second story features Don Cheadle, a cop who has been undercover in the drug trade for quite some time, and he wants out.However, he does form a bond with one of the drug dealers(Wesley Snipes).The third story features Richard Gere, an old police officer who is about to retire.He is an alcoholic who does not care about his job.When he finds out that a missing girl has become a prostitute who works for some violent pimps, he decides to save her.The performances are very good.It was interesting to see Ethan Hawke, who played a straight-laced rookie cop in Training Day, to play a somewhat corrupt cop in this film.This film is also Wesley Snipes first theatrically released film since 2004.He plays a drug dealer though definitely not as crazy as the dealer he played in "New Jack City".Brooklyn's Finest was an interesting and entertaining crime/drama and if you like the genre, then you should definitely check this film out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Slow and Gory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to watch this movie for free last night. I paid too much.This movie is just dreadfully awful. The cast is great, but it is impossible to care about any of these characters, so when they die you simply don't care. The director seemed intent on making LONG panoramic shots persistently throughout the movie, so even if you cared about the plot, you had to wait for these senseless, slow-motion shots. Not good for what's supposed to be a thriller.The acting of all the characters was sub-par. And the constant switching between the characters never gave you a chance to get into who they were or their problems.This movie could have been a decent one-time 80 minute DVD, at over 2 hours it's pure torture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about 3 cops that are doing their own thing. I thought it would eventually tie all 3 together, but it didn't. The stories stayed separate. Richard Gere plays a cop about to retire. He never was really heroic and played it safe. After giving up the badge, he tries one last attempt to do something that matters by saving 3 young girls. Ethan Hawke plays a cop with money issues. He has a large family with twins on the way and he can't afford a new house. So, he's the corrupt story as he tries to steel some drug money. And Don Cheadle plays an undercover cop whom wants a desk job. He's asked to do one last task and that is to get evidence against a drug dealer that saved his life and is his friend. Something happens that prevents him from having to turn on his friend, but then he wants revenge afterwards.I thought the acting was pretty good and all 3 stories were entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: A decent cop movie, I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crash + Training Day + Pretty Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story: "Crash"-style story with many characters that should meet at some point and resolve the plot. "Training Day"-style story where there is always a good cop and a bad cop and if they work alone they do the good cop/bad cop routine by themselves. "Pretty Woman" comes to mind when one character (guess who) falls in love with a prostitute and tries to save another one that is forced into prostitution.The acting: Don Cheadle (Crash) is doing a great job. Wesley Snipes is just as good. Ethan Hawke (Training Day) struggles a little but does a good job in the end. Nobody told Richard Gere (Pretty Woman) this is not another Pretty Woman sequel. Ellen Barkin's cameo is a big mistake. On the other hand, Vincent D'Onofrio's is very good. The rest of the cast do a great job supporting the stars.While the movie is totally overrated it's not as bad as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Im all for a good cop movie, I love them...usually. But this movie was not one of my faves. This movie is full of profanity and vulgar and lude "adult" acts. The first hr or so was very slow and confusing, so much so that people began to WALK OUT of the theater. I was contemplating that myself, then BAM all of a sudden the movie FINALLY picks up and gets good. You really get to see and understand the different personas of each "bad cop" and you begin to understand why they behave the way they do and the different struggles they deal with in their own lives. I gave this movie a 6 because it wasn't great but it is watchable...after the first hour or so. To me it was a combination of Training Day and Pride and Glory with a very very very heavy urban influence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>R-rated television without the intended progress. A microcosm of urban decay and insanity as seen through the eyes of three Brooklyn cops: Richard Gere as a burnt-out veteran of twenty-two years on the force and ready for retirement; Don Cheadle, undercover in the projects, who will do almost anything for a desk job; and Ethan Hawke as a financially-tapped family man whose low paychecks and grueling drug-den raids have tempted him into taking street money. The screenplay by Michael C. Martin takes an unusual and potentially fascinating tack by following these characters separately up until the final showdown, though in the film's opening stages a good twenty minutes passes by before anything involves the audience. Director Antoine Fuqua seems to relish the cross-cutting in the narrative--and, certainly, it is this episodic lay-out of the story which sets "Brooklyn's Finest" apart from the cops-&amp;-crooks set-up we usually see on TV--but only Gere's section of the picture has any drive. Cheadle's hothead tends to bounce off the walls without allowing us more than a passing glance into his off-duty personality or lifestyle (he lives in a spacious, empty apartment and keeps photos of his ex-wife in a safe-box). Hawke has it even worse; whether flying off the handle or moping about like an unshaven corpse, the actor has the kind of role which can be completely summed up in just a few words (and his actions in the finale don't make a lot of sense). This type of one-dimensional character writing can sometimes get by if the performances or surrounding minutia are gripping enough, but Hawke's family life and poker night with the guys seem like clichés lifted from other movies. In fact, there's even a faint overlay of "Taxi Driver" at the conclusion, but Fugua mounts the proceedings with intensity here and the film ends on a somber, thoughtful note. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuqua does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was completely blown away by this. It was everything I wanted and so much more. Just about everything was fantastic about this movie. Acting, music, realism, etc...Director Antoine Fuqua has explored this territory before with Training Day. That was a tale of corruption and greed set in Los Angeles. Now he trades L.A. for New York and the result is even better. Fuqua learns from his mistakes in Training Day and crafts another one of the top 3 cop movies I've seen. Working off an awesome script written by 1st time writer Michael C. Martin (a former NY transit worker), everything came together perfectly. Starting with the cast which includes big names Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke, Don Cheadle, &amp; Wesley Snipes. Snipes is decent, but doesn't have enough screen time to really flesh out his character. Gere, Hawke, &amp; Cheadle on the other hand all give fantastic performances. Each of them fleshes out their characters completely and makes us as the audience really believe that they are these people and we feel for them. All of the supporting actors are very good as well, including the city of Brooklyn which is another supporting actor in itself. The areas which this movie were shot in really provided a lot of realism and grit that I believe it really needed to work as well as it did. Kudos to everyone involved.Now I believe that if this is not better than Training Day or The Departed, then it's at least right up there with them in the upper echelon of cop movies.It's my favorite movie of 2010 so far and it's gonna be really tough finding something that can beat it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I really enjoyed most of the movie.But it all fell apart at the end, REALLY BADLY! During the movie people are shot and KILLED with one or two bullets to the torso. Wesley Snipes character dies from a couple of shots to the torso. But in the end, a guy is shot in his chest (right next to his heart), yet is able to almost beat up Richard Gere's character. STUPID!! Ethan Hawk's character ends up getting shot in the back while emptying a drug dealers fake washing machine, full of money. Who the hell would go into a drug dealers apartment, kill the guys in the money stash apartment and NOT be wary of others coming to see why there where gun shots. Just plain STUPID!! Don Cheadle's Character gets shot in the back two times by a fellow officer. If I'm not mistaken, it is standard practice of a law enforcer to give a warning to an individual before they open fire so long as individual isn't pointing or shooting at the officer. But in this movie it seems to be okay to shoot someone in the back, VERY WEIRD!! Up until the end I was really enjoying the movie, but it ended as a RIDICULOUSLY STUPID movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest a very well thought out, character driven, cop thriller. with standout performances by Ethan Hawke and Richard Gere, a good comeback turn by Wesley Snipers, who i would've like to have seen more of, but left you wanting more(in a good way), Don Cheadle was good as well, but i felt that his performance was a bit underplayed through out, if another actor had played the role they would've brought out more flair (possibly Terrence Howard).Director Antoine Fuqoa does and amazing job by weaving in and out of the three stories involving (Gere,Hawke,Cheadle) and showing Hollywood that he should be honored more for his work.In some ways it reminds me of L.A.Confidental, but where this differs from with that movie is that the three main leads here have little to no scenes. which doesn't hurt the movie at all.The final act of the movie is where all three stories somewhat come together one way or another and is played out strongly.The movie is gritty, violent, and very truthful with what not only with what goes on out on the streets(gangs,drugs,hookers, but also with how police officers deal with day to day living as a cop(undercover cop,underpaid, rookie life, retirement,family, everything in between.Go out and support one of the best picture's so far this year.I must add that this movie is not for young teens or little kids, even though their were a few at the showing i went to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not one to compare, however when the trailer shows that this is the same director as Training Day you have to. Ethan Hawke is in both movies, and they both are in some ways about crooked cops. The reason I gave this movie a 5 is strictly based upon the acting of Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle. Without them this movie wouldn't have been anything good to watch. Richard Gere gave a good performance as well, but he didn't really stand out much.This movie was so disappointing. The script at times was awkward, and the character development on Gere's role was pathetic. Also the climax of the movie was a very cheesy way to end a movie such as this, and it seemed at some points that movie dragged on when it didn't need to. A two hour and thirteen minute movie could have been an hour and forty five but at times it just kept going for no reason.Overall the acting was very good, however the script did not do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible movie, which would have been better served as a HBO teledrama. Good to see Snipes at it again, but his mediorce cameo only added to the woefulness of this movie. Don Cheadle plays your undercover cop (Tango), whose been so long undercover he doesn't know he is or what side he's on anymore. Wesley Snipes plays his long time friend, a drug-lord (recently released from prison) named Caz. Tango is assigned to bring Caz and his drug empire to justice. But Tango refuses his employer's instructions and decides that his friendship to Caz is worth more than his career. Gere is a cop with a bad record, struggling with his own existence. He's on the edge of retirement, no one wants to work with him and every now and again sleeps with a Latino hooker. Ethan Hawke is really the only bad cop. In order to provide for his wife and kids, robs and kills drug dealers and puts the money towards a new house, because the on he currently lives has wood mould which makes his wife sick, as she is expecting twins. Now, Training Day was a great film as was Magnolia. Put the two together and you get this mess. Why Fuqua decided to make a movie about of three New York policemen whose lives become intertwined, is beyond me? A horrible script and a boring story but with some good performances. Richard Gere was good in his role and made me feel sympathetic towards his character. Don Cheadle was poor and unconvincing as Tango and looked uncomfortable the whole time. Constantly nervous and looking over his shoulder in practically every scene. Great actor but not in this film. Ethan Hawke offered nothing new to his role. It's the kind of performance we would expect from him. Lots of intensity and little else. Snipes did nothing special with his character. Would've better if Nino Brown came back to life. As I said it's good to see him amongst such esteemed actors, but I think his days in DVD hell will last a little longer. Both Ellen Barkin and Will Patton offer solid support as the cops trying to keep Tango focused on his undercover work. All in all as a movie, it's all about choices and the choices will make in life. Bad choices with good intentions are always bad choices, whether our intentions are good or not. That and also remembering the consequences for our actions can be severe. Fuqua needs to go back to the drawing board for me. I struggled to find anything that made this movie memorable or unique. One Good Cop was a great film with a good cast and a simple story. This however is an art-house cop thriller, which maybe if Spike Lee was at the helm, might have made this a better movie. Expect to find this in you DVD bargain basket come May! AVOID!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest aka Ravalaaru is an awful movie, with a thin story. The only reason for casting Snipes in the movie is the comedy relief. Cheadle's role is even worse and he hardly has anything to do. (It's intriguing to see why a young boy would agree to act as the father of a 35 year old actor!!!) Lousy story.. frivolous characters.. sudden duets.. all of these leave the viewer wondering when the movie is going to end, and not how. Considering that even Marcelo Zarvos's songs are bad, there really is nothing that could keep you in your seat till the end.The only thing tolerable in the movie is Cheadle's performance - he has put in effort to portray different characters, and he has done it quite reasonably well.If you have the patience to sit through this movie, do listen carefully to the last dialogue in the movie. It is the only indicator to why the movie was named 'Brooklyn's Finest' in the first place.Verdict - it really is awful. Please don't try to watch it except if you are an Richard Gere fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene this film was disgusting. If you enjoy seeing the absolute worst side of human behavior compiled into a movie, this one if for you. I actually went to the theater to see another movie and they had a problem with the film and gave us the option of picking another movie or getting a free pass to come back. I regretted not taking the free pass for a later film even though I would have to drive 60 miles to use it but sat through this entire propaganda piece about the corruption of police departments.Technically the film was well done but unlike many movie goers today I am not excited by demonstrations of the darkest side of evil in humanity. I was shocked to see parents with children under 6 watching this film and not leaving after the first five minutes. I can't imagine why they wanted their children to see this film. Maybe they want them to grow up hating police officers. The concept that Richard Gere's character would grow a conscience after he retires was ridiculous.Don't waste your money unless you have a desire to get depressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Hollywood's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brooklyn's Finest is not Hollywood's; it is a bloody cop drama that imitates in the broadest way the fragmented stories of Crash with less coherence, less social value, and less literary merit. Finest is the real crash.Three cops have three very different lives that intersect in the bloodbath so common in the denouement of thriller police stories. Eddie (Richard Gere) is one week from retirement (big cop cliché) with lonely longing for his absent wife and affection for a prostitute. (The clichéd ending to this segment is hard to believe). Tango (Don Cheadle) is undercover but forced to decide to advance corruption or be loyal to the hoods he has infiltrated. Sal (Ethan Hawke) needs a new home for his burgeoning family.As these troubled officers move through their violent world, they mostly beat up people, steal their money, dirty or not, and murder others. No more, no less.I'm going to rest now in the hope that when I return to the keyboard, I have been inspired by some dream muse to find art in this seemingly idiotic story.I'm back, and I see the review is nicer than it should be. I'll not change it in the hope that you'll see it and point out the charms of Brooklyn's Finest that eluded me.</fullReview>
