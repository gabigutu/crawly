		<shortDescription>The Real Best Film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dazzlingly complex film, `Traffic' takes a hard, unflinching look at the so-called `war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture -- the users, the dealers, the police, and the politicians -- and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand. In terms of story, direction, and characters, `Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years, period.`Traffic' takes a look at the world of drugs through the stories and lives of different characters. Some are loosely connected to one another; some are not. There is the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican policeman struggling to keep his distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; there is the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to turn the low-level drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against his drug cartel boss; there's the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the unsuspecting wife of the drug cartel boss who suddenly learns who her husband really is and what he does for a living; and then there's the new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so wrapped up in his mission to stop the war on drug, he fails to notice that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack. Much like in the real world, the events of each story directly or indirectly affect the events of the others, leaving all the characters to consider their roles in the drug culture . . . and what, if anything, they can do to change those roles.In terms of story, `Traffic' is absolutely brilliant. I'm still amazed that the film could cover so many plotlines and dozens of characters so effortlessly. Each story -- whether it's Helena assuming the role of her drug-dealing husband, or Robert canceling DEA meetings so he can deal with his drug-addicted daughter -- is powerful and brutally honest. `Traffic' isn't afraid to look at tough or uncomfortable issues. `Traffic', somewhat surprisingly, never preaches, either -- while it's safe to say that the message of the film is essentially anti-drug, it never comes out and outright says that message. A lesser film would've had some grandiose speech imbedded somewhere in the film denouncing the use of drugs -- not `Traffic'. It's wise enough to let the viewer take what messages they want from the film, without ever preaching. (A minor quibble -- did Michael Douglas' character really have to be the new drug czar of the United States? The fact that he was the top law enforcement drug official in the U.S., and that his daughter was addicted to drug . . . well, it seemed a little too far-fetched, and a little too movie-like. If Mr. Douglas had been playing ONE of the top drug officials in the federal government, instead of THE top official, I would've found his character to be infinitely more believable.)Soderbergh's also at the top of his game with his direction of `Traffic'. The film is virtually filmed entirely with hand-held camera, giving each and every scene an up-close-and-personal feel. There's also a distinct lack of background music, which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on real-life scenes, and not just watching a movie. These techniques make for a very personal, intense experience. Soderbergh also uses a technique he's used in some of his other films (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich) -- certain scenes are filtered a specific color, to heighten a mood or a sense of awareness of what's about to happen. The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier, for example, are all filmed in a very bright, almost disorienting yellow. It's a technique that can be irritating at times, but for the most part, it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.As for the characters, and the acting . . . jeez, `Traffic' is without a doubt one of the best-cast films of all time. I mean it. There are no weak links, no poorly written characters, and no badly played characters. Each and every character adds something significant to the story in `Traffic', and each and every actor is outstanding. Kudos must go to possibly one of the best ensemble casts of all time. Three actors in particular stand out, though -- Benicio Del Toro (who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance), Don Cheadle (who was actually slightly better than the brilliant performance of Mr. Del Toro, IMHO), and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I'm normally loathe to use the word `flawless' when describing a film, but the casting of `Traffic' was indeed flawless.`Traffic', with its unflinching look at drug use in America today, can be uncomfortable at times to watch. It certainly can't be termed a `happy' or a `feel-good' film. That doesn't change the fact that it is an amazing, thought-provoking, powerful film -- and without a doubt the best film released in the year 2000. I can't recommend this film enough.

		<fullReview>No compromises here. Traffic takes a long, hard look at the narcotics industry in North America and manages to entertain at the same time. The triple plot allows you to see the whole industry with multiple perspectives. The movie is visually stunning, loved the different filters for the three locations.That the war on drugs cannot be won, and is hypocritical to boot, is a message that needs as much air-time as it can get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's best film is a thrilling ride...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll, demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. He's been America's most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade, and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost, it's a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s, when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than he's ever done before, bouncing several characters and plot-lines against and off each other, so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking, this is not an "issues" movie per se. Instead, it's a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. What's most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich, there's a graceful absence of self-importance and bombast in the presentation. However, this doesn't mean the film lacks a strong point of view.Stylistically, this film represents a major breakthrough. Soderbergh shot the film himself (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) and Traffic takes all of his past experiments with color, available light, and hand-held work light-years beyond The Limey and Out of Sight. He has created a brilliant style that could best characterized as expressionistic naturalism. His loose hand-held style lends the film an extremely spontaneous realistic tone, but the modifications of color amplify the drama. Each storyline has its own distinct look that accentuates the emotions underlining the film. (The Mexico story involving Benicio Del Toro is told in earthy saturated yellows, the story of Michael Douglas and his daughter Erika Christensen is told in an aquarium blue, while the Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman-Don Cheadle story gets a natural available light look). In addition to being visually striking and cool in a completely unpretentious manner, Soderbergh's camera technique transcends mere virtuosity and actually becomes another character in the film. As usual with Soderbergh, the film is edited with musical verve and skill, where time is collapsed and expanded, and characters are seen reflecting on past actions.I've been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world, he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta-Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically great, acting's great, the whole damn thing's great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It certainly has been a good 12 months for director Stephen Soderbergh, hasn't it? Erin Brockovich, probably the most underrated film of last year, eventually got the recognition Soderbergh, Roberts +Co deserved, as did this film, a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure, and this is quite evident here, telling the story of a new US drug control officer (Michael Douglas) whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict (Erika Christensen). It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose husband is facing a conviction, and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout, speaking in tones, very believable tones, and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico, as a behind-the-scenes nightmare world of seediness, humidity (you can almost FEEL the heat) and as a place where one murder matters not, is handled excellently, Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard, which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length (2 ? hours) is maintained, and while at times it borders on arty, it is done thoughtfully, incisively and effectively, the scenes of importance delivered in tense, muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's (Benicio Del Toro) character and personality is both strong and incredibly well-acted - the quiet, thick skinned yet razor-sharp mind suiting his environment perfectly, and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film, for example in creating the tense, unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages, namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us, particularly in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is, it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways, and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich', where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life, and the movie cliché of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newly-instated drugs officer (Michael Douglas) fighting drugs on two fronts: the Mexican Border and his own home, as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted, I can't put my finger on a single bad performance, but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all, then, a great film, combining good acting, clever psychological undertones and classy direction, which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy, modern style which he has brought to the movies today - this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge, understanding and talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic delivers a powerful message with impeccable flair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim. Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies. It's no wonder, either, as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.Traffic takes on the complex issues involved with the war on drugs in the United States and Mexico from the view of these nations as a whole to the very personal level. In the film, three stories unfold to illustrate the near impossibility of ever stopping the drug trade, despite the billion dollars that the US spends each year for just that cause. While the tales are related, the characters rarely, if ever, cross paths with one another. This is one of the elements that allows Soderbergh to deliver his message so effectively.The first story features Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez. A cop in Baja, Mexico, he enforces the law and allows the wheels to be greased from time to time. After pulling off a huge drug bust on the Juarez drug cartel, the powerful General Salazar swoops in to confiscate all of the drugs and the credit. Later, Javier and his partner are recruited by Salazar to fight the war on drugs by aiding him in bringing down the Obregon cartel that has plagued Tijuana for some time.Meanwhile, back in the States, Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) of the Ohio Supreme Court is about to be appointed by the President as the nation's new leader in the drug war. For the judge, the drug war is about to become more personal than he could ever have imagined.In San Diego, Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) are two federal agents perpetrating a drug bust on a slimy drug supplier named Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer). The events that follow lead them up the drug food chain to Carlos Ayala, a well-to-do suburban man who has been smuggling illegal drugs into the country from Mexico. His arrest leaves his pregnant wife, Helena (Katherine Zeta-Jones, who was really pregnant during the film), to fend for herself while taking care of their son, court costs, and a $3 million dollar debt to the drug lords in Mexico.Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow. By the films end, matters are not neatly wrapped up; there is not a fairy tale ending. This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie. Furthermore, the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal, ensemble cast. Zeta-Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film. Don Cheadle is superb in his role. Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter. Topher Grace (of TV's That 70's Show) is excellent as her upper-class, druggie boyfriend. Dennis Quid's character, while played adequately, is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses, neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry, grainy, shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation. Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn, comforting blue. Zeta-Jones' story is filmed without the use of lenses, suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy, Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000, surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture, Erin Brokovich. Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end, the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long, uphill battle, but it is better than no battle at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sodebergh Binge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, I'm on a full Sodebergh binge. I've been crazy about him ever since "King of The Hill" and he, very rarely, lets me down. I couldn't say that about many people including siblings and lovers. "Traffic" is not a departure for Sodebergh, all of his films are. He is an artist with a golden touch. He can travel through opposing universes with amazing ease. In "Traffic" the universe is uncomfortable, muddy, almost ugly and yet, it fascinates and attracts with the power of a magic magnet. Benicio del Toro and Erika Christensen are the two inhabitants of this peculiar universe that get under your skin and carry with you as if they were part of a personal experience. No, not if. They do, they are, they become part of a personal experience. The film allows you that. It makes you learn without preaching. How many films today manage that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the year, but not worthy of ALL of its praise. ***1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRAFFIC / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four) "Traffic" caught some of the most gratifying praise in the year 2000. Does the production live up to its expectations? To some extent. It is not a movie to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon, nor is it an "entertaining" popcorn extravaganza. "Traffic" is one of the best films of the year, but it is not a movie for everyone. I had my fair share of disappointments, and I think many audiences will walk away unsatisfied by its documentary-like style and unusual structure. "Traffic" is still a great achievement in filmmaking and visual style-worthy of some, but not quite all, of its great acclamation. The movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, won Oscar nominations for both of his movies last year: "Erin Brockovich" starring Julia Roberts, and this epic about the never ending war on drugs. That first film is entertaining and charming, but this is far more complex in its story. There are actually three separate plots here, the first detailing two Tijuana cops (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) who find themselves in the middle of a corrupt police force, working for Gereal Arturo Salazar (Thomas Milian), Mexico's top drug aggressor who wants to shut down the Tijuana drug cartel by capturing a notorious assassin (Clifton Collins Jr.). The second story has Michael Douglas as a conservative Ohio State Supreme Court Judge turned nation's new drug czar. He has a savage job, as we can see, but it is even more difficult being the father of a 16-year-old daughter (Erika Christensen), who gets straight A's in school, but uses heavy drugs and eventually prostitutes herself for them when the supply runs low. Amy Irving plays her mother whom herself tried every kind of drug in the market when she was young and thinks her daughter should be given more freedom in this area of maturing. Her husband strongly disagrees. The third story is a bit more complicated, dealing with the reactions of a typical pregnant homemaker, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), when she finds out her husband, Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), is not an executive, but a high-powered drug lord. He is taken into custody when undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luiz Guzman) crack a disreputable drug cartel led by Juan Orbergon (Benjamin Bratt). Helena, with the help from her attorney (Dennis Quaid), must deal with the pressures by her husband's demanding enemies, as well as the DEA. Miguel Ferrer plays the middle-run drug dealer who is captured by the DEA agents and wants immunity for testifying against the high-powered bosses for whom he works. "Traffic" does not have the harrowing, compassionate, hard-to-watch tone that "Requiem for a Dream" had earlier last year, which also contained three different although parallel stories. That film depicted drug use as personal success followed by desolation and punishment. "Traffic" doesn't really make drugs personal, although the plot featuring Michael Douglas' drug addicted daughter touches on the idea, and the actors do a good job of making the character's attitudes hit home, but the film is more about the war on drugs within America as a country, and how it is a battle not likely to be won anytime soon. The picture does not capture the feeling of the characters like "Requiem for a Dream" did with its highly elaborate styles and camera effects. "Traffic" just isn't as emotionally profound as the much more worthy "Requiem for a Dream." Steven Soderbergh does manage to capture an inciting style with grainy, high contrast photography exploring the atmosphere of Mexico. He pays attention to even the smallest scenes. Take a scene where the Benicio De Toro character encounters a young married couple who complain about their stolen car. Many directors would have left this scene on the editing tables, or paid less courtesy to it because it is not as important as many other scenes. He gets the right mood, confusion of the characters, all while furthering the development of De Toro's character. Each individual scene here is interesting on its own merit.  A top notch cast contributes superb performances in "Traffic." We expect and receive good performances from actors like Michael Douglas, Amy Irving, Dennis Quaid, Benicio Del Toro, and Albert Finney, but there are also some newcomers who shine with their material, including Erika Christensen and Topher Gracer. The actors really hold our attention, and with a running time of nearly 150 minutes, that is imperative. This film is greatly constructed and perfectly cast-it is the kind of movie in which you walk out of the theater wanting to discuss your opinions about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best american film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is an incredible movie. The director, Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape, out of sight, erin brockovich, etc...) has created a film that combines elements of Hollywood and independent filmmaking. On one hand, he has created an epic that has a very wide scope and has used some famous Hollywood actors. On the other hand, as the cameraman for the film, he has shot it with a handheld camera and and makes the film visually very different from traditional films. He presents the drug war in the United States from three perspectives. The first is of a police officer (superbly played by Benicio del Toro)in Tijuana struggling with the difficult situations that such a job creates in the center of drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the wife of the leader of a drug cartel in San Diego who gets arrested. Once naive about his business, she takes charge of the operations. The third story deals with the appointment of conservative Ohio Supreme Court justice Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas, to the post of drug czar. This occurs while his daughter Caroline, portrayed emotionally by Erika Christensen starts descending into a world of drugs thanks to her boyfriend Seth Abrahams. (Topher Grace from "That 70's Show" plays Seth) These three stories are distinguishable visually. The Tijuana story is shot with different tones of yellow, giving everything that goes on in the story a feel similar to that of a hot desert. The San Diego story has warm soft colors, representing Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta Jones' character) once peaceful social soccer mom life. Finally, Cincinatti and Washington, D.C., the cities where the story of the drug czar takes place is shot in a cold blue, giving it an emotionless feel. Despite the importance of the visuals, what makes this film that much better is the fact that Soderbergh does not moralize. There is not an anti-drug stance but there is also not a strong advocacy of legalization. Traffic shows a problem with no current solution. The viewer has to decide for himself. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh splashes colors with the dash and power of a Jackson Pollock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic (2000)Like an abstract expressionist master, Steven Soderbergh stands in the center of a canvas that stretches from Cincinnati to Tijuana. He mixes materials and splashes colors with the dash and power of a Jackson Pollock. His materials are skillful acting, lively editing, a dynamic music score, and an unflinching camera. (He did his own lensing, under a pseudonym). The artist's aim? To paint a picture of our country's drug problem.Scripted by Stephen Gaghan, "Traffic" has its roots in a 1989 British television mini-series, "Traffik," which followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. There are three loosely related stories, each with its own color coding--and as with Pollock, there is nothing random about where the paint splashes upon the canvas.Blue hues bathe blue bloods in Cincinnati where an Ohio Supreme Court Justice (Michael Douglas) is flattered into taking a job as national drug czar, just as his bright young daughter (Erika Christensen) is seduced into addiction by her prep-school friends.A rich golden-yellow surrounds San Diego where a comely couple (Catherine Zeta-Jones and Steven Bauer) occupy the upper links of the drug chain and spend ill-gotten cash on clothes, cars and country clubs. They are pursued by two undercover cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) who spend most of their screen time cooped up in a surveillance van.In Mexico, a washed-out, burnished brown bespatters a desert of desperation as two Baja policemen (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) pull off a major drug bust only to be themselves busted, by a sinister general (Tomas Milian) who notifies them that 'I will take over from here.' Each color signifies its own impenetrable culture, and when Douglas crosses into Mexico to meet his counterpart, we know (but he doesn't) that his fellow drug czar is really a drug lord.The performances were exceptional, especially considering that no one was given star treatment. Much of the film was shot with existing light and Soderbergh kept the composition wide, letting the actors create their own space. Douglas was surprisingly believable as the would-be czar and bookends an Oscar-worthy year with his scruffy professor in the earlier "Wonder Boys." His real-life wife, Zeta-Jones (carrying their child), gave a quite credible performance as a society snob who turns ruthless when her status is threatened.Other stand-outs include Christensen's drugged-out daughter, Del Toro's street smart Mexican cop and Cheadle's dedicated drug buster. In fact, there was not a weak performance in the bunch, including crucial cameos by veterans Peter Riegert and Albert Finney. Real people even play roles: Douglas's fictional drug czar confers with real-life senator Orrin Hatch, while actual customs officials relate their day-to-day drug enforcement dilemmas.Each of the three stories ends with a glimmer of hope. But despite small battles being won, the film's verdict is that the larger war is plainly being lost. As if on cue, White House Director of Drug Policy, Barry McCaffrey, has resigned effective January 6, 2001. The real-life outgoing czar, a former general, has become a vocal supporter of increased funding for treatment programs.Like Pollock, Soderbergh continues to stretch the boundaries of his art, as he did a dozen years ago with "sex, lies, and videotape," and more recently with the undervalued "The Limey." "Erin Brockovich" though fairly conventional by his standards, nevertheless completes a year any director would envy.Rating: 3 1/2 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Steven Soderbergh's latest film, "Traffic," covers the US/Mexican War on Drugs-specifically, cocaine-from several different angles. Three separate but interconnected storylines show dealers, users, cops, smugglers, lawyers, government officials-everyone but the South American growers.We get to hear the arguments on all sides and see the impacts on many people's lives-innocent, guilty, and everywhere in between. But in an early scene when Erika Christensen takes her first hit of freebase, the look of sheer bliss on her face sends the message that this war is already lost. As long as something can give people this kind of high, they won't care about how much it costs them and not all the laws and governments on Earth will keep it from getting to them.The cast is large, full of good actors in juicy roles-Michael Douglas, Benecio Del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Miguel Ferrer, to name a few. Newcomers Christensen and Topher Grace stand out as spoiled teenage cokeheads. And if you look carefully, you can spot brief appearances by Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, James Brolin, and Benjamin Bratt. There are also cameos at a cocktail party by a real-life governor and five senators, at least one of whom (Orrin Hatch) has since denounced the film.Each storyline is photographed in a different style-all shot by Soderbergh himself, with a hand-held camera, under the pseudonym Peter Andrews. Cincinnati and Washington are blue, hard, and cold; Mexico is overexposed, dusty, and brown-filtered; and San Diego is warm and soft-focused. At times I thought the jerky camera movement and jump cut editing started to get pretentiously artsy and distracting, but the story and the characters always pulled me back in.The script by Stephen Gaghan-based on a 1990 British TV miniseries-may use situations and character types familiar to us from years of TV cop shows and other movies, but Soderbergh and the cast make them seem fresh and exciting again. For a change, style and substance work together, not against each other. It was like when I saw DePalma's "Scarface" or the series "Miami Vice" for the first time.The only time my credulity was challenged was when drug czar Douglas went looking for his addict daughter in the worst-and apparently all-black-part of Cincinnati, kicking down doors and threatening an armed dealer himself. The guy's supposed to be a popular, hard-nosed, law-and-order judge. Surely he could've found some sympathetic cops to handle the rough stuff for him. This, for me, was the only scene where the movie took a turn for the stupid. And, to the film's credit, this stupid behavior almost gets Douglas killed.Soderbergh got my attention three years ago with "Out of Sight" and knocked me out again last year with "Erin Brockovich". He fully deserves all the nominations and awards he's been getting lately. &gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film-making, acted out brilliantly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a fantastic movie. Let's start with saying that.I just got back from seeing it, and it certainly rates as one of the best story-based drama's I've ever seen. Being a big fan of movies with different storylines overlapping (as Magnolia) I was highly anticipating this movie. And of course the big oscar nominations and the prizes it already won made it even more desirable.It didn't let me down one bit. The different story's were all excellent. Being that the mexican one was in my opinion the best one. Especially Benicio Del Toro (remember him in Fear and Loathing in Las vegas, the BEST drugs movie ever) being absolutely brilliant. But also the storyline involving Michael Douglas with his problems dealing with a daughter on drugs (well acted out by newcomer Erika Christensen) is remarkable. The topic drugs is clearly highly talked about especially in the United States, and this is actually the first movie which shows all aspects of it. The dealing and smuggling, the addiction, the risks of being a narcotics agent and the political point of view. It's hard to find a film that's so complete, everyone will feel connected to one of the storylines because everyone deals with or has dealt with drugs before, even if it's just a one time mariuhana use. That's why this movie will appeal to a very large crowd.Anyway when you look at the flaws then maybe some will say that it takes too long, or that some of the scenes are a bit slow. But does everything go fastpaced in real life? It just tries to sketch a realistic view of handling with drugs. And maybe there isn't a lot of action going on, but that's not the goal of the movie.The only thing I found when watching the movie was that the switching between movielines happened a little too often. I'd preferred if it stayed with one story a little longer. Just a tiny flaw that I personally noted.Traffic is a film that has to sink in, when you start to think about it it just gets better and better. I can't wait for the official release here in Holland, so that I can see it again.Oscar for Del Toro in any case !!!!!! And throw in an oscar for best film too. It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but one enormous flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a conservative judge appointed to head US drug policy, intertwined with sub-plots involving his own daughter's drug-taking and the criminals actually producing narcotics at the other end, with a sub-plot of an initially innocent woman gradually taking over her husband's drug business. Most people seem to think this film is great. The reason I don't is because I've just seen the European version of Traffic, a TV movie made a year earlier, and it is SO much better. It's impossible not to make comparisons. Michael Douglas is excellent as always in the lead character and so was Peter Reigert (wasted in a small role) but that's about it. If only Catherine Zeta-Jones' talent could match her ambition. Her Welsh/South American accent is laughable. The worst aspect of this film is the superficial "Disneyesque" way it deals with Douglas' daughter's drug-taking. It's a joke. We don't see anything "nasty" and at the end she simply comes back to Daddy and gives up drugs. The Euro version really does show the filth and the squalor and the utter despair of a junkie as the young Oxford student drops out and descends into a life of thievery and prostitution to feed her habit. SO much more convincing. I'm annoyed by this movie because it was made later than the European version and had a much higher budget so it should have been better, and it simply isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie further sustains the fact that no matter what role Douglas plays(with the exception of Falling Down), Douglas acts exactly the same. Its just like the same person with a different name and occupation. His facial expressions for every situation is the same, his actions and reaction for every role, every emotion, every situation that his character faces in every movie is the same. He is Steven Seagull without a pony-tail.The movie is incredibly over-rated. The direction of Steven Soderberg is grossly over-rated. This movie's plot is too simple, too weak, predictable and too straight forward. There are minor plot curves but like I said they are minor and also few and far between. A general conception of this movie after I watched it and looked at the big picture was to put in as simple a way as possible,(which is fitting for such a simple movie) is that is was "JUST PLAIN BORING". Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas does nothing in this movie. You could of put anybody in that role. The only good out of this movie was the superior acting of Don Cheadle. He is the only person in this lack-luster cast that shines. Which makes me sick to think that it was nominated for a best-movie Oscar. Much worse is the fact that it won best director.4.5 out of 10- very very ordinary</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an ugly story but still fascinating to watch, at least once. I'm not sure about more than twice, at least from my experience. It's too much of a downer to enjoy regularly but I do recommend a minimum of one viewing for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.Like him or not, Michael Douglas usually plays interesting roles and this is no exception. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his role but I don't know why. He wasn't anything that special. Personally, I liked Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in here better with the latter adding some much-needed humor to the film. Miguel Ferrer was also intense as the bad guy, "Eduardo Ruiz." The two kids who played Douglas's daughter and her boyfriend (Erika Christensen and Topher Grace, respectively), received no billing on the back on the DVD but they had major roles. They must have done a good job because they really irritated me. Man, I wanted to slap those annoying punks! The girl's descent into drug hell was not pleasant to view. This is not an easy story to watch, or comprehend everything that's going on. It also is not one with a happy message.On the plus side, the visuals were great with many all-sepia toned scenes, or all blue. Scenes changed every two minutes to a different ongoing. You had to really pay attention but I never found myself drifting away from the story. It isn't just the unique visuals; it's an interesting and disturbing story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start my saying that this movie was terrible. If I could go back in time, I would have rather watched Anaconda in French with Spanish subtitles than watch this movie, and I don't speak French or Spanish.I attribute all the praise and acclaim this film received to typical Hollywood BS. The acting in this movie, except for Benicio del Toro who was wonderful, was TERRIBLE. The screenplay for this movie was TERRIBLE. Anybody with a crayon and a piece of paper could have written better dialog than the trash that comes out of these character's mouths. The message in this movie, however blatantly ridiculous it was, was TERRIBLE.On the plus side, the movie did finally come to an end, although it took nearly 3 hours to get there. This reminds me, I just noticed that this film is one of Amazon.com's Top-Selling DVD's. Maybe I am just crazy but that's a lot of people paying way too much for something that amounts to a drink coaster.Well enough about the good things in the film, I'm going to go watch Requiem For A Dream again just so I can remember what a real movie about drugs is like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie has a decent message but unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have several issues with Traffic. 1) The idea that Catherine Zeta-Jones' character could get away with murder is not believable. There are several things that make this impossible. First, the killer she hired she was talking to her on the phone seconds before the car blew up. Clearly, there will be an investigation on the Federal Agent's death which would reveal that the last person the killer talked to was Catherine Zeta-Jones. 2) When the snitch actually does get killed, his security was a joke. You tell me you are going to let some guy serve him breakfast, who you don't even know who he is. People clearly wanted the snitch dead. Also, why is Don Cheadle's character protecting him? Isn't that the US Marshal's job? The snitch shot at Don Cheadle and Don Cheadle shot the snitch. So clearly they aren't going to make Don Cheadle the snitches protection. 2) At the end of the movie, Don Cheadle puts a bug underneath Catherine Zeta-Jones' table. As the movie had shown earlier, the house was already bugged. So what would that even matter. It was obvious that the bugs didn't help anything because they knew that the house was bugged. There were things throughout the entire movie that I found far fetched. I could keep going, but I would be here forever. I don't even want to start on Michael Douglas' character and his daughter.The one line of the movie that I actually liked was when the snitch was talking to Don Cheadle and told him that essentially he works for the drug lords too since all he is doing is helping the Juarez cartel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving, informative and unbiased look at the drug problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mexico Officer Javier Rodriquez Rodriquez is stuck in the middel of a country where the drug dealers and the police work hand in hand and murder is rife. In the USA the head of one of the cartels Javier is trying to close is taken to court by the DEA who have an informant (Eduardo Ruiz) in the custody of Agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro, leaving his wife, Helena, to take care of his business. Over all this a new drug czar is appointed who begins to find that the war on drugs is not as simple as it seems and that it is a war raged in his own home.Based on the channel 4 series Traffik this is an open-minded intelligent look at the war on drugs. Looking at the problem across several interlinking stories allows us to hear everyone's side ? to see the internal problems in Mexico, to see the futility of the DEA's actions even to see the scope of the problem facing the US political machine as it tries to fight a war against the drugs trade on all sides. The stories are told with out over doing it ? action happens without pomp or fanfare, explosions happen in silence, killings are brutal, swift and final. This is not an action movie. The thoughtful nature means the film moves slowly and, if you're not used to following stories then it may frustrate you. However those wishing something to get you thinking, during and after the film should be rewarded.The film is intelligent far beyond the subject matter. The direction and editing is perfect. The scenes in Mexico are all yellow and washed out ? giving a desolate feeling, the scenes in political America are given a blue hue to give a colder, detached feel to the business while the scenes with the DEA are noticeably bright and realistic. This is typical of the intelligence put into the film ? it rewards you the more you watch it. The casting is another example of how right the film is.Del Toro is perfect ? he gets the moodiness spot on but also has a fun side to his character. Cheadle and Guzman are as good as they always are and play off each other well ? they have an element of the `buddy cop' couple without becoming caricatures. Douglas is really good ? how often can you say that!? His young wife is also very good ? I expected her to be the weak link but she gave a good performance. These are the main players but really the cast is deep in quality from those that have bigger roles (Quaid, Bratt, Miguel Ferrer) to those that essentially have only a few lines (Albert Finney, Peter Riegert).The strength of the film is that it lets you work it out yourself. It never goes one way or the other on the drugs issue and leaves you to decide for yourself what should happen. This is rare in an `issue' film and it should be commended. The film allows long silences for us to think but yet is never boring or dull.Overall this is a really good film. It is shorter and more polished than the mini-series it came from, but it is very intelligently done and is though-provoking. Anyone who thinks they are sure of their stance on drugs should watch this ? no matter what you think this will highlight the fact that it is a complex problem to which there is no simple solution. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not your usual thoughtless rubbish. Excellent storyline which I won't spoil. Brilliant cast, particularly like the cop duo of Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, boy does he have an eye for a good script. He also has an eye for a good woman...Catherine Zeta Jones is rather good in it also. Benicio Del Toro got all the praise he deserved for this film. It is what I like to call a "well screwed together" film. By that I mean all the storyline points have maximum effect due to the quality of acting, music and cinematography. Great use of Brian Eno's music, and effective use of colour filtering to convey mood. Just watch it and be absorbed.Edit (After having watched the TV Mini-series on which it is based)I say based but it is mostly a straight copy apart from the Mexico/Pakistan parallel. Whilst my comments about visuals and style still stand, less credit should go to Soderbergh. I'm still a big fan of his but the scope and variety of plot lines and characters come directly from the mini-series.In conclusion, the film is the series compressed and stylised into a nice bitesized Hollywood chunk. Well done to the teams that produced both film and series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre and unchallenging film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film which looks amazing, but lacks substance. That is quite odd, considering the fact that this is a film which wants to be deep and carefully tries to avoid clichéd Hollywood storytelling. Of course, thanks to "Crash" and Inarritu's films the 'interlocking drama' has now become a cliché, and perhaps looking at this film seven years later after seeing all the films it has influenced lends it a disadvantage. "Traffic" tells three stories, one of a politician in the US who is hired to head the war on drugs and has a drug addicted daughter, one of a trophy wife who attempts to save her jailed husband's drug business, and one of a corrupt Mexican cop who struggles with his conscience after discovering that his boss may not be the ardent anti-drug official he thought he was.The problem with "Traffic" is that it is played 100% safe. It does not take risks. In the 90's Soderbergh made challenging and articulate films in a wide variety of styles, and they were all far better than this one. When making "Traffic", Soderbergh made a crucial mistake with the casting. Two of the blandest and least interesting actors in Hollywood are featured here, and in prominent and dramatically important roles- Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Their performances here are awful in the sense that they are firmly average and lacking in any flair. Zeta-Jones is incapable of any emotion in any performance I've seen her in. Here she is asked to play a complex and fairly interesting (yet poorly developed) character and she goes through the entire film without one moment of acting which isn't wooden. I have long ago decided that Michael Douglas plays every role the same. He just isn't convincing here, at all. Too bad he didn't inherit any of his father's talent. It was absolutely crucial that this film be well acted, but these two actors are detrimental to its success. It feels phony. At least the dependable Benicio Del Toro (nearly) saves the film with his powerhouse performance. The main issue I have with "Traffic", however, isn't even the acting, it's the screenplay. An Oscar winning screenplay, nonetheless. I don't think it resolves its various stories well enough and I don't think just about ANY of the dialog was interesting. It's too worried about being politically correct and about addressing the issue at hand to bother being a good screenplay. "Traffic" is Oscar bait. A safe drama which hammers its point home over and over... and over. There's a shot nearly at the end of the film which pretty much summarizes everything that's wrong with this. Don Cheadle's character plants a bug underneath a table in a house, something we see clearly. A few seconds later, we see the bug AGAIN. This film assumes that its audience is less than intelligent. All that said, "Traffic" is a visually good film. The production design, crucial to telling stories in several vastly different locations, is excellent. The photography is excellent and innovative (use of different lenses adds atmosphere to the film). The camera is always in the right place at the right time, capturing events perfectly without being too distracting. The score compliments the film very well. This film is well-made but it is empty. It manages, in nearly three hours, to say nothing and offend nobody. It's good technical film-making, but other than that, offers nothing. It wants to be a big statement on drugs and drug policies but it fails miserably. It's not even the best movie made about drugs in its year. Looking into the 90's we find Danny Boyle's masterpiece "Trainspotting". The 80's? Well, there was a terrific British miniseries on "Masterpiece Theatre" called "Traffik" which was the inspiration for this film, but far stronger in a narrative and dramatic sense. 2.5/5</fullReview>

Traffic was a catalogue of self-indulgence and affectation, with cardboard off-the-shelf characters and a plot could have come straight from Ronald Reagan's propaganda machine in the 80's.Far too many plot and character opportunities were wasted - particularly with regard to Michael Douglas's home life. Here, the movie chooses a 'safe', familiar, and ultimately insulting and naive route of depicting a brilliant young girl turned bad as a result of evil nasty DRUGS!It reminded me of Kroger Babb's "public information" exploitation movies in the post-Hayes Code Carny days. Check out "Reefer Madness" or "She Shoulda Said No" - no less complex in its commentary than Traffic, methinks. But we have no problem identifying these works as the crap that they are. Perhaps if Kroger Babb had kept is camera handheld, shot half the movie in Spanish, and given the finished print an over-exposed sepia wash...The idea of constructing a narrative from unrelated plot threads is intriguing but hardly new (I actually liked "Honky Tonk Freeway"). However, none of Traffic's plotlines go anywhere, hold my interest or make any attempt to parallel one another.In short, I found Traffic naive and preachy with nothing to recommend it. This is, however, one of those rare movies that manages to be insulting in its badness.</fullReview>

Traffic DIRECTLY steals from the English predecessor. The dissolving statues. The hit with the poison in the eggs. The drug "czar"'s daughter becoming an addict. However, the English version is VERY detailed in the descriptions of the drug manufacture and smuggling of heroine.

Nancy Reagan would be proud of this film. Never have the media-hyped fears of the white patriarchy been so well captured on the screen. (WARNING: SEMI-SPOILER APPROACHING) For example the film fallaciously implies that the only place a rich, young, white girl can find drugs is in a poor, African-American neighborhood. With people-of-color only drug dealers and a visual aesthetic that renders Mexico as a burning hell-hole, the film also offers a distinctly racist point of view. This film is sexist too. Feminist film-theorist Laura Mulvey would have a field day with how this film offers the young white girl as the primary victim and reason for fighting the war on drugs. Furthermore, the performances are only partially believable with the exception of Benicio Del Toro who is truly amazing. His performance is the film's ONLY redeeming quality. He should be offered an Oscar.</fullReview>

They explain that "To a wise man, it is obviously a beautiful suit of clothes, but to a fool it is totally invisible". The emperor "Not wanting to appear a fool" proceeds to ooh and ahh about the non-existent clothing and a vicious cycle continues until almost the whole city is convinced the Emperor is parading down the street in his wondrous new wardrobe when he is in fact completely stark naked.What does this have to do with the movie Traffic you ask? Well, an attack of "The Emperor's New Clothes" syndrome is the only rational explanation I can possible proffer to solve the perplexing riddle that is the popularity of this movie.The critics, rating as they do based on artistic elements and the fine equasions that go into what they deem to be "quality cinema", loved the movie, and Joe Public, "Not wanting to appear a fool" is convinced they are watching a cinematic marvel, when in fact they are watching three hours of cinema which rivals a perpetually looped stock-market report for sheer enthrallment value.Traffic came and went from Australian cinemas in the space of two weeks. Almost everyone I have spoken to found it mind numbingly terrible. The two friends who accompanied my to this film wanted to leave after two hours and I didn't argue - we were outta there.I'm curious to know how the film is mostly rated 9 and 10 here, but around half of the comments come from people offering similar sentiments to myself.I may not know cinema-art, but I know what I like and quite frankly Traffic aint it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a complete mess. It did not connect the various stories beyond the fact that drugs was the common theme. Everyone knows that drugs come into a country and are then distributed. Furthermore, the attempt to shot the film in various spots as a semi- documentary was a horrendous failure. This film held no interest and the use of the colour blue in scenes involving the judge (Sheen) was a completely useless. The filmmakers should have study the works of Bava, and Fulci to learn a thing or two about use of colour to create an effect. Finally, the story revolving around the judge's daughter was plain stupid and full of cliches. The ending to this film was fitting it was as stupid as the rest of the film. Avoid this film. * out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Oscar Winner of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The qualities of a great film are intelligent direction, breath-taking cinematography, a well-written script, and powerful acting. Traffic has none of these.Traffic is easily the poorest excuse for a film ever nominated for an Academy Award.How is it that so many have been duped by this sham movie? It appeals to the masses because it manages, in three hours, to say nothing and offend no one. Does anyone honestly think that a movie that has speaking cameos by both Barbara Boxer and Orrin Hatch could be saying anything controversial? Only a middle-of-the-road, fence-riding, piece of trash like Traffic could manage that.This movie is as realistic as the worst after-school special. Not only are there better episodes of Miami Vice, I've seen more feasible plot lines in soap operas. A rich, white girl on cocaine and heroin who manages to get all A's in a private school, be a member of six billion school clubs, and do volunteer work all while keeping everyone but her druggie friends in the dark. A married couple has a serious (apparently ongoing) argument about their only child and a few days later both say nothing more than, "I'm sorry," and then Presto! turn into SuperCouple. A pregnant housewife who is upstanding citizen one moment and smuggling drug lord the next. In short, this movie has not one believable plot line or character. Not even the great Benicio del Toro could make his character powerful. If he stands out in this film it's only because everyone and everything else is so bad. His perfomance is a diamond in a dung heap.There isn't a single line of memorable dialogue in this entire film. The characters speak in cliches. (The alcoholic at the AA meeting saying, "At least I don't have to eat from a dumpster today.")I could go on and on about this poor excuse for a film, but I haven't the space. I have given this film a rating of 1 because it is the ultimate example of mediocrity. Any film that is three hours of mind-numbing mediocrity is worse than a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing has changed as of 2015 in the so-called "War on Drugs" as it relates to the streets of Nogales, Sonora, where much of this tale was actually Filmed on the pretext it was Tijuana. There are still two main cartels that control production and distribution, two parts of a community divided by an ugly and ineffectual fence, and two faces on people directly involved in a farcical but deadly struggle to maintain sanity in the face of a community psychosis. At the moment, for example, the current police comandantes and their hirelings are extorting every peso they can get their hands on before the next political machine is swept into power by a disgruntled electorate who know, sadly, that it will only result in a new batch of uniformed hoodlums. "Traffic" only scratched the surface of the ongoing problem in 2000, and we are left with no better filmed drama today.The problem of this film, now and when it was produced, is that it is a series of vignettes rather than tightly constructed narrative. The viewer is left with no central notion of why it was made, and for what purpose. The main characters played by Del Toro and Cheadle grasp at thin air when it comes to defining themselves as other than (a) a guy who likes seeing happy kids at play in a safe environment and (b) a guy who wants to exact revenge for his friend's death. Neither carries a moral standard for the story (if there is one). The character played by Michael Douglas has even less on which to base his one-dimensional purpose: to save his daughter from drug addiction. Not exactly the stuff of high intellectual drama. What a shame neither country has yet rid itself of a mental health malady that continues to shape life-or-death issues, preferring instead to seek political solutions backed up by brute force. A movie made today on these same streets employing the same kinds of people could make that point as this one has not.</fullReview>

I must admit that some of the filming teachings were interesting and gave some scenes more atmosphere--the geography of the whole story made it a lot better too. The cast was good ;most of it were into their characters-both main and others (especielly Benicio Del Toro ,Michael Douglas ,and Erika Christensen)--and most of the characters were human and had interesting developments during the movie. The movie was sometimes too messy with sub plots and it was pretty long too ,but the whole thing was good with a message and deep characters which wasn't really predictable nor limited ;it was about a thing that most movies just don't touch this aspect of everyday life.</fullReview>

Writing liberties are taken, once going too far, but the point is that you have to push boundaries in these discussions. The combination of brutal honesty, teenage speeches, Beltway hypocrisy, the futility of the current U.S. Government direction, the hope brought on by living one day at a time make this the best picture to ask the question "what can we do about the culture of drug abuse in the U.S.?"

		<fullReview>Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow. By the films end, matters are not neatly wrapped up; there is not a fairy tale ending. This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie. Furthermore, the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal, ensemble cast. Zeta-Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film. Don Cheadle is superb in his role. Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter. Topher Grace (of TV's That 70's Show) is excellent as her upper-class, druggie boyfriend. Dennis Quid's character, while played adequately, is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses, neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry, grainy, shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation. Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn, comforting blue. Zeta-Jones' story is filmed without the use of lenses, suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy, Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000, surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture, Erin Brokovich. Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end, the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long, uphill battle, but it is better than no battle at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world, he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta-Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is something as utterly unusual as a film that actually presents a complex subject as, well, just that. There are no easy answers to the problem of drugs, and this acknowledges that fact. The opening scene begins a trend within this picture that goes on until the end credits start rolling; that of credibly conveying powerful points that cannot be ignored on the issue, as well as covering so many areas of it. This holds next to no manipulation. The plot is interesting, engaging and well-told. Each of story-line is treated with a tint appropriate to its tone. This works impeccably well. All acting performance are spot-on and flawless. The dialog is excellent and marvelously delivered. Everyone is perfectly cast. I don't know a lot about Christensen, but she is beyond reproach here, and I intend to keep an eye out for her in the future. This is the most compelling I've seen Topher Grace be. The pacing is swift without being overwhelming, so the running time passes by fast, without ever losing the audience. As a thriller, this is exciting and intelligent. Editing is razor-sharp, and the cinematography is magnificent, the hand-held camera is used to great effect, and not excessively. Apart from obviously featuring and dealing with narcotics, this contains plentiful strong language, moderate sexuality and disturbing content. The DVD holds four trailers(for this, The Gift, The Watcher and Rat Race), production notes, a photo gallery and B-Roll footage. This deserves all four Oscars that were awarded. I recommend this to anyone mature enough. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>preceding "Syriana"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, Stephen Gaghan directed and Steven Soderbergh produced "Syriana", about everything that has resulted from US involvement in the Middle East. We might say that they preceded that movie with "Traffic", about the futility of the drug wars and how the whole trade affects various people.The movie starts off by showing Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro, who won Best Supporting Actor); he and his partner travel around the northern part of the country looking for drug smugglers. Then, we get introduced to Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), soon to get appointed drug czar of the United States, but unaware of something shocking. And then, San Diego feds Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) have to bust drug smuggler Carlos Ayala (Miguel Ferrer), leaving his pregnant wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) with no one.I will say that the movie isn't perfect. It misses the chance to focus on the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking over the years. Moreover, all the Mexico scenes are filmed in sepia; are we to infer that our southern neighbor is nothing but a drug-infested cesspool? But anyway, the movie does a very good job taking a grim look at everything associated with the drug wars. The aforementioned cast members do a very good job, as do Dennis Quaid, Amy Irving, Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (Sens. Don Nickles, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley also appear). I do recommend this movie, despite it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troublesome awareness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is all true: the film structure, with three interweaving plots, the dialogs, reduced to the absolute minimum, the way the movie has been shot ? all that contributes to its status of a masterpiece in cinematography. If someone says it is boring, I'd like to reply: it is so condensed with the content, that if you have enough gray cells under your skull, they will not stop working even for a second during the perception of the film.Personally, the film has overwhelmed me. It was a short peep into another world ? the world of which existence it would be more convenient not to know. Not that I hadn't, before I watched the movie. Perhaps I was more absent-minded on that theme. The film's documentary-like quality made me feel, even more than think, that while I eat my meals, look after my family, sleep or work, somewhere in the world the whole death-machine runs non-stop. Some young girl with their whole life in front of her prostitutes herself for two centimeters of heroin, some driver's palms sweat when he crosses the frontier with drugs hidden in his car, someone falls out of the game with a single shot in his forehead, maybe having wetted his pants out of fear before he died. And, first of all, the money and power continues fluctuating, both between the prominent ones ? the drug-businessmen, who tenderly love their children, and between the marginalized ? the people who, through drugs in that or another way, get their own piece of power and control. E.g. the black people ("black" emphasized, to stress their marginal position) successful at dealing the drugs to white students, thus getting back the sense of domination they wouldn't have been able to attain in the white-privileged society by any other means.So, even now, someone is getting stoned, maybe for the last time in his or her life. I cannot say if this consciousness is going to carry me from the sense of powerlessness to any sort of a constructive counter-action. As you are reading this, I know that you smile and say: so idealistic, naive and banal. I don't care. A single lost life is an undeniable fact that lays some weight to my shoulders. After watching "Traffic", try as I may, I cannot shake that weight off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great picture, wrong message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artistically, this is a great picture, well worth seeing. Forget the content or the message, for now, let's just look at the picture.First, using a sepia tone for all the Mexican scenes. This was great, giving a perfect emotional tone to the moral and physical poverty that is Mexico. It was also an easy but clever way to let us know when we passed from one side of the border to the other.The shot of the helicopter landing in Mexico City ? what a great shot!!! That right there is a tour-de-force of the imagination. To make something mundane like a helicopter landing and turn it into something artistic is a small triumph, and this picture is full of such small triumphs.Shooting the picture in a semi-documentary style at times lent a powerful immediacy to many scenes.Note something you won't note while watching the film: the score. Why won't you note it? Because it is almost non-existent. Since silent pictures movie makers have used the power of music to emotionally manipulate audiences. We have heard these emotional musical cues so often we now respond to them automatically like Pavlov's dogs.But in this picture the score is almost non-existent, yet the picture is still powerfully gripping. This let's you know just how great the acting, directing, editing, casting, scripting, is. Everything that needs to go right in a film went right in this one.Now, to the message content. Many say this picture is not preachy. I must disagree. The message is nihilism. That the whole war on drugs is pointless, so why fight it? The only smart thing to do is to sell drugs, after all, the drug dealers are winning anyway. That's the message.I must disagree. If selling drugs was just a slap on the wrist misdemeanor, a little public service time, I wouldn't be writing this right now, I'd be selling drugs ? and trying to get you hooked so I'd have another steady customer. .......And you'd be doing the same thing.....instead of reading this.One personal note: I did not feel any hostility to any of the characters, good or bad. I accepted them as they were. The one character I did want to slap the crap out of was (Michael Douglas' on screen daughter) Caroline Wakefield's boyfriend, Seth. What an amoral, self satisfied, conceited, spoiled little brat. That shows what a good, well drawn character, he is; as was the social worker. But that's the strength of this movie: big character, little character, all well done. No one drops the ball.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were great admirers of the mini series in which this film is based. Written with great attention to detail by Simon Moore, it was shown on Public television. We gather it might have made an impact on director Steven Soderbergh because he directed the film version. The screen play is by Stephen Gaghan, who transfers the action from Europe to America and makes it compelling as it involves us because both the director and the writer are speaking about things we all seem to be familiar with.The drug traffic in the film is basically from Mexico into the United States. We are given a prominent family at the center of the story, the Wakefields. We also see the Ayalas, who are the kingpins of the drug operation, and then, the soldiers who are in charge of distribution to all kinds of people in all ways of life. Robert Wakefield awakens to find out his own daughter victim of an addiction, he was not aware of.Mr. Soderbergh moves his large cast well. Some of the performances are brilliant. Benicio Del Toro makes quite an impression as the corrupt Javier Rodriguez. This was a role for him to play, as we can't imagine any other young actor who could have given the part the intensity and the dimension given by Mr. Del Toro.The other surprise is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who usually doesn't play this kinds of roles. She plays the wife of the obnoxious Ayala, and she shows at the end of the film she is really in charge of the action and she is not ready to let anyone interfere with the style of life that the illegal drugs have provided her with.The rest of the cast is excellent. Michael Douglas shows rage as he discovers to what extent he and his family have been exposed because he never suspected his own daughter. Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle make some interesting contribution to the film. Amy Irving, Erika Christensen and Topher Grace are also seen in the film.This film shows Steven Soderbergh at the top of the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the half dozen best American films of the last decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Very slight spoilers] Director and cinematographer Steven Soderbergh creates in Traffic an Altmanesque narrative mosaic of epic scale and complexity. In developing its unflinching examination of the contemporary drug scene, the film takes us on a sweeping journey across a social landscape that ranges from the political drawing rooms of D.C. drug policy-makers, to the posh houses of California drug lords, to the meanest street abodes of pushers and users, and to both sides of the Mexican-American border - the putative `frontline' in the hapless, perhaps even hopeless, war on drugs.Masterfully inter-cutting among three plot lines, Soderbergh also interweaves three symbolically-suggestive cinematographic styles: a grainy, handheld, sub-titled documentary style for the Mexican scenes, a cool Conformist-like blue for many of the drug use scenes, and a `realistic' color palette for the middle-America scenes. Perhaps the film's greatest glory, though, is its extraordinary wealth of fascinating characters ? some are admirable, many are despicable or pathetic, but all are developed with incredible economy of dialogue and screen-time. Much of this success, of course, must be attributed to the casting. Michael Douglas gives an understated, highly nuanced performance as Robert Hudson Wakefield, a U.S. drug czar whose failure as an administrator opens the door for his redemption as a human being. Erika Christensen, as Wakefield's troubled, drug-addicted 16 year old, is continuously surprising and convincing.Among the Mexican characters should be mentioned not only Bernicio Del Toro's much-deserved Academy Award winning turn as a corrupt cop with an idealistic heart, but also Tomas Milian's chillingly wonderful (and under-praised) performance as Mexican General Arturo Salazar. Catherine Zeta-Jones, pregnantly (literally and figuratively) playing a drug lord's pregnant wife, is a revelation, dominating the screen in every scene she appears in. Other fine performances are turned in by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, as DEA officers, Miguel Ferrer, as a middle-manager in the drug-pushing business, and Topher Grace, as a glib high school pusher. All in all, Traffic's use of a high quality acting ensemble to choreograph and humanize the drug plot and the film's social and political themes also bears comparison with the socially-conscious Altman of Nashville and Short Cuts.Having rooted heavily for Traffic to win this year's Best Picture Award, I was pleased when a viewing of its recent DVD release only reinforced my original reaction that this was far and away the most artistically ambitious and powerful film in the Academy-nominated field, the beauty and intrigue of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon notwithstanding. I'd now go further and claim it as certainly one of the half dozen best American films of the last decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How influential will this movie be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This contains minor plot spoilers so don't read on if you haven't seen the film and want maximum surprise.)Robert Wakefield, a conservative judge, is appointed to head America's war on drugs. Some time after taking the post, Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) discovers that his own daughter, Caroline (played by Erika Christensen) is a heroin addict. Sub-plots involve the various cartels and authorities in Mexico, a high-ranking middle-class dealer in San Diego, and Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio Del Toro in an award-winning performance) who tries to do the right thing when there is no right answer.Traffic examines America's war on drugs in a thought provoking way. Extensively researched (and based to some extent on Channel Four's drug documentaries), it combines big name acting and the scope of a major movie whilst retaining many of the techniques of independent film-making - and much of its integrity.The crux of the film is the uselessness of the war against drugs, but it manages to make the point without making a sermon. This is both the film's strength and weakness: by not resorting to big speeches, larger than life characters or pulling the multi-layered plots together into a single, overpoweringly neat crescendo, Traffic convinces by osmosis, by displaying the facts and letting the audience make up its own mind. But in doing so its entertainment value is necessarily lessened, some of the characters and dialogue are underdeveloped, and it tip-toes around its conclusion (apparently that current policies simply do not, and cannot, work) with an emotionally bleak lack of commitment to any message (such as decriminalization, factual and better researched educational efforts, more treatment programs or treatment in, or instead of, prison). It never declaims its message with anger or wry bitterness but leaves the audience to find its own anger at the situation depicted. Although the subject matter has a constant note of urgency, the pace of the movie is somewhat splintered and our enjoyment is therefore largely dependent on how interesting we find the real-life dilemmas as portrayed in the film.In evaluating a film we could look at a film's value as cinema in isolation (in which case the Director's previous effort, Erin Brockovitch, for instance, is more entertaining), or look at a film because of its value outside of itself, because it makes a valuable point. Alternatively we could judge a film as good film-making because it effectively serves a purpose beyond that of cinema, because it not only makes a point but has an effect. If Traffic makes that sort of impact, if it becomes a wake-up call on drugs policy, then it may be some time after the initial release that such an impact can be judged.The war on drugs has been described as the "most unexamined conflict of our time". So is Traffic examining the conflict in a way that could influence it?The logic of the film suggests that the drug war benefits few of the people it is intended to benefit, keeps the drug cartels' businesses successful, disadvantages minorities, and generally throws money at the problem rather than analyzing it or implementing policy on the basis (for instance) of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The budget of the South American drug cartels is estimated at 200 billion dollars a year, whereas the budget expended fighting those cartels is estimated at between19 and 45 billion dollars. This means the cartels can afford the best in ensuring the drugs reach their destination and any laws are sidestepped.Laws may affect prices - not necessarily making them higher (low cost increases addiction rates) but they do not stop drugs. The stories in the movie, many of them based on real life, generally demonstrate with unnerving force that the war on drugs cannot be won, that governments refuse to admit it can't be won, that well-meaning people risk their lives trying to win it and that policy-makers are doomed and willing to repeat the same mistakes year after year.According to official figures, approximately five million people in the U.S. are addicted to drugs, only 2.1 million receive treatment, and 52,000 deaths a year are directly attributed to illegal drugs. It can be argued that the drugs war probably takes a greater toll on human lives than do the drugs.According to Michael Douglas, listening to comments at screenings, both the Drugs Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs praised the film, believing it shows how hard their job is.The film goes into some detail about how drugs are marketed and how laws are neatly avoided, watching in documentary-epic style rather than judging. The audience hypothesizes that people are denied services because of the drain on the economy occasioned by uselessly fighting a drugs war, not to mention the crossfire of associated crime. Most education efforts are still blinkered by well-meaning lies and hypocrisy and, at a time when several states in America are going for legislation to allow non-violent drug offenders to choose treatment instead of jail, Traffic tries and succeeds in countering most of the arguments for the continuation of the drugs war.Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Director Steven Soderbergh also does the filming. Various cinematic techniques support the complex interwoven and parallel stories: across the Mexican border the film is grainy and light-blasted, with frequent hand-held camera work - the Washington and inner city lighting is equally key-signatured, though less obviously. Young Christensen's drug experience as she uses crack cocaine is emphasized as the camera goes out of focus yet, like the hand-held camera, it seems appropriate rather than pretentious or ostentatious (compare this to the other anti-drugs movie released at about the same time, Requiem for a Dream, where the fancy edits are central rather than supportive.)Del Toro's performance as a Mexican policeman, Javier Rodriguez - perhaps the film's most enduring character - puts him on the map as an actor of outstanding ability. His sunken eyes and weary countenance contain a smouldering intensity that almost suggests a Puerto-Rican Humphrey Bogart. His moral disillusionment only adds to our awareness that there is no real solution or "right answer", yet his discernment is in striking contrast to the general headless and ignorant policies of the American authorities on the one hand, or the calm self-assurance of the cartels who know how easily they can outflank those authorities on the other. Rodriguez wants to believe, even in the confusing morass of double-dealing, that fair play, honour and integrity are nevertheless possible. His granite-like moral judgement is the film's most warming theme. But, like many of the characters, what he does will make little difference under the present regimes.Zeta-Jones, pregnant throughout filming, brings conviction to her part and more acting ability than I've seen in any of her previous roles. The rest of the cast all handle themselves well without hogging stage centre. The overall result, under Soderbergh's skillful direction, is an awesome movie.Soderbergh keeps us guessing what he will do next - after Sex Lies and Videotape, Out of Sight, and Erin Brockovitch, Traffic is his most ambitious and complex film to date. Soderbergh does not, himself, favour legalizing drugs, but believes addiction is a public health issue rather than a crime. The film also tends to the view that rational rather than emotive policy would bring down the crime rate and result in a safer society. Soderbergh is a well-respected director and his name somehow brings a confidence to a narrative - one commentator remarked how it was a good job he did this film before it was tackled by someone else . . . like Oliver Stone . ..Time will tell how important a landmark Traffic is. Cinematically it is a powerful and mature work that will spark off different thoughts in different viewers. It just about avoids falling between the two stools of thriller and documentary and, although its greatest weakness, this is perhaps also its most defining strength.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but I am a Republican!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas portrays the role of a judge who must now take on a pet project as a crusader for the war on drugs!! He lives in an affluent bedroom community in suburban Cincinnati, despite all his money, he can afford to ride around in something better, yet he just drives a Cadillac, and he gets snookered on Scotch, what makes me think he is a Republican? I will give you odds!!...So what is the basic political party generalization of a Republican anyway? You eat oatmeal six times a day, and your sofa and drapes match each other with that really hideous plaid pattern!!!...You don't have sex past age 32 and your kids don't do drugs, right?...That is for those Long Island Liberals who are afflicted by sociological curiosity!!....You are labeled a pro-society sap head(this word is a G-rated replacement for the real one) your daughter does not even mind this stereotype, it is just that she is bored!! Spending gobs of money at the mall no longer amuses her!! So!! as a result, her spoiled adolescent cliques all have the desire to do dangerous drugs, furthermore, this year it is in-Vogue to hate your father!!This movie has a single culprit, DRUGS!! It (this movie) evokes a potpourri of pecuniary monsters who are morally bankrupt, their only real opposition to the Mexican Drug Cartel is that they want residuals!! Other running characters include: The aging GQ attorney who is a sleaze ball, the executive housewife, who is burdened by malaise, which means she is avaricious beyond imagination, and of course. there is the pusillanimous aura of the Country Club set who exemplify the term despondence, and make it extremely lethal!! Nauseating reality persists, Law School does not make sense because of drugs and money!! The Drug Cartel has the profit numbers to put it in the Fortune 500 category, hence, it acts like a Fortune 500 Corporation!!! Irrational logic patterns of drug induced behavior lead to violent confrontations, some people get killed, but what is the real impact of such deaths? Put it this way, I just killed a mosquito!!The film "Traffic" exudes reality to an unprecedented rudeness level!! Ultimately, Mr Conservative Politician realizes his family is deluged with catastrophe!! He is scared senseless (another G-Rated replacement for the real word here!!) Truly indicative of a politician's inflated ego, his problems have to be heard by a solicitous audience!! This film is tremendous, and it astutely effectuates pejorative realism to the point where the characters in this movie might want to think twice about whether or not they should look in the mirror!! Steven Soderbergh is marvelous as the director of this movie, he is up there with the best in the business by way of possessing the golden touch on any film he gets involved with!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few great films I've seen in 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This definitely was a great movie. It combined a) a great and unique plot, b) stunning cinematography and visuals, and c) spectacular acting to come out as a whole a superb movie.The plot was unique not because of the basic ideas of the plot, but because of the way they were presented. Three stories, all with charcaters unknown to each other, are simultaneously presented, each as interesting and engaging as the next. The first story is with Benicio Del Toro as he and his partner explore the dangerous and brutal world of drug trafficing. They both involve themselves with one side of two drug outfits battling for control of Tiajuana. He soon learns the brutality and fear that the industry entails when he and his partner are dragged further and further into the frightening world of drugs. The next story is with politician Micheal Douglas. As he tries to succeed in his work, his family suffers internally because of his daughter's quick addiction to inhaled cocaine. As Douglas tries to warn others of the dangers of drugs, he learns more and more of the pain and anguish drug addiction causes. Probably the most comedy came from the daughter's friend in the story, the guy who plays Eric Foreman in "That 70's Show." The third story is that of Catherine Zeta Jones as she tries to get her husband, who was strongly involved in drug trade without her knowledge, out of going to prison and in turn leaving her and her son to defend themselves against the people to whom debts are owed from her husbands dangerous trade. This story involves both officers of the law, trying to protect the lead witness against Catherine Zeta Jones husband. What was so cool about the way that the movie was told is the way that the stories all pretty much had the same theme about the effect drugs have on people and families. It really was a shame to see at some points the awful things that could happen, but in the end it all kind of came back together so each character in the stories weren't completely screwed anymore.The cinematography was so good because of how each story was filmed in literally a different light. The story with Benicio was filmed to be very hot-looking (to say in one word). It was filmed to look very yellow and bright. There were a lot of sun caused glare and almost every character brandished sunglasses and profusely sweated. The camera also seemed to be much shakier as well and all together made the entire setting look like, well...Mexico. The Michael Douglas story was filmed to look very greyish and bluish. It looked very much like the north-eastern U.S. Catherine Zeta Jones' story, though, was just filmed in normal looking light.The acting in Traffic was spectacular. Everybody's favorite, Benicio Del Toro, really was great. He is definitely one of the best foreign actors in our modern age. Michael Douglas and his character's daughter (the actress, I mean, I don't know her name) both were great by themselves and funtioned well together. Everybody else, especially the police officers in Catherine Zeta Jones' story, also acted very well.All together the movie was very, very good. It was a gem in a long line of terrible movie theater films. It really had everything that you want in a movie: good plot, action, acting, filming, and directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Soderbergh`s interpretation of the British mini series just about works , but why shoot yourself in the foot by making it arthouse ? Like THE LIMEY Soderbergh doesn`t seem to believe an audience will watch a film where characters walk about without any visual gimmicks . Why does the director have to shoot in sepia in order to show us where the story is located ? I`d have absolutely no complaints if the camera work was done in a fly on the wall style but that wouldn`t be enough for this director.The other problem I had was the screenplay adaption . ( !!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER TO ORIGINAL MINI SERIES !!!! ) In the original Channel 4 show the story starts with a British politician meeting a Pakistani politician and a German businessman . As the story develops it turns out the Pakistani politician is growing opium , turning it into heroin , selling it to the German businessman who distrubutes it all over Europe and indirectly sells it to the British politician`s daughter who is a smack addict ( END SPOILER ) In this film there`s little connection between the stories , I think the closest we get is when Zeta Jones character walks past Javier . Another minus is the fact that if you`ve seen the original you`ll know what happens next plot wise because - despite the switching to an American location - much of what happens is identical to the mini series .Maybe that`s why I enjoyed the Mexican sequences so much which is total invention on the part of the screenwriter and has no equivilent in the British original . Javier is an incorruptable Mexican cop superbly played by Benecio Del Toro and very understated . Is he gay ? He lives on his own but look at the way he picks up the suspect at the bar . Always good to see an Oscar for acting going to a non English speaking partAll in all a fairly good film that`s worth watching once . But be warned if you`re looking for a typical Hollywood thriller or have seen the original you may be somewhat disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a problem with SO many parts of this movie. The yellow filters were obnoxious, first of all, and the blue ones were sleep-inducing. The fact that the white kids had to go to a black neighborhood to get drugs was just silly. The fact that the wife didnt know what her husband was was unbelievable, considering they vaguely hint that she came from the streets. The thing that got me the most was that there were no real consequences of the daughter's actions. What is THAT?!!Aside from that, the acting was mediocre, but they did the best they could with the script, I guess. Topher Grace alone was brilliant, just playing his normal character plus a backbone.This movie is preachy, too long by half, and makes no real statement besides "Drugs bad. Foreigners bad. Rich people bad."</fullReview>

The man seated in front of me turned his head and glowered at me but I had had enough. The biggest waste of my time and money since I paid to see Jerry Maguire. Catherine Zeta Jones has supplanted Demi Moore as the worse working actress in Hollywood today. I do not get how this movie won even one academy award and has been lauded as a work of art. Horrid dialogue, horrid acting, and you can actually see the director micromanaging this faux masterpiece. This new style of filming that seems to integrate a choppy video feel and seems a bit out of focus is also irritating to me. Maybe I am just not with the times but I DID like American Beauty so I can't be THAT out of touch. To me it was a pure exercise in painful boredom watching middle class kids pretend to be part of the drug culture. Truly a waste of time and a truly unrealistic portrayal of drug culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is singlehandedly the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't make the same mistake that I did which was to see the movie! The only reason we did not walk out of the theatre was because one in our party didn't want to leave, because she had already invested 90 minutes and was determined to see the end of the debacle.In short the movie lacks everything a movie is supposed to have to make it enjoyable. There were 2 separate plotlines that didn't really tie together, and for a movie about the war on drugs there was an awful lack of action. The Mexican plotline was hard to follow and not very interesting while and the American plotline I didn't particularly care for either because it was predictable, you knew that the daughter was going to be ok. The acting was horrible. I can't believe that the movie was nominated for an Academy Award. The flickering on the screen also made my friend so sick that he had to go to the bathroom and puke.Conclusion: This is the worst movie I have ever seen, this does not include The Lost World which I never saw because I walked out of the theatre 5 minutes into the movie, nevertheless I would have given the vote a negative rating if it was possible. Nobody in my party liked it nor did my roommate who saw it as well at a separate time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Despite my respect for him, I did not see `Erin,' because it seemed to simple narratively and I cannot imagine how Roberts could be used in any kind of Soderbergh experiment. It seems he is back on track in pushing the envelope. When he does, he deserves respect as he has both cinematic ambitions and skills. But I think he got the balance wrong in some elements of this adventuresome experiment. That shows he's once again pushing himself to the limit (and partly beyond). We should applaud.He understands that the camera is the primary instrument in cinema, all else is secondary, including acting and story. His goal is to master that camera, which other intelligent directors try also of course. Those others sometimes invite the camera into the action by having characters address it, or by involving the movement of the camera within the action. In both cases, the notion is to place the viewer's eye within the reality of the film.Soderbergh eschews this, and curiously focuses on the technical elements of the film's emulsions within the context of time. Above all, the film is presented not as present action that the viewer is witnessing, but PAST action that the viewer has recorded. The art of memory not experience.His last experiment (not his last film) was thrilling. The viewer there was present, but `out of sight.' The game was in how the past was reconstructed, in a jarringly non-linear fashion. Okay, having mastered that, he moves now to the non-linearity of three stories. They are connected only by the mention of a common drug king. There is no indication at all that they are contemporaneous threads, except a couple passes in auto traffic.He does a fine job of shuffling back and forth among the threads, keeping the mind simultaneously engaged. The trick here is to make it more explicit that the film you are seeing is film that you have made. The film is decidedly unprofessional, with lots of saturation problems, and motion jiggles. The framing is just as one would get with home movies. We ride in the back seat and get out with the actors. We run upstairs behind our buddies. The only exception (done to underscore the effect I am sure, but see below on the distinctness of the threads), is an overly arty shot of a helicopter coming in to land. Soderbergh himself handles the camera.The traffic here is the narrative traffic the filmmaker is able to direct through your head. (Drug trade is a mere plot device.) These two tricks -- sliced parallel narratives and `you were there' camerawork -- are supported by two stylistic tricks. The first is a bewildering number of characters. But he places each character in a set of local images that registers them immediately. Brilliant storytelling at least in this regard.The second trick he doesn't pull off so well, and I'm unsure it is doable. He bombards us with thousands of images, over a hundred characters, each placed and identified locally using the same visual tricks, but he tries to distinguish the three threads dramatically and visually.There are distinct photographic conventions for each of the three, involving different palettes, color saturations (as if three different bad labs were involved) and different tics in the interthread editing. That works fine. But the tone of each narrative thread differs too -- as if a different director and agenda and worldview were involved. So we have one narrative where the actors are wound tight and externally (the Mexican story) and the motives are romantic. We have another (the San Diego story) where the relationships are personal, and the acting is internal. Quaid is back from the dead! In the first, the romantic notions are based on nobility, absolutely lacking in the second where the relationships are closer and more convenient.The problem is that you need a consistent image vocabulary to manage the narrative traffic, but too much diversity in the threads fights this, and it is in the third thread that the distinction fights the weave of the fabric. The Michael Douglas story is supposed to have great power and be about great powers -- including the power of family and the power of the drugs themselves. Douglas has been creepily effective in `Wonder Boys,' but he doesn't seem to understand what this film is all about. He is tepid. Amy Irving is a poor actress, period. The kid does stoned well enough, but the thread can't hold its own against the others.This is Soderbergh's fault. He just tries to do too much: to create diversity and consistency at the same time: music that stands still. But a marvelous experiment. Why couldn't Tom Hanks have such balls?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't as good as you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this movie. Partly this was due to the high expectations I had, but there really is a lot wrong with it. First of all, the majority of the acting is average or even below average. The exception is Benicio Del Toro's performance. He did a very good job; however, I still felt like his character could have been a little more compelling. Many of the actors seemed like they were not quite in character once filming started and I was very conscious of the fact that they were acting. Don Cheadle's character was, if not a parody, an exact copy of all of his other roles. Michael Douglas did not deliver a powerful performance as he should have under the circumstances. Then, Catherine Zeta-Jones seemed more interested in looking attractive than acting.Dennis Quaid was mostly just awkward to watch. Erika Christensen was okay, but she didn't really act much different when she was on drugs than when she was sober. So, the acting was sub-par. The acting is not the only part I did not like. The script was very boring and plain. It was even laughable at some points. You can tell it was only there to advance the plot. Lastly I felt that in many of the scenes the director insults the viewer's intelligence by over-explaining things that should be obvious. On a positive note, Del Toro did give a very good performance, and I felt that the way the 3 main plot points were orchestrated was quite good. Really the only thing that was not average, or below average, was the scope of the plot. Overall, given the material and the actors, I feel like Steven Soderbergh should have made a much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With films like Traffic and Requiem for a Dream, drugs seemed to be a pretty big deal in the year 2000. But only one of these two films was recognized by ole Oscar, and that was Traffic. Not to say that Traffic is better than Requiem for a Dream, but I'd say it's a pretty close race. Traffic is a vignette of three different story arcs with a cavalcade of characters who are almost all played by huge names like Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for his performance as Javier Rodriguez, a man from Tiujana working for the police gathering information about the drug cartels. The other story lines are Catherine Zeta-Jones' story as a wife whose husband gets arrested for drug trafficking, and she must clean up his own mess, and Michael Douglas as a conservative judge who is appointed by the President to helm the war on drugs, only to find out that his own daughter is an addict. It's an intense, dark, gritty, and harrowing film represents the brutality and futility of the drug war.Traffic is a film where everything pieces together just right. Soderbergh's poignant direction is stupendous and adds such a raw intensity to the entire film. The way he differentiates between the three stories is excellent and wildly creative. For the story centered around Douglas there is a blue wash over everything that represents the cold and bleak hopelessness of the story. For Zeta-Jones' story everything is much more vibrant to represent her esteemed bourgeois lifestyle. And for Del Toro's story in Tiujana everything is given a yellow tint to give it a much grittier, more raw, and much hotter feeling. What could have been a cheesy gimmick to make the film unique ends up being a stroke of genius by Soderbergh and his cinematographers that adds a whole new level of artistic value to this film.And while Traffic is visually striking it never lets up on the intellect and complexity of its stories. The film flows perfectly and the transitions from the three intertwined stories is seamless. There is not a moment in this film that takes you out of the experience. The script is perfect and the dialogue itself flows so realistically and so smartly that you would think this was a documentary. There is some obvious ad lib work going on here that adds to the intense realism the film touts all the way through. Traffic does not miss a beat in its story or characters. It is all played to perfection.One of the beautiful things about Traffic is that within its grandiose storyline it never loses its human connection. Drugs have affected all of our lives inadvertently, and anyone over the age of 16 can probably have an idea of where this war on drugs is leading. Traffic recognizes the futility of the drug war and this is one of its main focuses. Through the story surrounding Douglas and his daughter we find a very human element to the story as the drug war is brought home to the man trying to fight it. His daughter being an abuser was a genius move by the Gaghan, the screenwriter, and it changes the face of the film as Douglas realizes that the drug cartels cannot be stopped, the important matter is the one closest to home, helping those who have already been affected. It's a feat of exceptional storytelling that works wonders to the overall purpose of Traffic.Few films manage to be this intense and this visceral, while still succeeding in being a humane and emotionally powerful film. Traffic gets everything right, and it's possibly Soderbergh's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It certainly has been a good 12 months for director Stephen Soderbergh, hasn't it? Erin Brockovich, probably the most underrated film of last year, eventually got the recognition Soderbergh, Roberts +Co deserved, as did this film, a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure, and this is quite evident here, telling the story of a new US drug control officer (Michael Douglas) whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict (Erika Christensen). It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose husband is facing a conviction, and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout, speaking in tones, very believable tones, and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico, as a behind-the-scenes nightmare world of seediness, humidity (you can almost FEEL the heat) and as a place where one murder matters not, is handled excellently, Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard, which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length (2 ? hours) is maintained, and while at times it borders on arty, it is done thoughtfully, incisively and effectively, the scenes of importance delivered in tense, muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's (Benicio Del Toro) character and personality is both strong and incredibly well-acted - the quiet, thick skinned yet razor-sharp mind suiting his environment perfectly, and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film, for example in creating the tense, unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages, namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us, particularly in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is, it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways, and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich', where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life, and the movie cliché of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newly-instated drugs officer (Michael Douglas) fighting drugs on two fronts: the Mexican Border and his own home, as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted, I can't put my finger on a single bad performance, but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all, then, a great film, combining good acting, clever psychological undertones and classy direction, which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy, modern style which he has brought to the movies today - this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge, understanding and talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revelation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a monumental achievement and a huge demonstration of the diversity and range of Steven Soderbergh that he released this in the same year as Erin Brockovich. Not even a year after that standard and heartfelt piece, he unleashes this biting and ultra-real exploration into the drug war that plagues this nation. He removes all of the glitz and Hollywood sensationalism that typically fills up a film of this nature and instead shoots it up with a major sense of authenticity that grabs you by the throat and shows you the world these people are living in.The use of different film stocks for each setting is a brilliant decision on his part, I'm honestly surprised that more filmmakers haven't tried to utilize the technique. The scenes with a blue-collar family are given a cold, reserved aesthetic that depresses you whenever you're around it, like sitting in a hospital waiting room and the Mexico scenes feel grimy and claustrophobic, you can really feel the sun beating down on your back anytime we shift focus. This technique shows you that even though these people are soldiers, collateral and casualties in the same war, they are living in very different worlds.At first the hopeful ending felt a little false to me for a film that spends two hours showing us that we are losing this war on drugs and for every win we are hit with two more losses, but after letting it resonate with me I found a sense of decency and humanism in it. Soderbergh shows us that even though we're losing, there is hope to be found in the little wins we get every day. With a smile on Don Cheadle's face we get a little hint at the future potential.Writer Steven Gaghan does an amazing job here, making it feel as though this truly is a mini-series folded down into two and a half hours; which sounds like a criticism but is actually a huge compliment. Thanks to Gaghan and the tremendous cast we get the development and intensity of a ten-part mini-series packed into one film without anything feeling rushed or too brushed over. The entire cast dominates the screen, adding to Gaghan and Soderbergh's remarkable authenticity here, from Cheadle to Del Toro to Zeta-Jones, everyone is a site to be impressed with and no one drops the ball.</fullReview>

This is one of the best movies of 2000 and I see why Steven Soderbergh won best director.This is about America's war on drugs. It's told through four different but interrelated stories. It's similar to what a best picture winner Crash did.The acting is powerful. Michael Douglas plays another flawed man and it works again.

		<shortDescription>As it turns out, Soderbergh can in fact direct Traffic; and does so in this engaging and at times dream-like feature which emphatically hits all the right notes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic was based on a British television series from the back end of the 1980s that I have not seen, here translated into a two hour plus opus revolving around a bunch of disparate characters of different ages, classes and nationalities; the item that ultimately connecting them all being that of drugs, which, on the whole, works really well. Soderbergh's skill as a director allows him to veer the adaptation down a number of routes, fleshing out each character and applying varying tones ranging from the political infused to pulpy crime thriller. The film offers an agonising and often gruelling peek into the world of drugs, spanning a dozen or so characters; two different nations and a whole lot of pain and emotion. It is told amidst stark and grossly varying colour palettes, with a series of harrowing sequences and individual shots, ranging from a pair of men standing over their own freshly dug graves to a middle aged man desperately seeking his lost, rogue daughter as he slowly cruises his way through a hostile African American community, sticking in the memory. It is a punishing, refreshingly multi-stranded and supremely mature piece that never preens nor lectures to an audience whom can be young enough so as to pick up on the film's message, and to those old enough to appreciate what drama Soderbergh has pulled off here.Traffic will predominantly revolve around American judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas), and his attempts at stopping the growing number of drug distributors whom operate across the U.S./Mexico border; his daughter Caroline (Christensen), an actual addict highlighting Wakefield's inability to deal with what should come first and foremost closest to him before going international; Benicio Del Toro's Mexican narcotics cop Javier Rodriguez, whom prowls the urban and desert zones of Mexico with beat partner Manolo (Vargas), as San Diego based DEA officers Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) are employed to keep an eye on the wife of a highly wealthy man, of whom is unaware of the true extent of his career, in Helena Ayala (Jones). While varied and unbalanced in age and attributes, Traffic dramatically documents the fights and perils of each party as the battle for apparent liberation from drugs and the intrinsic link they have with one another in this regard, takes centre stage.In Wakefield's daughter Caroline and her equally aged cohorts, the film makes a point to linger on the potential dangers drugs pose to these rather gifted individuals. Placed at a private school, and initially apprehensive at the prospect of burning up and smoking heroin before going through with it and loving it, Caroline is led in by the bad company she keeps; sadly later coming to have to escape rehabilitation and prostitute herself so as to score a fix as she seeks ever increasing highs. On another strand, we first observe Helena at a golf club having a rich lunch with some of her friends, casually joking about her son perhaps becoming the next golfing protégé; the life of an apparent socialite whose grotesquely rich husband, and how he became so rich, will act as the catalyst for her own arc of realisation as the proverbial mirror is held up in front of her own existence with a torrid sweep of emotional distress; observation and plight taking over her life following this previously sheltered existence. This, as the dangers of apparently playing life straight in the war on drugs in the law enforcement characters, are inescapable, and both Del Toro, Cheadle and Guzmán do excellent jobs in playing supporting characters Soderbergh does well in squeezing out enough drama out of the plights of.The director free flowingly hops from each story, a new tact and overall tone in proceedings effortlessly inserted into the plights of these characters as harsh, warm reds accompany the Mexican strands and deathly cold blue hues the American ones. Most of Michael Douglas' scenes, as he plays this suit-and-tie clad judge before branching out into a concerned parent bounding from locale to locale in a causality driven fashion seeking his daughter, are socially and politically driven; the film going to some extent so as to provide depressing statistics and figures on the subject for our benefit during proceedings, as other similarly dressed officials stand around in the office hearing about it. The extra officials of whom, I read, are even played by real life officials in this field and must go so far as to inform Wakefield (as well as us) that there is no Mexcian equivalent over there as to what he is doing over in America. The film is not a two and a half hour slog-come-lecture with one thing to say in the form of "drugs ARE, in fact, bad!" as Soderbergh churlishly plays with his lens filters, colour saturation and delivers everything under this promise of big name acting talent doing what they do. On the contrary, Traffic is a smart and taut piece of drama; effortlessly combining an array of character studies, some more branched out and affecting than others, but all combining to form this marvellous drama of varying tones, stories and content which hit most marks they aim for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't stop watching this, but, like "The Godfather," I didn't want things like this to be so powerful. This is really masterfully edited piece of work, keeping about ten different balls in the air at one time. We have the bad guys, the drug lords, the hit men, the drug connection, the drug victim, the clueless politician, and so on. We are moved from one to the other, and, what at the beginning seems incomprehensible, begins to grow on us. I need to see this again to get a handle on who's who, but on first viewing, I was stunned. Del Torre (the Usual Suspects) is so striking on the screen. Facially, he may be the best actor working today. Michael trades in his usually violent, anything-goes character for one who slowly becomes aware of the beast he is trying to slay. I can't deal with all the characters, but the chief character is the the whole drug trafficking industry and what it does. There is a great scene where cares pass into Mexico, virtually unstopped. At the Mexico/U. S. border, the lines are endless. Still the stuff comes through at about a fifty percent rate. I recently heard someone talking about the use of the express "War on Drugs." He said it was laughable because we are really powerless to stop enough to make a difference. Look at any schoolyard or backstreet or bedroom in some MacMansion. This is certainly a powerful film, but its implications are devastating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much but enough (just like the war on drugs)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Soderburgh is one of a kind. I love his indie efforts of "sex,lies, and videotape"; "Bubble"; and in a strange way, "Schizopolis". I like it when he develops characters, but I haven't seen a majority of his "big" films because I see him as an innovator and more of an indie film maker. Maybe I should. I don't know.With that intro out of the way, let me say that everyone in the film under the direction of Soderburgh -- Michael Douglas, Catherine-Zeta Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Benico Del Toro, the assassin guy -- everybody plays their part well and they act well -- but the issue is the war on drugs something we see only glimpses of on the news and in the streets (and, yes, in the labs and fields, etc.) I appreciate the effort of the film and its overall message that it this "war" is unstoppable and you take victories where you can get them. But the film, in all of its cool glory, never takes enough time to let us know these people, with the possible exception of Del Toro's cop.There's so much going on: the color schemes, the characters "representing" a specific piece of the war (legislation, drug dealers, etc.) with a such a star-studded cast that we always see the actors and actresses on the screen rather than their characters. Del Toro's cop, Javier Rodreguez, is allowed to be fleshed out more than anyone else in the movie. We think he is a good man, than we wonder, then we realize that is again, and then we realize why he wants what he wants. In a movie with interlocking stories, color screens, and this and that, he is a human being to whom we can relate. The rest, even Douglas' performance, fail to move me as beyond stereotypical.I don't hate this film; I just think it was trying to do too much, and lost its emotional core, except for Del Toro. Like I said, good performances and good direction ... but like the real war on drugs, it doesn't add up to too much. Check out "Requiem For A Dream" for a better, intimate statement about this war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to reach its true potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is one of those films which is survived by its acting talent. Without it, its interweaving storyline alone is not enough to make it a great film. Of the multiple interconnecting narratives, the most effective relationship is between a father and daughter, allowing for an emotional and tense story that will be relatable to millions of parents across the world.Traffic takes no prisoners in its delivery. Soderbergh lays out the nitty gritty details of the North American drugs industry to viewers and holds back no punches in laying out the disturbing truth. Whilst doing this, the film is fantastically shot in showing harsh realities.However, with all its acting talent and engrossing storyline, Traffic falls very flat in certain places throughout the film. It often feels dull and diluted and has no real 'action' to help propel the film forward. It is these factors which prevent Traffic being the great film it should be and instead only provides a film that is all too serious, providing no escape from its monotonous tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deflating multi-strand drugs thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the reasons I like Soderbergh's movies is that they set up to tell the story clearly. The gimmick to Traffic is bleaching each subplot a different colour to help distinguish the players. Of course this sounds like a rather patronising practice until the movie gets started in earnest Soderbergh wants to illuminate the intractable web of compromised politicking and ethics drug abuse spawns from bathroom to boardroom and he doesn't want to have to dilute his drama on the way.It's a tight, clearly scripted affair, without undue overlap between the tales. Most characters struggle to reconcile their experience during the action with their position at the outset, with the exception of the already corrupt Rodriguez and Sanchez for whom policing drugs trafficking is 'an entrepreneurial activity'. The deadpan Benicio Del Toro is a study in blank immorality here. The rest of the cast are equal to this: Michael Douglas always owns his screen time, but I really liked the strange bargaining between Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones. 7/10</fullReview>

If you want to see something really rough and utterly amazing in direction, acting, writing, and cinematography, check out the mini series Traffik from 1989, that's what the movie is based off of. Some of the characters have been changed, but it's essentially the same story. So to reiterate, yeah, this is an amazing movie, but the original is easily better. Del Toro has made and acted in better movies than this, yet this is obviously the peak of Soderbergh's career as a filmmaker. Also, there is too many unneeded language in this version. If you look at the 1989 version, there is no language for one reason: it's not needed because the acting is so terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not find the movie to have all the metaphysical meaning and power the critics claim. I respectfully disagree. I found it to be a tentative to accomplish too much at once, that ended up in accomplishing almost nothing in the end. The director would have wanted to make a thriller, a family drama, a political movie and a documentary, all in one. He has failed to accomplish that, in my opinion. The movie is to disconnected, following one of the 3-4 plots present in the film would have been more than enough, since all of them where very promising, and would have been great if fully developed.In other, the movie sports a great cast of actors and great filming (camera). On the other hand, the music by Brian Eno went unnoticeable. I find the Oscar awards that this film received to be fully exaggerated and unwarranted. I realize that it is "modern" to say that a movie by Soderbergh is good, but... In addition, the film probably got them for being so "liberally Hollywoodian" and politically correct (especially for the ending where a conservative judge abandons the war against drugs to listen-in at his daughters AAA drug addicts seminars....) Is this the correct message? Give up the fight? I think not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shockingly Realistic, Honest and Harrowing Eye-Opener Detailing All The Effects Of Drug Trafficking Across The Globe. A Mesmerising Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drug trafficking has become a major, worldwide problem; it's causing havoc across the globe and brings crime in many forms. You hear about drug-related problems on the TV, the newspaper, the radio and the general media as a whole. It has become a media sensation, governments are supposedly trying their best to stop it and police forces are supposedly tackling the problem down to the core. A lot of people see the "drug epidemic" as something that is communicated through small triangles coming via low-life street gangs corrupted by poverty. Now when tackling a problem like drug trafficking to the core a word such as "corruption" is a central key to the problem. Traffic proves just how big the drugs ring is and that it is a triangle that is constantly moving.Traffic is a study of social dilemmas that are faced in the recent war on drug trafficking. The film puts forth so many details of how everyone is affected by the problem. Traffic, unlike other drug films like Trainspotting or Requiem For A Dream that focus on the soul affects of humans Traffic's heart is set on showing the involvement on everything. It's a wonderful anti-drug film that shows the tackling and breeding of the problem. The film's gritty nature is needed to create the fast-paced style, the fade in/fade out editing is usually perfectly and does not detract the viewer from the story. Everything is crafted with elegance; the story manages to work around the script with an astonishing amount of pressure.Traffic personifies film-making and with what is easily some of the finest direction from the 21st century it will remain a highly reminiscent work of film. Stephen Soderbergh is a director who I've personally never been a fan of, but Traffic stands out as a tour de force example of highly challenging cinema. The direction grips you; it captures the persevering and dirty nature needed for the film. The excellent editing and screen-transitions show tremendous skill at the art of film-making. The use of colours to distinguish the different stories works as a brilliant metaphor. The wonderful soundtrack accompanies scenes with a polished style, each song or piece of music is chosen to fit each scene flawlessly.The cast is one of the best casts to ever come out of cinema in recent years. With the likes of Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid you may expect the film to feel very "mainstream Hollywood". Yet it doesn't and each actor manages to pull off their performances with the needed emotional power. Benicio Del Toro gives the best performance of his career (along with the latter 21 Grams) managing to create a believable character who reacts to a situation with the needed realistic response. He becomes his character throughout the film's two and a half hours running time, which never fails to lose its grip nor fall into pacing/structure problems. The other shining performance is that of Catherine Zeta Jones who gives a highly poignant performance reminiscing one of Oscar material. Overall it's Benicio Del Toro who steals the show, deserving his Oscar with what is a genuinely effortless example of brilliance.Traffic gives the viewer morals through conflict; it's a film that should be taught in schools as it shows the ultimate effects of what drugs do to our society. It puts fourth many questions of ethics, values and responsibilities in a controlled and sophisticated manner. The substantial amount of dialogue that the film relies on manages to remain an absorbing cinematic device helping to understand the character's current situations and pasts. It's sharp and digs down to the point, seeing as that's what is needed the film succeeds in another area of greatness.One of the greatest films of the decade so far, a film not to be missed and one that forges a mile-stone in direction.</fullReview>

Oh, and it's a good idea not to get your girlfriend high in the hopes of having fun, because, not only will a bunch of people lie to and kill each other, your girlfriend may end up the property of a drug dealer/pimp. It's an interesting menagerie.It may all sound pleasant (if yer some kind of masochist I suppose). Regardless, I didn't find the movie pleasant. Traffic was lacking some in the humor and drama department. Actually, even with humor and drama, I usually don't find these crime shows pleasant. There was only one scene I found pleasant. The humor I found in this scene is probably due to the fact Drug Czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) reacted to the scene in the movie almost exactly the same way I was reacting in my seat.This is a movie for people who feel the need to know about the illegal drug industry. I'm sure there was a huge audience for this movie in that this (knowing all about drugs and feeling superior in our knowledge) is the method educators and entertainers use to try and keep us off drugs, in our 'tolerant' world. Not to mention the potential audience of criminals and former players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a severe film of incompetent people.i) A teenage schoolgirl who develops a hard drug addiction (and focuses _in treatment_ too much on her present instead of her future), ii) A powerful drug importer who gets informed on by an underling and also with little physical security, iii) A mother who ignores her daughters ongoing drug abuse threatening her and her families entire lifestyle and wellbeing, possibly due to her own declared previous drug use, iv) American Policemen who fail; get shot, can't protect their witnesses nor themselves, and end up pettily grasping for success, v) A prominent drugs politician who cannot cope with the situation he is in, vi) A lying presidential system, vii) A Mexican policeman who lacks a desire to financially improve himself, viii) A high level drug dealer who is arrested, ix) An assassin who is tortured and also assassinated, x) A corrupt Mexican military general who is killed.The strongest elements are i) A treatment centre that attempts to provide an insight into a cure, ii) A black drug dealer who mercifully lets the politician leave with his brandished $1,000, iii) The creep boyfriend who retains his desire to go to law school, meets the US Drug Tzar on, albeit immaturely uneducated, drug socio-economics and has a distrust of the previous generation.If this is how the drugs scene was seen then it's honest. The dialogue is excellent. Douglass plays his incompetent, out of his depth-although well qualified, character professionally. This out of place contrast suggests that the filmmakers see the War on Drugs as futile. The fact that $1,200USD can be made in an hour on the street, with contacts, is not a valid excuse for participation, and acceptance of its presence is not only unpalettable but unjust and suicidal.On the other hand, the cinematic judicial results are:i) The schoolgirl (whose first filmed word is 'no'), although broken from parental and macro-societal micro-rejection and non-conformity to exposed survivor, survived her experience, ii) The importer ended the film with his pregnant wife and her country club social life, comparatively large home, and business starting a boom, iii) The wife ended with her husband in his career, and her daughter still at home, a family, iv) The policeman survived, v) The politician was assured of his career, vi) The presidential system rules over a far more socially, politically, economically and factually technologically advanced country than its neighbour, vii) The Mexican policeman survived and was close to a lady, viii) The dealer shot a policeman, and provoked this policeman on his occupational hazzards moments prior to his own assassination, ix) The assassin lawlessly killed people, and was assassinated, x) The General tortured the assassin, and was murdered.The cinematic winners: Decided by achievements made after getting paid: i) The Mexican policeman who gets the park for his neighbourhood from the US, ii) The importer who started a boom in business with a new technology, iii) Mexico who gets a park, one less assassin and one less torturing General.Notable filming: i) Cars turning right, ii) The chase jumping over train tracks.The despicable, treacherous, dealer turned informer and his police escort are saved only when walking away from their car, the assassin killed by the new assassin in the car park background, the inept policeman then returns to the car only to be killed by the now dead assassin. An undertone of pollution is apparent. The politician in his role as saviour father, discovers his daughter using at home, in her ensuite bathroom, when he leaves his car to walk into his home. The viewers are shown the life of the Mexican policeman and his method of gathering income by tourists liberated from their car.The phrase used by the politician, "self medicating" is a powerful and libertarious phrase. His expanded phrase "a way of self medicating" makes it seem like a '60s' Eastern religious discipline.It is not made easy to like this film. The heroine, pun intended, is broken but survives, the main protagonist in the politician is a failed hero, the secondary protagonist in the Mexican policeman fails to achieve personal gain.The viewers are shown a black future. The death and omni-destruction in this intoxicating aspect of life is dragged into the shared future of viewer and film. The setting being very much the present day, the real world, using with a small part the shining West Wing set and the story itself set in the most powerful nation on earth. We are shown technological innovation only in the traffic of drugs. The technology of the police in their small bug is known to the audience to be effortlessly swept away. The snooping van with its supposed technology doesn't have a gun mic.The strong dialog is evident in the perhaps improvised scenes in the group of upper class teenagers. Also, the politicians being powerfully political, and the police being ordinary.A strong theme of escaping from this blackness is evident.The film stars trucks, cars, a plane, a helicopter, jeeps, suburban 4x4s, a train and a van.It is a very professionally acted film and a landmark in contempory, faux-Real World, human-issue cinema.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Una Pesadilla Mas Fea...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of "Traffic" introduces us to two men on a lonely desert road near Tijuana, one of whom, Javier Rodriquez, tells of "a nightmare most ugly" he had the night before, of seeing his own mother with a plastic bag over her head. He spits to get the taste of it out of his mouth.A nightmare is what follows, in triplicate, each shot in its own moody, surreal style, presenting various aspects of the war on drugs within the disturbing context of family. In Mexico, Javier (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself dealing with some suspicious lawmen, and a brother-like partner he is no longer sure he can trust. In San Diego, Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) struggles to keep her family together after her husband is fingered for cocaine trafficking. Finally, in Cincinnati, ambitious judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is named the nation's drug czar at the same time his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) discovers the joys of freebasing."Traffic" is part-white paper, part-"Miami Vice" episode, part-afterschool special. Even though the parts aren't always that great on their own, the mosaic-like effect created by writer Stephen Gaghan and director Steven Soderbergh adds up to an often-compelling whole, as an array of compelling characters weave in and out of each other's stories "Magnolia"-style.The resemblance of "Traffic" to a P.T. Anderson film is cemented near the beginning when we see two familiar faces from Anderson's "Boogie Nights," Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle, a.k.a. Maurice and Buck, walking into the middle of what turns out to be a very screwed-up drug bust. Alternately comic and harrowing, and very real-feeling, it's a standout sequence in a movie with several such highlights.Cheadle and Guzman have the best time with their characters, while Del Toro won a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar for the harrowing ride of conscience he gives viewers as Javier. Most of the other acting is very good, even smaller roles handled by James Brolin (as Wakefield's predecessor) and Miguel Ferrer as the guy with whom Guzman and Cheadle's characters tangle. Topher Grace is also worth singling out as a smarmy preppie who gulls Caroline into the high life as an extension of his own ego-stoking, a real breakout performance from this generation's Michael J. Fox.The central message of "Traffic" is that of family, of how drugs kill family connections, how drugs compromise them. It's not arguing for legalization, or tougher laws, but rather makes a probing, non-finger-pointing case for how families and governments need to work together to destroy the source of drug use, their sinister appeal to those in crisis.I think it's a good message. I think this is a good film. That said, there are things I'm not impressed by. Zeta-Jones' sketchy characterization of a Welsh soccer Mom who transforms herself into Pablo Escobar, weakly written, is not helped by an inert performance. Just watch her attempt at registering surprise when Dennis Quaid tells her what her hubby really does. Zeta-Jones is good in other roles; here she's miscast.And what can you say about the unrealistically sloppy way the police guard their ace informant? Even the Dallas Police Department did better with Lee Harvey Oswald; they only screwed up once. A lot of bloviating and speechifying slows this film down, especially in the form of an unrealistic public breakdown Judge Wakefield has near the end, where he agonizes about how we can fight a war when the enemy is your own family. As Cheadle asks at one point, "What, are we on 'Larry King' or something?" But I like the film's message, the way it delivers it, the fine acting and occasionally powerful vignettes. Soderbergh is clearly a filmmaker of great power, and "Traffic" often delivers great things. It's not a great movie, or even at moments a very good one, but it's a worthwhile film to see, and see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate Description of the War on Drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a very realistic movie about the drug war between the US and Canada. It's pretty long but it's understandable because it looks at the issue from many different positions. From high up government officials, to US cops, to Mexican cops, to dealers, to teenagers using the drugs and other innocent people caught up in the action. It is very gritty and to the point, showing just how much can be lost from the war on drugs, your friends, your family and your life. I think the main message of this movie was delivered quite well, that the war on drugs will never be won, it's a hopeless cause. I liked the acting and I didn't see anything stupid or out of place at all. Everything seemed very legit and totally plausible as to what could happen in real life. You really started to feel for the people at the end, though some of the angles could have had a bit more focus put on them. The settings were nice and varied, the music didn't tend to stray too far from one song to the next though and there was only a few action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic: flows nicely, but with some mixed signals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic', loosely based on a Channel 4 series of the same name, is certainly one of his more impressive films; a powerful, watchable and generally believable overview of the many facets of the drug trade; moreover, it coalesces into something approximating a coherent thriller with a nicely nuanced end. Politically, the film makes the point that the war on drugs is hopeless (or at least, that the language of war and "Czars" is not helpful when considering the problem). But it still supports the idea of narcotics as something toxic being fed into American society from outside, rather than an innate feature of almost every society; nor does it stress the imbalances of wealth that lie behind the existence of the trafficking routes it depicts. One of Sodebergh's typically overstated stylistic techniques, that of filming the U.S.A. and Mexico through different coloured filters, also exaggerates this sense of drugs and the drug lords as an essentially alien menace. 'Traffic' is good on the "how", but the recent documentary series on Channel 4, 'Cocaine', arguably did a better job at explaining the "why" of the drug trade, and was more emotionally powerful as a result.Caveats aside, 'Traffic' is still a strong, gripping movie that asks some, though not all, of the right questions; and the cinematography is interesting as well. In my books, it's Sodebergh's best film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Issue-of-the-day movie works as an engaging drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really look to movies to dramatize the issues of the day for me. I can't see how a movie about the drug war in the U.S. and Mexico could be of much practical use. Maybe this got some people to thinking about the matter; I don't know. I'm in favor of legalizing drugs, and this movie did nothing either to change my mind or reinforce my position. I didn't need this issue presented to me in terms of drama.So how is this movie as a movie? That's different. As drama, it had me."Traffic" tells three separate stories, artfully interspersed with one another. In one story, a judge from Ohio (Michael Douglas) is tapped as the new drug czar only to learn that his own honor-student daughter (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack. In story number two, a Mexican drug enforcement cop (Benicio Del Toro) discovers how corrupt the system really is and how willing he is to do the right thing. In the third, two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzmán) spy on the wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) of a just-indicted drug kingpin while trying to protect the peon (Miguel Ferrer) who will testify against him.Each of these stories has so many characters and so many interconnecting layers that you get the illusion that all the stories interconnect. The stories connect with one another in some minor ways, but mainly each works independently of the others. Stephen Gaghan, who adapted his script from a British TV miniseries, does a fine job juggling all these people and all these stories. The Del Toro one confused me the most often, but I imagine that was due more to my distractibility than to the script.Steven Soderbergh directs smoothly enough to keep all the plot points reasonably clear. The movie is very attractive, and he has the clever idea of using three different film stocks and color schemes for each story. The Douglas one is blue and somber. The Del Toro one is grainy, rough and yellow. The Cheadle/Zeta-Jones one is bright and composed of primary colors. He often uses hand-held cameras to give the movie an unintrusive semi-documentary style. (This works well, but on the rare occasions where a moment feels phony, this attempt at realism just makes it all the phonier.)The ensemble cast is very large, and there are a lot of familiar faces, yet I can't recall a single performance that let me down. But Del Toro is the obvious standout. His morally conflicted character is the juiciest role in the script, and he makes the most of it. He just seems real the whole way through. And that's added to his striking good looks and unconventional sex appeal. He's a real guy and a movie star at the same time.My favorite surprise is the one involving Catherine Zeta-Jones. I loved how the movie sets us up to feel one way about her character, then leaves us feeling very differently by the end. A few critics complained that it's implausible her character could learn as much as she does in so short a time. That's irrelevant to me. What's completely credible is that this particular woman *would* teach herself these things. And yet it's shocking to see her actually do it.Any flaws? The only thing that bothered me was Michael Douglas's speech before the press corps. What he does happens all the time in movies, but it shouldn't have happened in one that affects to be realistic. Has anyone giving a speech, particularly before the Washington press corps, ever stopped in the middle and declared that it's all bull? The scene is bull.Also, that doll made of cocaine fascinates me. It's odorless, undetectable by dogs, yet if you dissolve it in liquid, it reveals itself to be coke. That seems straight out of James Bond. Is it plausible? I wouldn't know.I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt. Besides, one or two credibility gaps do not a bad movie make. This movie had my attention from beginning to end, and it's rich and detailed enough to keep itself alive in my memory. I'm glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome thriller cum human docu-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film as most of you will already know deals with the drug-trafficking phenomenon prevalent in the US. The narrative is told in the form of 3 interspersed stories set in the US and Mexico: a high-level DEA official (Michael Douglas, who's actually good in this movie!) whose efforts to curb the traffic are contrasted with his own daughter's addiction problems, the wife of a gang boss (Catherine Zeta-Jones, thankfully not stripping) who struggles to gain control of her life in the aftermath of her husband's arrest (and ends up doing more than that) and a Mexican cop (Benicio del Toro, good debut) who is trapped in a suffocating haze of corruption around him. Each of these stories appears to have been shot in a subtly different style, the Mexican portion standing out because of its docu-style photography (kudos to Soderbergh for this), downplayed acting and stark lighting schemes. The screenplay moves at a good pace and considering that at least 2 of the stories, the DEA agent's and the Mexican cop's, had the potential to be individual movies in themselves, always comes across as pithy and gripping. Soderbergh thankfully presents his material in a very matter-of-fact fashion thereby avoiding the pitfalls of a more melodramatic approach, especially with reference to the portions that relate the addiction escapades of the DEA man's daughter. This is miles ahead of Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape and, I expect, Erin Bronkovich (which I refuse to see, it being a Julia Roberts star vehicle). Technically the film is quite sharp and in this case not just garnishing over an empty dish. I also mention the music (Cliff Martinez) which offloads the burden of orchestral scores to take a more synth-based sound which, although not riveting in itself, adds a lot to the film's atmosphere. Definitely worth a see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D look at the world of illegal drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Multifaced and multifaceted look at the drug industry in various locations and through various experiences.So much of today's film world takes place among bullet proof heroes, plastic glamour and easy morality that when a movie comes along that treats you like an adult- and even includes a good measure of ambiguity - you are taken by surprise. This is certainly one such case.The original C4 (UK) series, on which this is all based, is actually much better because it tells the tale in more detail and includes more about the people that actually produce the crop (and their Mafia dominated lives.) Television, when at its best, can beat cinema in human drama simply by having the luxury of time.The handhold camera work and the use of filters gives the film a documentary style and I think that this really works. Nothing here seems clean, straight-forward or clear cut. Even the camera work seems jerky as if events where unexpected rather than scripted.The US drug chief (Douglas) coming face-to-face with the scale of the problem and the fact that drug taking is already in his own home stays in your own mind longer, but I prefer the scenes in Mexico where corruption is all around and is maybe the only way to live beyond hand-to-mouth. Great acting by Benicio Del Toro - maybe the best in the film.Praise for Michael Douglas for playing semi-weak and being part of an ensemble cast, although wife (in real life) Zeta Jones's accent seems to wander all over the place like provincial rep.As I said before, television has moved on to do human drama better than cinema anyway. But this is an important and thought provoking film about what drugs, money and power do to people. However I still think the original TV series is far better and it is sad that so few people got to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lower your expectations for this overrated mediocrity. Nothing irks me more than critically overpraised films and few fall so squarely within those parameters as Traffic. Based on a vastly superior British miniseries, this U.S. adaptation unfolds like a Readers Digest condensed overview of the drug trade. It hops, skips and jumps between several stories, none of which are given enough screen time to truly engross the viewer in what happens. For all of the kudos heaped on the film, it breaks no new ground and its assertion that the war against drugs is pretty much a hopeless battle has been explored more effectively in far better films. The cast, with a few exceptions, is solid. Michael Douglas does quite well as the U.S. drug czar trying to educate himself on the drug war, while his own daughter (Erika Christensen) is selling herself to finance her next high. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman make the most of underwritten roles, while Dennis Quaid is totally wasted as a conniving attorney. Benicio del Toro brings a nice weary note to his character of an embattled Mexican police officer, but he really did not deserve an Oscar nomination (much less the Oscar) for this performance, especially in such a great year for supporting actors. Catherine Zeta-Jones is light years beyond ludicrous in a completely incomprehensible role that seems to go from one extreme to the other in the blink of an eye. Hers is by far the weakest acting in the film. As far as Best Director Steven Soderbergh, his only contribution seems to be that he films all the events in Mexico in a headache-inducing yellow tint, all of the events in Washington D.C. and Ohio in a washed out blue/gray and all the events in California in normal hues (no wonder why this was so big with Hollywood). Certainly not the worst of its type, but outrageously overhyped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic proves conclusively that the "the war on drugs" is still the lucrative carney scam that it always has been. This stunning artistic achievement has been endorsed by members of the US senate, the motion picture academy, the nation's movie critics and brain dead drones across the country. What more validating acclaim do you need to see this film over and over, and believe everything that it puts forth? Well, I'll give you some more reasons to believe: 10) Candy colors help the medicine go down. 9) Being part of the La Jolla gentry and being a ruthless drug baron go hand in hand. 8) The ends justify the means. 7) If we would just listen to our children they would never even think about smoking crack. 6) Mexico is more corrupt than the US. 5) Drug czars, Hollywood filmmakers and DEA agents are motivated by the noblest of intentions. 4) People from the ghetto really are responsible for corrupting innocent rich white girls. 3) The use of different types of film stocks, hand held camerawork, the narrative "jigsaw" technique and political cameos mean great art (but only when respectable directors do it in the service of a higher cause). 2) No one in this film ever suggested that the US army start spraying paraquat on tobacco fields in North Carolina or start bombing distilleries in Kentucky. 1) Catherine Zeta-Jones really can act her way out of a wet paper bag (ha-ha, just kidding, I couldn't think of ten reasons).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Traffic", especially the performance by can't-fail actor Michael Douglas. Although there's plenty of drama and art in the film, you can view it as a pure thriller if you want to, which makes it similar to "Training Day". That's important to a guy like me who normally avoids dramas.However, unlike "Training Day" the plot was close but not perfect. The two main characters (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas) have separate plot lines that never touch. So it's almost like two separate movies. I didn't feel the ending wrapped up the story, either, even though I "get it" that the USA's "War on Drugs" isn't wrapped up and may be unwinnable. I quite liked Luis Guzman, who was hilarious. The film's about drug trafficking, but it isn't glorified so that didn't bother me -- although the filmcertainly speaks out against the current USA anti-drug approach.Who should see this film:-- action / thriller movie buffs who won't mind a little dramaand the plot not really coming to a bang closing-- drama buffs who don't mind the topic of drug traffickingI'll give "Traffic" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved so many things about this movie, but NOT everything. The directing was brilliant. The use of coloring gave a precise flavor that set the perfect atmosphere. The story was believable, informative, and quite a shock to anyone who doesn't understand the nature of how the drug industry operates (at least part of it) in parts of North America. Del Toro is the true star of this film. (I'm not going to be a fair judge. I think the man is brilliant in almost everything he's done.) When he's on screen, the pace is perfect. He creates intensity. This is done by several other actors in the film as well. Yet these actors aren't given the credit. The credit goes, in my opinion, to the actors who ruined it. My major mouthful of sour grapes came from the fact that this film was cast with some major actors. This movie was produced, written, and filmed to be a realistic depiction of life in a corrupted world that exists all around us. I understand that the studio wanted this to be seen by a wide audience. To get the audience=put in big names. Sadly, for me anyway, I would've felt the multi-layered stories more significant and honest if they weren't portrayed by actors I'd never taken too seriously. If you can enjoy big famous celebrity actors working in a film that presents itself in an almost documentary style, then rock on. This is something you're going to love. I believe, however, that the star power ruined this whole thing. No one in this movie should have been more famous than Del Toro. This would've made a gritty and thought-provoking piece of film that would set a standard for movies dealing with drugs.</fullReview>

I never like this even if I agree with the agenda. Art should take precedence over any message.-This story is told from such a white upper middle class perspective. The government corruption is on the Mexican side NOT the U.S. side. The young couple in the beginning of course get ripped off by those sneaky Mexicans, a prelude of all the trickery to come. Those dirty b***ards. Young rich white girls are sleeping with black - YES BLACK! -men to score drugs. Oh the horror!- Michael Douglas/drug czar has a daughter who gets hooked on drugs.

		<fullReview>I saw the original "Traffik" as a TV miniseries on PBS when it first came out, and then again over the past two weekends. I saw "Traffic" the movie when it came out, and enjoyed it also.In seeing the original again, however, I can only say that it literally eclipses the movie. The movie took the story, moved it over a continent or two, added flash and glamor but removed the soul. In every category, acting, writing, editing, music and, yes, directing, the original outshines the movie. The drug-addicted daughter is played heartbreakingly by a very young Julia Ormond. The Catherine Zeta-Jones part (which she did not have the gravitas to play) was played by the icy, beautiful and completely believable Lindsay Duncan. The mini also has a subplot entirely missing from the movie, although some of the character, who is a Pakistani farmer in the mini, is injected into the Benicio Del Toro part in the movie.See the original, and notice how Soderbergh copied the English director's idea of filming the different locations in different hues. Soderbergh got a lot of critical acclaim for that one, and I don't remember hearing him credit his predecessor with the idea.The user guide rating for the original is an incredible 9.1.

Multiple storylines are weaved through an almost-unbearable 2 hours and 20 minutes, with most tying into others by the end. The film certainly has a lot of style, and I liked how each storyline had it's on look and feel (i.e. almost sepia for Mexico, gritty for Los Angeles). With the exception of Catherine Zeta-Jones, it's a standout cast that does deliver exceptional performances, especially by Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, and Don Cheedle, who's character and storyline I found to be the most entertaining, protecting Miguel Ferrer while waiting for his day in court. The film picks up momentum every once in while (though not enough) and generates some good suspense when Douglas is looking for his daughter. It could have been cut by about 40 minutes or so, and it might have helped. Then again, it might have not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Finding an Obscure Address in the Middle of a Big City at Rush Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Traffic' is certainly an appropriate title for this movie. The only way I can closely approximate the experience is to compare it to trying to find an obscure address in the middle of a big city at rush hour. While much of what is going on is of great importance, much is simply distracting. Director Steven Sonderberg manages to keep everything confusing enough so it is pretty easy not to care which is which. Perhaps the best comparison is the television series `Cops'. While `Cops' portrays actual police operations, the technical limitations of portable equipment and uncontrolled environment makes it SEEM less realistic than, say, `Law and Order'. However, `Cops' has the consistent sheen of betacam under either natural or ugly sodium lighting. By contrast, `Traffic' looks like home movies developed by five different drug stores.Contributing even more to the confusion is the casting. After a brief introduction to the `Law and Order conservative' judge (Michael Douglas), whom is about to be appointed drug czar, we get to spend ten minutes learning Spanish (never fear, English subtitles) with two south of the border cops, actors whom we have probably never seen before. Shortly thereafter, we are treated to a confusing drug sting involving two undercover cops (hey, isn't that the guy who tried to kill George Clooney in `Out of Sight'? Hey, isn't that the guy who did kill Patrick Swayze in `Ghost'? Say, isn't that one of the baddies from `Robocop'?) Just WHO is the `good guy' here? Next, we are introduced to Catherine Zita-Jones, playing a society matron whose husband has just been arrested for drug dealing (Michael Douglas? Isn't he the `law and order judge'? No, that's right, he's her REAL LIFE husband? Well, then who, Miguel Ferrer (`Robocop')? No, it's Steven Bauer (who?), who hasn't even been introduced yet in the movie. THIS is great storytelling? `Big' stars doing little star turns and vice-versa in this movie (Salma Hyak on screen about 90 seconds as a hooker?) is another trademark of this movie, leading to even MORE confusion (WHAT'S the title again? Ah yes, `Traffic'. )The BEST thing about `Traffic' is the overall message. No, not that drugs are `bad' (what a revelation THAT would be), but that the `War on Drugs' is the most misguided operation since Vietnam, with the same likely outcome, and largely for the same reasons. There are no clear objectives and there are too many competing interests. Like Vietnam, even the name is a misnomer. This SHOULD be a `War on Drug ABUSE,' which would place the focus where it should lay ? on the DEMAND side of the equation, i.e., the DRUG ABUSER. However, the `solution,' presented, i.e., the catchall term `treatment', is not sufficient. Even though the generally accepted to be most successful treatment (i.e., 12 step program) is shown briefly in the movie, the KEY to THAT treatment is recognizing and acknowledging there is SOMEONE higher than oneself and THAT is never mentioned. (For more information, read Dr. David R. Hawkins, POWER VS. FORCE). THAT would undoubtedly offend the liberal sensibilities of those who made `Traffic'. This is no more apparent than them allotting the main `finger pointing' to the movie's most loathsome character, i.e., the boy who introduces Douglas' sixteen year old daughter to the world of hard drugs and whoring. If Douglas really was a `hard nosed conservative' this kid would be speaking those lines with jaw wired together and several cracked ribs. Nonetheless, drug addiction is a SYMPTOM of underlying psychological problems such as unresolved rage and self-hatred. Besides, who DOESN'T have an addiction, be it drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, sex, shopping, etc. Our society's very economic existence is based to a large extent on satisfying those addictions. Certainly liberalism, with its emphasis on self indulgence, envy, materialism, instant gratification, ridicule of traditional values and non-accountability has done a HORRENDUS amount to create the climate in which a `pill' solves everything. There have been historical cycles in drug abuse. As this cycle ends, politicians will claim have been `successful' in winning the war on drugs. That `Traffic' has shown the emptiness of this argument is to its credit. However, that is just about the only good thing I can say about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very compelling and often visceral experience by Soderbergh well worth praising both on attempt and execution.The crucial lines of the film were in the beginning and at the very end:''We're here to listen'' which was said to the counsellor in the drug relief program to ease her daughter's woes by Michael Douglas who recently has been instated as States' new drug control officer yet turned down this offer at the very last point for his own reasons, ironically for his daughter's involvement in drugs.And said by magnificent Benicio 'Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez' Toro to his cop-partner while waiting for a bust on an anonymous tip in the arid,humid and sepia-toned desert near Tijuana-Mexico,his town:''in my dream...may she rest in peace,(my mother) had a plastic bag on his face and could not breathe...''When you walk out of the theater, the excuses and the frequently sensible(relative perception though),explanations of the convicts,victims and the characters and their acts echo in your ear.You ponder over them yet it's very difficult to state an exact right.There's only one thing for sure:Both the trafficking and the struggle to stop this act will continue as long as the only mighty power of mankind prevails;which is money...9/10 overall with very strong appearances from the cast and the supporting actors,the film,for me,felt like 30 mins instead of 147 mins with some very chilling background music at times and awesome cinematography especially when depicting Mexico.I highly recommend this piece of art to all concerned...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not an original story, but an original presentation. We've all seen similar plots in similar films before, but rarely are the performances this believable, the direction this excellent, or the stories this gripping. I loved the changes in cinematography used to contrast the different settings, the highly original camera angles and the clever interweaving of the separate plot lines. I know there are some who think that Zeta-Jones lets the film down, but there is not one dud performance in my opinion. Every cast member shows a strong window into their character's plight. Whilst Del Toro was very good, I did feel that all the acclaim and awards that he received from this role made his performance a little overrated. He was wonderful to watch, but my expectations of him were very high due to the hype surrounding the film. In retrospect, I think I understand what was so impressive. It was great to see Cheadle and Guzmán paired together against a very under-used Miguel Ferrer, as well as Quaid and Douglas in meaty roles. Very refreshing use of interwoven plot lines since the swarm of movies using them post-Pulp Fiction. I've noticed a few comparisons to Magnolia because of this, but that is the only similarity. You get more closure in this movie and it hits the point quickly and clearly. In all, Traffic is an excellent film worthy of all acclaim it had received. It deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar, considering it won in all its other nominated categories (but we all know that Gladiator had the Hollywood Epic sign stamped all over the voters). Do you find it spooky that three of the four Oscar winners from Traffic are named Stephen or Steven?Higher than highly recommended.</fullReview>

At last there's finally a movie that shows how pointless that war is and the whole world has the opportunity to see a movie in which USA people don't place all the blame for that upon our countries.Its format is solid and shows a variety standpoints on the drugs drama. It displays excellent camera work and you'll have the chance to see very good performances by all of its cast. Benicio del Toro plays an excellent character, balanced by the judge, Michael Douglas's role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent but not timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am truly surprised by the negative reviews on this page. I thought the film was excellently crafted, intelligently put together, and Soderbergh got wonderful performances from everyone involved. I am equally surprised by the comments that the story lacked plot. Of course it did. It was about drug traffic, not any individual plot or storyline. It was about the world we are all living in - right here, today, 2001. It was a snapshot of the time and as such it was remarkably well done. If one reads the other comments on this page they will find comments praising the film for it's anti-drug war stance, other's praising it for it's anti-drug stance, still others hating it for either position. That's the magic of this film. Everyone thinks it's biased but there is no consensus on which direction it is biased towards. That takes craftsmanship, and storytelling, and everything else this film's detractors are slamming it for lacking. The proof is in the results. The only negative I see in the film is that in five years it will be completely irrelevant. Great movies are timeless, this is a very good movie that captures it's time. Well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Powerful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I make movies and have my own production company, and must honestly say (and this is rare) that I couldn't have done better myself!Technically, it wasn't a great film. It wasn't supposed to be. The music itself was pulled off the shelf. I'd have to say it almost had a totally "Independent" look. No, the soundtrack of this movie won't be in your nearest store anytime soon. Somewhere between the look of "Blair Witch" and an old "B&amp;W" movie, the important thing wasn't how great the characters looked, or even how much money was spent on special effects.No, this movie totally threw the "Hollywood" formula right out the window, and produced something fresh and much better - which is why I loved it so much. And it was all deliberate and intentional.Don't be fooled by what appears to be a cheap budget. I can't tell you what a great risk the producers took just by doing the film in the first place. Our "Newspaper," the San Diego Union Tribune, hasn't even touched this subject during my 5 years here, for fear of narcoterrorism and retribution, damage to economic and business ties, and reluctance to endanger the well-connected, moving-and-shaking upscale neighbors as excellently protrayed in the film. The story is really about the Arellano Brothers Drug Cartel of Baja, but the bigger point was that if this cartel is arrested and shut down at sundown, a new group will be open for business by morning. Most of the Arellano Felix Brothers seem to be operating the bulk of their business around Coronado, not LaJolla. Both areas have extensive political and business ties to San Diego, as do the Arellano Felix Brothers of Baja.But the film is not limited show Tijuana and San Diego. It also very accurately portrays the pride of even the poorest Mexican youth, while showing the irony of the tragic loneliness and abandonment felt by kids from even our most upscale and privileged neighborhoods in the United States.And I've rarely seen such an accurate portrayal of the game called Washington politics, a dog-pound of leveraged insanity that results in pointing fingers and jobs programs rounded to the nearest 8 or 9 figure numbers. The film-makers realize that even if Washington actually decided to actually solve problems - (and they don't-what would we do with all of those marble monuments and gainfully employed bureaucrats who exist because of problems, not because of solutions) - Washington is also fundamentally inadequate to do so.So what solutions are offered? I won't give away the whole movie, but to say it's likely the producers are interested in finding the solution to our problems within the audience itself. The problem affects all, originates from and exists within all, and from there the solution must be found.I noticed this movie has been produced and distributed by multiple companies. Hopefully the next time someone wants to film San Diego, we'll have a better picture to show them of what we've let ourselves become. But this movie needed to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that very badly WANTS to be "important"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you believe the TV ads and trailers for Traffic, then you'll think it wants to be an Academy Award-winning political action thriller. When you go see it, you'll also realize that it desperately wants to be a so-called "important" film. It's not. Traffic succeeds only in being a moderately entertaining action flick that will not hold up to the scrutiny to which you subject it during the 10-minute car ride home.Actually, what Traffic does is prove that, even with a great subject (the complexity of the North American drug trade and the futility of the US war on drugs) and plenty of recognizable actors, a movie still can't be good without convincing characters and fresh, well-written dialogue.Traffic actually does quite well in showing America's drug problem to be mind-numbingly complex. In one scene, Douglas's new American drug czar asks a planeload of policy experts to give him some new ideas on how to stop the flow of illegal narcotics from Mexico into the US. The only suggestion he receives is a request for more funding and less restricted training of enforcement agents. Otherwise, the plane is a silent as the movie's audience, no one having any idea how the problem might be solved. If the Mexican supply problem is knotty, the demand issue in the States is just as complicated. With high street values, ready availability, and millions of underoccupied, overpaid white suburbanites willing to pay for the goods, there's no way that anybody is going to "just say no" to buying or selling drugs in America anytime soon. Traffic makes the war on drugs seem quixotic, tragic, and ultimately ineffectual, and that, I think is a worthwhile statement to make in a movie.Unfortunately, Traffic makes its statements not with creative filmmaking, but with shameless news talk show moments in which stock characters recite stock speeches designed to explicate the weighty issues without needing to bother with character development or well-crafted screen-writing. The movie occasionally pauses for a minute or two while various characters--the drug czar himself, a beleaguered convict-turned-star-witness, an uppity private high school student--step up on their soap boxes to deliver show-stalling diatribes on drugs in North America. There's nothing wrong with the politics of Traffic, in my opinion, but don't mistake engaging political discourse for good movie-making.So the dialogue is bothersome, but so are the characters who speak it. Traffic presents us a host of characters who are at times engaging but who all too often slip into movie-cliche and stereotypes. There's the high-principled drug czar slightly nauseated by the grasping, hypocritical officials he rubs shoulders with during his Washington workdays. There's his teenage daughter who is ironically abusing drugs recreationally while her father does off fighting the war against those same drugs. There's the marital strife when her drug habit is exposed and dad wants to punish (to send a message) while mom wants to forgive (hasn't she suffered enough already?). We watch the speedy decent of the daughter from weekend abuse to prostitution in a matter of screen minutes (and real life days). It all feels so familiar, which doesn't jibe with the "important" aspirations of the movie. And when Catherine Z-J's character goes from a pregnant wife of a US drug lord who's "never been on my own--there's always been someone" to a sadistic, pregnant lionness who can order mob hits, stare down the Mexican drug king, and produce dolls make of cocaine, I know I'm seeing the kind of movie magic that can only make sense in Hollywood. Simply stated, the movie would be much more legitimately "important" if it could offer believable characters who look like the people I've known rather than the people I've seen in other "important" movies.There's a place for this kind of screenwriting on prime time news shows like 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Nightline. We'll hear speeches like the ones in Traffic on Academy Award night, too, but they will come from the mouths of the privileged, ribbon-wearing presenters and recipients, and (hopefully) not from the nominated films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Picture of the Year; surprised the hell outta me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At fist I thought that was it. That the top 10 list I made up from this year was complete. That was until I saw Steven Soderbergh's best film to date called Traffic, which not only broke through my top 10 list, it went straight to one. Because this is quite the impressive thriller/drama combo.The film has a story with 3 different stories all connecting (not all to each other, but in one way or another) about drugs. The drug selling, the people in the government trying to fight drugs, the problems in Mexico with drug cartels and people who don't even know that the money they get is from drug sales. It is a vicious cycle that is well brought together by fine acting including Benicio Del-Torro as a hard working mexican cop brought in to fight the cartels, and Michael Douglas as a Judge who becomes the new drug czar while his daughter is slipping down the spiral of drugdome (ie Coke, Crack and Smack). All of the performances are top notch and with that plus expert cinematography (I love the idea of having a different look for Mexico and a look for US) and finite direction, this is one of the best films I have ever seen on drugs in general.

		<shortDescription>A very complex plot that all boils down to one thing...futility.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a VERY complex film--one with many different plots occurring all over the United States and Mexico. What makes this very unusual is that many of the plots are NOT clearly interconnected. So, what one group of characters do in Cincinnati or San Diego might have nothing directly to do with folks in Mexico or DC--at least not until later in the film. Indirectly, though, they are all part of the drug trafficking world as well as the war on drugs. Together, these many different stories all paint a very, very grim picture--a picture of futility about our government's attempts to get a handle on the illegal drug trade. Because of the fine craftsmanship in making the film, you can't help but be pulled into their message that what we are doing now simply isn't working. Clearly, the film is trying to make a political statement. And, if you don't believe its message, you sure will have your thinking challenged. And, you have to respect what this film has accomplished."Traffic" earned four Oscars and I can see why it won so many awards. However, one of them left me baffled. While Benicio Del Toro did a good job in the film (I have no complaints at all about his acting), I marvel that he received the Best Actor award simply because this film has no star--just lots and lots and lots of vignettes with lots and lots of actors. If I saw the film and had to identify the star of "Traffic" without knowing about the Oscar win, I would have no idea who THE star was. I might think it was Del Toro or Michael Douglas or Don Cheadle. I know it's not done, but it sure would have been nice to have given an award to the entire cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Proof positive that I can set my political opinions aside and enjoy a well-made film is "Traffic". It is a relevant exploration into the gray area of illegal drugs that uses compelling dialogue and interesting characters to create a atmospheric film. Considering the impact drugs have had on our society, it is a tale worth telling. The interweaving stories are complementary and not confusing at all, as some have complained. The cast delivers at all points, especially Del Toro who is was a perfect pick for his role.In the DVD liner notes Soderbergh says that he took a neutral tone into the work, but I disagree. Their are two tendentious expostulations in the movie that reveal an agenda. The first is Seth's (Grace) lecture to Wakefield (Douglas) in the car where he pontificates about racism and the lure of drugs (by the way i think this proves that Topher Grace is not acting at all in his roles and actually is a little punk and that the only reason to even watch "That 70s Show" anymore is the faint hope that Red will really punch the annoying twit). The second is Wakefield's ending speech, complete with aposiopesis, that borders on melodrama, and frankly, nonsense. I mean the guy's daughter just prostituted herself to multiple men for the drugs she is addicted to and he chooses to become effete? Very counterintuitive and unlikely.It was a film that made me think, but did not change my mind on the issue of illegal drugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands Down One of the Best Films Ever Produced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is one of the best films ever made and arguably the best and most important film of the past decade. The war on drugs is examined from three major angles. In Washington, D.C. Michael Douglas has been appointed as the new U.S. anti-drug czar. What he does not know is that his teenaged daughter (Erika Christensen) in Cincinnati has become a heroin addict. In sunny San Diego, two detectives (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) have caught middle-man Miguel Ferrer and now he has pointed the finger at boss Steven Bauer. Ferrer is now protected by the two detectives, awaiting his court date to testify. Bauer's trophy wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is unaware of her husband's "business", but proves to be a quick study when the chips are down. Attorney and family friend Dennis Quaid is also along for the ride, but his motives will not be clear until the film's finale. Meanwhile two detectives in Mexico (Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) are walking a dangerous line of corruption which involves the government, the police, the drug traffickers themselves, and a war-like general (Tomas Milian). They experience the drug-war at its very worst and in the end their safety is not a sure-thing. "Traffic" is outstanding in every sense of the word. The cinematography is sharp as it shows differences in D.C. (dark, sterile, blue-lighting), Cincinnati (accurate photography), San Diego (slightly hazy), and Mexico (very dirty, much like a cheap 1960s color film). Stephen Gaghan's Oscar-winning screenplay is one of the best during the history of the cinema (ranking right up there with "Citizen Kane"). Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-winning direction is excellent. He handles the story-lines very well and the film is never slow, confusing, or hard to follow. The casting is perfect all over the board. "Traffic" is a film easily on par with "The French Connection", another movie that deals with drug-trafficking. It also has the epic feel of "The Godfather". "Traffic" is an exceptional piece of film-making that is destined to become a classic piece of the cinema. Then again, it may already be. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a movie that features three characters -- a Mexican Cop (Benicio Del Toro), a Senator who is the head of the DEA (Michael Douglas) and the wife of a drug baron (Catherine Zeta-Jones)-- and their three stories in the drug business in the US and Mexico. There's also a fourth story concerning two US cops but it's more of a sub-feature. The stories are connected, but don't overlap and the characters don't meet each other.Although this movie is intended as a "serious" look at the "drug problem" it comes across as a pathetic joke. Aside from the story featuring Del Toro, few of the situations, characters or resolutions are even remotely connected to reality. In addition, the themes and commentary are preachy and contrived. To me, this movie is a parody of Hollywood "message" movies. The more I think about it, as I am writing this review, the movie is... what's the word?... oh yeah, stupid.Here's just one scene that is so idiotic that it defies description. The Senator's teen-aged daughter has become a drug addict, run away from home and is living with a drug dealer in the ghetto. The Senator finds out where she is and shows up at the ghetto tenement to get his daughter back. Threatened by the dealer, the Senator breaks down and begs the dealer to turn over his daughter, and then meekly leaves when the dealer says no. Is there any father in the world, especially one who is a US Senator, who would act like this when his daughter's life is at stake???This movie was written and directed by a crew of idiots. And ironically enough, they were probably on drugs when they did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it again on TV, and everything I thought about this film the first time still stands. It has great lines. It has powerful, moving scenes. But this is one of those films that was molested by a directorial technique. In this case, it was what we call color correcting or DI, Digital Intermediary. Sodenberg - whose many films I like - chose to make the narrative storyline have a color theme. Blue-ish for the drug-addled kid. Orange-reds for the Mexico stuff, and so on. Wow. Deep.That technique, heisted from TV commercials, music videos, and hack college students, rarely suits a good feature film, and almost always looks lousy when employed for such a stretch. It usually distracts and detracts, and this film is just plain annoying. This top-250 indulgence - this highly vaunted film is no exception.***Here are the scene spoilers*** This film sucks beyond DI because...That "let's smuggle toys made completely of cocaine". This crappy film *pivoted* on that ridiculous premise. That was borrowed from a 007 film. When I go to a 007 film, I expect to be entertained. But this was a BIG STATEMENT Film, and it has nothing but BS and to back it. Or a poorly thought-out story. Bad story.Oh, and there is Luis Guizman's character getting killed by being blown up in an car because of an assassin's bomb. And the cutaway is for show, and it features a 50-year-old couple ducking for cover from the explosion. But twenty seconds earlier, there is a huge shootout, maybe twenty-five bullets or more BLASTING out of half a dozen guns or so. And yet, THIS COUPLE, FIFTY FEET AWAY, WAS NOT DUCKING FOR COVER ALREADY???????? Instead, they are ducking for the big car bomb explosion. Makes for good visuals, sure. But while it had visual impact, this film is supposed to represent something real, and totally unreal moments just makes it suck MORE. Bad Story.Bad (really, high-school level) story, directing, and editing.It was not cohesive, it was stupidly directed and color-corrected, it was not a great cut, c'mon, must I go on? So much for Big Statements. Go watch another incoherent high-holy obfuscated mess, Crash. Or go watch Enchanted, see if I care. But avoid, avoid, avoid this over-hyped tripe.You either agree with me or you'll watch the film again.</fullReview>

Worst of all, the plot line of the original German-British TV series was butchered almost beyond recognition.One of the critical elements of the series, both dramatically and in terms of the fundamental telling of the tale, was omitted entirely, and arbitrarily. Without the storyline of the opium farmer, this telling is incomplete.What is left is told without passion or commitment. The characters are detached, shallow and uninteresting. They seem nearly as bored with the movie as we are.And what can be said of Soderberg's art-school direction? Smug? Distracting? Gimmicky? He insultingly assumes we cannot distinguish one locale from another without using that laughably awful color-scheme. Well, if that's the case, it's a problem introduced by the director himself -- jiggling the camera around until the audience is claustrophobic and nauseous.Anyone who is tempted to think this a good film, let alone a great one, owes it to themselves to sit down with the original series (entitled "Traffik") the next time it appears on PBS. They will see much the same story told with clarity, punch and realism -- not to mention performances you will not soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The inane nature of this awful movie shows why America has no coherent policy on Drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only someone extremely stoned could be impressed with this tainted piece of fluff. The plot (what little there was) was so flat and cliche as to be sleep-inducing. The acting was mediocre, at best. The cinematography was cliche (anyone else see "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and her Lover"?) The "color change equals mood change" has been done to death.As a true-blue American movie fan, I could ignore all of these flaws with ease if the movie didn't attempt to make some high-and-mighty statement that ended up leaving a very sour taste in my mouth.First, let's address the race issue, because that's the most appalling aspect of this film. According to this movie: Drugs are shipped here by evil unscrupulous and corrupt Mexicans, they are imported by latin-americans with dumb-but-corruptable wives, they are fought against by slightly hypocritical, but otherwise likeable aging white men, and they victimize pretty little white boys and girls who end up ruining their honor roll status. Come on. The height of the racial tragedy that is this movie is when the pretty little white girl's depravity is symbolized by her sleeping with the large naked black man who sells crack through the door. The little stupid speech in the car by the kid from "That '70s Show" is only icing on the putrid cake that is the twisted racial message portrayed by this awful slop.Even if we could get past the racial issue, there is still the issue of socio-economic class, an issue very much tied up in America's drug woes. That issue, to say the least, is bass-ackwards in this movie. Basically, the only people portrayed as injured are very rich people, while the people who live in the "bad neighborhood" are quite happy to profit off of the suburban kids' drug habits. Let's face it, drug dealers live in bad neighborhoods because that's where their customers are. 90% of drugs go to the inner city, and stay in the inner city.Finally, the backhanded way that American foreign policy is dealt with shows how far from the truth the writer of this movie really was. It is also offensive to believe that the only people capable of solving crime in Mexico are DEA agents. Typically, it has been American DEA agents that contributed to all sorts of corruption in Latin America.I could go on, but this movie isn't worth any more words. I strongly suggest avoiding this crud. If you want a "fun and brutal" drug movie, go watch Scarface, or even (yuck) New Jack City. They were both better than Traffic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the war on drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drugs have been a huge focus in the US since the 1980s. States like Miami, California and even my home state of Texas were at one time havens for anybody looking to get into the drug trade. With the legalization of pot in some states though, the focus appears to be shifting more towards harder drugs like coke and heroin. This movie does a great job of showing the effect that drugs can have on people that don't even use them. Families dissolve, people get killed, and the process repeats itself. All the performances are great, and the stories are written insanely well. The only real problem I had was the filters. Whenever a scene was taking place in Mexico, the screen would have this sepia tone on it. I'm sure it was placed there to highlight the deserts of Mexico, but it started to irritate me after awhile. The same thing goes for whenever Michael Douglas is on screen and everything's blue. Other than that though, everything else is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic (2000): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, Amy Irving: Provocative masterpiece about the impact of drugs in our society. Michael Douglas plays a district attorney leading the war against drugs yet is unaware of his daughter's drug addiction until she is taken into police custody. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a wife whose husband is arrested for drug possession. When she cannot bail him out, she plots to have the squealer murdered. Benicio Del Toro plays a Mexican cop assigned to bring down a drug lord. He suspects foul play on behalf of his partner and is left with a decision that marks him with regret. Steven Soderbergh's best film to date, and certainly better than that overrated wretch he directed the same year called Erin Brockovich. Superb performance by Douglas whose ethics are crossed when family is involved. Zeta-Jones is excellent as a woman of vicious means. Del Toro is flawless as a cop who sees the dread of the system. Don Cheadle plays a cop out to avenge his partner's death and uses clever means in order to plant a device. Amy Irving is featured as the the wife of Douglas and whose daughter is involved in these crimes. Well crafted film that addresses its theme in a non traditional manner, which is needed. It is not so much about the drug war but about reclaiming those from its clutches. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intermixed story-lines depicting the drug industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This complex and inter-weaving story-line gives a great overview of the many different 'stages' so to speak, of the drug industry. From the creation of drugs in Mexico, to the distribution and consumption of it in America. There is a filter used that depicts Mexico as a dirty and corrupt land while America is presented as clean and sterile. I did not really care for this contrast, though it did add to the mood of the scenes.The acting was pretty good as well. All the actors and actresses did well in their parts. Plus, because there are so many characters to follow, we do not get much character development. But the film does show how the drug industry affects each of these characters and how it changes them. I liked how this film makes the characters come into contact with each other, while not really knowing the other person. For example one would walk by another and not even interact, but the camera would be following one character and then switch to another. I think this might have happened more than once, but I can only think of one instance in which this happened. It is a cool technique regardless. The action is very thrilling and engaging, with each story-line making you invest in the outcome. Also, though many things are occurring and one would expect to be easily lost and confused, that does not happen. The film carries itself well, and the directing and editing is great in keeping the audience on top of what is happening on screen. The transitions between characters happen so smoothly that you do not feel that you have just gone from state to state, or to another country. Overall, a great movie depicting most aspects of the drug industry. An all star cast with a great story, the film also hints at how Mexico who mass produces the drugs aren't only to blame, as the demand is coming from the U.S. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a director with something to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Soderbergh, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary talents, has made over thirty films, some generating modest reception and others reaching high levels of praise. Traffic, by textbook definition, is probably his objective "best," generating awards, controversy, discussion, shedding light on an issue, and most importantly, profit. All of its additional successes and trivia-points are well-deserved, as this is a truly compelling picture, unfairly shortchanged, presently, in the public eye. In a world where "the war on drugs" has escalated to unprecedented heights and profits are raging uncontrollably, this is a film that doesn't age with time and shows more than what should've been allowed.To put it simply and bluntly, Traffic is a work of an anti-anthology, where we are introduced to a number of characters in similar situations, yet none of them ever come full-circle in a wraparound story. I will make an effort sum up the characters and their stories as quickly as possible, so as to leave much to be desired to you. For starters, Benicio Del Toro plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer torn between which of the two Mexican drug cartels he runs to continue supporting. Should he fend for one and forget the other, or turn in his information to higher authorities and completely compromise the profits he gets to survive? Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, a conservative politician attempting to combat "the war on drugs" as quickly as possible, at the same time he finds out his own daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is a cocaine addict. Ranking in the top three in her Junior class at an exclusive private high school, Caroline resorts from hitting the books to feeding the habit, resorting to prostitution to support this lethal addiction. The final "main" story centers around Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an upper-middle-class woman whose life is shell-shocked when her husband is arrested for drug dealing, she realizes, and must take up a life of being a drug mule to possibly save his well-being in prison.Another story that keeps popping up every now and then involves Ray and Montel (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle), two undercover detectives usually working inside their van and staging drug-busts on suspects. Their work is dangerous, demanding, and often, meticulously staged and they wouldn't have it any other way.Right off the bat, it's hard not to recognize the amazing cast of champions Traffic serenely, but effectively boasts. If there's a word for their performances all together, it's nuanced, as they are not showy and none of them appear to be designed with awards in mind. Everyone here, most notably Douglas and Del Toro, although there's not an average one in the bunch, are low-key and compelling, mainly due to their sympathetic nature. Even the most despicable acts done by characters, we at least have the ability to see where the characters are coming from.There are, undoubtedly, dozens of truths one can extract from Traffic in an effort to completely prove "the war on drugs" to be nonsense and almost wholly ineffective. The one truth I, myself, can extract with full confidence is a point brought up by Caroline, which is "it's easier for me and my friends to get drugs than alcohol." Because alcohol is legal, it's regulated heavily, with a certain age to be able to consume it. When it comes to drugs, especially with many of the hardcore ones banned in America, they are sold illegally by men and women who do not care what age the person is or what their reason is for acquiring such drugs. So long as they get money and lose some supplies, they couldn't care less what happens to them or what becomes of their habits.As of right now, this is Soderbergh's most daring exercise. He boldly stands up to the narcotics controversy that has plagued American for an untold number of years, showing the effects of prohibition and how numerous lives have intentionally and unintentionally been effected by drugs. This is not a work of exploitation or shock, but of blunt honesty, showing how numerous different people are effected and thrown into turmoil by a huge problem that is almost too large to contain. In many ways, I believe the issue of drugs isn't too far germane to the gun control issue. It seems people are bringing up flawed solutions to closet their views on the underlying, truly unavoidable result; the problem will likely never go away.On a final note, pay attention to the cinematography during the course of this film. The scenes in Mexico are heavily saturated, making the film have a yellowish glow to it, due to the sunshine and the gold sand. Often we can be blinded by the oppressive sunlight almost penetrating the camera lens through every shot, growing more and more fierce with every sequence. As a stylistic attribute, it's a rather noteworthy one, and may have subtle ambiguous serendipity to the story. Could it be that the climate as an effect on their behavior? Or that the sun itself represents something larger, like a watching eye? Or maybe does it reflect the constantly glaring, incorruptible pressure of their job by showing the oppressive relentless of something. Like many instances in Traffic, Soderbergh leaves you to be the judge.Starring: Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Steven Bauer, and James Brolin, and Topher Grace.

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece Multi-Character Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a crime drama film that explores the illegal drug trade from a number of perspectives: a user, an enforcer, a politician and a trafficker. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although some of the characters do not meet each other. The cast includes Michael Douglas,Don Cheadle,Benicio del Toro,Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones.The screenplay was written by Stephen Gaghan,which was based upon a miniseries originally aired in Britain; and it directed by Steven Soderbergh.The movie divides its time among three main story lines and almost a dozen locales. The first and primary plot thread, set in Ohio and Washington, D.C., concerns freshly-appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield, whose enthusiasm for his new prestige position is quickly offset when he realizes his 16- year-old daughter Caroline is graduating from recreational drug use to habitual abuse which happens to be a secret that his wife, Barbara has kept from him. South of the border, Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez attempts to wage his own war on drugs, heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his partner Manolo Sanchez. Surrounded by corruption, Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise, which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar, the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile, San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro, leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife, Helena. At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante, Arnie Metzger,Helena decides to carry on the family business that causes tragic consequences.Traffic is such a complex film yet artfully done in such a way that you cannot help but sit back and admire it.In terms of modern films, it kicked off a whole list of issue-related multi-character dramas like Syriana, Crash, and Babel.Apparently,it holds a candle to the films mentioned previously or it may be the best of all of them, even if some of its stories are stronger than others.Aside from that,the issues of ethics are gray rather than being presented as black-and-white especially with with no clear-cut good and bad characters in the film.Finally,great performances abound in this film from the cast involved.Also,don't forget the great direction and screenplay that it is easy to say that this film work at all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic is Soderbergh at his commanding best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2000 was a great year for Steven Soderbergh, who made two Oscar-winning films in Erin Brockovich and Traffic, the latter landing him his first Academy Award for Best Director. Traffic missed out on the Best Picture award, which went to Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), but managed to pocket four statuettes in total, including a Best Supporting Actor win for Benicio Del Toro. Considering that Traffic is an independent film of sorts, it is a remarkable achievement. Soderbergh's work is deservedly acclaimed, and it remains to be one of the American auteur's most potent efforts.Together with Alejandro Inarritu's Amores Perros (2000), Traffic also made popular the trend of dramas weaving separate story lines into each other, forming an intricate web where characters, often strangers to each other, interact by chance. In Traffic, this interaction is not as pronounced or life-changing as observed in, for instance, Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003) or Babel (2006), because for Soderbergh, his interest is to depict the far-reaching effects of an issue that has plagued the U.S for decades ? drug trafficking, or more specifically, cocaine trafficking.The "main" storyline follows a judge Robert Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas), appointed by the U.S government to work towards stopping the devastation that drugs bring upon Americans, especially the young. In an ironic twist of fate, Robert discovers that his daughter is addicted to cocaine, straining their family dynamics. The two other story lines include a high-flying wife whose husband is arrested for his involvement in a drug smuggling business, and a Mexican cop (Del Toro) who finds it tough to impose law in his corrupt city.From the film's first moments, it is fairly obvious that Soderbergh intends to achieve a visual look through the use of color that would help viewers identify the different settings. Saturated yellow is used to depict the harsh and hot Mexican desertscape, while a cool blue tint envelopes Robert's world of cold politics. A natural color tone is used for the rest of the film. As it may be confusing to follow the film because of its rapid change of setting, Soderbergh's use of color is spot-on, and also adds considerably to the overall aesthetic of the film.I would like to give special mention to Douglas, whom I feel gives the best performance here. Sorry Del Toro. But I thought his portrayal of a man torn apart by the escalating war on drugs, both on the "battlefield " and at home lends a strong emotional touch that provides Traffic with a measure of human warmth in a mostly hard-hitting film, most evidently in the scene where Robert finds her drugged daughter in a worn-down hotel in a town populated by blacks.While gritty and violent, Traffic also gives us a glimpse of the fragility of the human condition. It works as an anti-drug film, and despite it not being as visceral and explicit as Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000), it is still a timely (and painful) reminder of the detrimental effect of drug use. The futility of fighting the war on drugs is laid bare here because of corruption, inadequate laws, and the sheer profitability of the industry. Traffic is Soderbergh at his commanding best, a film that is both powerful and unsettling, capturing the essence of the U.S-Mexico drug trade as it is, and without the need to moralize.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic Movie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The war on drugs has proved to be a difficult battle. "Traffic" itself has given us viewers a clear and speculative glimpse of how much is truly lost in this war, who the enemy is, and who truly suffers in the end. Director Steven Soderbergh divides this well made close look into the world of drug trafficking, separating its plot into 3 individual stories, showing the multiple aspects of the war on drugs. The main factors he tries to educate viewers on are the concepts of addiction, widespread corruption, and even the desperation shown by several characters. It all begins with a simple drug bust, turning into a variety of open opportunities for Mexican police officer named Javier Rodriguez (Del Torro), in the eyes of a questionable Military general, using what he's seen to further eliminate more drug cartels, including the real life Tijuana Cartel. You'd think that all the efforts General Salazar is making to eliminate these cartels is noble and cunning, only to work more for his advantage, as well as for those he truly works for, the Juarez Cartel. The film shifts back to the U.S. where Judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas), hits the big time in Washington, earning the title of a Drug Czar, hoping to reduce the flow of drug trafficking, and the consumption of illegal substances. In the eyes of a politician it will be challenging, and even inspiring. But how will it see to the person they truly are at home, when the very enemy they are fighting comes in the form of a loved one? Wakefield's daughter's addiction to multiple lethal drugs bring her father into a new viewed aspect on how challenging the war on drugs really is, entailing the true horrors of waging war on someone who means the world to you. In San Diego, 2 undercover DEA cops, Gordon (Cheadle) and Castro (Ruiz) bust a big time drug dealer, who willingly makes a deal to sell out the big man of his operation, as well as the father of his second child to come from his spoiled and soon to be corruptible wife Helena Ayala (Zeta-Jones). As Carlos Ayala, is dragged out of his home, and placed on trial, Helena's desperation to protect her son, and maintain the wealthy lifestyle she's been accustomed to drive her to the tainted art of her husbands unforgivable business of illegal distribution. All it took was some debt, some threats from their rival groups, and a little push from her husbands lawyer Arnie (Quiad). All these stories put these characters into corners where their moral compasses direct them to make final decisions that influence not only each other, but the general outcome of America's stance on the war on Drugs. Javier faces the difficult decision of whether or not he should side with Salazar as well the very drug distributing devils who make life in Mexico hell, or if he should reveal all that he knows to the DEA, in the exchange that they make a change for the children in his neighborhood. Robert realizes the depth of how vicious a battle they are facing against drugs, seeing the desperate acts of his daughter's addiction to obtain more drugs. Helena folded and decided to stain her soul with the choice of her husbands business and all its requirements, including the will to murder, lie, and further push for the distribution of drugs in America, with more advanced knowledge. As we've seen the war on drugs in America is a war where winning seems impossible, particularly in the methods the politicians, and state and local agencies hoped for. It's not clear if we will win this war, however our efforts proved not in vain, as the actions of few show that many out there have the possibilities to make a difference to win this long battle. Roberts actions to listen and support his daughter are noble enough to prove that despite facing an unwant able enemy, our hope is not lost. Javier's need to help those in need, and throw away his desires to help those without fortune show the desire to change, what the influence drugs and their cartels have created for innocent and easily corruptible people. I especially enjoyed the conclusion to Helena's story, how Gordon in a premeditated act, slips a transmitter well enough to show, that the enemies will at some point face the true hands of Justice. "Traffic" is more than just a look into the very process of transporting drugs across the border and there. It's also a glimpse of the battle of those for and against drugs, how this conflict affects our country and the people in it. This battle is still going on today, right now, and despite the odds of percentages against us, through our determination to not only cut down the distribution, but help those tainted by drugs is comforting enough for Director Soderbergh to send the message that we can win this war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's Academy-Award-Winning Film 'Traffic' is indeed a treat of a film. First of all, by saying Treat, I mean, for those who love dark/intelligent cinema. This 2000 classic doesn't belong to mad-cap movie-fans.'Traffic' explores the intricacies of the illegal drug trade from a number of perspectives: a user, an enforcer, a politician and a trafficker. Their point of views and expressions are wonderfully explored on in those odd 145-minutes. The characters are so twisted and interesting, that just don't lose yourself in your seat. It has also has a terrific culmination working all the way to the advantage.Steven Soderbergh's direction is a pure genius. He handles a tough subject with multi-color and as mentioned, twisted characters. And, his Oscar-Win is his greatest compliment. Peter Andrews's Cinematography is top-notch. Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan is tough enough. Stephen Mirrione's editing leaves no stone unturned to become legendary.In the acting department, Benicio del Toro is absolutely amazing in a multiple-award-winning role. Michael Douglas is first-rate, as always. Erika Christensen is excellent. Catherine Zeta-Jones does well. Don Cheadle is hugely effective. Dennis Quaid is superb in a role that offers him shades.On the whole, an experience you have to catch if haven't. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Ensemble Film About Drugs in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping ensemble drama from on again/off again director Steven Soderbergh about the drug trade in the U.S. and its impact on three inter-related narratives.The best of these concerns a white, privileged teen and her boyfriend, and highlights the clueless suburban parents who pigeon hole drug use as an inner city problem that can't possibly affect their precious darlings. Another strong storyline involves a mother who turns to drug trafficking as the only way to keep her little boy safe. This was the first film to suggest that Catherine Zeta-Jones (who plays the mother) could actually act.Soderbergh, who himself served as the film's cinematographer, chooses to film each of the three story lines in starkly different lighting schemes, a gimmick intended no doubt to help audiences keep track of the complicated narrative and which should be annoying, but which instead lends the film a unique style.Grade: A</fullReview>

I notice that border towns in Mexico looked very bleak in this film, but if you Google Earth many of the same places they look friendly, with kids playing on the streets and no feeling of violence in the air. Hollywood Hollywood, whats your real name girl...lots of that here. Not really a bad film, but it takes a morally ambiguous stance as to the nature of how people behave when confronted with true adversity. People vary, but maybe have more strength than this film gives them credit for, in general. I did find it hard to believe a perfect student would be doing drugs like heroine and cocaine, which is what the producer expects you to believe. Hollywood Hollywood, etc. There are so many films like this that it is sometimes hard to know where the reality ends and the fiction begins in terms of the story being based on real life...your guess is as good as mine. Sophisticated yet primitive. Cerebral yet confused, like a hat tied to a sculpture being painted by an angry child. It titillates yet gives you nothing in return and that's why we love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Impossible War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1980s American intercities became notorious for becoming horrible slums, with people becoming addicted to crack and heroin. People started to take more drugs, in North America, Western Europe and even in the Soviet Union. Many countries ended up supplying the drugs, such as Columbia, Panama and Afghanistan. Ronald Reagen even declared on the war on drugs, a massive domestic and international effort to stop the flow of drugs in America. America is still fighting this war. The war on drugs became a source of influence to American storytellers, such as Tom Clancy with his good novel Clear and Present Danger, some episodes of the greatest American TV show the West Wing, and of course, Traffic, which was based on a British TV series. The action within Traffic ends up transfered from the UK to the United States and Mexico.Traffic tells three interwoven stories. One story is set in Mexico, about a Baja Californian police officer, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro): an officer who isn't corrupt. He gets recruited by General Salazar (Tomás Milián), who is the head of Mexican anti-drugs campaign. In Ohio and Washington D.C. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes the head of the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and sees that massive scope of the problem. His 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen), who is a very intelligence, happens to be addicted to heroin and cocaine. Robert has to tackle both a massive political problem, and a problem at home. The third story is set in San Diego, about Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a suburban woman whom happen has been arrested for being a drug boss. She ends up getting in debt and struggling to survive. Her husband is being investigated by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán). Helena is slowly forced into dark underbelly of crime.All three stories could easily have worked as individual films: but Stephen Gaghan and Steven Soderbergh have done a brilliant job combining the three stories in a really compelling film. It shows the complex nature of the war on drugs, from the cartels in Mexico who supply the drugs (and as we have seen recently Mexico is turning Columbia), law-enforcement in both the United States and Mexico, the actions that American politicians takes, from treatment problems, to law enforcement, and the personal efforts it on people. It's a complex film, and that's what makes it good. Gaghan deserves his Oscar for screenplay. Soderbergh won a Best Oscar for Traffic. He was nominated the year before for Edin Brockovich, which was a more Hollywood type film, Traffic had a more independence feel to it, and is Soderbergh's best film. He keeps the balance of all three story, not letting any of them drop. The film is wonderfully shot, using different filters and colours for the different stories. The Mexican story shot almost like a 70s style thriller, the Wakefield story is shot with blue lighting, giving it a more indie drama feel, and the action in San Diego is shot like a normal American film/TV programme, like the Wire. They is good pacing, and keeps the film going. He shows real skill dealing with a complex script.There is an excellent cast to the film, Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle are two talented actors who rarely put a foot wrong, both giving very good performance. Michael Douglas is in his best role since playing Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. This is easily going to be the best film Catherine Zeta-Jones will ever do. Erika Christensen gives a compelling performance as a drug addicted teenager, whilst Topher Grace is perfectly annoying (as he was meant to be). However, I did not like the slightly camp quality in Tomás Milián's performance.A brilliant film, 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish films this good were made more often. Traffic tackles the drug war problem in a unique way with intertwining stories. I love how it depicts the drug problem on three levels: (1) An individual basis (the struggle of an addict), (2) the effects it has on the family, (3) and the effects on the country (and world). All these come together to form the perfect story that sheds light on an issue that all of us may not be too familiar with. Especially considering everything that goes on behind the scenes in the drug trafficking world, we need to learn about just how bad it really is. Along with Benicio Del Toro's acting, Traffic well deserved the Best Picture Oscar in 2000. Erica Christensen also amazed me with her performance, which was a very difficult one to play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think one of the best things an actor can have in the way they act, is when the acting's so good it's not acting...it's real. The actor that portrayed that the most in this was with out a doubt, Benicio!!! I was so amazed to hear he got an academy award for this!! I'm so proud of him, I feel like crying. Anyway this cast could not have been better, everyone acted outstandingly even the Francisco character he acted great!! In the very end of the film, there was something about it that just touched the heck out of me, well I think it was because of what Benicio said in the beginning... and it came true! It was right the movie end that way, it was right it end with him. Any movie that is based on conflicts and issues of things that have happened, and things that are happening, I think those films usually mean a lot to us in a way because we get to fully grasp what actually goes on in the world. This movie did a hell of a job on that. See this movie if you would like to know more or if you just want to see some good acting, or both!!! Whatever, the movie was real and true, the acting, real and true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading all the comments after picking this DVD up at the rental store, I was looking forward to a high quality movie representation of the drug scene in America. Overall, however, i was left with a feeling of "Is that all?" It all comes down to the final scene where Michael Douglas' character is giving his speech to the support group, and, just like another person has suggested here, it was just too much, too cheesy, and too cliché.Having said that Michael Douglas fills his role well and Benicio Del Toro was nice to watch.Worth seeing once perhaps but this one was definitely over-rated 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is magnificent in many ways: the multidimensional story, the correct words using plot, the well developed characters and the artistic editing were flawless.The story was told from different point of view at the same time, and you get in touch with all of them. There was not expected nor unexpected, fair nor unfair ending, there was just an ending the way life is.I can tell there was a deep research in order to get the plot done and the characters developed, because of the language, the slang and the attitude toward every situation. There was no heroes, neither victims just characters living situations for the first time in their lives and doing what they can. There were a lot of remarkable quotes (you can see some of them in the quotes section) which were a reflexion call for the viewers.The editing and photograph was the best, since the director (Steven Soderbergh) used different kind of filters, lights and shadows according to the feeling he was trying to sell. He was successful in doing it. Making this an extraordinary Audio-Visual experience.Even though I have seen this "theme" (The drug world) a hundred times. This is the first time somebody do it not only in the right way, but in the perfect way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld has a cameo in this movie as himself, at a cocktail party. As a Massachusetts resident, I'm not sure whether I should be honored or frightened that he was in a movie that almost won the Best Picture Oscar. At any rate, this movie is basically 2 1/2 hours that underscore all the flaws with our nation's drug policies, and it does so in style. It focuses on three separate story lines: Michael Douglas plays the newly appointed drug czar; Benicio del Toro is a Mexican cop and Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a major drug dealer living in style. I don't want to get too much into the details of the movie because then I burn up too much of my allotted 1,000 words here. But suffice it to say that you watch the movie and you say to yourself, "This is everything that's wrong with our War on Drugs." I like the feel of the movie too, the Drug Czar scenes are done on high-quality film stock while the Mexican scenes are done on much grainier film. It's also pretty interesting that Benicio del Toro won Best Supporting Actor in a role where he barely speaks a word of English. Get your hands on this movie and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decided to rewatch this after seeing "Syriana" recently and see why I remembered "Traffic" being so much better. From what I can tell it was just because the stories didn't intertwine, so it was far less confusing, plus the story was more interesting with a stronger cast."Traffic" follows several major stories that look into the drug trade, particularly between Mexico and America. The major story lines are:-Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the newly elected drugs chief who is intent on defeating the drug industry in his country and in his home.-Javier (Benicio Del Torre), a Mexican cop pushing it uphill to bring down some of the cartels in Mexico -Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), a drugs cop overseeing the protection of a key figure about to stand trial and name names.The movie jumps between stories and shows us the enormity of the fight and the battles individuals on the frontline face. All of the stories are interesting, particularly the Mexican setting with one of the best 50 performances in a movie of all-time by Del Torre. It's well shot, well played out and keeps you intrigued.Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, a good film for students of sociology and criminal justice classes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Traffic is a useful commentary on the obvious relationship between family, government, and law enforcement and the overall drug problem. One might begin the discussion with the question, is there a drug problem at all? As a former federal parole officer I can tell you that many parolees with drug problems often commented that they did not have a problem with drugs at all. It was society that had the problem and that drugs were simply a recreational alternative and adaptation to the world itself. Obviously, this is a mechanism used by deviants to manage their deviance. It is obviously a problem if your parole officer has to violate you and send you back to prison. Redefining the deviant act and finding explanations that can make it acceptable are often utilized by the deviant.I found the film useful in discussing the relationship between the three underlying components related to the drug problem: international diplomacy, law enforcement, and the family. This involves understanding the nexus between micro and macro issues. The government and underlying greed and corruption pose a systemic and macro sociological dimension. The family and law enforcement can be usefully viewed inside the labeling perspective and takes on some interesting twists with regard to deviance in general. the micro sociological issues surrounding the law enforcement strategies (the use of informants, and the typical street-savvy expertise of the narcs were excellent displays of this phenomenon.Students might understand the complex web of meanings that can both explain and obfuscate the so-called drug problem. Deviance is relative to the context in which it is found. It is again similar to the other categories of deviance easily classified in criminal justice courses, but becomes problematic in the domain of the sociologist.The following issues are raised in terms of both juvenile justice, deviance, and general introduction to criminal justice course work:In the movie, TRAFFIC, the main themes surrounding the drug problem are portrayed. What do you think is the solution to the drug problem? Is there a drug problem? does rehabilitation, law enforcement, or international diplomacy play the key role(s) in solving the problem? Is one more important than the other?How does the family contribute to the problem of drug abuse? What is the attitude of the parents, the spouse? and how does the family play a role in the overall drug abuse problem?What is the relationship between government, the individual families, and law enforcement and how does each interact with the other in contributing to the overall drug problem/solution?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, realistic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was living in North Carolina and had never traveled to the US/Mexico border. I had experienced the same exposure to drugs as every high schooler raised in America has but had never used drugs. I saw friends and relative self-destruct, but was not really involved in the game. I thought it was a very good and interesting movie. A few years later I watched this movie as a federal agent working on the front lines of the drug war in southern CA. I now know what an extraordinary movie this is. The story line is realistic. The cinematography is amazing. Anyone who has traveled to a Mexican border town can instantly relate to the yellow tint used in the film. Political correctness aside, Mexico is DIRTY. The only "hero" in the movie was the Mexican cop trying to avoid corruption. I know it is a cliché that Mexican police are corrupt, but that is easy to say until you have walked a mile in their boots. Cartels run Mexico. Work with them or die is often your only options as a Mexican official. Mex cops are paid little and have everything to lose by enforcing the law. I don't condone it, but I understand why. Traffic is the only movie I have ever seen that portrays this group of people as they really are. Bottom line, traffic is as entertaining and realistic movie as you will see coming out of Hollywood. And it has an important message. Regardless of your take on drug laws, watching this movie makes you admit that something is terrible wrong with the current policy. If you haven't seen this film, see it. Then see it several more times. It is that detailed and complicated. I have probably seen it end to end 6 or more times and each time I see something I missed before.</fullReview>

Michael Douglas,(Robert Wakefield), is appointed by the President of the US to head a government agency to stop the drug traffic entering the US from Mexico. The film shows great scenes of Mexico City and various locations at the boarders and the horrible people who will do anything to make a buck. Catherine Zeta Jones, (Helena Ayala) gives an outstanding supporting role as a pregnant wife, who goes to every extreme to help her accused husband get out of jail. Of course, Zeta Jones is carrying Michael Douglas's baby in real life. Great film about drugs and how the use of these drugs will eventually destroy your Body and Soul and put you right down the sewer of life forever.

		<fullReview>... a man is in the Witness Protection Program. He is testifying against a drug lord. And after a day in court, he and his guards walk out into a parking lot. After a lengthy (outdoor) discussion - in which the witness is exposed to potential assassins - he decides he'd like to walk back to his hotel room, which would further expose him to potential assassins. It is stupid enough to expect us to believe the the WPP would allow any of this. But while all this is happening, there is a gunman watching it from a window. He is just about to blow the witness away when - guess what! - another assassin kills the first assassin! Wow, what a coincidence.I liked the subplot of the Mexican cop, and I usually like most of the cast. But having a scene as stupid as the one I just described ruins the whole movie for me. It seems to me there were some other stupidities in the script, but that's the one that sticks out to me.Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Can't Subtitles Be Made Legible on the Small Screen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since most movies will eventually end up on DVD, film makers need to pay more attention to what subtitles will look like on a TV set that isn't the size of your average wall. Traffic is a very good movie that was irritating because 3/4 of the subtitles were virtually illegible on a respectable sized but not huge TV set. Although it was usually possible to guess the import of the conversations on the Mexican side of the border, two folks with pretty good eyesight had difficulty figuring out exactly what was being said. Too bad because it detracted from what was arguably the more interesting half of the movie. Foreign films are generally better at this than American films, perhaps because foreign companies realize that the subtitles are essential if their films are to meet with any success on this side of the Atlantic (or Pacific). It really shouldn't be all that hard to figure out folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Win For Losing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a superior anti-drug flick all the way around. It doesn't provide any easy answers. In fact, it provides no answers whatever except to keep on trying to stop something that appears impossible to stop.Well, after all, we're talking global village here. The people that farm and refine hard drugs like heroin and cocaine are genuinely puzzled by our insistence that they stop. An awful lot of Colombians and Afghanis depend on their crops for a living, however modest, and the folks that bring it to us make very big bucks indeed. And who are they selling it to? All of those among us who are willing to pay for it. In economics this is known as a "market demand." If we didn't use it, the market would dry up.The movie is splendidly done, a movie for adults. The losses are big ones and the triumphs are small and ironic. A lawman sees a friend blown to bits and in return he manages to successfully plant a transmitter under a drug lord's table. (Some trade.) The direction is kind of effectively loose limbed. A lot of the conversation sounds unscripted, naturalistic, as does much of "All The President's Men," for instance. The script is nicely written too, without a great deal of hype, and even with a few gags thrown in. One DEA officer tells another, "This is the beach where I first got laid." The other replies, "Was he good to you?" And they turn and stare at each other with raised eyebrows but no smiles. Perfectly done -- and useful too, because we need to know these two guys have that kind of friendship.The performances are quite good too, with many familiar faces in small roles. Without in any way demeaning the others, Don Cheadle's DEA officer is magnetic.The photography, direction, and editing are all above par. There are one or two shots that leave the viewer a bit jangled (a helicopter landing shot upside down, for instance) but they add to the sense of disorientation that the story generates, and they aren't frequent enough to be distracting.The use of tinted film has not only a dramatic impact but is practical in helping us separate the three story lines woven into the film. A melancholy blue follows Michael Douglas around in Cincinatti and Washington. The La Jolla story is sun drenched. The Mexican subplot is a dry thoroughly baked ochre. Characters from the separate plots pass one another on the sidewalks and streets without knowing it.No point in dwelling further on this. It's a fine movie, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

Of course, they never tell the truth which is that our govt banned most drugs so they, the politicians, could make a fortune off smuggling. One thing i did like is that the movie also criticized booze , the worst drug of all. Early in the film, star Michael Douglas is at a party with other politicians and they're all bloviating about the horrors of America's addiction to coke and heroin and then Douglas signals a waiter and nonchalantly says "bring me a scotch and soda please."

		<shortDescription>Did I Miss Something Original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given its success with critics and at the box office, you expect "Traffic" to be an extraordinary film. But if you have not yet seen it you would be advised to set your expectations a little lower. This film is best summarized as what you would get if Quentin Tarentino and Robert Rodriquez collaborated in the production of a three-hour movie for Lifetime. Which means it is worth viewing but not the cinema classic many have made it out to be.Basically this is a propaganda film in which Steven Soderbergh uses a dramatic story to semi-successfully disguise a very tired anti-drug message as a profound social statement. There is nothing really new here, "Go Ask Alice" did it more effectively way back in the 1970's and there have been countless attempts since then-most of which have aired on Lifetime.Like "Pulp Fiction", the film intertwines four separate stories but "Traffic" does not mess with the timeline and instead of being nicely tied together by the end, the stories barely connect-even thematically. There is at least one story too many and the 147 minute running time is too long. Unfortunately, the best story (the pregnant wife of a arrested drug baron takes over his business-insert "Godfather's" Michael here) is the least developed and has the least talented cast.Except for making money for its production company there is nothing useful about "Traffic". Everyone already knows that the drug war is a joke. Having the prefect blonde teenage daughter of the President's Drug Czar become a crack whore would be exploitative if it were not so tired. The drug war itself has become mundane and most of the participants are deluding themselves and us. Do we really need reminding?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main theme of this movie was focused on drug trafficking in Mexico. However, each subplot within the movie honed in on a more specific aspect. Poor foreign relations, government corruption, and the low quality of life in Mexico were stressed throughout the film. Since independence from Spain, Mexico has struggled with many aspects of their government and economy leading to dishonest administration and widespread poverty.Historically, Mexico has been subject to problems with drugs and corruption, but compared to other countries discussed in class, like Columbia, their problems did not seem quite as horrific. After Mexico achieved independence, frequent shifts in power and profitable foreign relations made the government a lucrative profession, if manipulated correctly. This relates well to the fact that the man in charge of the national police task force, General Salazar, was also connected with in the high ranks of the Jaurez cartel. The city streets were also depicted in context with Mexican history. Besides for an extremely small elite, much of the population is impoverished. I think that the director did a good, but slightly biased, job in portraying Tijuana. Whenever the scenes that took place in Mexico were playing, it always had an overtone of horrible place to be. Although poverty and corruption my run rampant throughout the city, that was the only thing the director played up. I think, that by showing other more positive cultural aspects of the country they could have given Mexico a more objective role compared to the United States.The movie overall was excellent. The way the plots were all interconnected made it exciting to watch. The characters were all cast very well and did a good job as their parts. Benicio Del Toro did an especially good job playing Javier Rodriguez. I could tell how hard it was for him to help out in arresting General Salazar because it was made clear how the drug cartels find out absolutely everything. I also liked how all he wanted in return for his help was to fix up the baseball field and park and put lights up so the children in Tijuana could have something safe to do in the evenings. Also, I really enjoyed how it portrayed so many different sides of one topic. It gave interesting accounts on everything from personal addiction struggles to the greedy, corrupt, and harsh ways of General Salazar as the Drug Czar (the Mexican counterpart to Michael Douglas' character) to the many interconnections between Mexico and the United States involving the drug trade. The cinematography was also good. They way that most scenes were filmed in somewhat of a dim light most of the time really helped relay the somber mood of the movie.While this movie was amazing to watch for entertainment, with its dynamic characters and overlapping plots, it didn't give a realistic feel of the overall life in Mexico or serve a greater educational purpose. Therefore, I would have to give it 2 separate ratings. As a movie for the general public to watch and enjoy, I would give it a 9. But, for a Latin American History class it only deserves about a 2 or 3.</fullReview>

This war has not been able to be stopped yet so what make people think we can stop it now. So with that said the United Staets should legalize Mary-Jane to a certain extent. The way they can do this is to have a single area that you can go and smoke in peace and pleasure. They can stop an hole lot of crime by doing this. I am not by far a druggie but I hate to see the world try and fight a war they can not win. People can always get drugs they can receive drugs from the streets and/or go to the doctor and get them the drugs for a medical disorder that they do not have. The states should take my advice and work on it so they can do this to stop the crime with drugs and the death rate. I say death rate because if they do that the killings with stop and the drug war will not be as big of a war that it is today.

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly my favourite movie, as it has something of everything. I particularly enjoy films with large amounts of characters, completely different story lines, and some degree of complexity. This film has all three.Each character is interestingly developed, and characters are not typecast as being good or evil. For example, the drug dealers in this movie are shown as having clear financial motives for committing these crimes. No one is judged as being evil for dealing drugs; this is left up to the viewer. If one believes the financial rewards justify committing the crime than one could view the dealers as the better side perhaps. One reason this film is so compelling is that it shows the conflict's two sides objectively. Nobody wants propaganda.In addition, the directing, editing, etc. is all very well done. The director has some amazing shots in this movie, such as the helicopter descending. The musical score is also fitting.I find it sad that this lost the 'best picture' academy award to Gladiator. Regardless, I recommend this motion picture to my fullest ability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie with one teensy-weensy negative...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... which is that it is - almost in totality, and scene-for-scene - directly purloined from a far, far superior British miniseries of the early 90s - 'Traffik'. Therefore, I must say that everything that is good about the film succeeds only because of its stellar predecessor, and thus its relevance is somewhat negated.If you haven't seen the series then you will be of the belief that (the movie) 'Traffic' is the absolute bee's knees of gritty, uncompromising, documentary-style drama. By comparison, however, it comes across as being distinctly overly-slick. It looks a lot more impressive on the surface than it does when subjected to closer analysis. But I will make more pointed comment on Steven Soderbergh's directorial style later.Further, I must say that I prefer the England-Germany-Pakistan nexus of the series above the US-Mexico one, which seems to me to be something not nearly as fascinating, although obviously of more direct concern to an American audience. Not only does the series, which explores Western involvement, or interference or meddling, if you prefer, in Central Asia - Afghanistan included - have a lot to say about the realities of illegal drug manufacturing and distribution, but it also is timely (relative to current events) in its condemnation of Western governments' hypocrisies concerning Geo-political matters within the region. It makes very clear that Drugs and War, or Drugs and Power, have been, and always will be, uncomfortably close bedfellows. To my mind this extra layering makes the series far more substantial than the movie, which ultimately comes across as little more than fleetingly stimulating entertainment (although quite impressive on a superficial level), when all is said and done.Of course 'Traffic' - as a self-contained film - does not have the luxury to extrapolate to the degree of the series. Actually, at this point, I would have to give the screenwriter some praise for condensing the salient moments from the series in such a way as to retain its overall impact - even if in, what I consider, a relatively less satisfying package. Regarding Steven Soderbergh's effort as director, I must say that I feel that his style, whilst unquestionably sleek and accomplished, strikes me as far too glossy at times. In fact it was probably at the time that this film was released that I was beginning to become more than a little bored by his signature film-making style, despite my admiration for previous efforts like 'Out of Sight' (best Elmore Leonard adaptation) and 'The Limey'. I am of the opinion that Soderbergh is getting just a little too slick, and perhaps even self-consciously 'cool' for his own good. There are times when I find his trademark jump-cut editing style, 'Nouvelle Vague' affectations and conceitedly underplayed performance coaching just too distracting. I find it a little egotistically self-congratulatory, even as much as I admire the technical skill and sensibility to pull it off. In many ways I would like him to start to bring some rougher edges into his directorial style - to put a little immediacy and 'mongrel' into it, as it were. It would make material of this nature a lot more earthy and credible.All in all 'Traffic' is typically accomplished and flawlessly-polished edu-tainment from Steven Soderbergh, yet not as deep or challenging as it might first appear. It definitely suffers in comparison to 'Traffik', which I would recommend to anyone with independent critical faculties and a few surviving brain cells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The self-perpetuating War on Drugs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a film has been made that displays the War on Drugs for what it is, a completely futile failure. How many people's lives must be taken by the drug lords and gangsters that profit from recreational drugs being illegal, and therefore extremely profitable, before we realize as a people that something else must be done? Not to mention treating drug offenders with compassion rather than condemnation?Some may completely disagree with my stance, but the way I see it, it's an impossible idea that it can be won in the ways in which we have already tried. Get rid of the profit, get rid of the crime and criminals. This would mean all recreational drugs would have to become legal, and in turn purified and protected by our government like normal prescription drugs. It'd be harder for young people to get them that way, they'd be safer, and there wouldn't be people killing each other over them because the market would be gone. Likely? Probably not, but it's because I don't think we're mature enough as a people for this idea to come to fruition yet. And in the end, what business is it of yours what I decide to put into my body as long as it doesn't hurt another human being on this planet? None of your f-ing business! End of f-ing story.As for the film, complete mastery in all departments. The cinematography is simply beautiful and entirely fitting. The scenes in Mexico have a gritty feel to them and are dominated by orange and yellow hues, which is further complimented by the gritty, shaky feel of the camera. The political and family scenes, in which Michael Douglas appears in, have a much more subdued and soft feel to them and are dominated by blue hues. This is meant to display opposite spectrums of the war, the war that both fronts are fighting in futility, just in different ways. I think this is also portrayed in the drug dealer scenes, featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones, and her drug lord husband. These scenes are displayed in regular color resembling the real `traffic' of the film. At least that's my opinion.The cast is second to none and I especially enjoyed Benicio Del Toro here, as he's entirely convincing as the torn Mexican policeman. He more than deserved his Oscar. The acting and ensemble cast is, overall, nothing short of perfect. But the direction, screenplay, and editing are what really make the movie unique and interesting besides it's amazing message and undoubtedly deserved the three Academy Awards it received in those departments. Soderbergh really catches the eye here and will no doubt be a force to be reckoned with in his future films. Many directors have recently tried splitting up scene presentation to keep the audience entertained and many have failed. This is certainly not one of those films.Excellent and extremely entertaining cinema about a very important issue in today's society, and with a powerful message to boot. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is All About One Actor to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic follows the effective, but not-so-often utilized method of crossing over many stories into one central theme. Another movie for reference may be Magnolia. It is a presentation about the institution, effect, and battle against drugs.On one side you have an unknowing wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who must take over a drug empire once her husband (candidly played by Steven Bauer) is indicted on trafficking charges. On the other, is the newly appointed "drug czar" (Michael Douglas), who attempts to "go to the front" and attack the enigmatic problem of curbing the demand for drugs in the U.S. Interestingly, all the while, his daughter (a straight A student with a seemingly bright future) is falling victim to her own battle with drugs.The story does not stop there. Perhaps the most provocative, though hardest-to-follow aspect, is the corruption that befalls Benicio Del Toro's character, Javier Rodriguez. He brilliantly plays a common Tijuana cop who discovers an army-run drug ring, and throughout the movie, internally battles with himself about whether or not he should share his knowledge with the D.E.A. in the States, all the while fearing for his life in the process.Although the Mexico sequences seem at first not to correlate with the rest of the movie, and the subtitles are difficult to follow (the only movie with subtitles that I really enjoy is Seven Samurai), it is Del Toro's performance and the fate of his character that make you want to watch. Put another way, he is not the reason I went to see the movie in the theaters, but he was the reason I stayed. And although it might be crude to say that the whole movie's credibility falls on him, Del Toro was definitely deserving of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar he won for this role.The movie itself attempts to approach the "drug issue" from an objective standpoint, and for the most part it does. There are times when the script is lagging, but that tends to appear in many movies. I would rate this movie at 4.5 stars, leaving only the landmark films to become 5s. For an interesting, thought-provoking film go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'War on Drugs' is unwinnable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderburgh demonstrates his mastery of the film medium with this sprawling, multi-character and plotline expose of American law enforcement's mammoth, endless campaign against illegal drugs. Three distinct story arcs and numerous characters are expertly woven into a compelling narrative that scores its points without attempting to wrap everything up into a neat package. The real world is messy and often ambiguous, and this film does a good job of reflecting it.Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan has said that his research revealed one common denominator among those on the front lines of this 'war' and that is despair. Supplies can be interdicted with the proper application of force (and funding), but the underlying problem of a society's demand for mood-altering substances is rarely acknowledged and even more rarely addressed adequately. There may be those out there who can make the case that we're winning this war but clearly these filmmakers would beg to differ.Benicio del Toro won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of a conflicted Mexican policeman, but many others in the cast are equally impressive. Highest compliments go to Erika Christensen as the high school over-achiever who's also an addict; Michael Douglas as her father, a judge appointed to the position of federal drug czar who gets a hard lesson in the way drug abuse can insinuate itself into any stratum of society; and Don Cheadle as an undercover cop whose efforts -- and those of his comrades -- all too often lead to naught. In the latter section, Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a good, non-hysterical portrait of a trophy wife who learns more about greed and ruthlessness, and herself, than she could have imagined.Soderburgh's cinematography (he operates his own camera) differentiates the three intertwining story lines with stylistic precision: yellow/overexposed hand-held camera-work in Mexico (del Toro and the Federales' assault on the Tijuana cartel); predominantly blue tones/dark interiors in Ohio and Washington, DC (the judge and his daughter); and warm sunny tones in San Diego and La Jolla (Cheadle and his team's bust of Miguel Ferrer and their stakeout of kingpin Steven Bauer's estate). It's not just a gimmick; it works. This is an adult film. It entertains but makes you think, without preaching. Soderburgh, Gaghan, et al know there are no easy answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is a crime/corruption drama that shows how the drug trade affects several aspects of different peoples' lives. The directing by Soderberg is stylish with good use of colors and lighting. The acting is superb by the ensemble cast that makes you believe you are actually there with them. The disconnected interconnectivity works like magic. You never get confused or loose interest in the stories and how they play together. This movie gets heavy rotation in my DVD collection and if you don't have Traffic in your collection then you have a hole that you have to fill! 9/10 ....Buggie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating:**** out of ****.When I saw Traffic I thought it was a great film. It has Great Performances, Great Script, Great Cinematography, and Masterful Direction. Traffic may be depressing for some people because this is real life right here. This movie shows teenagers on drugs, drug cartels, and the effects of a woman whose husband is a drug dealer. Traffics acting is one of its best strengths. Michael Douglas leads the pack with a good, solid performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones really impressed me here, I thought she should have been nominated. She played a naive wife of a drug dealer, then became more authorative when her life and family were in danger. Benico Del Toro turns in a brilliant performance as a Mexican Cop. Erika Christiensen is Great here too as the drug-addicted teenager.The Cinematography is great in Traffic. The yellowish color of Mexico represents the climate but also represents it as a "hot" place for crime. The Blue of Ohio represents that its a depressing place, with teenagers getting drugged up. California has a more normal color, which I think means that this could be anywhere, it doesnt really have a depressing or "hot" feel for it. Traffic is a movie that got me interested for 2 1/2 hours and never let my attention go. It is a movie that is well worth seeing and owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" just happens to be a compelling, wonderful film on its own doesn't hurt - it's just that whether or not it was a "good" movie would have been a little irrelevant no matter what, since either way I'd just be praising it for the cinematography alone: its great use of colour tints to apply to the different stories twisting through this epic drama is worth the rental/purchase alone. However, the fact that I actually DID enjoy it on top of all that is a sure bonus.A gripping tale of the vast and never-ending "War on Drugs", "Traffic" really feels more like a docudrama, if anything else, but it also contains many welcome doses of action, suspense, and thrills along the way. Fortunately, the overall presentation of these elements is nothing short of impressive, intelligent, and realistic. Speaking of realism, it is also a blessing that the filmmakers chose to wrap up this film with a vague and "unsolved" ending. The way things work out in the film are, I think, the way things would normally work out in real life. I'm glad they didn't just try to put a clean finish to all the stories and wrap it all up in a neat, tidy little bow (as is often expected of Hollywood).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardhitting, honest film about drugs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really superb piece of film making. It's hard to find any fault with it - the acting, the editing, the story are all riveting. Nearly two and a half hours long, but you won't move from your seat.This is a film about drugs, on each side of the border with Mexico. There are several plots interwoven with each other, but altogether, the viewer gets a good sense of what drug trafficking is doing to people.Michael Douglas plays a newly appointed drug czar in Washington who discovers that his teenage daughter has a bad drug habit. Benicio Del Toro is a Tijuana policeman who's recruited by one of the drug cartels. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a major American importer of drugs who gets busted. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are a couple of DEA agents tracking the dealers.The movie is shot in a semi-documentary style, with much of the movie done on videotape. The acting, especially Benicio Del Toro, is great. There are no heroes per se, except for Del Toro's character, who turns his new bosses in to the DEA in exchange for a baseball field for Tijuana's kids. You follow the trail of the drug trade and watch the casualties mount up, and in the end the traffickers are still in business and nothing much has changed except for the players. Kinda like real life.This movie is Steven Soderbergh's finest work and he was very deserving of the Oscar he won as best director. Benecio Del Toro won for best supporting actor also.A perfect 10 in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three tales from the murky world of drug trafficking are sublimely welded together by Steven Soderbergh and a masterful performance by the majority of the cast made this movie well worth the effort. It was encouraging to see Benicio Del Toro pick up his Best Supporting Actor award at the Oscars as I cannot think of anyone who has played such a convincing role since the beginning of the millennium. Erika Christensen too, puts in a powerful show as Michael Douglas's troubled drug addict teenage daughter and there are enough light hearted moments - generally between Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman - to keep proceedings from ever becoming dull. Soderbergh deserves credit too for not coming over all moral on us and leaving the notion of whether "drugs are bad" entirely up to us, the audience. Maybe this film's not one for the popcorn munchers out there, but for those of us who like an intelligent well acted piece of art, this is a must. I'd give it 8.8 out of 10, but Del Toro's performance deserves a 10 no question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic (2000) is a movie that consists of five different stories. Michael Douglas' character is appointed as the new drug czar for the United States. His daughter, played by Erika Christensen is fighting for her own addiction to heroin. Benicio Del Toro, as a corrupt Mexican cop, plays the second story. He finds himself involved in the drug cartels that are plaguing Mexico and the United States. The third story is with Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman playing as two DEA cops whoare trying to bring down a wealthy drug king, played by Steven Bauer. His wife, played by Catherine Zeta Jones and himself make up for the fourth story. There are more actors/actresses in this movie but to remain brief, I will just list the ones mentioned above. The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who always directed the famous`Erin Brockovich'. Soderbergh uses his directing talent to link all of the four stories in Traffic together by giving insight into drug policies and the emotional damage that is caused by the associated drug usage and exchanges. Eachactor/actress does an amazing job on conveying the true harshness that isassociated when using or selling drugs. I found it interesting that Soderbergh gives each of the stories their different color. For example, he gives the story that is in Mexico, a brown and yellow color, for the stories in California, he gives whites and browns, and for the stories in Washington DC, he gives a deep blue. It was interesting how the movie started with 4 separate stores but then to see them and how the all interrelated was fascinating. I also liked how the movie illustrated that drugs can adversely affect you, no matter if you are white or black, rich or poor. The end result is the same. That result is Death. I liked how the drug czar, acted by Michael Douglas, was trying to lead America into a fight against drugs, yet he has to fight his own local war with his daughter having her own addiction. I also like the fact that the movie featured an AA meeting and seemed to deliver the idea in a positive light.Benicio Del Toro did a wonderful job at providing a role as a corrupt law officer for the Mexican Government. You can see remorse in his eyes for the actionshe has to commit in his cop role, which are not always in the `good' light.The two DEA agents (Cheadle and Guzman) provide Traffic with a little comicrelieve in a very sobering film. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a solid proof of her performance for drama behind her gorgeous looks.In conclusion, Traffic gives an in-depth look at the world of drugs from all ends. It shows the sides from the user, the selling, and the identity that is trying to stop it. The movie clearly illustrates that the war on drugs is an ever-ongoingprocess and will always challenge and pose a threat to society.If I were to rate the movie on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the movie a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris-132 produced a rather long note on this fine film, so I'll try to be brief.Since 1970, I've seen the drug culture grow, shrink, mutate and grow again over several cycles here in California. For better or worse, I've pretty much "gone my own way" in these matters. Given the alternatives of a "garrison state" as described in the cartoons of Ron Cobb and the violence-ridden chaos of the drug culture, I'd like to have the one thing that no one is likely to tolerate--a third choice. I'd like to have at least one choice that balances unquestioning obedience against unreasoning rebellion.In this film, it's pretty much all here. It dares to ask an obvious question--why are the drugs so attractive? The partial answer(in the case of schoolgirl Caroline) is that it is pretty easy to be the school valedictorian and also--lonely, alienated and self-destructive.Several of the popular drugs, notably cocaine, offer an omnipotent high and if you have been force-fed a toxic diet of powerlessness, alienation and behavioral control, they can seem overwhelmingly attractive.It's simplistic, as well as cruel, to say that severe enough punishment will end the drug problem.It is so easy for a young person to loose his/her moral compass... And so difficult for all of us(of whatever age) to hold onto it.</fullReview>

The plot was pretty simplistic and dumbed down. Michael Douglass was boring and Benicio Del Toro was boring and made me tired. He put me to sleep, yawn, even though his story was the most interesting, that he was a moral man, but that bored me too. You know he was naughty underneath to get all the information he did.

		<shortDescription>Of price and Men ( The Castings of Soderbergh )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh has the well-deserved reputation of making his players appear at their best in very successful movies : The reason why most stars agree to be in his films with drastic cuts off of their usual salaries, and which rendered possible the filmings of OCEAN 11 &amp; 12,- otherwise unsolvable financial problems. Apparently, it was the same (but on a smaller level) with TRAFFIC, budgeted at a reasonable $48millions, with Michael Douglas being paid $10 millions instead of his customary 20. Anyhow, as usual, the result was satisfactory for the actors who were granted together the 2001 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by the Cast of a Theatrical Motion Picture (first billed only : Steven Bauer - Benjamin Bratt - James Brolin - Don Cheadle -Erika Christensen - Clifton Collins Jr. - Benicio Del Toro -Michael Douglas -Miguel Ferrer - Albert Finney - Topher Grace -Luis Guzmán -Amy Irving - Tomas Milian - D.W. Moffett - Dennis Quaid - Peter Riegert - Jacob Vargas -Catherine Zeta-Jones ). However, the level of excellency is somewhat different among the players: I may be mistaken, or biased, but I sort them as follows: - Outstanding: Erika Christensen - Excellent: Topher Grace - Benicio del Toro (but perhaps not a performance of Oscar caliber, maybe it was the year for satisfying the Latino moviegoers...still I must admit that many many people think differently), Miguel Ferrer, Luis Guzman, Don Cheadle, Tomas Millan, Steven Bauer, Jacob Vargas, Clifton Collins Jr, plus Marisol Padilla Sanchez- Good - A surprisingly old -looking Michael Douglas, Amy Irving, Catherine Zeta-Jones- Underused : Albert Finney, James Brolin, Peter Riegert, D.W. Moffett, Dennis Quaid, Salma Hayek. Note: Amy Irving (Erika Christensen's mother) is depicted as a former drug addict- which is perhaps a mistake, as drug addiction does not systematically run in the blood</fullReview>

There's a Mexican cop (Del Toro), the naive wife of a powerful drug kingpin who ends up taking over her husband's lucrative business (Zeta-Jones), a newly appointed anti-drug czar who's good at his job but lacks the fundamental skills to be a good father (Douglas), among others, including a neglected and drug-addicted teenager (Christensen, in a riveting performance). The film is long, and the stories occasionally drag, but it's thoroughly engrossing and well-acted by all members of its first-rate cast. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. It drew me in with its style and its content. Made a star out of Del Toro, and rightfully so. He is amazing here. Loved the ending, which is huge in movies. Didn't win as many awards as it deserved, even though it won some. Also loved the performance by Douglass' daughter--Christiansen, I think. She was extremely charismatic and her story powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really bugs me when people bash a director or movie for being "over-rated"...how exactly is this the director's fault? Take it from me, you'll live longer if you just calm down and watch a movie while ignoring what others say.End opening rant.For what it's worth, I loved Traffic...both when I saw it back in the theater, and recently on DVD. I have been lucky enough to check out the double-disc release from Criterion and it is fantastic! There's tons of deleted scenes and commentaries which really make me appreciate the work that went into it. I plan to check out Traffik (the British mini-series) as well, but what we have with Traffic is a very tight condensation of a whole lot of story. It's by no means a perfect movie, but too much of this movie works well to dismiss it entirely.Anyway, there's a lot to like about this movie. The acting is superb (which even haters of the movie can admit), it's socially relevant, and it took a very skilled hand to put this much substance together and make it entertaining. To sum up, check out Criterion's double-disc set for the complete package, and then make up your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, at the beginning i have to say that i am personally a Steven Soderbergh fan. I think his ideas are brilliant, his way using camera and colors (especialy in this movie) are fabolous. This movie is very good and yes, realistic, believable story about the USA's drug war against mexico. I dont want to tell about the movie a lot, 'cos you have to see it yourself. Acting is very well done, of course with such an actors like Michael Douglas, Benicio DelToro, Don Cheadle, Catherine Zeta-Jones etc etc..Very good, maybe the best drama/thriller ever.

		<fullReview>In Pulp Fiction-like fashion, Traffic interlocks three different tales that focus upon the ever-increasing problem with the war on drugs. The three stories are vastly different and, at the beginning of the film, there seems to be little connection among them. However, Traffic weaves the stories into one dramatic tale that, by the end, depicts the realism underlying the drug trade from several viewpoints.In the first story, a Mexican policeman (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself in a web of corruption as he tries to rid Tiajuana of a controlling drug cartel. In the second, the President's newly appointed "drug czar" (Michael Douglas) battles cartels on the United States' front while he simultaneously copes with his own daughter's addiction. And in the third, two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) in San Diego try to take down a wealthy smuggler, whose wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is suddenly forced to learn the truth behind her husband's financial success. The tales are interrelated because they share a common, central theme--the drug trade.Steven Soderbergh, whose efforts earned him Best Director honors at the 2001 Academy Awards, blends the stories with distinct coloring styles. The first tale is saturated in brown, effectively capturing the feel of Mexico while maintaining its cruel realism. The second tale is distinctively washed in blue, seemingly hiding the hard reality of addiction. The third is filmed without a coloring effect, as it reveals the difficult truth to blind eyes.Soderbergh unites the stories in a style not too unlike that of Quentin Tarentino in Pulp Fiction. Soderbergh focuses on each story separately, but he ultimately ties them together by the end. Unlike Pulp Fiction, though, Traffic proceeds sequentially, whereas Tarentino's film jumped forward and back at the drop of a hat.Aside from Soderbergh's creative style, the story and acting is superb. Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of the Mexican policeman won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and it was well-deserved. Michael Douglas gives another great performance as the President's "drug czar," coping with the effect of drugs in both his professional and personal life. Catherine Zeta-Jones is convincing as a wealthy smuggler's wife who is sadly innocent and naive one moment, terribly ruthless and power-hungry the next. Don Cheadle's performance as a DEA agent was, generally, overlooked when the film was released. But, he was excellent.Traffic is certainly a film that was worth its praise. With a stellar cast, a well-written script, and a creative director, it was hard to imagine this film could go wrong. It didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic", as many pointed out already, is based on German documentary of the same name and it keeps its overall docu-style pace and structure. Many here took that as a flaw but I didn't see it that way at all. If anything I wanted even more of the educational approach. Blue and red camera lens filters (there, I guess to make the movie appear more stylish) got to be annoying at times but that's really a minor complaint. What's more important is that Soderbergh brings us to various frontlines of America's misguided war on drugs and takes time to show us around.We meet the foot soldiers - cops on both sides of the border - Javier (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo (Jacob Vargas) in Tijuana and Rey (Luis Guzman) and Montel (Don Cheadle) in San Diego. We meet the distributors in America - 'legitimate businessmen' - Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) and Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer) as well as their suppliers from Mexico - powerful Obregon cartel operating out of Tijuana. We also meet the top drug fighting brass on both sides - Ohio judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) freshly promoted to the position of federal 'drug czar'. His Mexican counterpart, we're told, doesn't exist; with oily general Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian) being the closest thing to it. And finally we meet the consumers, many of whom are middle and upper class Americans including judge's daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen).All of this adds up to a powerful film giving us a look into every aspect of drug war on both sides and many different agendas at work. "Traffic" doesn't offer any solutions to this very complex problem (at least not directly) but it sure provides us with a lot to think about.P.S. I agree its pretty implausible that Carlos Ayala's wife Helena would be completely clueless about the origins of her husband's wealth especially after being shown as a street smart woman who seamlessly takes over his business when he's thrown in jail. In fact, entire Helena character is weak and way overdeveloped but I guess Catherine Zeta-Jones who, if we measure head sizes on the poster, gets top billing in this movie demanded more than a mere wife role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY RATING- 6.6A tough and accurate view of the drug business between the great lords, who have benefits with the misery of drugs. A great performance from Michael Douglas and Amy Irving as his wife. My personal fave is Catherine Zeta-Jones who is much more than a beautiful woman here, she's a strong-willed woman who tries to take his husband (who is guilty) out of the prison. We are treated with different points of view, by loving Douglas' ideals yet we root a little for the efforts of Zeta-Jones, knowing his husband is a real drug lord. I also loved that division (maybe a racist touch!) between black and white for drug dealing parts and color to what seems our nice world. Not a great mov, by any means, but see it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SO overrated !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does everybody think that Steven Soderbergh is a cinematic God? True: he IS more versatile than he was when he started, and his ability to take risks has enabled him to be where he is now. I think Soderbergh's film here was well-made; an excellent ensemble consisting of Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Cheadle, Guzman, and co.; but for something like this to be nominated for best picture? Me thinks that it's because this movie was released in December. It's an excellent documentary, but this is not a film that inspires hope-- it inspires despair instead. I guess what Soderbergh is trying to convey is, "if drugs were legalized, then we wouldn't have this sort of violence and anguish that I have shown you for the last two-and-a-half hours...See?"Well, that's an opinion, but legalizing drugs is like letting loose a box full of rattlesnakes on a playground.Perhaps he can handle his drugs, but I know a lot of people who can't.Maybe HE should watch his film and relize that !I'm done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hailed by many critics as best movie of the year Traffic was rather a disappointment to myself. Traffic is made up of five stories, each one of them is intertwined to one main goal, the destruction of drugs in the United States. Michael Douglas's performance is extremely underrated and Benicio Del Toro's is extremely overrated. If you have heard that this film is at all shocking, think again, nothing in this movie is as interesting as it sounds, the stories make sense, but they are flawed and one can point out many errors in them. Go see the movie for the hell of it, although it's portrayed to be a complex story, I found it actually a brain-less movie which required no thinking, but then again thats all that was produced in 2000. You'll like Michael Douglas and his daughter's story of strength and recovery, and I know you'll find Catherine Zeta Jones's cocaine doll a blast, especially if you're a user. Traffic won Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Supporting Actor, and in my opinion Gladiator beat them all out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)"I'm not only a director but I can operate a camera,too". That statement must have been going through Steven Soderbergh's mindwhen he decided to color code his film so that audiences would "get it". "Traffic" is one of the most overrated films of recent years. It's stereotypical(white kids go to a black neighborhood to get drugs, unbelievable(Michael "chin tuck" Douglas is clueless about his daughter's drug problem,Catherine Zeta Jones reads some micro film and suddenly she's a player who would give Pablo Escobar a run for his money)and it also offers us some wonderfully inane dialogue as icing on the cake(Douglas' daughter is confronted about her problem, looks at her toes and says "I guess I'm angry"). What a hoot! Many people have wondered why the film is out of focus so much of the time and that's simply because if Soderbergh stopped waving hiscamera all around and stayed in one place in focus we would see the only things that he had to say were probably in the press junket to begin with and were taken by gullible critics as brilliance.</fullReview>

This may be the first time that it's been taken over the top. If there hadn't been recognizable faces of prominent actors within the movie, I might just have reached for my remote to check that I wasn't on A&amp;E. While well-directed and acted, this didn't really seem like a movie at all. After all the hype, I felt let down. The producers of this film needed to take a page from Ron Howard's take on Apollo 13. That movie was re-telling a story that millions of Americans already KNEW the end to, but still managed to be entertaining, if not mesmerizing. I watched Traffic expecting to be entertained, not getting an educational documentary. I've already got cable for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Traffic' is about the eternal war between the drug dealers and those people in the governments that are trying to 'erradicate' them. Even though there has never been a true advance in that field, which is actually growing.The acting is great even for Catherine Zeta Jones, who always seemed to be reading her lines from a board somewhere. The environmental lighting is great and gives more depth to the scenes, and remarks the social, economical and cultural differences between the countries. This is also a movie about loyalty, morality and principles. And not to mention devotion and maintaining an objective look of the situation, no matter what is going on around you.This is a film that can't be missing in any good modern top 10 or 20. One of the best in the decade and probably history. Just make sure the right side will prevail.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic tries hard, but it's a narrative mess. The end is contrite (just a few too many neat tie ups). The story - what's the story? Benicio del Toro is a Mexican copper on $326 per month who tries to do right but is being reeled in by a corrupt (gosh) army general. Michael Douglas is a newly elected drugs czar with a daughter on a downward spiral of addiction. Catherine Zeta-Jones is an upper income housewife who's hubby Steven Bauer is suddenly arrested for drug dealing or what not by honest coppers Don Cheadle and Luis Guzmán who catch and guard sleazo drug minion Miguel Ferrer. (And watch out for a nearly unrecognizable, mustachiod Benjamin Bratt of Law &amp; Order as drugdealer Obregon.)Most of them never meet, therefore the subplots don't obviously hang together. The thing is, I like police procedurals, drugs movies, etc., but this is just one long string of clichés. In fact, I had a better time watching "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story" which also starred Michael Bauer, Miguel Ferrer and a very young Benicio del Toro.The best thing about Traffic is Erika Christensen who is _hot_. Maybe this movie still has to have time to grow on me, but right now it just seemed like a big name mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since 7 billion people have already commented on this vastly overrated movie, I just want to add my quick two cents. Soderbergh has seemingly mastered the trappings of verite style: use of the handheld camera, lack of background music, etc... but so far, in my opinion, has failed to employ it meaningfully. The too-precious-to-be-ironic nature of the judge-daughter arc has been commented on, as has the uselessness of Quaid's lawyer. I would like to say I enjoyed Soderbergh's open-ended questions (does Zeta-Jones get caught, etc.?) but unfortunately I didn't really care.Also, this movie possibly suffers from the most detestable bias in filmmaking: Californicentricity. All the shots in Ohio and DC are shot in suicide-blue, and Mexico is shot in vomit-speckled yellow. Meanwhile, California is the only location that has well-timed film. Only when characters travel to California, or when they have an apotheosis (Douglas' sickening `I'm here to listen') are they full-color. Truly, California must be the land of milk and honey! I doubt (I hope) this is not what Soderbergh intends. Regardless, I think painting different moods different colors is a failed experiment. The only thing it inspires in the audience, to my observation, is annoyance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best Director and Screenplay, but not picture? Oh well, Soderberg's stunning win as Best Director for this amazing film locks its place in history. Gladiator may have taken the big prize, but this was the best film of 2000.This is a long a complex film that you need to see more than once - the kind that is worth owning on DVD and watching again and again. It has no real plot, but just tells interweaving stories that show, as the director has said, that the war on drugs is a constant losing battle that acts as a price support system for the cocaine and heroine trade. There are three parallel stories about characters who never meet, but who are all affected by the drug trade. Benecio del Toro is brilliant as a Mexican cop who is a straight as he can be and as crooked as he needs to be, trying to bring down a drug cartel. Michael Douglas plays a judge recently appointed to the federal commission on drugs, who is unaware that his own daughter is a junkie. Catherine Zeta Jones has the performance of a lifetime as a country club wife who comes to realize that her husband is not the pillar of society she thought he was.None of these people meet, but their lives are controlled by the same evil, but in different ways. What needs to be observed in this film is how these characters all draw the essentially same conclusions via different avenues.This movie is a directorial triumph. Soderberg threads these plots in and out of eachother without making the movie messy or confusing. A lesser director would have had some giant conflict or shoot out scene where everyone meets at the end so we can see all the big stars at the same time. But "Traffic" is more concerned on showing how widespread the cancer of the drug trade is, that the same narrow avenue can completely consume so many people without them ever knowing who eachother are.Migeul Ferrer, Luis Guzman (miss him on "Oz"), Don Cheadle, Erika Christensen and Benjamin Bratt all play key supporting roles with ease.There is no Hollywood ending here - but a film that ends with a sense of futility and frustration. The tone is perfect from start to finish.As strong a recommendation as I can make. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story of Javier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To those who ask why Michael Douglas would quit as drug czar when he's had his first success? my answer would be that that was his choice. Obviously he knew he personally didn't do anything to effect the General's bust in Mexico - afterall, he thought the Scorpion was dead. He didn't really know what was going on. And the silence on the plane ride from Mexico after he said `the dams are open' for new ideas simply depressed him and led him to conclude that not much on the supply side could be done. His daughter needing more attention than the war on drugs was what in the end decided it for him, and is - to me at any rate - the `message' of the film.To those who think the transformation into a slick drug dealer was too quick for CZJ, I answer that her motivation not to have her kids grow up in the same impoverished circumstances she grew up in accounts for her zeal and ruthlessness in protecting her families' riches. I also think that at some level she always knew about her husband's business, and is simply putting into conscious motion what she had possibly been absorbing all along unconsciously.I loved the film but take the point that it does tend to `traffic' in some unfortunate stereotypes, as others have noted. Also, what was Don Cheadle's character's motivation? At the end, I suppose it was to avenge the death of his partner. More than anything, I see the story of Javier as being the heart and soul of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troubled Mexican narcotics cop (Del Toro) fights the dirty fight in the dusty streets of Tijuana. A new US drug czar (Douglas) favors career over family and ends up bogged down in moral ambiguity and domestic chaos with his ironically drug-addict daughter (Christensen). A trophy wife (Zeta Jones) discovers the drug baron business after her husband is arrested by relentless cops (Guzman and Cheadle). These are the intertwined stories of Traffic.Say what you want about Steven Soderbergh, the man is willing to take risks. When making Traffic, he joked that nobody in their right mind would bankroll a 40-million dollar dogma film, and while Traffic has more polish that his quote might imply, it is only by a slight margin. This is perhaps the film's greatest asset - that and an impressive cast - giving it an immediacy and raw power that party help make up for its shortcomings.First, the good. The raw visuals and style are truly invigorating, and throw you headfirst into a perfectly realized, morally ambiguous universe. The Mexican narrative thread, the best of the five in the movie, is gripping, held together by Benicio Del Toro in a star-making and award-winning performance. Don Cheadle and Katherine Zeta-Jones hold their ends up well too, standing out among more seasoned players.Then, the bad. Juggling so many subplots, the script inevitably falters, and it does so in an arguably crucial aspect: short-changing the drug-user element. We are asked to empathize with drug czar Michael Douglas' on screen spoiled brat of a daughter, and though Erica Christensen gives the role everything she's got, the part is simply does not work, and cheapens the entire film as a result, as does the way Douglas' character arc unfold as a result.Traffic's one nod to Hollywood conventions proves its undoing: after over two hours of watching drugs corrupt everyone and everything they touch, we are asked to believe that love is the only right answer. Thus honesty and authenticity are ultimately scarified for the sake of feel-good sentimentalism. There in a nutshell, is why its detractors hate it. And yet...For all the aforementioned problems, Traffic a brave film by an inspiring director. It contains weird flaws and traces of greatness, sometimes a single cut apart. It is definitely worth watching, if only to see what happens when the Hollywood machinery is stretched beyond its comfort zone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noteworthy for Del Toro's heartfelt, Oscar winning performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie even though I didn't buy a lot of it. Its a solid piece of movie-making but is not profound or unforgettable or a masterpiece or anything like that. Most of this will openly discuss important plot points/characters, so beware..Most of the value I got from it came from Benicio Del Toro's performance as a man doing the right thing. He's a silent hero, he's humble and just wants to be allowed to be the police officer he wants to be. He's sacrificed money to do this work because he thinks its important. As he explains, he wants to be able to watch kids in the park, playing baseball, in a safe environment. That's all he wants and he knows the high price to be paid for that. He's the good guy without the parade or the woman waiting in the doorway or the swell of music. Benicio is terrific and supplies the movie with what little soul it has. Oscar voters did a good thing by awarding him his first Oscar.However, the rest was not as good. I had a lot of problems with the Zeta-Jones/Dennis Quaid/Steven Bauer story. Bauer did not go from zero to being dragged from his home, arrested for drug trafficking. At some point, the FBI or the local police or SOMEONE would have had some kind of search warrant, and been in their house. There would have been some sort of incident in their lives to indicate he's a heartless SOB. Then, after he is arrested, she is in shock and pregnant to boot. In no time at all, she's made contact with some of his 'business men' and is giving instructions to 'shoot him in the head'...are you kidding me? While the babysitter reads 'Polly Wally Doodle', she's ordering assassinations to government witnesses?? Sorry, not buying it..The Michael Douglas story was not much better. His daughter getting high with her friends is perfectly reasonable. Seeing them sitting around doing coke seemed authentic, the drug talk all meaningless and fast and mostly just a way to use your jaw before it cracks off, or feels like it..then one of their group overdoses, and they dump him at the hospital (Literally! Was this a small homage to Dennis Quaids' character in "Postcards from the Edge"? He at least brought Meryl Streep INTO the hospital, not dumped on the sidewalk like a sack of mail, and he didn't even KNOW her!) and get caught doing so. Turns out Mom Amy Irving knew of her abuse, but didn't tell husband/father Michael Douglas, who by the way just so happened to be named the new drug czar in the USA. In no time, she is put into a rehab, escapes from that rehab, is turning tricks for a fix, steals her parents valuables and has to be rescued by Douglas. Sorry, again..he'd have an army of cops shaking down every dealer within 700 miles, because he, of all the people ALIVE, could actually request and get that!! So you see him driving 20mph down the ghetto streets, in his $45K mini-van, searching for his daughter. Its possible he didn't want to create a media circus by inviting help, but since Mom, Dad &amp; Daughter end up holding hands at an AA meeting, it didn't seem like he cared what everyone thought. There were other inconsistencies/awkward moments for me. In summary, most of it rang pretty false. In a year when the magnificent "Requiem for a Dream" was released, "Traffic" looks worse than it might have been. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is simply amazing, i heard the hype on it and wanted to see it in the cinema but i was too young so i watched it on the movie channels, it is strong, truthful and frighteningly realistic. from the moment the opening scene begins you realise that this film will grip and hold your attention, it is not something you can leave the room and re-enter and pick up the plot on you must watch it all the way through, it has a strong sense of reality and shows the sides of the addicted, suppliers, police, government and parents..each play their role equally in making the movie simply brilliant. the fact that the politician is the parent of the user is a strong message that your family can get hit by the "Drug war", Douglas plays his part magnificently and as does the rest of the cast, when watching you do not feel like you are watching a movie it feels more like a documentary. This is no ordinary film, taking you on a journey around the goings on in the drug industry and how it can affect everyone and anyone at sometime. there are a few witty moments, excellent dialogue and quotes, some extremely disturbing moments [of what length someone will go to get a fix] and some emotional moments, plus the odd bit of violence, all in all making it an unforgettable movie. A note though, do not watch the film if you want it all to be tied up in the end and everything to work out and fit into place because it is not that kind of movie,it is more truthful and does not show the happy ending, it sort of ignores sentiment and focuses on what would happen in everyday reality. Traffic is to the drug story what 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' was to the Mafia story. Simply brilliant.</fullReview>

In the series the drug dealers wife took real risks to get the money which gave a greater degree of suspense.My biggest gripe? Why did the drug czar resign? In the series he was depressed that deals between governments were white washes that helped no one. In the film the DEA starts being successful so he quits. Eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well-done, well-acted movie. Michael Douglas was superb as the Ohio Judge picked to be the U.S. drug czar. Virtually every actor in this plays their part nearly perfectly. Especially Benicio Del Toro. He played a remarkable character in this: A Mexican State Policeman, trying to be a decent, honest cop, but aware that the corrupt reaches of the immense drug trade are all around him. He plays a conflicted character, aware that he's being manipulated, but attempting to use the manipulation in the right way.The inter-locking stories are shown in such a way as to illustrate the weaving nature of the drug world, and how the misery and heartbreak can ripple up and down the drug pipeline, and virtually destroy people and families.A very intelligent, well-acted motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't completely understand "Traffic" when I rented it, so I'd have to watch it again. I do know, however, that it deserved all four of its Oscars.The dialogue was brilliant, especially Robert Wakefield's, Caroline's, and Javier Rodriguez's. The writer picked realistic but intelligent-sounding lines that make it worth watching even if you don't understand the story. Sodenberg deserves the Oscar and lots of praise for a directing job well done.Benicio Del Toro, the only Oscar-winner for this film not named Stephen or Steven, was awesome. I believed his every word and action, especially when he speaks English because it really sounds like he doesn't know it fluently. He is the only reason this film didn't seem too fast, because Javier Rodriguez was really the only character that had the slightest hint of uneasiness. You can also feel the cop's tension when he has sort of a breakdown trying to get out of the SUV. I definitely want to see more of Benicio's movies, even if that means I have to sit through an action flick, my least favorite genre besides war.But Erika Christiansen, Jacob Vargas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Douglas, and Topher Grace (is that his name?) were also great. Kudos to Erika, who pulled off many convincing scenes where she was high, specifically after freebasing for the first time. I also loved the end under the circumstances, the way the colors looked different wherever the characters were, the lack of a musical score so it sounded like real life...there really wasn't a lot I didn't like. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh must have decided to get back to business. After the rather boring and ridiculous Erin Brockovich, he redeemed himself with a rather neutral look at the drug war. While some of the representations seem to be caricaturized, the film is quite decent in most respects. The acting, especially Benecio del Toro and Don Cheadle, gave realistic interpretations of the characters they were trying to portray. While this film really doesn't go deep enough into the inner workings of the drug war, it is still a good film nonetheless.</fullReview>

See Requiem for a Dream. That one is extremely good.This movie is more on the war on drugs and the dealers's families.(spoilers?)Dennis Quaids character is rather weak in this movie. They give a rather silly excuse as to why he's even in the picture at the end.I really think that a picture such as this can't even begin to understand the problem. That and your dealing with alot of opinions too. I've got some odd opinions in the matter. I've never done drugs. The only thing out of place I've done is drink beer when I was 12. Now I'm 26 and I hate beer. (unless it's got a nice citris flavor. :) Iowa just banned this liquor jello stuff called Zippers. Oh well. Too late for me. But really, I don't think we should ban drugs. I'm more into the concern of finding out why kids would wanna go to such stupid lengths in the first place. We have to come up with a good reason for them to stop instead of telling them it's illegal. Cause it's only gonna make them want it more. But that's my opinion. You've got yours and here this movie sits.8/10Quality: 7/10 (nice use of camera filters!!!) Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very dark but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very strongly crafted story about the drug trade and the war to stop it. Stephen Soderbergh directs this unique tale focusing on three different people and how they are affected throughout the story. He uses different coloring to film all and it works surprisingly well. The story jumps back and forth between Mexico, California, and Ohio and involves a cop trying to take down drug traffickers in Mexico, a woman finding out her husband had been a major supplier in California, and the new Drug Czar finding out his daughter is a major pot-head.Acting from all ranges from good to excellent. My only question is the Best Supporting Actor Oscar going to Benicio Del Toro. While I didn't think he did a bad job (like Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential) I didn't see him do anything superb.This is a very dark movie and doesn't have a lot of hope throughout though it does end on a slightly upbeat note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, was there a plot? I couldn't pay much attention to the plot or characters, I was so distracted by all the pretty colors. Every scene in this thing was tinted some garish color, I guess supposedly to help you keep track of the convoluted plot. There was a dim blue, like a badly done "day for night." Some were a nasty yellow. It looked like a black-and-white film that had been clumsily hand-tinted, or colorized. Most amazing of all, some scenes were tinted to almost perfect imitation of the appearance of film that has been stored too long and has started to fade to oranges and pinks. It might have made sense if these scenes were supposed to be flashbacks to the Fifties--but they weren't. I kept wanting to get out a handkerchief and wipe off the screen so I could see the movie. I'm sure there was a movie behind those colored filters somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is about 2,5 hours of great cinematographic entertainment. Yet great scenes and first class acting performances go hand in hand with not so well casted scenes and over acting. It's just a little too much here and there. Like there is, Douglas' searching in ghettos for his crack-addicted daughter and Zeta-Jones turning from a unconsciousness mob-wife into a very conscious drug negotiater. (No harm done, watching these less developed characters. All is made up for by the brilliant performances of the other actors.) Going across the US-Mexican border over and over again of almost every character doesn't do the film much good either. Or parts of the plot, that are almost too complex, f.i. the different Mexican cartels and there connection with the politics, and tend to distract you from what's on the screen. The better parts are without doubt those that were shot in Mexico. The music score deserves a separate line: it definitely gives the film extra atmosphere, without ever being annoying. It was great fun watching this movie yesterday night and I was dazzled until hours later. Thank you, Mr Soderbergh. By the way: what is your final message?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm probably not going to do Traffic justice. I had decided to try the new city centre multiplex. It was full. Well. Almost. A huge queue of punters who seemed to be deciding what to see in the throng before the electronic filter permitted access to the ranks of pay desks. Now late I was offered apologetically a front row seat. I smiled and headed for the first of three escalators that would leave me within a few auditoria of the screen I wanted. I took what would be my usual seat and tried to relax. Difficult where high headrests force the eyes of us bleachers to the bottom of the screen. But worse. Popcorn to my left. Mobile phone behind me! Unbelievable intrusion from my right!! And a general hubbub all around. This can't be right! I need my splendid isolation.Especially for films as complex and detailed as this. But having said that, I'm not sure I didn't feel a little patronised by the different colour washes highlighting three converging threads of storyline.No. The real problem with Traffic is that within a couple of weeks I finally saw the original Channel 4 television series.

It has a thought provoking and intelligent story, great acting, direction and cinematography.Particularly effective is Soderberghs use of color as Washington is tinted in blue and mexico in sepia/gold. The characterization was splendid as Soderbergh spends a good hour of the film introducing us to the heroes and villians. The subject matter of the film is not to my taste (drug trafficing and drug use) but I especially was touched by Michael Douglas's characters 16 year old daughters performance as a drug addict, it bought a lump to my throat more than once.Obviously there is not much big action or effects, but as a docu-drama the film is excellent.SCORE: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through numerous interwoven tales of corruption and suffering, Soderbergh unleashes a stunning, realistic view of drug trade and trafficking. Traffic details the effects of drugs on the country; in particular, the traumatic effect that they have on families. Soderbergh's editor on the film, Mirrione,does a spectacular job of balancing the many stories so that each story is told in equality not leaving anything out or dragging any scenes. Fast-paced and hard-hitting, the film not only chronicles the effects on the United States, but also the effects on Mexico as well. Unforgettable performances by Benicio del Toro and Michael Douglas and the gripping soundtrack boosts the film's ego. In 2001, the film gathered four Academy Awards including a Best Director Oscar for Soderbergh and a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Benicio del Toro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is one movie that people are going to see more than once. It was so entertaining that I actually bought the DVD and was mesmerized by how this story and these characters were developed.The movie is split into different stories involving different people. It was kind of like PULP FICTION except no dancing at Jack Rabbit Slims.The first story is about a cop in Tijuana, Mexico named Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his partner (Jacob Vargas) who go undercover as drug dealers and learn about the horrors that occur in the drug business.The second story is about a pair of police officers (Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman) who are protecting a powerful man named Eduordo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who is to testify in court against a powerful drug lord named Carl. Carl is being held in prison while his nervous wife Helena (Cathrine Zeta-Jones) begins to take over his business by dealing drugs.The third story is about America's new drug czar named Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas). He is trying his hardest to keep the youth of America away from the biggest drug dealers and drugs that rule our country. But, a crisis in his family is occuring. His 16 year old daughter Caroline (Erika Christiansen) has fallen in with the wrong crowd in school and has now become a drug addict. Now, Robert does whatever he can to put these dealers away.I for sure reccomend Traffic to anyone who wants a good entertaining evening. It has everything that a good movie should have in it. Don't miss it! Take my word for it.Suitable Ages: 18 &amp; up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think anyone can seriously stand up and argue that Gladiator was the best film of 2000, especially given the other two competitors: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Traffic. Between these two I believe it's kind of toss up, although the edge probably goes to Crouching Tiger just because it's a dazzling movie to watch.But, I'm not writing about Crouching Tiger, I'm writing about Traffic. Why? Because Traffic is an important movie, and important movies really aren't being made any more, or at least recently, or at least by big studios. Crouching Tiger is an important movie, but for reasons that are less immediate; Gladiator isn't important at all.Steven Soderberg deserves a lot of credit for making a wonderful film out of a very long British BBC series, if for no other reason than because nothing is really lost in this American version. Virtually every aspect of the drug trade is covered to some degree: users, dealers, importers, suppliers, American distributors, American border patrol, American drug policy, Mexican drug control, Mexican law enforcement, etc. Out of all of this comes a movie that is obviously very thorough, but also very moving, because--and this is where I insert my own opinion--it covers the affect of drugs beyond the purely effectual, as in Requiem for a Dream. This movie is more ambitious. There is the sense one gets from taking drugs by what we see from Caroline, and we also see why prosecuting and incarcerating people like Caroline may not be such a good idea, and why the Michael Douglas character has to give up his hopes of becoming the drug czar.Yet it is important to get people off drugs, and that is why you have the DEA agents, and Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez. Even if the "war" is misguided the message, and the effect drugs can have on people, is not.There is also the dark side of drugs, the world of backstabbing and retribution and assassination and manipulation. These are given human faces but nothing redeeming and are necessarily awful.People may not like how this movie changes color tones from sequence to sequence, but what the heck? It doesn't change the movie, and it allows you to distinguish each sequence, so why not?This is a very polished film, and one that flows very well. The editing is superb, and the music is always subtle but there to add just what is needed. This is great film making, and Soderberg deserved the Oscar, even if Ang Lee did as well--you can't give it to two people unfortunately.This is also an important movie, and one that is worth every minute if you can have the patience to watch.</fullReview>

Soderburgh's unique way of capturing the events in three places using colours: yellow for Mexico, Blue for Michael Douglas' story and normal colours for Don Cheadle's story.I am a big fan of Soderburgh's work: my favourites being Kafka and The Limey. Both are originally in approach using experimental techniques to capture nice visuals.The usefulness about having multi-narrative is that you never seem to get bored it is always switching.There were times however when I got abit confused about hat was happening.Great acting by Benecio Del Toro, Don Cheadle and surprisingly Catherine Zeta Jones who puts in a great performance.If you want a really interesting journey into what is going on in the world concerning drugs watch this.

		<fullReview>At the end of this film I was left feeling "well we might as well all just surrender and get hooked on Heroine, then" - such was the overwhelming gloom. Its documentary style gave it a serious rather than an entertaining feel, which added to the depression. Perhaps that is why I didn't 'enjoy' it as much as either Trainspotting or 'Requiem to a dream.' They too were depressing but I though they were far better films than this.When will someone make a film where a non-smoker is the hero and cigarettes and drink are exposed as the corrupt, money making machines they are? TRAFFIC seemed to be pretty clearly saying that about the drug industry - but what about booze and fags? Dunno. I thought it was just a bit overrated. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was stange film as there was so much good about it, but sadly so much awful about it. Now what I know about the deep core of drug culture you can write on the back of a postage stamp, so the realistic / unrealistic aspect I'll sit on the fence with.Loose spoilersBut on the credit side, good acting from Del-Toro &amp; surprisingly Douglas &amp; Don Cheadle too. There are some interesting stories running through. It's relatively easy to follow, carries one or two good message, occasionally builds up some suspense with some excellent scenes, kept me interested and was one of the better drug related films I've seen, but I'm not a huge fan of the genre.On the debit side however was really that I'm not sure what the purpose of the film was at all. In on sense it was far too long. 2 hours &amp; 20 minutes to tell at story that only occasionally verged on fascinating or exciting was too much, mainly due to there being one segment lasting for 6 minutes without a word, just background music, another one for about 3 minutes.However in another sense, the film only ever touched on the plot. There were between 3-4 plots running along. Any one was long enough for a film on it's own. Thus you were left with 4 stories that sort of come together but sort of didn't. The characters (Douglas, Del Toro, Jones) never met up or came together. None of the 4 plots were completely resolved. It was as if we were left to wait for a Traffic 2 like with Lord of the Rings. We're left with Don Cheadles camera under the desk? Well what then? The Mexican story may have resolved itself but if it did I missed it. I can't hand on heart say I understand exactly how the General, the presumed dead bloke or the Obrego brothers were left when it ended &amp; what the viewer was meant to presume.Two scenes severely let Traffic down though, Zeta Jones going from doting mum &amp; housewife to gangland villain overnight &amp; Michael Douglas entering the drug den to take on all comers on his own.Worse than all of that though was the editing &amp; poncy colours they used. I generally don't like that but can put up with it if I see how it adds to the film. But for the life of me I can't see what the Mexican scenes being in yellow &amp; the odd Douglas one being toned blue actually achieved. For the first hour the Mexican based scenes were the best but by the end they'd become a pain up the arse. The film was always soap opera style ie one good scene, but then have to sit through a dull one to get to the next interesting bit, by which time you'd forgotten what had happened in the previous one.There was no one character here to like or connect too, occasionally Del Toro but never enough, nor was there any real resolvement to the plots that had been set up. There were a variety of messages it sent out but no clear one &amp; despite not a bad film I couldn't help thinking "what was the point"?A low 6-10</fullReview>

For people who appreciate a little more depth, you may enjoy this movie.TRAFFIC is a documentary. Its main purpose is to explore the cyclical nature of the drug dilemma (simple supply and demand at work). It does not take sides, nor does it preach like some people seem to believe it does. The characters do express their feelings about intensifying or ending the drug war. This is not preaching by the filmmaker. It is character development.As you know, the drug war seems like a no win situation for everyone involved. TRAFFIC explores that idea and brings it together with an interesting story and superb acting. This movie focuses on the big picture, unlike TRAINSPOTTING and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, which mainly focus on the devastating effects drugs have on the end user.If you like thought provoking movies, check this one out. If not, skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, Contrived Average Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know the vast majority of people think this is a great movie, but I am not in that camp. The movie was filled with plot holes and the Mexico film scenes were filmed in an annoying yellow grainy style that I found unnecessary.The movie would have us believe that Michael Douglas the drug czar of the United States has to go looking for his lost teenage daughter by himself and when her drug supplier tells him to get lost he just leaves. Not for one second do I believe it. This guy has enough power to have law enforcement all over this drug dealer, but he just walks away. And his wife, she just sits there and says the daughter has to find herself.A contrived movie hoping to make the point that the fight against drugs is hopeless. It might be hopeless, but should the government do nothing? The movie never answers that question. I will say the performances were good and the movie had a style not frequently seen, although the Mexico scenes were overly annoying.When the movie was over I for one was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film, enjoyable at face value.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is certainly a film a cut above the average dross and is enjoyable taken at face value as a drama/thriller. It isn't however a remarkable film, and falls down slightly by trying to be more profound than the script warrants.The film is edited in a style I enjoy (the Robert Altman mold), however the style can be used to keep interest in what could otherwise be a dull plot (like a Soap Opera), and i feel this film would be very boring in traditional format.Different camera filters are used for each of the plot threads: Bleached for Mexico; Blue for the Czar; and diffused for the dealer/court thread. I pondered why these were used and if it could signify some subtext like in the Trois Couleurs trilogy - however i can't seem to see any, and suspect it is just for atmosphere (or i dread to think, to "colour-code" the plot lines to keep things simple.) Much more could have been made of this element though.A minor complaint is the bulk of the story takes place during the space of a month (from the Drug Czar's induction to his first speech), resulting in some plot elements lacking a sense of proper pace e.g. Helena and The Czar's daughter's rapid transformations.One of the worst things a director can do is patronize the viewer by over explaining things and drilling points home repeatedly (one of the only things i didn't like about Magnolia). Soderbergh holds up quite well in this respect (by not falling into the obvious trap of preaching), but does end up over explaining a bit too much i.e. we have unlikely characters blurting out social commentary on various aspects of the drug war. This works very well in some instances (The Drug Czar's introductions gives Soderbergh a wonderful opportunity to present a variety of views), but looses some realism a lot of the time.The film overall is highly watchable, but lacked depth in many ways (which made a second viewing very boring). It would also have been interesting to have a strand on the source of the drugs i.e. the farming.The final scene is my favorite - understated credits, a nice score and some wonderful cinematography. The assassination scene is quite clever also.There are a good number of films tackling addiction, and Traffic holds up quite well - it pales though against others such as "Nil By Mouth", "Requiem for a Dream", "Midnight Express", and "Once Were Warriors".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic has some good moments, but is overrated and cliched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We enjoyed the general mode of direction and story line. There were some intense and well-acted moments. However, the viewpoint of the drug world was not as deep as I would have liked: as in all drugs are evil. There was no mention of legalization of drugs as a solution - even remotely. Marijuana as usual was lumped into the same category as heroin. The biggest flaw, however, was the unbelievable transformation of Zeta-Jones from house wife to drug king-pin in just a few movie seconds. If fact, there was no visible transformation - she just was. I enjoyed performances by Topher Grace, Ben Bratt, Don Cheadle and believe it or not James Brolin. Benicio Deltoro was also impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I remember thinking just how amazing of a movie this is. Not only is the plot and acting exellent, but the way the movie was filmed and edited is simply amazing. I love Soderbergh's unique directing style; the grainy, intense colors, and the diferent camera angles. Another part of the movie that I love is the way it was edited; like at one point, you see michal douglas's character start walking up the stairs, then it cuts to a shot of him at the top of the stairs. From an editing perspective, it's simply amazing!I also love the way the many different stories flow together to form one big, thought provoking insight into the world of drugs.Traffic is one amazing movie, and I hope anyone who reads this, goes out and watches Traffic for themselves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scruffy-looking visuals, no music, a highlight movie of 2000!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic, is all about the lives of those involved in the drug wars: families, law enforcement officers, drug dealers, and drug users.While watching it, you might spend most of the time hoping that the characters of the different lives will finally get together and know each other. Well, they won't. And the director put that in a good way. You might not like the visuals, with all its filtered "viewed-from-Bono's-yellow-sunglasses" glory, which looks scruffy. But it adds to the overall atmosphere (though I couldn't really link the yellow-view to the story).Anyway, the cast is very very natural and casual in playing their respective characters that you could swear it's like someone that you can meet next door or next to your movie theater seat. Some of them may not be on Hollywood's who's who list, but the ensemble is very good.You might also be so into the story that you may not notice that the movie uses very little music. As a listener of movie music, I'm a little disappointed. But Soderbergh managed to 'cover' it up with a very engaging story, cast, and atmosphere that manages to take you there to San Diego, Tijuana, and the Ohio area. And that is a good thing.In this movie, the message is clear. That the war against drugs means nothing, if not started from within our own families. I have a relative who was a crack addict and only recently gained freedom from it. I found out that I was one of the reasons he did it in the first place. That I was NOT LISTENING. Here's to another gem of the movie media!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent cinema. I think it is the first film in which I actually liked what Michael Douglas was doing. Soderbergh shows great ideas in his concept of not only planning the film but the filming techniques used. Intelligent and articulate ? well, that needs some explaining! The use of modern-day North American English is certainly an up-date on my antiquated British style, as well as the fact that the Mexican version of Spanish was also an interesting language lesson, as there are great differences to the classical Iberian usage to which I am accustomed. Thus the already apparent authenticity of the film was enhanced even more. Superb, sober telling of the harsh facts of the narcotics business, and sensibly leaving out the clichés, over-acting and other banalities which could so easily have crept in. What do you say over there in the U.S? Ah, yes! ? Kudos, Mr Soderbergh, Kudos to you, sir, and all the cast.An excellent piece of work.</fullReview>

Interweaving three different stories at once, Soderbergh shows the various views of the drug trade. Cheadle and Guzman play DEA partners in very underrated roles, and provide the movie with it's most powerful moments. Douglas is the new drug czar who finds out his daughter is a substance abuser. Zeta-Jones is the wife of arrested drug dealer, who is at first shocked at the realization, but later decides to continue it. Throughout the movie Soderberg employed innovative filming techniques and a moving soundtrack to convey the emotion of the film. The movie was compelling, realistic, and emotional, and the best film of 2000.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and overblown (Del Toro is good, though)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After managing to sit through Traffic, I tried to figure out why it was made. It seemed as though it was intended as a "serious" film, rather than a simple profit generator, but all of its subplots seemed simultaneously obvious and silly. I could only imagine that the director thought he was revealing some important truth about illegal drugs, or the "war" on them. Well, maybe if you were asleep for the last quarter of the twentieth century this movie might tell you something you don't know about the illegal drug trade, and the criminals and politicians whose livelihoods depend on it, but otherwise - I don't think so.Anyway, it isn't a documentary, so maybe it is unfair to criticize it for not being informative. But it isn't even entertaining, despite some pretty decent acting, due to basic problems of structure and execution. There are too many plots, necessitating too many technical events (cuts, etc.) that make the whole thing look like a soap opera. That gimmick with the colors is embarrassingly corny, the more so because it is completely unnecessary. The only subplot that hangs together is Del Toro's; both Zeta-Jones's and Douglas's plots made me groan due to their implausibility.All in all, I give it a 4, because I am feeling generous this season.</fullReview>

All I really want to say is that the acting is (seriously) top-notch: Miguel Ferrer, for example. Soderberg's almost documentary-esque style of filming gives the film a decidedly realistic ambience, plus the use of diegetic sound is superb. Finally, perhaps what I found most impressive with the film is the amazing soundtrack. It may be somewhat superficial to like a film simply on the strength of the score alone but Cliff Martinez is a genius. I cannot think of a (recent) film where the soundtrack has moved me quite so much. As for Brian Eno's final score ('Ascent') well...it still gives me goose-bumps when I hear it even to this day. All I can picture is Benicio Del Toro sitting and quietly applauding kids playing baseball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a pretty good, though somewhat overrated film. It portrays the ridiculous War on Drugs that US (and occasionally other) politicians run in a grab for cheap votes. The movie is quite ambitious in that it tries to show three different angles to the story. There's the side of the Mexican cop played by Benicio Del Toro who has to fight against corruption as well as drug smuggling. Then there's the two US cops played by Don Cheadle and the sublime Luis Guzman, who go after importers on the other side of the border in San Diego. Finally there's Michael Douglas as the newly appointed head of the DEA.The three stories are filmed in distinctly different colour schemes to make an easy distinction that becomes more distracting than anything else. Thus, the head of the DEA story is drenched in blue tones and the Mexican shots are all covered in yellow but the whole thing becomes gimmicky very quickly and the film would have been better without it.What makes the film good is that it generally strays from the obvious path and instead shows that there are no easy solutions. As long as there's a profit in it people will always push drugs and no amount of manpower or moralistic high ground is going to change that.Where it loses it somewhat is when it tries to hammer home some points with a few cheap shots. There's the head of the DEA who has a bit of a drinking problem himself for one. Even worse is his daughter who becomes a junkie in a badly executed "we try to fight a global war while we can't even control what's going on at home" point. This is really underdeveloped and badly done. Erika Christensen who plays Michael Douglas's daughter goes from the upper class nice girl who occasionally does dope on campus to a drug addict who runs away and prostitutes herself for dope within a couple of days. This is a bad lapse into the "one sniff and you're hooked for life" cliche that is behind a lot of the War on Drugs policy.Another lapse of taste is the ending which I won't give away here, other than to say that it's an obvious test audience ending. I'm certain that after an initial test screening a couple of hicks requested a more upbeat ending that really spoils an otherwise good film now.Unlike a lot of US movies, particularly ones dealing with drugs and pushers the characters are quite well developed and Steven Soderbergh avoids painting them in simple black and white. His direction is quite good apart from the above mentioned points. There are a lot of different characters and plots in this movie but these are woven together quite neatly. The film also never looses it's fast pace and despite it's length is very entertaining to watch. As a point on the war on drugs Bill Hicks summed it up much quicker a couple of years earlier though, "It means that there's a war and that people on drugs are winning it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This film is OK, but wa-a-a-y overrated. Soderbergh does a decent job weaving together the various storylines, which is a difficult task... but they're kinda boring, to be honest. Soderbergh's detached cool doesn't really work for a story that's supposed to act as a hard-hitting drama, especially one with a pretty unequivocal political mesage. While the acting is solid and the editing tight, the cinematography is amateurish and over-stylized - the too-contrasty photography, the exaggerated use of colored filters, the NYPD Blue-style shaky handheld-with-an-exclamation-point shots. Plus, I don't buy some of the plot twists: Catherine Zeta-Jones goes from being a genteel housewife who doesn't know her husband is a major drug tycoon to a hard-bitten, assassination-ordering femme fatale in the space of like two scenes, and the only justification we're given for this is that she grew up poor and doesn't want to lose her upper-class lifestyle. Then Michael Douglas, instead of resigning his post, actually breaks down DURING his first press conference as the U.S. Drug Czar and renounces the nation's "war on drugs" as misguided. Yeah, right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great representation of the drug war on all fronts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie clearly defines the drug war from several points of view. It has a message, but it isn't preachy about it thankfully. And much of that message is open to viewer intrepretation; to the director's credit. There was a spot in the movie where there could have been a preachy message in Michael Douglas' speech, but they realistically avoided that. It is such a relief to see a movie use subtlety. The movie ranks as one of the top 5 films of 2000, if not the best. But it isn't a masterpiece, just a fine work of directing and acting.In fact, this movie shows what it means to direct and act in a film. I would hope more directors and actors take note of how it is done right. So many do it wrong...The only bad thing I can think of in this movie is the strong use of tinting. While I do like the concept of tinting, I think it is slightly overdone. But it doesn't detract from the film itself which is a good thing. Mainly because the storyline blends several complex stories seamlessly. I don't know of many directors that can accomplish this.And I certainly had no complaints about the use of Spanish. To do anything different would make a terrible film. They were trying to paint a realistic picture after all. If you don't want to read anything in a film don't watch this movie.It's unfortunate people don't realize how difficult it is to blend several stories together effectively. I have seen so many movies that can't accomplish this. If you have a short attention span, and like short action movies, do not watch this. There are some obvious complaints from these people. Aside from an early intense gunfight in the movie, there is not much else in the movie in terms of action. Watch this movie not for some special effects, action bonanza, but for a film flawlessly directed, with fabulous acting on top of a good storyline.summary: definately watch this movie if you like "real" movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my humble opinion, overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure "Traffic" is a film that means well and all, but I did not like it. I was quite excited about seeing it, as so many people have been praising it, but 30 minutes into the film, I began to wonder if I was watching the right movie."Traffic" is, in a word, boring. That isn't its biggest problem though; it's filmed in such a way that the audience doesn't really get to connect with the characters. Soderbergh would show you one scene, and just when that scene is getting exciting, he'd jump to another, and another, and another, so that when he returns to the first one, you've already forgotten what just took place. It's original film-making, yes, but is it effective? I didn't think so.The main reason I wanted to see "Traffic" is Benicio Del Toro. I was quite irked by the fact that he has been winning Best Supporting Actor awards left and right, instead of Joaquin Phoenix, my favourite actor. I was hoping to be somewhat consoled that the awards went to the right person (unlike Best Actress), but I wasn't. After all the hype his performance has received, I would think it's something worth hyping over. I couldn't see at all what was so awesome about his acting. Half the time I couldn't understand a word he was saying, and I didn't follow his story at all, which eventually leads back to the point I made in the previous paragraph. And it didn't help either that I was about to fall asleep in the middle of the movie, and I watched it at 11 a.m.!Back to point made in paragraph two. I did not care about most of the characters. Del Toro's story was boring, and his acting made me unable to empathise with him. Besides Del Toro, the only other segment I remember is the one with Michael Douglas and his daughter. His daughter was the only character I cared about, and I thought the actress was so much better than Del Toro. Michael Douglas's story could've spawned an entire movie on its own; I think it should've. "Traffic" fails to connect and to touch (which I thought was something 1995's "The Basketball Diaries" starring Leonardo DiCaprio did do), and it doesn't seem to have a clear idea where it's heading. If it didn't jump stories so often, I think I would appreciate it a lot more than I do right now.I guess I should mention the fact that I did see a pirated copy of it. But if in order to appreciate it means watching it on a better quality disc...I would rather not do it. Not even if you give me the DVD for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the best film I've seen this year. Traffic is an extremely well done drama that manages to be insightful and thought provoking while at the same time not seeming like a paid advertisement about the danger of narcotics. The film is about the drug trade between the Mexico and US border. The plot involves several different story lines. Michael Douglas plays a newly appointed drug czar who is in charge of fighting the war on drugs but runs into some problems when his daughter gets addicted. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the unsuspecting wife of a narcotics importer, who only learns of his business after he gets arrested. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are two cops assigned to protect a witness before trail, who also happens to be an importer. There are several subplots as well but the real eye catcher is the performance of Benicio Del Toro as a corrupt Mexican police officer, which is sure to grab him an Oscar. That being said, the whole cast practically deserves an Oscar. There is not one bad performance in the whole film. It could be said though, that the real star of the film is its director, Steven Soderbergh. I don't know what it is about this guy but all the critics seem to be in love with him. Personally I don't think he is all that great. Sex, Lies and videotape nearly put me to sleep, Out of Sight wasn't anywhere near as good as critics said it was and although I did like The Limey it was by no means one of the years' best. However earlier this year the director managed to strike a cord with audiences (and of course critics) when he made the mega-grossing Erin Brockovich, putting him on the Hollywood A-list. Which brings us back to Traffic. The film has a nice look to it; the scenes in Mexico were all bleached with a yellow tint giving it a very atmospheric feel. I'm kind of split on the camera work though, which was also done by Soderbergh. Because he carried the camera instead of using track shots; scenes are often shaky and unprofessional looking. However you soon get used to this and after 20 minutes you won't even notice it. It also kind of helps the movie adding a grittier feel to it. Check this one out, it's definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of some bad luck, I never got a chance to see this in the theater. So I had to settle for renting this. Thus, I already had heard the hype of "Traffic". Already had seen Benicio Del Toro get his Oscar. Already had heard how it was "the real Best Movie of 2000" etc. etc.So, when it came time to watch this movie I had VERY high expectations."Traffic" did not disappoint !This is the best movie I have ever seen on the "Drug War"....I would even go so far as to say that there will probably never be another movie that depicts the Drug War as thoroughly. That is because this movie covers EVERY SINGLE STAGE of the Drug War from foreign drug lords, to foreign police, to Southern California distributors, to street dealers, to users, to the American undercover detectives, to the head of the DEA. You just can't get more extensive than that !This movie does a brilliant job of putting all the pieces together in the drug puzzle. The idea of using the head of the DEA's daughter as a child drug-addict is a perfect way to segue between users and government. It is the only way that this extensive story could have fit into a single film.The direction is also brilliant. The most amazing part of the direction is the fact that it was done by Steven Soderbergh, who directed "Erin Brokovich" the same year !!! That is one busy individual ! He completely deserved to get the Best Director award. He really adds interesting elements to certain scenes, which help capture the moment : In Mexico he uses a orange/gold lens filter that exemplifies the dry feeling of the desert. In the assassination scene he uses quick, short shots to show the panic of the moment. The scenes depicting the teenagers freebasing cocaine (and later shooting heroin) are downright eery.The script is great as well. So much so, that you want to listen to the bad guys talk, because they make really great points when they do.I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

Meanwhile his own daughter experiments with a drugs and gets further involved with the lifestyle associated with addiction.Benicio del Toro is a Mexican policeman battling not only the drug smuggling gangs but the heavily corrupted para-military police force. He won an Oscar for his role and you would have to agree with the Academy's judgement after watching this movie.Catherine Zeta-Jones is the privileged and very pregnant society housewife forced to get involved with her drug-dealing husband's associates after he is arrested.Fortunately you don't get seasick with the hopping between stories; what helps is that the scenes are played in chronological order and some stories link with others to help bring the whole thing together. The acting is top quality, and the Oscar-winning direction is innovative and totally engaging. Steven Soderbergh certainly has come a long way since the very interesting "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and I look forward to more of his work. As for the comment on the drugs problem, the battle is very fierce and sometimes hopeless; the overall feeling you take away is that the situation is very serious, but not totally futile.Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it was just that this movie had too much build up, but I was disappointed at best.I didn't think there was anything original in this movie. You had to work too hard to keep the characters (and their motives) straight.I didn't particularly care for the subtitles (although the Spanish added a flavor of reality) and I thought the sepia tone was over used.Let's get really, real though. There is no way on God's green earth that the Drug Tsar of the United States of America would be driving around the slums by himself looking for his strung out daughter. It just WOULDN'T HAPPEN! This scenario just goes above and beyond the realm of "literary license".All in all there are many other movies that I would spend 2-1/2 hours watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" is quite possibly the most boring film I have ever seen. The director (of the excellent "sex, lies and videotape") manages to make what could have been a fairly interesting narrative utterly banal and irrelevant. I did not empathise with anyone, the plot strands are too disparate (and shot in an irritating blue or orange tint), the films is quite obviously far too long; in fact, there is simply nothing that I could possibly recommend (except, perhaps, for the acting, which is adequate.)Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie!!! One of the best movies I've ever seen. It has a great script, great directing and above all great acting.Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bencio Del Toro probably made the rolls of their careers. Steven Soderbergh-really good director indeed. He made two oscar nominated movies in one year: Traffic and Erin Brocovich.The best role in my opinion and many others made Bencio Del Toro, who plays a mexican local constabel Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.Del Toro later got an oscar for best male in supporting role.A good acting was made by Michael Douglas who plays a judge who becomes the Drug Czar.The movie was made in a special way. There were three alongside running stories: Bencio Del Toro's war, Michael Douglas' war and Catherine Zeta-Jones' husband trouble. What's interesting is that all three stories were filmed with a different camera and style.For me this movie was really great, it gave me a different look on how the drug traffic works.I give this movie nine out of ten because it has very little mistakes and a lot of good things that I have mentioned in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very impressive, serious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having anticipated seeing 'Traffic' for a long time, I found it all in all to be well worth the wait. For a start though, I would have to admit that I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece in any way. It has some outstanding good points, and gives quite a realistic slant on life - and yet some major flaws just spoil the overall seriousness of the issues involved.First of all, I just HAVE to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance throughout this movie. Although her actual acting of the role is excellent (in fact, perfect), I have never heard another actor/actress speak in American, English and Welsh accents all in one movie! It is rather a shame I found this so noticeable, because otherwise I feel she had surpassed herself in this film.Meanwhile, Michael Douglas I found to be extremely likeable, which is a new thing for me. Benicio Del Toro just once again convinced me that he IS the most interesting and intense actor around at the moment. I don't believe he has ever made a film where he has not put absolutely everything into his role, and this is no exception. Beni, even as a less-than-white character, always carries a strong screen presence which commands a certain respect and admiration. Don Cheadle is impressive, Dennis Quaid is also pretty good, and I was surprised to see a cameo from Albert Finney (how strange to see him in this movie!) The drugs issues in this movie are, on the whole, very true to life and almost depressingly realistic. I watched this film shortly after a shocking incident at my school which I found this movie echoed perfectly. As portrayed by the daughter in 'Traffic', it is often the rich kids, with too much brains and money for their own good, who end up turning to drugs and crime. However, in other respects this movie was rather shallow. I found the typical all-American 'lets-all-smile-and-forgive' ending extremely disappointing and in a way it seemed to erase all morals and messages that the film was trying to get across. In my opinion it would have been better to keep this film a warts-and-all story, which was done impressively with the Mexican scenes. If director Soderbergh had perhaps been a little less warm-hearted and given this film a more brutal edge, I perhaps would agree with his winning the Oscar. As it happens, I feel Ridley Scott was wronged after re-opening a whole genre with 'Gladiator'. At least they got it right with Benicio Del Toro - a subtle, masterly performance which surely should seal his star status.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but half baked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is an entertaining movie, but it is absolutely not a masterpiece. The scenes from Mexico are the best in the movie, but this story should have been developed more, I would have liked to see more of whats going on I Mexico. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his performance and he is really cool and a very good actor. (Not only in this movie, think about his performances in The Usual Suspects and Way of the Gun).Different stories take place in Mexico and USA and in the states we get to see Michael Douglas doing his usual role as a bigwig. There is nothing wrong with his performance, he can do this in his sleep, but it is strange that such a powerful figure can do so little to help his daughter (b.t.w. excellent performance by Erika Christensen), but maybe that is the point. Some of the scenes involving MD seems unnecessary though and if I had directed the movie I would have skipped this part entirely. The other american story in the movie is hard to believe. I am not thinking about difficulties to protect witnesses, those kind of scenes have we seen many times before. But how can Zeta-Jones transform from an innocent housewife into a cold-blooded druglord ? That is what she very rapidly has to do to protect her family life in luxury, but how can she manage ? Where does she get the knowledge ? It is also hard to believe that Dennis Quaids´ character is so stupid. It would have been easy to change things so that Quaid, who knows what is going on, takes care of business instead of Zeta-Jones. The point that she is prepared to do anything to protect her interests did not have to be lost, she could still encourage Quaid to act ruthless on her behalf. The movie consists of three different stories and this fact is both a strength and a weakness. All the stories are half baked but the shifting from one story to another makes sure that we never get bored with any one of them. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a decent supporting cast (including Amy Irving, Jacob Vargas and Erika Christensen in a subtle performance as the Drug Czar's heroin addict daughter) I was bored silly most of the time. Too bored even to respond as vehemently as I could have to the film's basic conceptualization of the "drug problem" as being mainly one of race and/or nationality (consider how "Mexico" was representedin the mise en scene) and where everyone, except the police and thegovernment of course (Senators Barbara Boxer and Orrin G. Hatch playthemselves), is either severely morally compromised or complete scum. Theostensible main point of the movie, that the war on drugs has too manyunacceptable casualties, is delivered with smarm (just like Soderbergh's Oscar acceptance speech) rather than compassion and the entire 140+ minutesgurgles and hand-wrings fitfully over its plot machinations with little drama and even fewer original ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only imagine why this film didn't get Best Picture - perhaps it was too complex, and pushed the envelope a bit much, for a large segment of its audience.But for me the film was compelling from start to finish. First and foremost: Soderbergh's direction and Gaghan's writing were stunning individually; but in combination created something beyond that, something that carves out a new and personal appreciation for gritty drama and dark irony. Director and writer worked closely on this and it shows; it's something directors should do more often.The acting was superb, without exception (something I've never before said of Catherine Zeta Jones). The party that Wakefield (Michael Douglas) attended was a treat; I cackled aloud as Orrin Hatch and the other senators opined there - but you know that Orrin, He-Devil, has an excellent singing voice.During the first few scenes I squirmed a bit, worried the entire movie would be washed in uncomfortable tints; but at the first true-color scene I relaxed, and found it well-chosen thereafter.I found it difficult to read the subtitles at times, which struck me as a pretty beat snafu given the skill of the rest of it, but overall this movie is among my favorites and a no-brainer 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched Traffic for the first time, after having a few relaxing drinks. It's a film that feels almost European in origin, I'm in the UK &amp; I didn't watch the Channel 4 series, so that must put me in a minority for a start. Traffic is a very ambigeous file, should you feel sorry for the Zeta-Jones character, she was in fear on her sons' life ? Is Toros as honest as he seems, the scenes with Ana ? As in real life there is no happy ending, those films which embrace that fact rather then impose some 'Hollywood' happy ending are those films which people return to. It's a stunning film, the way in which Mexico is sepia-toned, whilst the US is Techncolour is a nice touch. There are few films that I would actually actively go out &amp; buy and 'Traffic' is one of them. Remember real life is rarely black and white, happy endings are few &amp; far between</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is an important social realistic film. How do I know this? Because this movie is more boring than church. You can stuff it full of as many fancy filmic techniques as you like, but you're never going to get a good film out of it.And stuff it with fancy filmic techniques they do. Traffic looks fantastic. The colour filtering makes it visually striking. And the editing ? the editing is excellent. I didn't realise editing could be this good; I just thought that editing was editing. But that's the thing ? I don't go to the cinema to be stunned by the editing. The last thing I want to be focusing on in a movie is the quality of the editing, but it's just so much more interesting than the plot and the dialog.And in retrospect I wonder how I can have found the plot as dull as I did ? it's a movie about drugs, with lots of guns and raids. It is, in fact, quite an achievement to make this movie as dull as it is. And it's not the achievement of the actors. Everyone puts in good performances, extremely good in some cases.You can understand the critics being full of praise for the film, because cinematically it is wonderful. But whilst falling over themselves to congratulate Mr Soderbergh and worshipping him as their one true god, what the critics have all failed to notice is that as a piece of entertainment, TRAFFIC SUCKS. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is many things, but the general theme is the U.S. war against drugs. We see the family fighting the drug using kids, we see the woman whose husband is dragged away by the DEA, we see the DEA in action, we see it from the point of view of the Mexican police, and so forth.This is all good because you see that there is many sides to a story. However, it also means that you get a lot of short stories (much like in Magnolia or Shortcuts) of which none are really good (unlike Magnolia and Shortcuts which both has good short stories).On one hand this is acceptable because it seems very believable and realistic but on the other hand it gets boring and predictable very fast. The story actually has no surprises at all.I give it a 6, because it is realistic and well-played but has a boring plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the theater after hearing alot of good things about it. I had a hard time at first following the characters and who was who, who was good and bad, who was a cop and a trafficker, etc..It took me watching the movie the second time to know completely who was who and after you get that figured out, this film is amazing, so well made and realistic. I was not a big fan of Benecio Del Toro at the time but while watching the film, something about him stood out and I think he is awesome. There are several different storylines and although some of the characters share no scenes together, they all are in it together for one reason-DRUGS.There are 2 main heavy drug cartels in this movie. The Juarez cartel amd the Tijuana cartel. When both sides are happy nobody gets killed, as long as they make their money. When things are bad, people die.Benecio Del Toro earned this well deserved Oscar as a slightly crooked but anti-drug cop who is tired of seeing his country torn apart by drug traffickers. His partner in crime is his buddy Manolo who is also has some tricks of his sleeve. They are working for a local corrupt police force when the opportunity arises for them to work for a bigger entity.Michael Douglas plays a judge who is just appointed to being the drug czar for the US. He has a 16 year old daughter who is an addict.Catherine Zeta Jones plays a pregnant housewife whos husband is arrested and being charged with drug trafficking. Don Cheadle plays an undercover cop. Him and his partner bust one of the largest dealers in the country-Eduardo Ruiz and they try to get him to snitch on his superiors.The movie is intense. I couldnt keep my eyes off of the screen although like I said, the first time it was a little hard to follow. The second time cleared up almost all of what I was confused on the first time. The hardest part is just figuring out who all the people are, but for some people who are good at following slightly confusing movies, they won't have a problem following it. The ending is awesome. GREAT MOVIE! I rarely give movies 10 out of 10 but this one gets one from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's not hard to believe, in the current cinematic climate that some people found this film a little boring. It seems as though movie watchers have become so used to films becoming little more than trite, lowest-common-denominator, unchallenging muck that when a genuinely intelligent, well-made film comes along, it is ignored.I can understand people not liking it on the first viewing, as it is a little complex - though that, I think, is the intention, but where it really comes to life is watching it the second time around. Someone described it as Reaganite propaganda. This is wrong. In the house of Judge Wakefield, the two different approaches to drug use; the wishy-washy liberal approach and the hard-nosed, uncaring approach are thrashed out. Soderbergh does not shirk his responsibility, as writers since Arthur Miller have, and while decrying the situation, also presents solutions to it. That is just one example of it. Seriously, to anyone who was confused first time; watch it again, the plot will be clearer and the wonderfully constructed layers of thought and effort come into play.Like it says at the top....a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Michael Douglas is a judge with special power for the drug fighting in USA. His position is rather political and less operative. Has a beautiful family with a daughter who is a drug-addict. All the shots in Mexico are in a sort of black and yellow colors which give a dusty and unsecure atmosphere. There are some passages of the film really well achieved like the one when the judge has a press conference and decides to modify it according to his personal and familiar problems.Far better than "Scarface" is a psychological not too violent film about this rotten world.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is a fantastic piece of film making. No movie has ever come close to illustrating the picture this movies forms about the drug war. It involves three different stories that are in some way connected that tells how lives are effected by the drug war. This movie doesn't tell you what to think, it lets you make up your mind, but it clearly shows how the drug war, at least the way we are fighting it now, is failing. This movie comes from the line of other great films like Magnolia, and one of the best films of the 90s, Pulp Fiction, in becoming a movie that involves different stories that are interconnected and works surprisingly well. My only complaint is that it's somewhat confusing. It's a movie you need to see more than once. I give Traffic a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Powerful Stories With Powerful Performances Throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" involves three separate but intertwining stories concerning the activities of a Tijuana drug cartel. The first involves two Mexican cops (Benicio Del Toro, Jacob Vargas) trying to bring down the cartel by aiding one General Salazar (Tomas Milian). During the course of their investigations, they are exposed to the General's unconventional methods in achieving his goals. This causes some problems between the two partners. Del Toro is excellent and deservedly won the 2000 best supporting actor award for his performance. The second story centers around two federal officers (Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman) trying to protect key witness Miguel Ferrer, who is to testify at the trial of drug magnate Steven Bauer. Bauer's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is surprised at his arrest and sets out to find out what is happening with the assistance of family friend Dennis Quaid who has his own agenda. The evolution of the Jones character is perhaps the most interesting one to watch. The third story involves a newly appointed Drug Czar (Michael Douglas), named by the President to head up the fight against drugs. His task is complicated when his daughter (Erika Chistensen) gets involved with drugs with some of her friends. Douglas is then torn between his family responsibilities and his presidential appointment. Amy Irving appears as Douglas' wife who is unable to deal with their daughter's problem. A number of familiar faces turn up in minor roles as well. Albert Finney appears as the President's Chief of Staff, James Brolin as a U.S. Army general and Benjamin Bratt as a Mexican drug dealer. The three stories are treated independent of each other, although some of the characters from the other stories do meet in passing. Director Steven Soderbergh has filmed each story using a different color tint which aides the viewer in keeping track of the various goings on. "Traffic" is an excellent film with fine performances throughout. One hardly notices the 147 minute running time passing by. As a note of interest, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones who were a hot item when this film was made, do not appear in any scenes together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is lousy. It is the most boring film I have ever seen - a total waste of time.Traffic is supposed to be a remake of the 1989 BBC mini series - which it is. It's the same story just set in a different part of the world and almost 3 hours shorter. That's a lot of detail to lose from a story like this. All the substance to the series has been sacrificed to resulting in a very bland movie. One more complaint, the shaky camera effect makes the film look very amateurish. I know why it was employed, but it just doesn't work.Forget the film. Just go and get the mini series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I thought it was brilliant and powerful. It captured something of the chaos of the Mexican border and punched home the truth that demand for drugs is the problem. Then, I saw the original British TV series, `Traffik.' Now, that is a film! Its length, more than five hours, permitted a deeper understanding. Although it's locales were Pakistan, Afghanistan, Germany, and England, the story was clearer and the characters more understanding than in the American remake. After watching `Traffic' again, I still say it is a very well made and powerful film, but it ain't `Traffik.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing less than terrific. Drugs are the enemy in this war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kudos to director Steven Soderbergh for this look at the war against drugs. Cinematography, sometimes choppy editing and the great hand held camera work gives a feel of watching a news special instead of a movie. The subtitles almost get to be a pain in the butt. Very diverse cast and the myriad of stories that sometimes interchange make this one of the better movies to come along in a good while.Michael Douglas is a judge appointed by the President to be America's drug czar. He is very ambitious with this temporary assignment until he discovers that his daughter Erika Christensen is more than casually partaking of heavy drugs. Benicio Del Toro is a corrupt Mexican police officer that flirts danger by playing both sides against the middle. The ever so beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a cocaine distributor. Don Cheadle is an eager DEA agent. Dennis Quaid is a two-faced attorney. Miguel Ferrer is a captured import/export trafficer that is to be a star witness in federal court. Most of these characters lives intersect the others directly or indirectly. Users, dealers, investigators, politicians...each element is sampled in this glimpse into the drug driven counter culture.Supporting actors of note are: Luis Guzman, Clifton Collins Jr, and small roles for Benjamin Bratt, James Brolin and Albert Finney. Very strong language and violence are needed to support this movies reality. If you try to see at least one redeeming movie a year; this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is a bleak look at what goes on in the drug trade across the US/Mexican border. We see all aspects of how the process of drug smuggling happens from the people who get it across the border to the corrupt police and army ,to the way it affects the kids on the street. This is quite a frank and somewhat depressing view of the modern day drugs trade. The direction is superb as is the acting. Every time we are over the Mexican border the film is shot in sepia and every time we are with another set of people they have a different way the film is shot. sometimes they cross paths. Im not sure the mexican side of the film was meant not to have subtitles but my DVD didnt , so i had to fathom out what was going on without knowing the language. I think i did quite well! Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle put on the best performances. The only thing that lets the film down is the story , although fascinating , is hardly edge of the seat stuff. 8 out of 10 (just)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently broke my personal rule of not buying a DVD of a film which I hadn't seen before, but because of the critical acclaim this film has received and the topic of which many a TV movie has massacred I decided to bite the bullet and buy it. I was mostly impressed and was blown away by the subtle acting skills of Bel and the girl who played the drug addict was very good. I loved how they didn't give any 'happy' endings as this would be too close to the format that Disney use, I must say I was disappointed when Bel's character actually had to give into the drug corruption around him and use it in order to stop the police corruption that was occurring at the time, I was thinking 'nnnnooooooo' as he was a glimmer of hope that Mexico had so to speak, all in all, an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Drug War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At what point are people going to realize the hopelessness of the Drug War? That's what Steven Soderbergh attempts to answer in his excellent film, Traffic. The idea here is that no one gets away clean. It shows several situations about how drugs are effecting everyone everywhere. Cops in Mexico, cops in America, the government, teens, parents, drug dealers, and many others, everyone is getting involved in drugs, and those who try to stop drugs are beginning to realize the hopelessness of the issue. It's a depressing film, but it's a depressing world.Soderbergh's direction is truly outstanding. He takes a five hour show and makes into two and a half hours long. He makes himself head of photography, shooting many of the scenes himself, making all of them seem documentarylike, choosing different hues for different storylines, and effortlessly making the multiple storylines flow smoothly between each other. He did a pretty damn good job if you ask me, but if you figure in that he had half the time the normal filmmaker gets to make his film, it's almost unbelievable that he could get this good of results.Soderbergh is able to pull flawless performances from his cast, and, combined with the shaky cameras, it makes it all seem so realistic, as if we are following along with the storylines, or as if we possess the cameras. That is the secret to the power of Traffic, it's realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" most likely will be noted as a classic film in many years, largely due to an all-star cast with superior performances and the in-depthness of a subject matter that has been tackled before, but for the first time making it memorable and believable. It is a little long and may be a bit confusing at times since there are three totally different stories revolving around the deadly world of drug trafficking, and it goes back-and-forth amongst each one, sometimes shot in documentary style. Overall it is remarkable and earns 3 1/2 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you follow movies or not, you've probably heard of Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' (based upon the british TV series, Traffik). I've heard countless critics rave about how great and original it is, but nothing here really went the extra mile to make a classic (which is what most critics are giving it, if you consider a perfect to 4 and a half out of five a classic).Sure, there are many different, interesting plots interwined, from a senator's daughter being a heroin addict, corruption in the mexican police force, and more. And the screenplay was fantastic, Gaghan well deserved that oscar.But, despite great performances by all the cast members (although, unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed - none of the plots are interwined) and a superb script, the downfall of Traffic is that it's based on a TV miniseries, limiting what the director, producer and writer could have done with Traffic, and making it seem longer than it had to be (about 20 minutes too long...).Also, the plot about the senator's drug-addicted daughter is just mediocre...watch 'Requiem for a Dream' (which rightfully deserved the best picture nomination more than Traffic) and you'll know what I mean.Despite this, Traffic is still a recommendable and very good movie, but if it didn't have it's miniseries roots, it could have been a lot more (think the X-Files movie).7.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously this is first and foremost an entertainment. We don't want to be confused about that. But director Steven Soderbergh does have a didactic point, and it's one I agree with. The "war" on drugs will never be won with guns or law enforcement. We can see this in the extraordinary sequence in which Michael Douglas, playing the newly appointed drug czar of the United States, steps away from his job and returns to his family. He stops his speech and simply asks how can we fight a war in which the enemies are members of our own family?Better yet, he might have asked, how can we fight a war when the enemy is ourself?Soderbergh carefully avoids the appearance of taking sides, but the ending makes it clear that the "war" will go on; indeed the war has become institutionalized, a way of life for us and those involved in it. In some sense the war on drugs has become an entertainment for couch potatoes napping in front of the TV, as well as a patriotic rallying point for others.I thought Michael Douglas gave one of his finest performances, and Benicio Del Toro as the Tijuana cop torn between what he believes is right and the reality of his situation, was excellent. The hauntingly beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones was chillingly effective as a woman without morality, a sociopath with the survival instincts of a hyena. Dennis Quaid, hardly recognizable without the grin, was competent as a sleazy lawyer who gambled big time and lost. Don Cheadle as the "solider" in the war who loves the battle, the "war lover," so to speak, was intriguing. Erika Christensen deserves special praise for her compellingly true portrayal of an insecure teen who finds escape in the little death of heroin.But I wonder if the average person seeing this movie realizes what the message is, that the war on drugs is a fraud. Like the war in Vietnam it is a war that is, without changing the very nature of our society, unwinnable. It is a bureaucratic monstrosity that we have created because we need an evil we can hate.There is no "solution" to the "drug problem" because there is no solution to human nature. A better approach to keeping the problem at a manageable level would be decriminalization and a massive program of education. Why doesn't this happen? First, because the entrenched bureaucracy that has a vested interest in maintaining its position. Second, because the old "moral majority" in this country, people who imagine that they know the truth, and have the right to regulate the morality of others, will not allow it to end.They need a target for their hate. Note well that Douglas came home and renewed his efforts as a father because he realized that that is where he failed, as a father, and that is where we as a nation are failing. Education begins at home. If you don't know what kind of drugs your children are doing, then, as a parent, you don't know anything.Soderbergh tells this tragic story in a somewhat simplistic, but ultimately, very effective way. The use of tinted filters to lend atmosphere and perhaps to help orient the viewer did not bother me, but I agree with those who found them unnecessary and not particularly effective. On the other hand I thought the use of hand held cameras lend an intensity and immediacy to the action. Note that one of Soderbergh's techniques is to show just a partial view of the action, such as just the guns and the hands and arms of the killers as Dennis Quiad puts down the phone. We know what is going to happen from seeing only that much, and so does Quiad. In fact, this is the way we sometimes view the world, the salient objects in our view register and we act. Soderbergh's technique of showing the "war" at various levels and in differing environments and from differing points of view was obvious but nonetheless very effective.But Soderbergh did not go far enough. Instead of showing the vulnerability of a judge with a junkie for a daughter, he might have had the local police catch her trafficking out of her house and had them unconstitutionally seize his property. Maybe then the message would get home to the American people that the war on drugs has the potential to become a threat to our democracy and our republican form of government.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing, *almost* failure from Soderbergh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*WARNING (Spoilers)*Having been a huge Steven Soderbergh fan since 1998's Out of Sight, I was really looking forward to Traffic, what usually happens if you take a great cast, a serious subject matter and a director on top for, you can't help thinking the end result will be a classic, but for every "Network" (1976) there's a "Burn Hollywood Burn" (1997)... Not that traffic is in any respect as bad as that, but thinking about what it should have been only stirs the disappointment. The problem isn't entirely Soderbergh's fault, perhaps the only thing he can be blamed for is making the whole thing look so dammed lovely, what with the colour filters and the fitting use of hand-held camera the can't fail to dazzle the eye, but the script is so weak, didn't anyone have the guts to tell writer Stephen Gahgan (sp?) that his script was heavy handed and badly written. The plodding nature of the structure, detailed in an Altmanesque multiple story line narrative; because the film jumps from one plot line to another so quickly we hardly know where we are before we're somewhere else, this pretty much destroys any chance of us forming a bond with these characters, so when it comes to the end of the film, what do we care who lives and who dies? Nothing.The film is supposed to be a revealing look at the issue of drug Trafficking and how affects nations, but the writer sandwiches in so many of these issues it all becomes too much, and to add insult to injury the only interesting plots involve Benicio Del Toro's character and the characters portrayed by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle, and they're hardly on screen for long enough. This brings me to another big hole in the film, the acting. To be fair, the three I have pointed out a very good, as is Miguel Ferra (sp), but like I pointed out they're just under used. The main plot lines are based around Michael Douglas's drugs Czar and Catherine Zeta Jones' society wife, concerned with getting her husband off a serious prison charge. The Douglas plot is laughable, the young girl who played his daughter won an MTV award or something and god knows why, she displays some of the worst acting of a youngster since the Olson twins, it's even worse that all the teenagers in the film speak in a "Dawson's Creek" style of all over pretentious thought and the kind of babble you would expect of a psychologist (if drugs make teenagers so profound they should legally distribute it to every school in inner-city areas), this isn't something Soderbergh can be blamed for, having already proved his talent for directing young actors in `King of the Hill' (1993). Once again the writer toys with the issues with no regard for reality at all, Douglas's daughter is soon taking to prostitution, all because daddy puts her in a support group. I think I've used up way too much room so I'll try to finish up, the biggest holes in the film of all are the happy endings that fall upon all the characters, "oh joy, look Catherine Zeta Jones' drug peddling husband has gone free', isn't he supposed to be the bad guy? A film that's worth a look, if you're curious about the hype, but avoid at all costs if you like you're films to make sense. Hopefully Steven Soderbergh will get back to what he does best, and fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After-school Special + Miami Vice + sophomore term paper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at a loss to explain why this film has scored such high praise. My only speculation is that the politics of the film cut it slack. The direction, of course, it terrific and Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Benicio Del Toro are worth watching in anything, so this movie isn't a total loss... but the script is just god-awful. Screenwriter Gaghan comes from a TV background, and that's exactly how this film plays -- like good-looking but still second-rate TV.The sequences with Michael Douglas and his daughter are straight out of the After-school Special book - predictable and badly emotionally manipulative. There's nothing interesting about this story. The Benicio Del Toro and Catherine Zeta-Jones arcs are straight out of the most boring Miami Vice episodes - mostly hollow, slow and dull-witted, with paper-thin characters doing predictable things. The Benicio arc would probably make a decent one-hour episode of a TV show by itself, but that's as good as it gets in this script. The Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman characters might be a joy to watch if only they had been given interesting things to say and do... instead we're treated to stock situations, TV cliches and unbelievably lame dialogue.And then there's the proselytizing. I'm not against this per se, and I'm certainly thrilled that these issues are being brought up in mainstream entertainment, but what groaners. You can see these speeches coming a mile away, and pretty soon it becomes clear that the characters and situations exist merely to give the screenwriter an opportunity to make a speech.I wish this movie the best and in fact I'm relieved that it's received the praise it has. Hopefully, it'll have a genuine impact. But I don't think it's fair to call this a great film or great entertainment - great direction, great actors, sure, but too bad about the weak and uninspired script. The point of it is fine, but do we really need to sit through all this half-assed melodrama just to get the point? Soderbergh should've made a documentary and Gaghan should've written a letter to the editor.If you already think the drug war is a bad thing, and you're not a gigantic fan of the director or actors, then I don't think there's any reason why you should spend two hours of your life watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Big Stars Equal Big Hype"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is one of the most overrated films ever made, and certainly the most overrated film of 2000. The film starts off slow and never gets going. The director chose a unique way to capture the action, however it is little more than "unique" and becomes quite tiresome after the first 30 minutes. "Traffic" parades out a cast of big name stars, many of whose roles would be called little more than a cameo. The acting, with the exception of Don Cheadle, is unimaginative and bland. Even the usual scene-stealing Catherine Zeta-Jones seems flat in her role. Michael Douglas offers nothing to the film and was a poor choice to play the role of the Drug Czar. It is clearly evident why Harrison Ford (who declined) was offered the role over Douglas. Benico Del Torro is the biggest disappointment of the entire film. Del Torro won Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film and The Academy couldn't have been more off, did this guy really out acted Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator? "Traffic" jumps around from scene to scene and doesn't seem to follow any specific order. The story-line itself is very good, but it is delivered in an unflattering manner. It is a perfect example of a film that simply tries too hard. It becomes evident from the first few minutes that this movie was made just to compete for an Oscar. It has all of the basic elements that would make it a "powerful epic", but their inclusion hurts more than it helps. The drugs within the family aspect is explored in a way that is ridiculous and downright insulting to the viewer. It makes modern parents appear inept and provides a realistic but still common place look at the teenage drug culture that offers nothing new. The director tries to make it seem that he is the first to tackle the drug issue on screen. The simple fact of the matter is that there have been many more films that have done it before and have done it much better than "Traffic". "Traffic" is a boring, poor acted, less entertaining version of "Clear and Present Danger". No wonder Mr. Ford stayed away, he did it right the first time. 1.5 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a serious examination of the drug trade, I thought TRAFFIC was laughably simplistic, but as a Douglas Sirk-like lampoon of Hollywood's typical approaches to complex social issues, TRAFFIC was very interesting. Director Steven Soderbergh uses and subverts three distinct cinematic approaches to his three story lines -- the sepia-toned documentary (with the excellent Benicio del Toro); the self-congratulatory made-for-TV Movie of the Week soaper (the drug czar and his daughter story line), blue-tinted to look like the picture from an old black-and-white portable television; and the glossy, high-budget action flick (the Catherine Zeta-Jones bit), cynical and empty, but filled with explosions, blood and bullets. Maybe others who have also been well acquainted with drug users and their widely different motivations and troubles think more of the movie's insights than I do. Personally, I suspect in twenty years the message in TRAFFIC will seem as dated as those earnest Stanley Kramer movies from the late 50s/early 60s. But we may still enjoy the artistry of a director who serves up his kitsch with style and energy. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

She truly is a great actress. Benicio Del Toro and Michael Douglas prove once again that they are two of the few actors that truly can say they have talent. Phenominal performances by both. And Erica Christensen does a tremendous job in her first really notable film. Though the story is somewhat old, it has never really been told from this point of view and with this awe, it hasn't been told better than this. It deserved every oscar it got. Go see this film.

Steven Soderbergh did an absolutely great job with this movie, as did the entire cast.

		<shortDescription>Style impedes substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I just don't understand what the Academy is thinking. The two key areas that detracted from this film were direction and editing. So, of course, two of four Oscars this film won were for Best Director and Best Editing.Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors around. He is also one of the most self indulgent. This is another example of style overwhelming substance. After playing it straight with `Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh picks up where he left off with `The Limey' and attempts to break whatever record exists for throwing the most stylized techniques into a single film. Admittedly, many of the images are brilliantly filmed with great impact. However, the excessive technique begins to get in the way of the story and makes a complex plot even harder to follow (and stomach).The story is a fascinating look at the drug trade from the perspective of various players in the game. Soderbergh feels compelled to color code the simultaneous vignettes with an assortment of hues by varying the filters to produce blue for one, sepia for another, etc. This is not only disturbing, but a bit insulting to viewers who really shouldn't need the color code to follow the story (except maybe for the disjointed editing). The editing is choppy and the constant use of hand held cameras while giving certain scenes a dynamic `in your face' quality, often becomes distracting and annoying.If there is one area that is uniformly excellent, it is the acting. The entire ensemble does an outstanding job, top to bottom. Benicio Del Toro is tremendous and deserved every ounce of the Best Supporting statue he received. Don Cheadle gives a career performance as well. Erika Christensen does a bang up job as the drug czar's addicted daughter. Michael Douglas is intense and unravels marvelously as his world comes crashing down around him. The acting is a solid ten everywhere you look.As well received as this film was, I believe it could have been much better if Soderbergh restrained himself a bit. Of course part of being Steven Soderbergh is to be obsessed with showing everyone just how brilliant a director can be, regardless of how it might affect the film. (How producer Danny DeVito got Soderbergh to stay out of the way in `Erin Brockovich' is amazing to me.)I rated this film a 7/10. Most people either loved it or hated it (far more loved it). I did a little of each. If the runaway director had been toned down just a tad, it could have been a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWay superior and far less pretentious (not to mention obvious)than his previous feature Erin Brockovich,Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is a marvellous ,sensitively compiled expose of America and Mexico's depressingly futile war against drug infiltration in society.It intelligently and inspiringly interweaves different stories involving different characters,and how each of their lives are being destroyed by the drug trade.America develops a tendency to spearhead initiations to stamp out the problem,but failing to do so,while Mexico is far less liberal and executes pushers and users of the drugs (they're hardly Japan,but ,you know).Michael Douglas turns in a heavily involving performance as the failing-to-deliver head of the anti drugs devision,but superior to this (and actually the best star of them all) is relative newcomer Benicio Del Toro ,turning in an observant,realistic performance as the honour-bound Mexican officer,embroiled in so much corruption around him he has no hope of doing his job without bending the law in at least some way (torturing informants,taking the drugs he's trying to stamp out in an attempt to make a believable ingratiation as an undercover officer,et al).To give all the actors who are turning in splendid performances an easier ride,the film is shot in a swooping,soft focus style ,with a choir esquire soundtrack playing over it,which reduces all the noise and commotion surrounding it and we can see with our own eyes and mind ,rather than from the characters themselves,the message the film is trying to convey.Indeed , at the end,anyone familiar with the recent NSPCC commercials will recognise the music,which works beautifully here. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so 'triffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaption from a television drama lays the danger of passing on inherent weaknesses to the big screen. The movie makes odd decisions which actually add new ones. Some of the most gripping scenes in the tv version such as the courtroom chase and shoot out on a bus followed by a desperate dash to warn a colleague of a bomb are surely bread and butter to American directors but here they are curiously altered or botched to the point of being perfunctory. It's baffling as a talky piece needs all the help it can get. Changing the poor farmer to a corrupt cop also loses the resonance of empathy, especially over the loss of the farmer's wife to gangsters. His revenge was not the almost indifferent one by proxy depicted in the film version, the overall effect rendering the proceedings somewhat anodyne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can appreciate REAL movies like this one. It had good acting, good symbolism and cinematography, and a good message. But I can't help but believe that this film was meant for the big screen (and possibly for DVD). I rented it on VHS..yes I'm a traditional one...and I had some trouble following it. I did pay attention and I listened as closely as possible (but still had trouble hearing the movie), and determined that I needed to see this movie on the big screen.And yes, I thought this 2 hour and 27 minute piece of work was an INCREDIBLY AVERAGE MOVIE. I don't know what Hollywood or critics see in Steven Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich was another average to below average movie. It was too long and really didn't drive its message home. I've seen plenty of movies whose sole purpose was to drive a message home. I though Traffic did a good job of that but as an entire movie bringing all of its elements together, it really didn't cut it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic:Pros: Not a typical Hollywood movie. An attempt to analyze a problem many people have so many misconceptions about. Well directed and edited.Cons: Another problem movie with a political message we've heard before. Cliched material. The plot is original yet predictable. The characters are not really convincing, they are cartoonish and stereotypical, their motivation is questionable. Their actions are often irrational and hard to believe. Good actors who show up for their paychecks and give us lifeless and uninspired performance. Annoying use of color filters and handheld cameras that's supposed to give this movie documentary feel but instead gives you nausea.Summary: don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. It's just waaay overrated. I was very surprised when I found out that Traffic received 4 academy awards that should've gone to "Requiem for a Dream". Now, that's a movie that you won't forget 15 minutes after the credits. Rent "Requiem" and compare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is good but very complex. So complex, it is very difficult to tell how parts of the film fit, especially in the beginning. Everything does come together and does make sense later. This one shows the complexity and the difficulty of the drug war and it also brings a personal touch. The tragedy of nearly losing (or losing) a daughter/son to the drug war. I also have to admit, this is one of the few films that shows how the system can turn an innocent spouse into a vicious criminal.This one is a great film about the reality of the drug war and its affects. It also shows the flaws of the system in both prosecution and the criminals it can create.Over all, definitely worth your while (8 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you about Steven Sodenberg.What does Stanley Kubrick use for effective images? See the Shining to find out. What does Steven Speilberg use for effective images? See Jurassic Park to find out. What does Tim Burton use for effective images? See Batman to find out. Now.....what does Steven Sodenberg use for effective images? You have GOT to see Traffic. Traffic's director Steven Sodenberg uses hand-held camera + change of hue. Many of you will be asking just what this "change of hue" is....well...for example....Traffic has three stories. One is about a desperate Mexican cop played by Benicio Del Toro. In this story, the screen or "hue" is yellow-ish. In the second story, a powerful man in a war against drugs. This man is portrayed by Micheal Douglas. The screen or "hue" is blue-ish. In the third story, Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a woman who freaks out after her husband is arrested for drug trafficing. The screen or "hue" is normal. The colors of the screens make us identify the stories as the movie goes along. Steven Sodenberg puts fantastic performances, different screens and a terrific screenplay. Mixing this, Sodenberg "Intensifies" Traffic, making this a powerful movie.There aren't just these stories, but sub-stories too. Like two cops keeping Edwardo Reese from trouble and at the same time keeping an eye on Zeta-Jones. Or Douglas' daughter who gets in one heck of trouble with drugs. All this is captured by brilliant Steven Sodenberg, leaving him an Academy award for Best Director.Steven Sodenberg captures the characters, from their expressions to their speeches. Could you beleive that there is absolutely NO BAD ACTING? Traffic's acting makes Cruel Intentions' acting look like a cast full of wannabe two year olds. No other director could capture what this man has done to turn Traffic into a powerhouse.In short, Steven Sodeneberg turned Traffic into an intense drama, while still unforgetting the message that drugs are SERIOUSLY bad. Even though a lot of movies tried to deliver this message, Traffic gives it with more clarity. It's a whole war of drugs in the world, and Traffic was the one to complete it.Bravo Traffic!10/10</fullReview>

The plot then hinging on the wife getting as vicious as her husband (along with being pregnant) just went too far for me. Benecio played his role very well and deserved his Oscar. Oh well, I must be the only person in North America that is ho-humming this effort. A 7 out of 10 for Benecio, Michael and whoever played his wife. Mighty fine acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic Accident. (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am truly amazed at the hype this movie received and am even MORE amazed that it won Oscars. This movie was 'OK' at best, and that's being generous.Other than the rare-occuring entertaining moment, this movie was slow, boring, hollow and little more than a documentary. I don't think there was much of a plot other than just watching what happens to drug dealers, drug users, and family members of both. The police officers of Mexico and the US were the only enjoyable characters to me.I don't understand how some critics/movie goers are "moved" or "touched" etc. by this. Are we supposed to be surprised that drug dealers can be brutally killed and double-crossed in their business? Are we supposed to feel badly for the rich, spoiled kid who ends up being an addict with her other spoiled rich kid friends? Should we be shocked that when the Mexican police ends up playing around with drug lords that one ends up being killed? I just don't see much of any shock factor or anything that I'm supposed to feel sorry for. I did feel somewhat badly for the father of the addict. He was the only one that wasn't playing with fire before he got burned.I found it VERY difficult to believe Catherine Zeta Jones's character. She is devastated that her husband is arrested for being a drug-lord, and has had no idea that he's been doing all of this for so many years as he has somehow hid all this from her. Then, some days later, she is orchestrating a murder of the Government's prime witness, as she is trying to run the cocaine business while her husband is in jail. Was I the only one that found this difficult to believe?After seeing the Academy Award nominations, all I can conclude is that the Academy must be on drugs.</fullReview>

I liked Del Toro, Mike Douglas, Ferrer, Cheadle, etc etc all fine. Even Orrin Hatch delivered his lines alright!(though he later disavowed this due to it's 'violence'-duhhhhhh, a DEA flick has violence Orrin? NAHHHHH!). Del Toro did a nice job, though nothing that Bronson in his better days couldn't have pulled off(in English, of course...)...I liked the revolving door plotlines, places where various characters pass each other by on the streets-Zeta Jones and Del Toro, for example, etc, I liked how you get to see Del Toro sitting right beside Douglas, etc. Things like that were fine.And the odd changes in color, camera work and etc was very much outta 'Three Kings', arty, somewhat distracting but giving the flick a sense of itself that others don't have. I liked that.I didn't buy for a second that the Drug Czar(say William Bennett) would go running through downtown Cinci looking for his kid alone, without bringing a phalanx of ATF types with him. C'mon guys, SOME believablity eh? (And was it me, or did you have a hard time telling Erika Christianson from Leelee Sobieski and Julia Stiles? Are they hiring all lookalikes now? Paging Reese, Alicia S and Britney...).I also had a little trouble sorting out some of the twists of the Drug lord vs Drug lord plotting, you would think that the sniper would be after Ruiz(Ferrer) not Freddie Flowers. Only so many turncoats can fit into a plot at once guys.And yeah the bogus Waiter bit/along with 'let's walk back to the hotel' was pretty KooKoo too. But those holes aside, I did like the rest of the flick. It makes some good points about treatment vs. prevention, and I thought it treated the Mexicans at least a little better than yer average Vice episode did the Cubans.This was deserving of Oscars seems to me despite its few flaws.***1/2 outta ****.</fullReview>

The new drug czar's daughter hooked on drugs, prostituting herself, stealing from the family?????? C'mon, how can anyone take this movie seriously?? I mean, how obvious; a bunch of rich kids freebasing really drives home the message huh?? About as subtle as a sledgehammer. Okay, the performances are great and Soderbergh direction and camerawork keep things interesting, but for all of the praise this movie rec'd, I would think that more people would've taken the creators to task for what I feel is a pretty ham-fisted delivery of the plot and story. Even the So Cal family involved in the drug trade is a little much. The real interesting part of the picture is the Mexican cartel story. This could have been the whole movie if handled right; and could have really illustrated the futility of the drug war that they intended. Instead what we get is some pretty obvious, less-than-believable storylines that come off as fairly dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow the efforts to control drug trafficking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic establishes that illegal drug trade is a problem affecting everyone. Traffic explores a set of diverse characters that fight against or for drugs, supply or consume them.When judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is appointed by the U.S. president as the new anti drug czar, his objectives must include joining forces with Mexican authorities to focus on the drug traffic flowing between Tijuana and San Diego, California. However, in spite of sharing a common enemy, each country's political and governmental differences stress the futility of their efforts to unite in battle against an evil industry that respects no boundaries. Working under Mexico's most feared crime fighters, policemen Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) are exposed to and tempted by power and money: the fruits of corruption most enticing to this underprivileged couple. On the other side of the border, DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) savor the idea of fabricating the downfall of drug lord Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), whose wealth has grown unquestioned by wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and by La Jolla's accepting society. As he prepares to make public through a press conference his commitment to win the war against drugs, Wakefield faces his own private defeat at home, where his wife Barbara's (Amy Irving) tolerance of experimental drug use has overlooked their daughter Caroline's (Erika Christensen) matured addiction.Traffic follows parallel stories involving very dissimilar characters, while demonstrating how drugs affect every one of them on some level. However, Traffic does not assume a specific position with regards to the production, distribution and consumption of drugs, and therefore, does not offer general moral statements. This is best exemplified in the character of Wakefield, who intends to govern with a zero-tolerance philosophy, yet whose wife and daughter practice a tolerance of experimental drug use. While Traffic clearly presents the devastating consequences of the daughter's drug addiction, the film also resists offering a clear condemnation of any character for her downfall. Rather than prove the premise that everyone is responsible for the negative consequences of drugs, the film's undefined intellectual or moral position seems to be more representative of an overall lack of creativity, as it does not solidly nor clearly develop its own theories. However, in spite of applying a general strategy of narrating its scenes with detached objectivity, Traffic does focus closely on the tragic quality of corruption and corruptibility, and on the destructive power of ambition; it does so successfully by establishing with realism the fundamental problem of fighting against invisible and untouchable drug warlords who have larger budgets and better arms with which to secure their empires. As its conclusion, Traffic offers a comment that speaks of the need to find moral support within the family unit before gathering the strength to confront the enemy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is ironic that I thought the two best films of 2000 were about drug use, Traffic and Requiem For A Dream. Could it be the next thing for drama? If we get more movies like Traffic, I hope it is. Traffic is beyond brilliance, there's no word to describe how great this movie is. Traffic is about the war on drugs, which I am totally against. This movie shares all of my view points. What I like most is the way it doesn't preach, as Roger Ebert also said. It shows the effects of the war, but doesn't preach. Traffic is also one of the most well acted movies you'll ever see. Zeta-Jones, Del Toro, and Christensen are all brilliant. Michael Douglas and Don Cheadle are superb. The rest of the cast is marvelous as well. I was reminded of the Godfather movies watching this one. It acts like it was Godfather part IV. But this is better than the Godfather movies. So if you liked the Godfather movies, and who doesn't, go see Traffic and thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was bothering me all through the first time I sat down to watch "Traffic". "This movie," I told myself, "reminds me of some other movie. But which one?"I could not believe it when I came to the conclusion of which movie "Traffic" reminded me of. Then I thought and thought about it and managed to convince myself that the comparison made sense. You won't believe it either, and you'll probably loose what little respect you all have for me when I say what it is. So let me get it out of the way right now."Rock-A-Doodle"."Traffic" reminded me of "Rock-A-Doodle".Now, now, let's think about this. Both movies have at least eight different plots going on at once. Any *one* of those plots would be a good movie on it's own, but rammed together they don't make much sense. "Rock", as you may recall, had the Parody of Elvis' Movies plot, the Farm Getting Flooded plot, the Lost Animals Trying to Find Their Friend plot, the Disenchanted Rock Star who is Just Getting Popular and Can't Deal plot, the Evil Sorcerer who Wants it to Rain Forever plot, and so on and so on."Traffic" has the Disillusioned Policeman in Mexico plot, the Drug Council Leader who Has Just Found Out That His Daughter is a Crackhead plot, the Crackhead Daughter who Runs Away From Home plot, the Successful Woman who Has Just Found Out That Her Husband Smuggles Drugs plot, the Scary Assassin Guy plot, the Guys in the Van plot, and more and more. Here's the thing, "Traffic" actually makes sense when all these plots collide with each other.That is to say, it makes sense when you see it the second time. And after taking extensive notes.Now that I mention it, maybe the different plots in "Rock-A-Doodle" connect in a way that makes sense, but I don't know if I'm up to sitting through that one again.Anyhow, "Traffic" is good; don't miss it. I don't think you'll look at goofy looking toy characters in the same light again.</fullReview>

When I started to watch it I thought that I'll see something that I had never seen before, but unfortunatelly all those problems which had been described in Traffic, the directing and editing I saw at least in 20 other movies. And Traffic doesn't innovator in this field.Next thing. As I said, the only one Oscar which didn't evoke in me any doubts was for Benicio Del Toro's act. But that's all. All other actors were such faded and inexpressive that I was really surprised to see very good actors like Michael Douglas, Amy Irving, Dennis Quaid and Steven Bauer acting so lifelessly. In Erika Christensen and Catherine Zeta-Jones case another story. They never had been good actresses and acted as usual. But Christensen was much better than Jones.But of course, everything that I said above doesn't mean that the movie is bad. It has it's positive sides, it doesn't look boring like many other movies about this topic, it's the best movie of Steven Soderberg (who I actually don't like real much) and all three plot lines crossed with each other much better and more real and effective than in Magnolia for example.As I said, it's not a bad movie, but don't think that you'll see something special there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good as "Erin Brockovich"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh won the Oscar for Best director for "Traffic" instead of "Erin Brockovich." That should have been reversed. His direction of Traffic is lifeless. It is amazing how much "Traffic" seems bored with itself. The performances in Traffic run the range from excellent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to bad (Benicio Del Toro). I wonder why Soderbergh told Del Toro to say his lines so slowly. No human speaks as slowly as Del Toro does in this movie. His performance has to be one of the worst ever to win as Oscar. I don't understand how both critics and audiences saw his performance to be good. The scene in the pool is absolutely the........ worst........... in..............the ........moo.......vie. The best part of "Traffic" is Catherine Zeta-Jones' story line. That part contains the best acting, writing and direction. Michael Douglas also gives one of his finest performances in this movie, though that story line is incredibly boring except for Douglas. Rent "Requiem for a Dream" if you want to know how someone can be demeaned by addiction to drugs. "Traffic doesn't go far enough".  "Traffic" was a wildly uneven movie, clearly not one of the best of 2000. "Erin Brockovich" had uniformly good acting and the direction was always lively and innovative. "Erin" was the better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I consider Traffic to be one of the best films of 2000.If it weren't for Crouching Tiger and Almost Famous.Traffic would get my vote as best film of 2000 and since the movie was still in theaters this year,I would also have to consider it one of the best of 2001.The acting in this movie is plainly phenomenal.I can't see why Micheal Douglas didn't get nominated for his role.Erika Christensen who plays his daughter in the movie gives an outstanding performance.I love that scene when she first tries crack and a tear rolls down her right cheek.I believe she has great talent and does a superb job in this movie.Benicio Del Toro also does an outstanding performance playing a Mexican cop. As for the technical side,the camera work was great.I especially love the camera work during that particular scene when they kill Frankie Flowers and Don Cheadle's partner gets killed from the car bomb.I love the use of color in the film.As we see the scenes in Mexico in a orange/yellow type of color and the scenes in Ohio as a blue/grayish color similar to Payback.As for the scenes in San Diego those are done in normal color. Overall I enjoyed this movie.I can't believe some of the negative comments I read,but everyone has their own opinion.Except for about two scenes that seem to drag a little.This movie is down right phenomenal.I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big complaint I seem to be reading about this movie was about the plot. People didn't like the 3 seperate stories, or they didn't like how it just kinda ended without any bang or anything like that. I thought those two things were two of the best things about the movie. It is a movie about the war on drugs, drug abuse, etc. The point it was trying to make was that it just keeps on going. No matter how hard the government trys to put an end to drug use, it is still going to be a problem. Thus, there didn't need to be an ending to the movie, the stories just keep on going. The same things are gonna happen the next day, and the day after that, etc. It will not end with a big bang. As for the three seperate stories, I thought they showed well that it affects everybody. They had stories about rich kids in cincinatti, poor cops in mexico, drug czars, politicians, dea's. All these stories happen right now. None are connected. They don't need to be connected, cause in real life they don't. Everybody can put themselves in one of those positions in the movie, yet they would never know about the other stories. That is what made it so great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult subject well treated - this film does not provide answers, but covers a number of aspects of the drug trade without slipping into cliche (too often). There are drug busts, trades, deals, government policies, families, police - all angles are covered.That could have been risky, but the swift pacing and quick but deep enough characterisations means it all pays off nicely. The strong cast are well served by an excellent script - aside from Don Cheadle's stereotypical obsessed cop highlights are Benicio Del Toro in an Oscar-winning role and Michael Douglas' politician on the edge.Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting technique, minimal content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is more interesting for its technique than for its content. You have to have been hiding under a rock for the past three decades for this movie to inform you. But, if you are uninformed on the topic of drugs in this country, then this movie could be educational. I would have liked to have had more information on drug use in Mexico, and more specifics on what happens at the lower end of the drug hierarchy in Mexico. The movie interweaves three separate stories in a way to keep your interest and attention. I personally did not care for the use of colored filters to distinguish the scenes in Mexico - what was the point? I did like the hand-held camera work and documentary feel.Some plot elements stretched the imagination. Such as the U.S. Drug Czar cruising the streets by himself looking for his drug-addled daughter. And we are supposed to believe that putting lights on kids ballfields in Mexico is going to be a big part of the solution? But maybe there are only small successes in this area and every one should be pursued."Traffic" does not shy away from the complexity of the material and it leaves it up to the audience to form their own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the War on drugs a Civil or Vietnam War?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This provocative film well deserved its many Academy Award nominations and was by far the best of 2000 in the categories of Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Editing, and Director. This movie deserves a big-screen projection or at least a widescreen version; unfortunately, my video store had the VHS only in pan-and-scan. I had looked forward to seeing it for more than six months! From my recent impressions, I strongly (Rating of 10!) recommend this as one of the very few superb films released last year. It has, however, something to offend everyone's sensibilities. It kept me watching till the final credit to see whether Director Steven Soderbergh thanked the Clinton White House for location shooting (actually the shots are at "The West Wing" mock-up stage). The U.S. Senators come across as a bit sycophantic, in my opinion. The teen characters are quite unappealing even as they are superficially "beautiful" and "cool." It offended me with what looked like authentic drug paraphenalia and smuggling material but the source material, I'm fairly sure, included all of the simulated usage for its shock value. The ending is certainly positive and I hope the situation it depicts along the Mexican-U.S. borders has been sufficiently "rubbed in the noses" of the policy makers and elected officials nearby. I'm not quite sure how I'd answer briefly what it finally says about the ongoing Federal War on Drugs -- is it a Civil War waged primarily upon "family members" (fathers "fight" daughters as in the film) or a Vietnam War with entrenched soldiers who are "grunts" versus die-hard propagandists (an African-American "foot-soldier" versus the "traitor" informant who is being witness-protected to no avail, for example)? This is a movie made to make Americans feel uneasy! Especially those who live in "safe" suburbs while urban centers house the "seamy sides" of our modern civilization. Kudos to the Director, Screenwriter, and all the cast and crew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" makes a valuable observation that the War on Drugs does not meaningfully address the problem of demand at home, focusing instead on the supply side. However, it gives no suggestion on how to reduce demand, and frankly, I don't know if it could. There are too many social problems and personal factors which induce the use of drugs -- peer pressure, rebellion, plain curiosity, you name it.Most regrettably, some problems are so very much at the core of our civilization, that they cannot be eradicated. Take Caroline, the judge's daughter, for example -- ah, let me give you a little sequel about Caroline.I don't know if the use of drugs among the upper class youth is higher than in the middle class, whether it is comparable with the level of use on the lowest economic rungs of the society, but I would not be surprised if it were indeed so. Boredom, in Baudelaire's words, is the greatest of all evils, a monstrous beast seeking to swallow a human being whole. Caroline's problem is not your garden-variety teenage brooding -- it is the very real and inescapable lack of control over her own life.So what will happen to Caroline? Regardless of her success (or lack thereof) in school, regardless of her therapy progress, she will -- she WILL -- go to an Ivy League college, most probably in the upper level, like Harvard, Yale, etc. She will not anxiously await a letter, sit by the mailbox with a pounding heart, surmise whether a small envelope means a rejection -- she will just be accepted everywhere she applies. It is that simple. After college, she will go to a top law school, her entry similarly assured. Why law school? Because. Three hundred years ago, girls from genteel families went to convent school. A hundred years ago, they went to finishing school. Today, they go to law school. It is where daughters of top government officials go. It is the way. It is a social convention. After law school, Caroline will work for a major law firm, practicing some dull yet fashionable, non-conflictual area of law. She will make partner within five years or so. And then she will become a judge. At no point in her life will her own abilities, work, and success be relevant, unless in later years she runs for an elected office. At no time will the harsh rules of academic and market competition demand that she consistently outdo herself, always reaching new levels of excellence. Everything in her life will forever be assured.For most young people, the future is a mystery, and the present is a struggle. For some, like Caroline, it is a pre-constructed road map, drawn and approved by others. And on top of all that predictability, all that boredom and convention -- the sickening, crushing realization that all you have you owe to your daddy. In sum, little Caroline will spend most of her adult life drifting between the cocktail lounge and the shrink's recliner.Does she realize all this? I think so. For her, the drugs, the prostitution are an escape towards the unknown. How do you fix something like that? It is just as improbable as eliminating poverty. The society has built-in mechanisms of degeneration, and such mechanisms are occasionally represented by seemingly innocuous phenomena -- a cushy existence and well-intentioned, well-moneyed, well-connected parents.</fullReview>

The cinematography was nice and the sepia tones very pretty, giving the film some texture. The acting was good, but all in all, the stories were the big let down here.

It just didn't work in this case (especially for the Douglas/Irving/daughter/friends story line, terrible dialogue, I couldn't stand to hear another word out of any of them).Poor dialog, weak story lines (that barely touched), too many times I shook my head with disbelief.

		<fullReview>After hearing all the glowing reviews, I found this movie not up to the reputation. The biggest disappointment was Del Toro who I now believe was a poor choice for the Oscar because I saw at least 20 other superior performances. Acting means the ability to portray a wide range of emotions. This performance was a stoic slogging through the part with little acting ability displayed. This is especially true since I have seen Del Toro interviews and he is exactly like the part he played. Being your self is not acting.Another particularly disappointing feature of this film is the story of the judge portrayed by Michael Douglas. I just don't buy the line that a person in his position and power would not get help to find his drugged-out daughter in the drug district. Not very many people will find anything in common with wealthy preppies dabbling in drugs.In summary, I found this film dull and uninteresting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is one of those movies I have enjoyed more the second time. Aside from being so well made and acted I think I like it most because doesn't portray Mexican people as evil and US as good. It was time a movie dealing with the delicate matter of drugs put everybody in the right place. There's good and bad on both sides of the border.I'm so touched by the colour contrast in the movie - the parts taking place in Mexico have a sort of mild orange, while the ones from the US are in a normal color. The beginning and the end are particularly impressive.The cast is superb, mainly Benicio del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas. Even the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones shines here, as the disappointed wife of a big drug dealer from San Diego. When her hubby is busted she feels a sort of rejection towards him, but eventually she is willing to fight tooth and nail for him, even if that means traveling to Mexico to take her husband's role as chief of the drugs traffic in San Diego.Judge Hudson is very busy fighting drugs all over the country and beyond that doesn't know he's got the enemy at home. Her daughter is hooked on heroin and when he finds out he is so appalled. Later she starts getting laid in a sloppy flat to afford her spending on the white powder and he goes crazy, chasing her through all the city.The whole film is so realistic, and the (deserved) success it has achieved surprises even more, given Hollywood's known love of harmless stuff. Fortunately movies like Traffic help keeping some faith in that something believable can be done over there now and then. To me, movies that make people look at their navels and think "We are the best, and we are perfect" are plain expendable. It's great that Traffic doesn't fill that slot.Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

Even stoic shots had a kind of shaky, Parkinson's quality.But maybe it was me. After all, I was on full brain-power to keep up with the name dropping, referencing and overall lecturance of the dialogue, that maybe after a while everything naturally melted into one big, subtitled, drug happyland available in both surround sound and occasional Espagnol.It should also be said that somebody got a little too happy-go-lucky with the color filters. And Michael Douglas looked lost. No, I mean literally. ("This isn't the 711?")Director Steven Soderbergh has a weird, schitzomorphic style. He gives life to his equipment - his little Frankensteins set off to capture the world of Catherine Zeta-Jones and....all those other actors. All that footage and all of it used. Traffic is edited to the maximum. Complete discrepancy overload - a film saturated with wavering, floating ADD looks into 3 separate stories revolving around drugs and its glamorized stereotypes. A voyeuristic look into a world of guns and stake outs, hopefully made to affect us - seduce us - with its exoticism. And we are either intrigued or invariably confused. The movie speaks for itself.

		<fullReview>TrafficFormula script. This time about the war on drugs. Guy with integrity in ineffective Washington,DC saves his family. Didn't Harrison Ford just save his daughter in spite of being President? Seen it before.If you like this particular type of movie by all means see this one.A bright teenager explains the economics of the drug trade to us. "If black people in hoards came to your white neighborhood asking every white person if they sold drugs, how many white people would be going to law school?"Many people consider lawyers to be as morally reprehensible as drug dealers. So what exactly is the point being made?Factor in Mexico. The incompetent government is in Mexico instead of the US because they don't have an effective drug enforcement agency covering their side of the border. The expressed Mexican opinion is that drug use is a personal decision so leave the users alone to kill themselves while others profit financially.The line from Traffic that people quote is, "Police work in Mexico is considered an entrepreneurial activity." So bravo for Benicio del Toro for wanting to make parks safe for kids to play baseball. It is a relief to have someone in the movie looking out for everyone.Plenty of helicopter shots of the Tijuana/San Ysidro border crossing. Two kinds of Traffic. Plenty of hot days and torture on the Mexican side. The Spanish speaking world still living out the inquisition in yet another movie.At six months pregnant Catherine Zeta Jones is prettier than ever (no joke). All she cares about is her family. Her La Jolla family is threatened since she didn't know it but Dad brings in the bucks through drug trade. Her superficial Country Club friends dump her when Dad gets busted. Even at a Country Club these aren't the people you pick for your friends. You find the one who looks fun and make her your friend. Some people just can't pick 'em. As long as she can protect her family from harm, poverty and humiliation all is well. Other reviews seem to think this constitutes a happy ending. In fairness, there is a suggestion that they might get caught so all her effort will be for naught. Witness Amy Irving's descent from prime roles. Now she plays an unhappy housewife.Michael Douglas's prep school daughter is a drug addict. Boo hoo hoo. All that talent and privilege cashed in for private adventure. What did the parents think would happen if they sent her to a school like that? No, you do it the way the Clintons did. You find the one private school that doesn't have a big drug problem and send the kid there. Oops, wrong party.Having an addict daughter makes Michael Douglas the perfect person in charge of Drug Enforcement in the USA because he works to understand the problem and has a personal investment in finding any solutions he can for any aspect of the problem. Like Daughter, like Father. He concludes that the problem is insurmountable, abnegates the social responsibility he accepted when he took the position, and instead pursues the personal solution of helping her overcome her addiction. Why couldn't he do his best in both arenas? Or did he come to accept the view of the Mexican government that drug use is a personal issue?This movie served other people well. Read what they have to say. It ticks me off. "My family is the only thing I am responsible for." I disagree. I don't even know your family. That's the point. So let's nominate Benicio del Toro for an Academy Award for portraying someone doing his little part in solving the problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This got how many Oscar nominations?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw the much vaunted film "Traffic" the other day, and I can't see why so many people I know this think is such a great film. It is overrated, cliche, and terribly incoherent.First let me start with the direction which, for some strange reason that I cannot fathom, won an Oscar. Mr. Soderbergh apparently thinks that it was a good idea to film everything in colored filters. This can either work well (see The Matrix) or look pathetic and laughable (see The Crow:City of Angels). "Traffic" is definitely in the latter category. Aside from losing the wacky color schemes, I would also like to inform all upcoming filmmakers of an amazing invention. It's called a tripod. Buy it. Use it. The jumping and constantly moving camera shots have no place in this film, except in the Mexican scenes, in which the jumping as well as the grainy air of them gives the effect of an old 16mm film. In all of the other scenes it looks displaced and downright silly. The camera angles are cliche and/or forced, and even the lighting fails to establish any sort of tangible mood. Bad, bad directing.Second: Plot. There are three separate stories all running parallel to each other throughout the entire movie. This is the bad part. They run parallel to each other through the ENTIRE MOVIE. They barely touch, let alone cross or, heaven forbid, come together into a sensible conclusion. No, the three separate stories stay segregated throughout the film. It's like watching three individual movies badly cut and edited into one. Even worse, only the Mexican plot is even vaguely interesting, the others are phony and contrived.I will say one good thing: Benicio Del Toro deserved his Oscar and then some, he was the only thing that kept me watching. It is a shame that the rest of the cast, from Douglas and Zeta-Jones to Don Cheadle and Miguel Ferrer, are underused and ignored, though they do their best with the limited material they have.All things said, I get the feeling that Steven Soderbergh cared far too much about one storyline whilst not caring enough about the others. Instead of what could have been a great film, we received a vulgar display of how Hollywood and the rest of the "artsy" crowd will praise anything that's different, even if it's garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be an overrated film with more good parts than bad, but still not deserving of the praise that has been heaped upon it. I did not see it in the theater but I eagerly awaited it on DVD. I watched the film and found that I was guessing correctly not just the plot but actual lines of the film. Very cliched material. I felt the minor characters were the best part, but Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones were too formulaic. I do not feel this movie was nearly as good as I was led to believe. I give it a six.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, overall, TRAFFIC was about as exciting as any fairly decent weekly TV show or made-for-TV movie about the "drug problem" in our country. It was NOT compelling, thought-provoking, or full of new and useful information. It left me with a feeling of hoplessness and the thought, "Well, we're screwed... nothing we can do about this but lock our doors and hide!". And adding insult to injury: Why Benicio Del Toro got the best-supporting-actor oscar over Willem Dafoe in "Shadow of the Vampire" is way, way beyond me! Go rent "Charlies Angels"!

		<fullReview>Before I saw "Traffic", I was told by many people that it was verydisturbing. But it wasn't. At all. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed thefilm a lot, I thought the acting was excellent, the directing wasfantastic, and it was creatively thought out. But it isn't disturbingat all. The most disturbing thing was that Michael Douglas's daughter(Erika Christiansen) became a prostitute in order to buy drugs, but itstops there. A movie about drug trafficking can't be disturbing (in myopinion) unless the director gives it some "Reservoir Dogs"/"Fargo"violence, and give the scenes with people doing drugs some "Fear andLoathing in Las Vegas"/"Happiness" material. Other than that, nothingcan be done to make this disturbing. The only thing I didn't like wasStephen Soderberg could've and should've picked another actor to playMichael Douglas's part. First of all, he's not a great actor ingeneral, and second, I think of many actors that would've done a betterjob, such as Martin Sheen (The West Wing), Chris Cooper (AmericanBeauty), and Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia). But despite this, go see it. You might like it, just do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic could be a documentary. Instead, Steven Sodenhberg shows us three seperate cases in which drugs are involved. The first one is about a senator (well played by Michael Douglas) and his daughter. She gets addicted to drugs after "experimenting" with friends. And later her case becomes more dramatic, when she becomes a prostitute and she's addicted to heroine. The second one is about two Mexican policemen. One of them (the excellent Benicio Del Toro) is involved in corruption, while he's supposed to stop the drug traffic in Tijuana, he works for a general that is in fact associated with drug traffic. And the last one, and the least interesting, it's about a woman (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who comes back from work one day, and sees the police in front of her house and her husband being arrested for drug possession. She has to live with her child that saw his father being arrested for a near reason. Their lawyer, played by Dennis Quaid, who is not very amazing in his role by the way, tries to replace the missing husband of that woman...but some drug stories make links between the three different stories. What was interesting was the fact that some characters from different stories could cross the same street at the same time, and never know anything about each other, like any normal pedestrian. That makes it more realistic. The most powerful story is the daughter's, and it's also the most disgusting. The most fascinating and entertaining one is the one in Mexico, and the last one is not bad, but could be better. Traffic shows the impact that drugs can have on people, and maybe it dramatizes it to the extreme, that's true, but there are really cases like these in the world. What is easy to understand is that drug traffic isn't the first cause of drug problems...it's the people who use drugs and get hooked on them. It's a moral message, and many movies that try to pass that king of message stink, but not this one. The acting is good, overall, especially form Benicio Del Toro...the directing reminds me of music videos, for the colors, the mood, the cutting actions, the always moving camera...actually, that could seem like amateurish directing, but in the case of Traffic, it just helps the film and the rythm. Very good film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great pseudo documentary style that made the point loud and long: Our efforts to stop the drug traffic are senseless so long as we don't approach the primary source: the feelings of desperation or ennui that drive people to use and abuse these drugs. Capitalism thrives in the ghetto where school drop-outs learn all about business in the drug world. And our government subsidizes many useless careers by deliberately failing to take note of the causes. It simply continues for reasons given, to subsidize the drug trade, by making the product very expensive, giving huge profit margins to thugs and killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies, like *Requiem for a Dream* or *Memento*, have this big hype, and everyone tells you it's great...and they're right. Those movies are ones I rave and gush about and will pull people off the street and tell them to see them. *Traffic*, however, was similarly purportedly great, but I don't feel like running around screaming, "See *Traffic*!"I didn't dislike it. It's a good movie. It's directed well, it's very finely acted. If you didn't really believe Catherine Zeta-Jones could act, here she is, acting. It's very complex, with multiple characters doing things and running into each other. Fun stuff. There's also this really cool upside-down helicopter shot...unforgettable and very unique. Never seen anything like it.The color schemes were interesting as well. The three storylines that play out were all shot through different filters. One is normal. One has a blue tinge to it. And the best one is the one used for any scene in Mexico, which was a washed out yellow. I can't imagine a better way to shoot it. It added so much atmosphere to those scenes. The blue was a bit problematic; it didn't seem consistent.But it just didn't do much for me. It had me for a while, and then it just dropped me off and said, "Okay, you're just going to watch the movie now." It's also quite long. But still, it didn't really pull me in and make me feel anything. It didn't scream, "I am a damn cool movie!" I appreciated the fine acting I was seeing, and the expert quick editing, but, well, the story just didn't really grab me.It's not a bad movie. It is a good movie. And I am sure some people will like it more than I. It's kind of like *Chinatown*. Good, but why is it great? I don't know. See it for yourself, and make your own decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. Traffic is a good movie--but certainly NOT what I expected. It seems to be a tad slow in spots. Also, in the Catherine Zeta-Jones storyline, it was confusing as hell to figure out who all the players were. ie,. the assassination attempt. Benecio Del Toro was as good as anybody else. I didn't see an Oscar worthy performance here. Personally, I felt that his role in "The Way of the Gun" was much better for Oscar consideration. The way that skeletons are easily pulled out the closet by reporters nowadays makes it hard to believe that the drug addicted daughter of the new chief in the "War on Drugs" would not become front page news but, strangely, it never got in the press--unlike the drinking problems that President Bush's daughters seem to be having. A witness under federal protection would not even be exposed to possible assassination the way Mel Ferrer's character was. (Ever heard of secured underground parking under the courthouse--or, tinted out car windows. How about a controlled outdoor parking lot with armed guards and bomb sniffing dogs?). Aside from these quibbles, I thought that Traffic was a good, not great, movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful argument against the war on drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a powerful movie about how different people are touched by both the drug trade and the war on drugs. What I liked about this movie was that there weren't clear cut "good guys and bad guys". I saw the story as more people on one side, and both drugs and the war on them on the other. The film shows that while drugs can be destructive in people's lives, the war against them can be just as destructive. Some of the things touched on were; how are government disregards property rights through asset forfeiture, teenagers find it harder to get regulated alcohol than illegal drugs, how it corrupts police and even governments, and turns murderers and thugs into millionaires."Traffic" may make you question if the billions of dollars we spend fighting drugs is a good investment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one, with "Almost Famous," ties for best film of the year. Steven Soderbergh's film about the drug war in Mexico and the U.S. is one of the most important and one of the best made films I've seen. The cast is comprised of one of the best ever in film: Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, and Catherine Zeta-Jones nail the emotional scenes perfectly and make this movie what it is. It amazes me how Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, and the actress who is Douglas's daughter were overlooked for major Oscars. The great writing by Stephen Gaghan, which won an Oscar, was so pure and exceptional as well as Soderbergh's directing, which was also great for "Erin Brockovich." This film truly details the world's drug problem, and if it would be shown in high schools everywhere, Soderbergh's views might change the drug world as we know it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I suffer from Attention Deficit Syndrome, but I require an interesting plot to keep my attention. I guess "Traffic" has three plots because two of them are completely boring and they figure you will hang in for the resolution of the interesting one.If you still want to see the movie, don't read any further, because what little suspence there is in this movie I am going to give away in the next few lines.Plots:1. The Mexican police (the interesting plot) -- Two Mexican cops bust a shipment of drugs in Mexico. They are stopped by Mexican army troops under a corrupt general and the shipment is "confiscated". The police end up joining with the Army to fight the drug cartel in Tijuana. This is interesting because it is a bit of a mystery as to what will happen to the Mexican police and who the general is really working for.2. Two american cops arrest a US drug dealer, persuade him to "squeal". The dealer becomes a the sole witness against CZJ's husband. They protect the "sole" witness against a drug lord by parading him around public streets with a group of cops around him, parking his car in public lots, and letting him eat any food that "room service" brings in. Geez, I wonder what will happen to him?3. Now, what was the other plot? Damn, that ADS is cutting in again. Oh yeah, it was about a drug czar whose daughter gets addicted to drugs, escapes from a rehab center and becomes a prostitute to support her habit. Her father (MD himself, I loved "Black Rain" by the way) searches for her by himself, (I am sure he could have gotten a few friends to help out). And sadly finds her and gets her back in to rehab. This might have been an interesting plot, if you had cared about his daughter in the first place. But even if you did, there was little interesting about how he found his daughter in the end.Some plotless movies I am willing to give a little leeway, if they are based on real events (like Blow), but I still require a somewhat believable story line. Otherwise I need interesting characters, realistic plotlines, and suspense. This movie is a technically well-done made-for-TV movie, and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic provides a great understanding of the drug war for those that don't read. It is entertaining and absorbing movie that lets the viewer decided for him/herself about what is wrong with the war and what should be done. However, there is a part missing from this movie that needs to be covered and brought to public attention, somehow. It the CIA's involvement in helping drug lords and permitting the use of that kind of money in thier operations. Like in the 60s, when the CIA hooked up with organized crime to whack the beard... times and faces have changed, but things remain the same. From Vietnam with Air America and opium, they became involved with drugs. The CIA even admitted to helping drug dealers in the 80s because thier money was being used to help the contras... but it is DARKER then that. With a little reading, you can find out more about our shadow government. I suggest you all read Dark Alliance by Gary Webb... among other great books. Because they won't make it a movie, anytime soon. Unless Oliver Stone feels the urge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie fails--not because it's poorly made, though it is. But rather because it tries to sell a message and then shows exactly why the message is wrong. The silly filters on the lens and truly awful camera work are deeply distracting, and unfortunate since it really didn't need it. The characters that it suggests are actually rather powerful and the actors do a fine job. Benecio Del Torro is extremely strong and deserved his oscar. Even Michael Douglas, who's usually pretty weak, does a credible job as a distraught father. But let's face it, this movie is a mess. It's all over the place, it doesn't have any real coherence, and in fact solidifies a lot of stereotypes. I think were I of Mexican nationality I'd be rather offended--they don't come off well here at all. We certainly need a movie like this tries to be, it's unfortunate that it fails. If the director had lost the "gee, I went to film school" techniques, and actually maybe used a tri pod on his camera, even that would have made it much better. Maybe edit the thing for about six months, and who knows--you might have ended up with something acceptable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Godfather came out in 1972, it did more than just open the eyes of movie-goers to the life of organized crime. The Godfather opened up to the American government. It sent a powerful message to our leaders and questioned their authority on the justice system. Now, Traffic steps forward with plans to follow in the same direction.The cast of Traffic is like that of no other. It stars Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Don Cheadle just to name a few. Separately, they are only a supporting piece in the puzzle, but collectively; they create the most astounding performances of the year.When Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is hired as the new US drug control officer, he is sent to Mexico to research the drug trafficking. Wakefield is tough on drug violations, but unaware that the real war on drugs is right below his nose. In his 16 year old daughter's room, lays a girl who is all too familiar with drug addiction.Another character the film follows is Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican state Police officer. Javier battles the constant criticism of not following orders, and has just found himself mingling with the wrong people.A third story develops from Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whose husband is facing conviction on selling narcotics. Observe Helena's transition from a middle-aged yuppie, to a panicky mother, living in fear of her family.Other key elements in the making of this film, are it's unique editing, lighting, and cinematography. These may seem like little touches that have no immediate effect on the story, but Traffic would not be the same if Soderbergh had simply filmed this like any other motion picture. Each location in the film has a specific lens color, that helps reflect the characters personality. Soderbergh cuts through scenes in a time lapse, but only to create a more intense atmosphere.The message that Traffic sends is clear. To clean the drugs in our country, we must reverse our war on drugs. We must attack the demand, instead of the supply, because their will always be suppliers. Steven Soderbergh's Oscar for best director goes untouched, for Traffic is the most powerful film of 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Traffic, I can partially understand why so many who have reviewed this film carped about the length of almost 2.5 hours. It is a bit slow in parts.But for me, it was worth it. If people choose to sit through three hours of tripe known as "Titanic", then "Traffic" should be a picnic.Because I didn't care for "Erin Brokovich" I was prepared to also dislike "Traffic." That movie was much more cliched and drawn out than "Traffic" ever was. I'm glad my assumptions were wrong.Three stories are taking place in this movie, each filmed in different colors. Del Toro, the Mexican Cop, is featured amid the hot tans, browns and rusts of his home country. Douglas, the new drug czar, is in blues and grays. Zeta-Jones gets the most color in her SUV-ridden San Diego scenery. All of the stories are compelling but Del Toro easily wins.Why? Because, to be frank, Del Toro simply IS. He does not announce "okay, viewers, I'm going to act now!" when he enters a scene. His low-key performance speaks volumes with subtle actions and expressions. He leaves it up to the audience to draw their own conclusions, which is what good acting is all about.There were a number of cliches, true. The scene with Douglas as his addict daughter speaks to the church group reeked of Lifetime movie smell. But as a whole, the movie gave us the elements of a truth (drugs in our world) we are all aware of but wish to hide from. Is that truth original? No. It's been told in numerous films. But Soderbergh tells it in a way that doesn't glamorize it or dumb it down. No screaming guitar soundtrack or witty dialogue accompanies the violence. It's laid bare without clutter.I would have much rather seen "Traffic" win more honors than "Erin Brokovich" any day. I can see Julia Roberts' cleavage and gams in many other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen quite some movies, but I hardly noticed that 90 minutes had passed until the break. Traffic is a great movie. Why? Because the main characters look very different (from their background..the one is a Mexican police man and the other one an american judge), but they actually are more or less the same in their values towards life and they also both aknowledge the weaknesses of their systems and give in to them (making it very realistic). Especially Benjamin Bratt is GREAT! If you remember him from the usual suspects he is even better and more convincing now.GJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen this year...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a fantastic fast paced story that just keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. With three great stories that never slow in there intensity . Director Steven Soderbergh tells a great set of stories in this film. The use of handheld cameras scene of the D.E.A bust and in the ensuing gun battle gives the story a frenzied pace and intensity not unlike the beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan. The Judges daughter as an addict is probably every parents nightmare, and the issue of the parents not being aware of a childs problem is obviously a common situation parents find themselves in as they become so caught up in their jobs, The Judge as the newly appointed head of the Drug task force at the White House doing exactly that and not seeing his daughters plight is a nice piece of irony within the story. The only real complaint I had was the story about the Mexican General enlisting the aid of Javier to take on the drug cartel and then his motive of being in the other cartel being revealed was a little to obvious, even though I tried to avoid reading to much about the movie and avoided looking at any spoilers it was still a little to pedictable. Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez good cop surrounded by corruption you knew he was going to stop at nothing to see that justice was done and that the General was brought to task for his crimes. Michael Douglas as Judge Wakefield the father who eventually comes through for his lost child, and realizes eventually that a job is only a job and is not as important as family. Catherine Zeta Jones as Helena Anala she showed an unexpected vicious streak after she was leaned on for money her husband owed the cartels and her son was threatened she played the vicious she wolf this was an amazing change from her normal role. Topher Grace as Seth he showed that he can play other types of role besides the good guy teenage characters like Eric Foreman in that 70's show and I look forward to seeing him in other movies. All in all a great movie that is worth seeing again and again and a video tape of this movie is definately destined for my video collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War on drugs becomes a war on ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me up until a few weeks ago to watch this film and to my surprise was very good. It was after I saw "The Limey" another Soderbergh film on the world of the underground, that I went to see this one. Micheal Douglas plays Robert Wakefield a man to whom the President has reside to STOP THE WAR ON DRUGS. Only to find that Robert's own daughter Caroline, beautifully played by Erika Christenson, has problem with Heroin. From there we go to the Mexican side of things with Policia Javier (Benicio Del Toro) and his look at things on drugs. Later a ring leader Carlos (Steven Bauer) is taken to prison to be tried and his wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is in question. Will the war on drugs be solved? The movie puts us through a lot of points. Finding the big picture is aways good but what is better is the details in between that shows us the fine points of the big picture. Robert was the man to fight the war and he had to be humble for the fact it started with his own daughter. Others to look for Albert Finney, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving and Dennis Quaid. Soderbergh has made me think again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this movie. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . because it's heart is in the right place, and it says all the right things about the United States' current "war on drugs": namely, that it is fundamentally un-winnable, and that to even wage it, we must - as Michael Douglas's character in the film states - "declare war on our own families" by treating addicts as criminals. Furthermore, the tremendous amounts of money to be made on the supply side, added to people's inevitable desire for altered states of consciousness on the demand side, ensure that there will never be an end to drug trafficking, no matter how many busts the government makes. Someone will always be ready to step into the breach and pick up the slack.The problem, as I see it, is that all of these points have been made before and Traffic does nothing to make them more lucid or compelling. I think the structure is the problem: the movie tells four different stories (well, three-and-a-half: two of the strands together form one entire story arc) spread out across four different locations: Washington D.C., San Diego, Cincinnati and Tijuana, Mexico. In theory, this should provide for epic movie making: a vast mosaic of snapshots from within and without the drug trade, as we alternately rub up against dealers and suppliers, lawmen trying to put a stop to it all, and the people whose lives are directly affected by the presence of illegal, yet available, drugs. Coming in, I was very much looking forward to the interplay of these various stories.But the truth is, these stories don't resonate off each other in any particularly useful way. Aside from the fact that they all have something to do with the drug trade, they may as well be separate movies. In fact, that's exactly how it feels: as if four separate and distinct movies have been jammed together into one giant hodge-podge, with parts cut out of each in order to make them all fit. Whenever a particular story strand is getting interesting or building some dramatic momentum, it is cut away from in order to visit one of the others. After little less than a half an hour, the technique becomes annoying and self defeating.Furthermore, because time is at such a premium for each story, any semblance of subtlety or nuance must be forsaken in order to streamline and get points across. This isn't to say that the film lapses into Oliver Stone style polemics or overstatement, but it does mean that none of the stories yields any particular surprises, nor develops along lines that are any more than the most relentlessly cookie-cutter. Story #1: Michael Douglas, playing an Ohio Supreme Court judge with a reputation for being tough on drug offenders, is appointed the nation's new drug czar, only to find out (at *EXACTLY* the same time!) that his straight-A daughter has become a major user. Oh, irony of ironies! Story #2: Catherine Zeta-Jones, after years of living the high life in San Diego, finds out that her husband, who she previously thought a legitimate businessman, is one of the country's biggest drug importers. After what seems like thirty seconds of soul searching, the genteel socialite turns ruthless she-bitch in order to secure her man's release from prison, as well as the successful continuation of his drug business. The other two stories are mirror images of each other: Benicio del Toro and Don Cheadle as, respectively, Mexican and American cops trying to put away drug pushers amidst a system that is, at best, ineffectual (in Cheadle's case) and at worst (for del Toro) actually encouraging of the lawbreakers. Cheadle and del Toro both give great performances, but we've seen this all before too: the frustration of the "one good cop" against all manner of corruption and villainy. The stories in Traffic bring nothing new to the party. (In fact, in the del Toro story, when we find out that a top ranking Mexican official is in fact involved with the drug trade, it seems as if it's supposed to be a surprise. But it was so loudly telegraphed from the very beginning that it packs absolutely no punch whatsoever.)To be honest, I found the Michael Douglas story, though melodramatic, to be the one with the most heft and heart. I think the movie would have been much better if it had cut out the other tales and just focused on this one. After all, this one story covers an awful lot of ground in and of itself: as the new drug czar, Douglas not only must meet with Washington movers and shakers, but he also elects to visit with customs officials at the border (both here and in Mexico) to try and figure out how the situation is currently being handled. Add to that the harrowing personal dilemma of his own daughter's drug dependence, and you've got a story that is already sufficiently well-rounded and existing on more than one level (and locale). Making this one story into a gripping movie would have been accomplishment enough; unfortunately, Soderbergh and everyone else involved felt they had to pack in more, and in doing so they've plainly overreached.But, as I said at the outset, I mean to be kind to this movie. I ultimately can't give it a positive rating, but I should emphasize that it's not a *painful* film to sit through in any way. And, if you're sympathetic with the viewpoint expressed, you should find something to like. Trouble is, that's a bit like preaching to the converted. And Traffic isn't good enough to win over anyone from the other side. So it fails as politics, and it's iffy as art. But it does have the best of intentions; in Hollywood today, that's got to count for something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was robbed of the oscar for Best Picture and really is the best movie since Schindler's List. It tells the story of drugs- and three stories linking together slowly as the film moves along. Benicio Del Toro does a great job as a Mexican cop, Michael Douglas as the Drug Czar of the United States, and a surprisingly good job by Michael Douglas' beau in real life Catherine-Zeta Jones. Wonderfully scripted and filmed- the movie is bound to be remembered as the nineties Godfather.Out of four stars- Four stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid but Slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first 15 minutes of Traffic (2000) I knew I was in for a long ride. The movie was good, but it was too slow. Simply not enough action for me. However, I am glad Benicio Del Toro received an Academy Award for his role as Rodriguez Y Rodriguez. He was the nuts- and-bolts of the movie portraying a character of great depth and personal strife. Conversely, the sub plot of the movie, in a role supported by Michael Douglas, was a tad too Hollywood for my likes and really did not stimulate me intellectually or emotionally. On the good side, an interesting use of filters in the movie and an unexpected solid performance by K. Zeta Jones helped legitamize this picture in my book. Possibly deserving of a 7 I am dropping my vote to a 6 because of the lack of action and a generic subplot. Too long and slow, but a fine effort nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic is a very assured masterpiece, which boasts superlative performances as well as oozing visual intelligence and dramatic complexity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watch more of Soderbergh's films, Out Of Sight, Erin Brockovitch, his narrative ability goes from strength to strength. In Out Of Sight the chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and George Cloony is sustained throughout the film. On paper the plot of Erin Brockovitch is utterly predictable, yet with one or two great performances and Soderbergh at the helm the film turns out to be good entertainment. With Traffic Soderbergh merges these two aspects, sustenance and narrative, to create a very powerful and riveting attack on drugs.Soderbergh is obviously not happy with the US situation over drugs- while he admires the USA's inertia at tackling the problem he thinks that drugs should be seen as part of health care, not as part of the problem, and Steven Gaghan's brilliant screenplay realises these different aspects.We see a domestic goddess (a pregnant and stunning Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life is turned upside down struggling to accept that her respectable husband is a cocaine importer.Michael Douglas plays a Judge Robert Wakefield who has been appointed the president's new czar- just when his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is fast becoming a drug addict.Benicio Del Toro is a weary but square Tijuana cop, Javier, on $316 a month, yet he and his partner,Manelo (Jacob Vargas), still manage to get tips on the big drug leaders - treading on a General Arturo Salazar's (Thomas Milian) toes and becoming drawn into the dangerous world of Mexican drug barons.Given the variety and focus of these stories Soderbergh could easily made a leaden film which preaches the morality of drugs to us - thank God it doesn't. The first 20 minutes opens with a take down two traffickers with their truck load of cocaine. Thrilling opening, but what really opened my eyes was the cinematography that Soderbergh employed - overexposed burnt reds and yellows with natural light which really gave your visual cortex something to work with. Couple this with some shaky camera work (don't worry, not like the Blair Witch Project) and there is a real sense watching a powerful documentary, like the scenes shown is the real footage from a drug bust. Soderbergh's even audacious enough to have them speak in a native Spanish tongue, meaning subtitles. Never have I enjoyed seeing subtitles so much (and I've seen a few).The plight of Caroline is something which I enjoyed watching because of the ambiguity of reasons for taking drugs. She is a 16 year old girl, she was a grade ?A' student, yet she still chooses to take them. When Gaghan wrote this scenario (lauded for its implausibility) he was drawing from experience, what it was like at his school. Being the same age as Caroline (16) I had some fun trying to identify her reasons. Soderbergh never actually provides a reason (which is sure to infuriate some), the nearest he comes is: `I think I'm angry about a lot of stuff. I'm just not sure what.'. He leaves it up to us to fathom why `25% of high school kids take drugs' and why `in high school drugs are easier to get than alcohol'.An example of how powerfully the film makes it point is when we see Douglas searching for his daughter, after running from her support group, and when he finally does she is drugged up in a bed after having sex with a business man for drug money. She looks at him with a beatific smile, `Hi, Daddy.' `Hi, sweetheart' he says softly, and then starts to weep. The image evoked is one of a father saying good night to his young daughter, but in this scene that innocence is shattered - and that's what makes it powerful.Soderbergh also offers us an insight as to why drugs are so available, especially amongst black people. If everyday people came to your neighbourhood with money asking, `Have you got drugs? Have you got drugs?' then pretty soon people would respond to the demand. Instead of blaming it solely on black people(which is often the case) perhaps we should look at our own influence on the problem.Steven Soderbergh obviously loves his actors. Believing in the beauty of the unforeseen he even rewrote Catherine Zeta Jones' part to accommodate her pregnancy- and it enhances the struggle of her as a mother by making her appear very vulnerable with the pregnancy. Douglas was good, although I as slightly more impressed with his role in Wonder Boys. However, while all the cast shine, the brightest star has to be Benicio Del Toro's performance as the Tijuana cop, Javier. He lights up the screen with his effortless presence, relaxed accent and he is a joy to watch, surpassing even his role in The Usual Suspects. If he doesn't receive an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor then a great injustice has been done.Accomplished as he is as a director he is also a very good cameraman. One of the advantages of being both the director of the film and the photography is that you know how to compliment them both. Partly for visual flair, partly to help us Soderbergh uses different cinematographic techniques in relation to the location; the steely, subdued blues of Douglas and Washington,the burnt yellows of Mexico and lascivious shots of Catherine Zeta Jones in San Deigo. The use of unsteady camera work serves to give an added effect of realism.The only flaw of Traffic is the slightly self-indulgent length. The penultimate 20 minutes don't quite measure up to the pace and the story goes on autopilot temporarily, promptly coming out out of it when Javier tips the DEA (for a big bust). Other than that Traffic is a very assured masterpiece, which boasts superlative performances as well as oozing visual intelligence and dramatic complexity. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good intentions but so let down by a packaged ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad film. It really isn't. Unlike the series from which it is based it misses out on where the drugs come from, who grows then and why they're grown in the first place. I imagine that this was done for space reasons.The film attempts to show the tangled web that drugs weave whilst looking at the effects that they have on individuals and it actually manages to come close to pulling it off. Almost. But then you get the all too neat and very packaged ending which simply ruined all that had gone before it.This has a vary good cast and for a (long) while it is a very, very good film. The immense pressures on people in Michael Douglas' position, the intelligence to realise that annoying some people doesn't make them angry, it gets you dead (a fantastic Benicio Del Toro). It shows the difference between the ?feel-good' rhetoric of ?drugs are the enemy of youth etc etc.' and the actualities of the people who are moving the drugs and making huge sums of money. Putting aside the vagaries of the plot demands in which the latest US drug tsar's daughter is free-basing like it's going out of fashion (which it is unlikely to) as well as the (massively out acted Catherine Zeta-Jones) hideously unbelievable episode of a drug barons wife taking over the reigns whilst he languishes in prison. It all kind of hangs together and it is a nice touch that the various strands of the story are colour coded, Mexico in an arid brown and the daughters world collapsing whilst bathed in ice-cold blue light.But then, well, then near the end it all just falls to pieces. I knew the film was in danger as soon as Michael Douglas began to falter in his talk to the press, beginning with the inevitable clichés and platitudes with which these people (i.e. politicians always talk) but ending with the clichés and platitudes that only actors ever say. The film started off with the whiff of realism in the air but only managed to finish with the stench of Hollywood obscuring all vision. What was the end supposed to mean? That good people who stick together with love and hope can conquer the evils of drugs? That bad people will get caught and pay for their crimes in the end? Steven Soderbergh said that he wished to avoid telling a story in which the audience felt like they were being educated. Well he certainly managed that.Drugs are probably the single biggest problem facing the western world at the moment and yet only one character (a friend of the daughter) actually looks at the prevailing conditions in society that limit some people to no opportunities and no chances. No hope and no future. And if I had that to look forward to, then maybe I'd be buying small bags of white powder to obliterate my brain cells as well. In fact the only character that has any inkling of how to really control the influx and threat of drugs is that of Benicio Del Toro. At least his character understands that the way to eliminate drugs is to reduce the demand. Give children hope and a future (even if this means in the film that it is that age old apple pie favourite of the states (*yawn*) baseball) and then maybe they will say ?no' themselves. And if everybody does that, then drugs cease to exist.The film has its heart in the right place but it ultimately lacked the courage to see its intentions through. It was truly hard to care about the daughter (a better story of the utter blitzkrieg that drugs can do to an individual is ?Requiem for a Dream') and the end of that strand was utterly bland and clichéd. Much better (in my opinion anyway) would have been to let people see that whilst the fight goes on, there isn't a lot of hope, and precious little chance of victory whilst the world stays as it is at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film of today's corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a fast paced, wild and extremely unconventional yet realistic as to how the world of drugs actually works. Steven Soderbergh took home a well deserved best director oscar for his work on this film which ranged from much more than simply director. What makes this film truly work is it's documentary style look at how the drug world works, none of the shots in the film look or feel like anything is set up you simply feel as though you are peering into another lifestyle. Three stories take place intertwined to help show the many different aspects of the drug world. First we have a story of a father (Michael Douglas) who has just been promoted to drug czar of the united states, and he is only soon to find out that drugs have infiltrated into the life of his top of the class daughter. Next there is the story of the tijuana cop (Benicio Del Toro) who gets paid next to nothing and has many opportunity's to be corrupt and profit from it. Finally there is the story of the unsuspecting wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) of a drug lord, she only finds out of her husbands true business when the FBI takes him away and she has to learn to cope with the new situation she is in where two FBI agents (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle) spy on her to find out what she knows. My personal favorite story would probably have to be the one with Michael Douglas because it shows a man in his fifties who is as anti drug as a man could be, come to realize that drugs are basically unstoppable. Films like this don't come around as often as they ought to because this movie is the rarest type a film that not only entertains it educates.</fullReview>

There's just one problem, the movie is boring as hell. For the first 2 hours of the movies, nothing happens except for Catherine Zeta-Jones turning into a crime b*tch. Benicio DelTuro wanders around Mexico spraying Oscar fodder all over the place while busting nameless perps who aren't interesting at all. Its like Soderbergh was trying so hard to make an Oscar-worth film that he forgot to make the movie entertaining. I saw anti-drug movies in grade-school assembly that were more interesting to watch than this. Its a perfect movie for a classroom, but if you're looking for something to see on saturday night, keep looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb technique, pity about the clichees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who still hasn't seen this movie, and worries about such things, the following contains a couple of SPOILERS marked towards the end.The overall message of Traffic is one that needs to be made - that it is fallacious to regard efforts to control drug use as a "war" being fought by "us" against "them", when the "enemy" includes our children and fellow citizens. However, the movie deliberately leaves open the question of what action should be taken. Technically, Traffic is brilliant, especially the skillful way Steven Soderbergh weaves together the different stories. The production values, camerawork and editing are all first class. As well as indicating when the action moves from one sub-plot to another, the colour washes for some portions of the movie are a visual reminder of the mind-bending effect of the drugs that the film is all about. Most of the performances are credible or better, with the possible exception of Catherine Zeta-Jones who is ill-suited to a role that is itself the most unrealistic in the movie. Michael Douglas is very effective in a straightforward part, that requires him to act his age, and be magisterial for once - quite a contrast with Grady Tripp of Wonder Boys. Oscar-winner Benicio del Toro stands out as a Mexican cop trying to do the right thing, as does Erika Christensen, as Douglas's druggy daughter.However, all those merits admitted, I found some aspects of the movie rather tired and clicheed. Unfortunately, this includes much of the way the Mexican side of the story is handled. American film-makers seemingly find it impossible to regard their non-English speaking neighbour with an objective eye, and can see only poverty, ignorance, corruption, brutality, degradation and sweaty heat - all features not unknown north of the border.(SPOILERS) Other hackneyed episodes in the movie are not one, but two, pairs of buddy-buddy cops, one of each pair being killed; the old chestnut of the vital witness under police guard, in the usual seedy hotel room, who is nevertheless found and "offed" by the mob; a lot of the US street action concerning drugs; and the black judge in the court case (a constant stereotype in American movies and TV, though most movie/TV counsellors are white). Nevertheless, this is a film to see, probably more than once, to appreciate its cinematic qualities, and simply for the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the director wanted to portray Mexico as a violent and miserableland, he didn't need sepia tones for that, Sam Peckinpah did it muchbetter in "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia". "Traffic" tellspeople in the USA what they expect to hear: there are corrupt policeofficers in Mexico, you can buy drugs in the slums from black people,every teenager is exposed to drugs, drug lords are rich, whatever.There are some unbelievable details in the plot, such as a drug lord'swife first being unaware of her husband's business and then organizinga professional assassination, or a high ranking USA government officerhaving a conscience attack and renouncing his job during theacceptance speech in a White House press conference, or the Mexicanhitman killing the other Mexican hitman. The Mexicans, both police andcriminals, seemed to have an unerring instinct to find anybody theywere looking for, no matter how they tried to hide, while the Americanofficers seemed totally lost.But, despite all that, it surprised me in being a very good film. Itweaves several different story lines, bringing them together despitethe fact that the characters in each line seldom came in contact withthe others. There is some excellent acting. Benicio del Toro certainlydeserved his Oscar, although his character seemed somewhat too saintlyto be true. I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film thoroughly and thought it was defiantly one of the best film of 2000. It was such a new and refreshing way to film and present a film. I congradulate Stephen Soderbergh for his Oscar, but I do believe Ang Lee deserved it more. I am a huge fan of Stephen Soderbergh. I really loved "Out of Sight", "The Limey", "Sex, Lies, and the Videotape", and even "Erin Brockovich", and I think this film defiantly ranks amongst his highest. I have always enjoyed his way of making films unique. I very much loved the scene that cut back and forth between George Clooney with Jennifer Lopez talking in the bar, and then about an hour later at her apartment. But, he used it a little too much in "The Limey". Lets hope he doesn't become a cliche of himself. The acting in this film is tip top. Benicio Del Toro more than deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. And the girl who played Michael Douglas's daughter was also very good, (Hilana Christinsan or something of that nature). I would also like to applaud Topher Grace on his performance, it is nice to see him in a dramatic role. I can always rely on Don Cheadle to give a wonderful performance. I am not suprised that this didn't win Best Picture, (I am suprised that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" didn't win, but that is a totally different story). This film is although a required taste . My uncle saw it and walked out because he thought it was so horrible. And I loved it, so I wouldn't totally recomend it to everyone. But it is a good film. 9/10</fullReview>

And I would consider myself a leftist, so it was not the propaganda that I had problems with. I think the most obnoxious scene was the one were little girl drug addict is telling about how she is a top student and president of many prestigious clubs, and even she does drugs. Oh my! moral: homeless, high school drop outs are not the only ones who do drugs. Such hyperbolic dribble used as an instrument to proving such an obvious point get on my nerves. Yet it may not be obvious to you. Perhaps this is the movie for you. If you want to see a real drug movie, maybe go see Trainspotting, but definitely see Requiem for a Dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickengly disgusting. In the good way! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do we watch movies? Well, let me see. We watch movies for the same reason we listen to music: for emotions. Movies, believe it or not, stimulate us. May it be in a good way or bad. So when I say &lt;i&gt;sick&lt;/i&gt;, I mean that's the feeling. The way the tint changes from place to place; sickening. The way the druggies look when they are high; sickening. This movie really brings out the way drugs affect us. And the message is a true and well-shown one: "The war against drugs will never end-It can only be lessened." I won't say anymore about this movie except these two phrases: "Casablanca with fire-power." Quote from some TV reviews. And of course, the movies cath-phrase: "No one gets away clean." And that's a fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't heard yet, Traffic is Steven Soderberg's (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich) new film, examining the drug war in the US, through the eyes of America's drug Czar (Michael Douglas), his heroin addicted daughter (Erika Christensen), two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman), the wife of a jailed drug lord (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and in Mexico, a cop (Benicio Del Toro) who is fighting against his own ethical code. What makes Traffic such a fascinating film is that it examines the drug war in such a unique way, from the users, the dealers, and the law's point of view. Soderberg's hand-held camera is effective, and his saturated colours are stunning. Del Toro gives the best performance of the film as the mumbling Mexican constable, and the rest of the cast give solid performances, particularly newcomer Erika Christensen as the heroin addicted teenager. The only flaw is Catherine Zeta-Jones' less than believable performance as the housewife-turned assasination-planner. Nonetheless, an exciting and fascinating experience. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>is this movie good? i am not really sure about this.it features several loose cennected storys in mexico and the usa about drugs. about some who sell them, about some who try to prevent this and about some who consume them. to me the film seems very realistic. the actors are good, the music is good. there are beautiful pictures in the film. so one could say it's a good one.but the point never really gets around. the film ends and nothing has really happened. if you're wanting some tension, action or twisted plot, you won't get it. but if you only want to watch some good shot storys about life and drugs you will enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a very interesting movie, but after watching it I really think that it is over rated. The best, without doubt is the acting. All the performances are excellent, from oscar winning Benicio del Toro to Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, they are all flawless, I was quite impressed by Zeta Jones. The story is very well written in terms of the slow connection of the separated stories, but the stories themselves aren't that good at all, what makes them good is their connection along the movie, rather like in "Magnolia". The direction is good, but I was really expecting bether, in my opinion the oscar wasn't deserved. The pace sometimes is to slow for the type of story being presented. A really very good movie can't be strong or capture the audiences, it as to do both. This movie only does the first and part of the second. No one was bored by "Schindler's list" despite the fact that it was three hour long! Most of the people who watched Traffic with me couldn't stand it any longer before half! Finally, two notes: The photography was brilliant, a very effective narrative tool, and the score was very intense, creating an almost supernatural environment sometimes. Watch it and judge it yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once a year ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good movies, great movie and movies that come around once a year. Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" definitely belongs into the third category. With brilliant technical means (great editing and the use of special color filters to separate the different plots) the director captures what is nothing more and nothing less than the "status quo" of the so called "drug war". The movie takes enough time to tell the story without getting boring at any single point. The four plot lines are only loosely connected but all contribute to the broad picture, a picture so realistic, it is scary. Apart, from great technical achievement and a superb story-line, what truly stands out is the phenomenal acting of the likes of Benicio del Toro and Don Cheadle, as well as a truly astounding big screen debut for "That 70's Show"'s Topher Grace. All in all, if it weren't for Dennis Quaid, whose performance simply cannot live up to the rest, which maybe is not his fault for his role is simply not developed enough beyond the greasy lawyer, this would be a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very disappointing given the positive hype provided by reviewers. Seems to me the drive to be PC overrode objectivity. Soderbergh gets kudos for doing a great job of interweaving three loosely connected stories. Unfortunately, each one of the stories is no better than a made-for-TV movie. The Drug-Czar (Michael Douglas) story was essentially a bad, preachy, made-for-TV movie. The U.S. drug dealer (Don Cheadle/Catherine Zeta-Jones) story was not quite as good as an average made-for-TV movie. OK, the Mexican drug connection story was actually at the better-than-average made-for-TV standard. The acting was nothing special, although I won't begrudge Benicio Del Toro his Oscar. Three less-than mediocre stories cannot make one great movie no matter how well the actors (only Benicio was noteworthy) act and the directors direct. I should have stayed home and watched "Cops" on RBTV. Can't give this one more than a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clockwork precision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie develops like a puzzle but with clockwork precision. We are seeing successively its pieces and try to put them together which we can do easily because they really match very well with each other: the cops (corrupt or honest), the chief of the fight against drug whose daughter is an addict herself, the highbrow addicts, the dealers, etc. One character says at a given point something like that: the war against drugs is a lost war for the governments because it is being fought almost exclusively on the side of production and distribution and not on the side of consumption. And it seems that the head of that fight in the movie finishes to understand that. And I add: to fight that war on the side of the consumption it is nor enough to act upon the individual or potential consumers. It is necessary to change the society and its present values to make life attractive for the youngsters making them to prefer living in a world without drugs than in one where the only way to evade its poor values is by creating artificial paradises to live in. That's the big problem which although not properly focused in this movie it's not totally absent from it either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films I have seen last year. What made this movieso great it is so beautifully crafted in every department. The actingis great. Camerawork is stunning and the colors are beautiful. Butthe best of the whole damn thing is the screenplay.It takes the issue of drugs and drug-trafficking and highlights everypart of it. From the lonely, rich teenage girl, to the corrupt Tijuanapolice officer to the top U.S. judge trying to grasp the size of theproblem.Some friend told me it gets to preachy and "happy" near the end. Idisagree, if there wasn't something of a message attached at thevery end it would have been a very nihilistic experience. The finalmessage of the movie was that it isn't so much the drug trade thatis the problem, the problem is people getting hooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly remarkable piece of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all Stephen Soderbergh's films this is, for me, the one that stands out as a truly great piece of cinema. And in years to come will rank him with the foremost lights in post war American cinema. There is so much to commend about the film. Unique visual styles are almost unwritten tenants of a Stephen Soderbergh picture. Also the fact that he could take on such a complicated narrative structure from what was, in it self a complex television drama set in Northern Europe and transplant it so well into a North America setting, is proof enough of his skill as a story teller. Also commendable is the fact that, for a director making a film about drugs within the Hollywood studio system, Soderbergh remains laudably remote from the subject. He simply documents the drug trades brutal ironies and harsh realities, therein exposing gross hypocrisy and the stupidity of the people charged with controlling it. This emotional detachment and neo-documentary style makes the plight of the central characters all the more harrowing. It also raises the film above the tired formulaic cinema all too common in the modern multiplex. Eclectic casting is another tool with which the director stands head and shoulders above other filmmakers. Much has been made of Benicio Del Toro's performance. And true to form he delivers in his own inimitable style. Yet this viewers attention was also drawn to the pairing of the much underrated Don Cheadle (the most talented African American actor working in Hollywood today) with gangster stalwart Luis Guzman. Their partnership was wonderfully real with moments of great humour and pathos, for my money reminiscent of Butch and Sundance. Erika Christensen &amp; Topher Grace brought a sense of true horror and frustration as adolescent drug dabbling spiralled into serious abuse. Even the limited Michael Douglas, who like Tom Cruise/Julia Roberts et.al. has become something of a parody of himself, gives a believable performance of a man who has every single one of his core values systematically destroyed by a situation he is completely unprepared for. Traffic is a wonderful film which if nothing else stands apart from the pack because it confronts an audience with stark facts and harsh realities, rather than the well worn and hackneyed clichés we've come depressingly accustomed to. If you only see one film this year make it Traffic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The directing of this movie was good but over rated.I did not like the terrible colors which distorted the scenes of Mexico.It seems to be an apology to the racists in the USA for showcasing Mexico in a somewhat serious and positive manner.This was the director's and producer's slick compromise for that.You see,Mexico and Cuba are somewhat taboo to be depicted too straight forward.I do not like the compromise although I realise it is better than nothing.This movie deserves a lot of congratulations for humanizing the Mexican people.This movie had an incredible screenplay,good script,incredible acting and good story.Overall,this effort makes Traffic one of the top 100 action /drama movies ever and must be respected for it's genre.This movie could have been rated a lot higher if 1)the silly distortion/coloring effects were not over used(I do not buy the story cut off excuse for the color schemes) 2)the silly,unrealistic assassin is killed by assassin within moments sequence is taken out 3)the drug doll technology is explored more 4)The Mexican side of the border action scenes were done more, particularly the Mexican General takedown 4)the amateurish shaky camera effects were not done. Regarding del Torro's great performance,he did an exellent job BUT his character was easy.All it called for was a Mexican stud who can reasonably act.Thus I do not think he should have gotten the best supporting actor academy award.I believe the performance of Erika Christensen as the druggie daughter was much more deserving of the Oscar nomination from this movie.I also believe the speech of Michael Douglas in the end of the movie was slightly over done and came off unrealistic and over dramatic.But I am being picky here in pointing out the movies missfires because overall,there are not too many movies out there that come as high a level as this great movie has.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a good movie about the social problem drugs. We see a number of different stories, which all display different aspects of this problem.The quality of acting, script and everything is really good, no question. Interesting effects, wellmade stories, good dialogues, flawless acting. This is all quite both realistic and entertaining. I especially like the effect that the coloring changed when we entered a different story.But for what the Oscars ? This is not a typical oscar movie, even if it is very high quality. I think the reason is that the drug problem is more present in america than in europe. I don't think it will be here as successful as in the US.Recommended if you want something earnest of really high quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"May contain spoiler"I like Steven Soderbergh. When I watch a film from him I feel I am treated with respect. I never once has the feeling that someone think I am stupid. This film is no exception. An intelligent directing to complicated script that always assume that I, as the viewer, can follow more than one story in one time. The script follows 3 stories which run simultaneously. The first one tells the story of a judge, Robert Hudson Wakefield (Michael Douglas), who is appointed as the new head of the D.I.A. while his daughter is on her way to drug hell. The second story revolve around a Mexican policeman, Benicio Del Toro, who tries to run his life through conflicting situations. The third story is about a Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has to deal with her husband arrest and find herself taking over his business. Soderbergh jumps from story to story and use different colors to establish which story we are watching(no use of titles to let us know that we are now in Mexico or in the USA). The fact that some characters from one story appear in another one, show us that everything is related and connected to everything, and also keep our attention to the screen.I find the film to be very good and though it lasted 2 1/2 hours it passed very quick. I don't think its the best Steven Soderbergh has ever done (Erin Brockovich &amp; Out of Sight were much better), but nevertheless its better than most movie which come from big studio's in Hollywood, and when his next film comes out, I'll go and see it because to my view Soderbergh is one of the most original and interesting director in today's movie world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" is basically a well done, entertaining, cliche. Michael Douglas is the not-completely-hard-liner who gets more and more understanding as he learns about the impossibility of 'winning" the war on drugs, and finally can only say "we're here to listen." His junkie but lovable daughter and her junkie and despicable schoolmates at a caricature prepschool for the rich kids of Indianapolis (Anywhereville, Midwest, USA) are just what they should be. The narcs on both sides of the border are gutsy, skillful, and love their partners more than anything except honor. And so on. Add to this an incredible coincidence as a professional killer is executed by another professional killer just as he is about to assassinate a key witness, and an even more incredible instant transformation of the ZetaJones character from selfish but innocent wife of druglord to macho, effective drug lordette.But it's fun. The cutting is fast so only effete intellectuals are able to worry about these kinds of nuances, it sends a great message about the war on drugs while honoring whatever honest people are still in the trenches trying to achieve the unachievable, Michael D continues to look more and more like his father -- it's a great ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very complex film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film showcases the disturbing realism of the underground drug world. The characters just get trapped in a vicious whirlwind, an unforgiving incessant cycle of depression and self-hurt. So many films like to portray the positive in life: people winning lawsuits, a love story, etc. However, those very films shy away from the very diverse world earth really is. There is so much suffering in the world: some by people who have no control, such as children abandoned by their parents, some by people who purposely destroy their lives, such as the drug addicts portrayed in this powerful story. This is a very complex film, intertwining 3 very different stories and characters, some of whom are drug dealers and addicts, others are law enforcement working to combat drugs. Whatever they may fight for, you'll see displayed so poignantly in this film, how they are no doubt deeply affected by what they do and the decisions they make in life. Definitely a film realistic in every sense, brilliantly filmed and directed, with superb acting, by all 3 acting leads: Benicio Del Toro (who won a well-deserved Oscar), Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michael Douglas. You'll come out of the theater with a lot to think about, not only your life but others around you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best I have seen in a long time. It deals with the topic drugs in the most realistic way I can imagine. Each person acts totally believable. Camerawork was great, too. Each location was filmed differently. Michael Douglas' scenes were filmed in a cold blue tone, Mexico and San Diego scenes in a warm yellow tone. It was interesting when the different characters crossed their ways at some points, where you could feel that they were "out of their territory". Editing - perfect. You'll see how in the end the pace slows down, you actually feel the relief they feel when they finally did the right thing. Screenplay was perfect. How those different stories were combined in a masterful way - outstanding. Not easy to follow sometimes but hey, there are enough movies where you don't need to think. I wasn't bored for one secong in these 150 minutes, this doesn't happen very often. Hey, I can't find anything bad about this movie, I think it is already one of the best movies of the decade. It is much much better than Gladiator and I can't understand why it didn't win the highly deserved Oscar for best picture.This is nothing worse than a pure 10/10</fullReview>

Traffic. The best movie this year has to offer. Such a bitter yet realistic look on drugs (all aspects), that allows the world to take off thoose cliche "rose-colored sunglasses" and see what our real problem is society's corruption. It allows you to see the big picture from the highest dealer to the lowest jubkie. Its a must for teenagers to because it opens up the subject matter. the protaryl of Caroline Wakefield by Erika Christensen was outstanding, and also props to the rest of the teenage cast, "That 70's show" star Topher Grace as Caroline's junkie boyfriend Seth and "Roswell's" Majandra Delfino as druggie friend Vanessa. Micheal Douglas is stellar as always, in the gripping role of Robert Wakefield the newly appointed US drug Czar and unaware of his daughter Caroline's addiction. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Helena Ayala whos husband Carlos (steven Bauer) is arrestes, is great, and as well as her shady lawyer plaed by Dennis Quaid. BENCIO DEL TORO definitely deserves that Oscar and all the rest of the awards he got! Well also to mention off-the-charts preformances by DOn Chedele, Luis Guzman, Amy Irving, Ben Bratt, Josh Brolin, etc..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just seen Traffic for a second time, I would assert my earlier judgment that it is a strange mixture between cinematic brilliance and naffness; overall, an enjoyable movie with an important (though not all that novel) message.Since the story lines are relatively complex and often interwoven, and visually as well as audially difficult to follow, it is a movie which almost requires multiple viewings. On my second session I was able to focus less on plot development and more on the individual scenes (*** MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***), such as the brilliant interaction between the two narcotics cops ("I lost my virginity on a beach like that" -- "lost your what?" -- "my virginity. on a beach, during my sophomore year." -- "oh yeah? did he treat you good?"). However, the multiple plot clangers also became more blatant: for example, why -- except for plot continuity reasons -- does general Salazar not order the execution of Frankie Flores? Why does Helena Ayala haggle over the assassination of the prime witness against her husband over a mobile phone, when she herself is under surveillance and we know from every other modern crime movie that under these circumstances it is highly inadvisable to use this means of communication? And why does Frankie Flores feel compelled to bring about his assured own capture or death by attempting to shoot his target at close range whilst being protected by a group of heavily armed cops? Etc., etc. All this leaves Traffic as being a watchable movie, but somewhat less than a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film won a number of awards and so I was looking forward to seeing it; my verdict is one of high dissappointment and i cannot understand why it is being acclaimed in some quarters. The over-view of the movie is about selling drugs(hence traffic) and various stories connected with that theme...which are eventually meant to come together.... From the very opening of the film...and which continues throughout....it keeps switching from one plot or sub-plot to another which is both confusing over-complicated and annoying. The way it is often filmed in strange colours and apparently with a hand held camera gives me at... least the impression of amaterism rather than realism.Do not film-makers realise how important it is for many of us who watch movies that if you confuse us at the beginning of the film you will lose us for the rest of the film??!!Most of the characters in the film are unsympathetic...maybe... that was intended but what really irks me is that major parts of the film are totally not realistic and at times laughable....the incident at the Court...and the eventual behaviour of the Judge with a drug addicted daughter...and the behaviour of the ostensibly respectable wife discovering her husband is an alleged drug lord..... OK the movie is sittable...but only just....and the actor playing the Rodriques part is excellent but apart from that I am bewildered at why this film is being so well rated and received....as the film is badly directed edited and presented with a overloaded story line which does not work and which nullifies any "statement' being made about the evils of drugs and trafficking in them. I have given this a 3 out of ten and that is generous. Please excuse my spelling mistakes....!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of my friends kept telling me how great it was -- so I finally went to see it. And it turned out to be just what I suspected. Boring, and over-directed. Soderbergh is a brilliant director, no question. But his fingerprints were all over this film. Every frame! He kept changing film stock, lighting, kept jump-cutting. It was annoying, but worse, it kept pulling me out of the story. Great directors direct unobtrusively, in my opinion. They don't pull you out of the story with fancy camera moves or jump cuts. Take away the tricks, and you're left, in this case, with a pretty dull story. And a vastly overrated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really makes you think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is just plain great. Starring such excellent actors as Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Benicio Del Toro makes this movie a must-see.What I like about Traffic the most is that it makes you think. Normally, when I see movies (can be action movies, comedys or whatever) I don't ponder the message of them, or the meaning of them after the movie. Traffic just ain't one of them.It really makes you think: How naive can America's drug politics and assumptions really be? What is America (and other big countries) doing to attempt to cut down on the drugs? What are the consequences of having a drug-addict in the family?I think the main reason that it just feels so ``real'' is because they filmed it with a shaky hand-camera.. and maybe also because they made it so that when a scene is filmed in Mexico, the whole picture is like a dusty yellow screen and when they filmed in USA it's like this cold, blue, environment. It makes you really *feel* the environment. The heat, the cold.Movies that somehow affects my real-life thoughts and makes me apply messages to The Real World are naturally 10-star movies. Way to go Soderbergh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above being said, traffic was really long.....I mean really long. 25 minutes worth of held shots and drags could have been cut to help the film.It is not one of the 50 best films ever. Maybe not top 100 either.Mr. Soderberg has a distinct signature. If you like it fine, if you don't, leave. I can't say I agree with a directing style that is noticeable. I'd know his film from across the parking lot now and I've only seen two.I prefer to let the story run the show. NOT the shots, NOT the tones, NOT the pace.We go to spend 100 to 120 minutes seeing a story, not someone's GD 'vision'.Sorry to beat you up Steven, you are really talented.The film was good, an enduring classic no.Del Toro was born for the role and deserved everything he got. In many ways the film is worth watching to see his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone asked me to summarize the story of ?Traffic`, I couldn't. That doessn't mean that I didn't understand it, but it's just impossible to retell the plot in a few words because it's so complex and the three threads are intervowen with each other, so that you can't speak of one thread without mentioning the other. That's the kind of movies I like!And then, if a movie has nineteen important actors and they are all fantastic, I don't need more! Steven Soderbergh made them all act so naturally and authentically that sometimes it seems as if he hadn't directed but accidentally filmed some scenes. I'm looking forward to seeing some other of his movies, although they are supposed to be completely different.Concerning the drug problem, I was anxious that the movie could be too moralizing and too negative towards drugs as American movies usually are, but it wasn't that bad. There is no unrealistic happy-end and no moral. And the drug problem is dealt with mainly on a high official level.In case I become a director, I'll do the cinematography, too. Peter Andrews = Steven Soderbergh did great camera work, with the shaky-cam as well as in the wide, beautiful Mexican-desert scenes. It made me want to be in Mexico, believe it or not! The world is yellow there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great example for modern film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With great expectations me and my friends went to the cinema - and we weren´t disappointed in any way! The was a great cast of main actors (a Catherine Zeta-Jones who was surprisingly good!) and a huge array of brilliant supporting actors like Albert Finney, Benjamin Bratt, Tomas Milian or the uncredited Salma Hayek! Also Steven Soderbergh´s way of narrating the story was excellent, because there were three independent episodes which were all connected to each other somehow. The film takes two and a half hour, but it´s full of dramatic and suspense and you won´t bore a second! It is also a brilliant crossover between different genres: "Traffic" is a social drama about the dreadful effects of drugs same as a thriller about the struggle of police and politics against the overpowering cartels. Also the style how this movie was made is fascinating, because every episode is filmed in an other color, what makes "Traffic" also being a piece of modern art. While the part Michael Douglas fighting for his drug addicted daughter is shot in a cold blue tone, the episode in Mexico appears like a trip... Finally, this movie is a big epic, where an intelligent story and a clear message are the most important thing. "Traffic" is the movie of the year! Definitely! (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing it last evening, I could CARE LESS about this film. It had some really phoney crap in it- and it had some OK stuff. del Toro certainly did a good job- but the director, whom I respect, got a bug up his caboose about changing the filming style depending on locale (US- normal view; TJ- yellow tine, news reel-ish; Polictical gatherings, parties, meetings [in the U.S.]- blue tint). That simply stunk and did NOT work. The scene where the DEA head's daughter is walking through the ghetto area to get her next dosage of smack- and not a black head turns or takes notice? Give me a break. The drug scenes felt like they came from the "Drug Traffic Story Film-maker's 101" manual, i.e.- just chock full of stereotyped AND racist crap. The White House and DC in general stuff was stodgy and stuffy. Throwing real political personalities in the film (much ballyhooed in the press) was wasted as they played so fleeting they seemed liked cast extras. Douglas' wife, Zeta Jones, is too marginal a talent to be effective in her role and it glaringly plays as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't belive that Stephen Soderbergh won an oscar for directing this film. The problem with this film is that it is completely flat and unengaging. There is absolutely no character development at all. I could not have cared less about the characters. As for the subject matter, that is drugs, addicts, drug lords, society's reaction to drugs, the war on drugs, the director took the extremely brave decision to say, absolutely nothing. This film offers us an insight into, nothing. The characters in the film make you feel, nothing. This film sends no message. This film is absolutely, positively, completely and utterly mediocre. As an action film, it was unexiting. As a drama, it was casual. As a character study, it lacked character. This film is pure hollywood, all flash and no substance. Stephen Soderbergh is a master of making modern hollywood masterpieces, take an extremely controversial subject and make an absolutely "safe" film out of it, that offends no-one and says nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One stand-out story line and two good ones...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with the harshest of audiences. Nobody seemed to like it. Perhaps it's because this film was marketed as a drug-related thriller in The Netherlands, which it most definitely is not. Instead it's a multistory investigation into the impact of drugs on American (and Mexican) society. And although it has its fair share of action, it's far more a character driven event.The movie is comprised of three story-lines, of which the one set in Mexico (starring justified Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro) is easily the best, both in a dramatic and cinematic sense. With almost European cinematography and a tale low on cliche and high on realism, it's far better than it's other two counterparts. I had particular difficulty with certain scenes in the storyline featuring Michael Douglas (as a judge assigned to fight drugs) and newcomer Erika Christensen as his addict daughter. To me, certain scenes felt just a tad moralistic. One could also hold against it, especially in The Netherlands, that it's not exactly saying new things.Still, this is a well crafted and especially well acted film. If you prefer dramatics above action, and are in any way interested in it's subject matter, I urge you to go see it. You just might agree with the four Oscars it recently got.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film that Sydney Lumet never made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched "Traffic" in a preview - three days after the Academy awards. Boy, was I excited! My expectations were high - and they were even exceeded! "Traffic" is an anti-drug drama, but also a political thriller. The script is brilliant! It tells 4 parallel story-lines seeming to have nothing to do with the other. Sometimes the different characters accidentally cross each others way - in a way, as you know it from "Short cuts" or "Magnolia". But in the ending everything fits together like a big puzzle! Steven Soderbergh started his career by directing the highly recommended independent movie "Sex, lies and videotape"- which I unfortunately didn´t watch until today. But I loved "Erin Brockovich" and "Out of sight"- movies that walk on the thin line between art and commerce. The last one is one my alltime favorites! Only a fool would call them star vehicles. All the actors performances - from Michael Douglas to Benicio del Toro - were outstanding. And the message of "Traffic"? Drugs are bad! I think: LEGALIZE IT! That would the best way to stop drug criminality. But decide yourself.... My opinion: a masterpiece! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>A phenomenal story of epic proportions. Ben Del Toro is superb and deserved the Oscar. All the other characters are not as effective. If you are sharp you will notice Salma Hayek and Ben Bratt. The cinematography is excellent, I especially enjoyed the helicopter landing and the "dirty" Mexican scenes. Unfortunately, sometimes the American scenes were "dirty" too. "Dirty" refers to the lower quality resolution for that rustic feel. The story comes together well, and there are no boring parts. The only stupid things are Miguel Ferrer's and Topher Grace's drug talk. They spit out drug statistics in casual conversation that looks very forced and completely out of context, as if the DEA re-edited the movie. Also, if Del Toro's character knew anything about the horrible situation of youth sports he would not have made such a stupid choice for compensation. The ending is given away in a blatant manner and it leaves a great film on a horrible note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benedicio del Toro...what an actor!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an actor is good enough to keep you guessing as to whether he's a good guy or a bad guy....that's ACTING, folks. Go back and see him in "Basquiat", the Julian Schnabel movie that preceded "Home Before Dark". He plays his Puerto Rican self in that movie, all drugged out but loyal to Basquiat, although i still don't know if that artist was noteworthy or whether he was a passing Andy Warhol fad. Those eyes and eyebrows...whoah. Too bad the Schnabel movie didn't get an Oscar, but guess we the people can't take queers, artists, and Castro all in one movie. Best stick to something safe that doesn't really castigate our stupid government for being so completely impotent where it comes to controlling the drug traffic. Just the silence when Douglas asks, "OK guys, what are we doing about treatment? It's just us in this plane. Come up with some ideas for prevention. " Silence.  Of course, it does make the point that as long as we don't cure the reason for the need, the traffic will be there....but very subtly. Wish they could have made the point, as Harper's did in a recent article, that only the drugs that don't make big business much money are illegal. The other equally dangerous drugs are as legal as they can be. I'm just waiting for Eli Lilly to come up with a legal way to get coke and heroin prescribed; then we'll have a new growth industry.I loved the "Can't tell the heroes without a lie detector and even then it's only temporary" aspect of this movie. The young woman who played the daughter did a great job of portraying ennui, innocence and the arrogance of youth. Kinda hard to look innocent as you lie on your bed of slutdom with the John just out the door, but she did. What a movie!!Take your family to see it, especially the 10 year olds. It may not be too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It failed to move me. That's the bottom line, I suppose. This comment became much more difficult to write when I read the previous comments, which were heavily positive, and extremely articulate. However, I must attempt to register why I would not recommend this film to a friend. (Please note that in explaining, I may describe the plot in more detail than you'd care to hear if you haven't seen the movie)Perhaps the film lacks credibility, and consequently the ability to shock. The storyline involving the judge's family was particularly weak. Personally, I (like most people) have little experience with crack cocaine, and so I don't fully understand its addictive qualities. I watched the judge's daughter go back, again and again, sinking lower and lower, but there was nothing to explain why. We do not watch her crave the drug, we only see her placid, sheep-like acceptance. Consequently, I could not sympathize, nor understand why she did what she did. The only clear message was this: Drugs bad. Family good.Similarly, was Elena's (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) only option to order a hit on the witness against her husband? Only weeks earlier, this woman was a pretty princess, living an adorable life, and suddenly she is prepared to initiate a murder to save a man who has been hiding everything from her. I understand her motivation is to hang on to the money, but we do not see her struggle with her conscience. By the way, who is taking care of her son while she's out negotiating with mobsters? How does the director want me to feel about her? Is she a hero for saving her family, or a despicable criminal? I wish I cared.The storyline held my interest and my emotions was that of the Mexican cops. In contrast with other major plotlines, Javier and his partner Manolo behaved like normal human beings would, and so I identified with them. They experience fear, moral dilemmas, and grief. I admired Javier for his refusal to accept the status quo, and exchange personal gain for integrity.Obviously, there's a lot missing from this little review, and that's deliberate for the sake of clarity. There were characters that I enjoyed (such as the guys watching Elena's house) and "stuff that was cool". What I'm trying to describe are the reasons this film left me so apathetic.What is this movie really about? Does it describe the futility of the war on drugs, as suggested by Michael Douglas' character? Does it describe the destructive power of drugs, as played out in the life of the judge's daughter, and the fate of most of the "bad guys"?All right, the war is futile, but drugs will hurt you. The emptiness of this movie is reflected in Michael Douglas' conference on the plane, where he pleads with the authorities "Anyone have any new ideas? Anyone?" I know how he feels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What are people seeing in this movie? I went to see it on the general principle that it was getting great reviews and that it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Best Picture in the I need to fall asleep category. I dozed off three times while watching Traffic and I never sleep in a theatre, I'm not going to waste my money. But this film was almost as bad as A Thin Red Line. It too got great reviews which is making me think that the reviewers have been spending to much time in a dark cave...or a museum. The only good parts of the movie were the scenes in which the teenagers were doing drugs...they actually managed to keep you alive and awake, they were somewhat interesting, especially when picking out errors (for example in one scene a guy is snorting what I assume is Cocaine through a dollar bill, and the bill isn't even rolled tight, a major no-no among anyone who knows anything about drugs). Del Toro did alright but other than him and the youths of the movie the acting was sub-par (I especially liked Majandra Delfino from "Roswell" and Topher Grace from "That 70's Show"). If the camera shots and angles had been any more sloppy (7 seconds people, the average persons attention span is 7 seconds Eyes Wide Shut is not a good film to copy a style from), not to mention the cameras themselves any more crappy (you can keep the camera balanced at least), the film would be worse than the average Indie flic. Overall I give the film a 2 of 10, give me a break people keep me awake don't put me to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2000.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For someone my age, it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol."Filmed in 8 different cities with 135 speaking parts, the three stories in "Traffic" unfold against a background of drug deals, drug trafficking and drug addiction. It takes a multi-angled look at the problem and it's effect on people of all walks of life. It looks at the big picture of what is being done to try and restrain the drug trade, and also shows us an intimate look at drug use within families. It illustrates how involvement with drugs has consequences for more than just those who take them, regardless of what race or class you are from. It asks us to think about what can be done about one of society's critical issues, one that affects us all.Michael Douglas plays the newly-appointed head of the US anti-drugs commission Robert Wakefield, a man shouldered with the responsibility of winning the drug war. His daughter Caroline is the third-ranked student in her class at an exclusive private high school, but is getting into drugs in a big way. Wakefield is oblivious the presence of drugs under his own roof, as he's hardly ever at home. He'll face dire consequences for his ignorance. Amy Irving is convincingly human as Wakefield's wife, Barbara. Caroline's boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace, That 70's Show) also has scenes of big impact, as he escorts Michael Douglas through the seediest of drug neighborhoods to look for his daughter, which teaches him more in five minutes than he could ever hope to learn from years on anti-drug committees.Douglas' real-life wife Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the innocent (and pregnant) housewife/socialist, Helena Ayala. She is being helped through her turmoil by her husband's business associate, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid). Her husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) has been arrested and stands accused of trafficking drugs across the US-Mexican border. His arrest is due to the work of DEA agents, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman). These two have a fun chemistry between them and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after being great in Boogie Nights.A cast this good doesn't come along too often. They are all impressive, and full of powerful and credible performances. Much of the acting acclaim this film has received has been for Benicio Del Toro, in his role of Javier Rodriguez, an honest Mexican cop whose job is to stop the illegal import of drugs across the border into the US. He deservedly won an Oscar for best supporting actor for this role. But my personal favorite performance from the film was that of Michael Douglas. His role is low-key for a lot of the time, but he delivers it with perfection. Also worth highlighting is the performance of his on-screen daughter, 18-year old Erika Christensen. She is effective at capturing both the innocence and, later, the lost innocence of her character. I was surprised to learn that this was her first film role. Also watch for small parts from the likes of Albert Finney, James Brolin, Benjamin Bratt and Salma Hayek.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also made Erin Brockovich in the same year, he deservedly won the best director Academy Award for Traffic, after being nominated for both movies. He first got his start with his debut "Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape", and is also responsible for the critically acclaimed "Out Of Sight". He is one of the most promising directors around today and I hope to see more great movies like this one from him. I'm looking forward to seeing his next film, "Ocean's Eleven", which also has a cast of numerous big stars.Traffic is innovative in terms of it's style, filmed with rough, shaky camera movements, which makes it look like a documentary. The scenes cut back and forth between the different stories, and thanks to some Oscar-winning editing, these transitions never feel forced or made at the wrong time. But the most noticeable look to the film are different color schemes which have been used for each location. This helps the viewer distinguish where we are (again the great work of Soderbergh, who also did the cinematography.) Some viewers have said this made it hard to watch, but I thought it was helpful to separate the stories and make it a visually interesting movie to watch. Music and score wise, there isn't much used, but this adds to the documentary feel.This movie is hard-hitting and honest. Once you've seen it, it may leave you with some disturbing images. It is a movie that gives you something to think about long after you've finished watching. This film is a "social commentary" that has much to show us about drugs, and it does so by simply observing what is going on, without attempting to provide any answers or preach to us. You, as the viewer, can draw your own conclusions. This is such an important movie, in my opinion a movie that needed to be made. 5 stars.</fullReview>

Soderbergh has taken various strands of society that affect or are affected by the flow of drugs onto the market place and made them all, at times harrowingly, human. Each strand, each element, is so vividly brought to life that it's impossible not to get involved with every character, and there are many, that moves across the screen. Of these, Javier (Benicio del Toro) is by far the most sympathetic, and it's a tribute to this actor's talent (never has an Oscar been better deserved) that the internal torture of the underpaid Mexican drugs officer is always crystal clear yet never overstated. He is the brightest star of a film that only loses points in its determination (mistaken, I felt) to leave no end loose, so that the tying up of the situations of the main characters comes across as mainstream Hollywood, when the feel had been refreshingly independent throughout. But that's maybe to gripe - it's a gripping film by an outrageously talented director. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the new millennium!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is most likely an extreme feeling of anger that "Traffic" did not win for Best Picture and my love for this movie that is prompting me to write this comment.First of all this is easily the best film of the new millenium. Hands down.Director Steven Soderbergh triumphs in this extraordinary film which features multiple stories that are all intricately woven together by their common element--drug trafficking. Soderbergh has a great eye for this film. The camera angles and shots are some of the best I have ever seen. The writing, directing and editing are all elements of this film that are deserving of Academy Awards.As the film progresses these stories come together to illustrate the different perspectives that the different people hold. This film offers a great contrast in points of view. We see the problem in the eyes of the newly appointed American drug czar, his addict daughter and her friends, the corrupt Mexican police, the rich drug lord and his wife, and the DEA agents pursuing them. Combined with remarkable editing and directing these stories and their characters come together to form a film that should have most definitely won the Oscar for Best Picture."Traffic" has one of the best casts that I have ever seen in a film. Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, and Luis Guzman are just some of the huge names that have contributed their talent to this film. Supporting them is Miguel Ferre, Topher Grace, Dennis Quaid, Steven Bauer, and Erika Christensen. It is very rare that this much talent works together on a single film. Each of these actors turns in dramatic performances and each plays their part as well as they could have been expected to. I truly recommend this film to any movie fan who enjoys the best that the industry has to offer in terms of plot, character development, directing, editing and cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hands-down the best movie of 2000, although a case can be made for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Either way, it beats the pants off Gladiator. The plot was deeper and more original, the characters were more varied and intriguing, and the cinematography was outstanding. Gladiator was an entertaining film that appealed to the general public, but based on the artistic merits, Traffic was by far the better film. Maybe the members of the Academy did not see the same film that I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-done movie with a powerful message -- worthy of Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to see this film today because of all the hype surrounding it, and because the Academy Awards were on tonight, as well. I had only seen one nominee "Gladiator", but "Traffic" definitely blows "Gladiator" right out of the water in my opinion. Right now it is before the awards, so I do not know the outcome, but this film deserves any award it is nominated for. Anyways, I took my dad to see this because he wanted to and he always has something to say about movies revolving around a subject like the drug problem, and "Traffic" is definitely a wake-up call to America about it. It was a very well-rounded, disturbing, and daring movie that showed how the drug situation is handled from every point of view. It was not long and drawn out like some people reviewed it as, and I also read one review that said it was just a "2 1/2 hour after-school special". It could very well be an after-school special to some because of the topic, but those are usually just revolving around high school -- this movie is much more than that. It was also beautifully-done using hand-held cameras and different color hues for different moods (harsh yellow for Mexico, a soft-yellow for California, and blue for Washington). I applaud Steven Sodebergh for being the genius at the helm to bring this movie to life. "Traffic", for me, was like last year's "Magnolia"; separate storylines unfold to bring together a very good piece of cinema (why "Magnolia" wasn't nominated for Best Picture last year is still beyond me, but that's the AMPAS' loss). Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, CZJ, Benicio del Toro, Erika Christensen, and the rest of the actors produced terrific performances; del Toro deserves the Oscar. This may be a work of fiction, but this is the harsh reality of it. And I'll definitely be checking out "Erin Brockovich" just because of the director. 10/10</fullReview>

The documentary style cinematography, the quiet dialogues and the narrative style all add to a very gripping and very extensive portrayal of the american drug-problem. We see political meetings as well as addicts, dealers and street cops. Michael Douglas has an excellent role as Drug-tzar and concerned father. Pay attention to the grainy filter used in the Mexican scenes as opposed to the very cool blue filter used in the politically charged scenes.

		<shortDescription>'The Godfather' of New Generation Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great storyline and intersecting stories which kept me interested throughout the whole film. Great performance by Benicio Del Toro as Javier and Michael Douglas as the Drug Czar for America. I think if Douglas had gotten a couple more scenes in- he would've been nominated for best supporting actor too. Ah, anyways- Del Toro changed a lot throughout the whole film- speaking spanish for a little, then english, then spanish- no, actually, Del Toro changed a lot because of the tragic occurences that happened because of drug wars and his inability to stay alive and worry about what could happen to him. Del Toro played the role as a cop well and in my opinion, deserves an oscar. Unfortunately for me, I'm posting this a day before the Oscars so I can get my point across. I promise this movie will get BEST PICTURE- why? Because not only does it have Godfather traits to it but its the most realistic film in the category and does not really have an ending- for drug wars still continue even today. This movie also shows the hardships for teenagers and drugs and what it does to families. Frankly, I think drugs should just be eliminated- but if the government makes money from it, why take away something that kills humans each day?As for Steve S- the director of this nominated film and Erin Brockovich- he did an outstanding job. The reason why was because the two films were entirely different and so was the editing and effects. You have to give this guy an award or *two* for best director. If he doesn't get it this year in 2001- trust me, he'll get it later on in his life.Great movie and there is nothing in the movie that won't get your attention. Rating out of 10- 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you kill, what could have been a fantastic movie, with ten final minutes of moralistic nonsense. That's the question that stuck in my mind after seeing this almost perfect film by Soderbergh, who is in my opinion one of the great American directors. His vision on the 'war on drugs' is worked out well, executed well by a terrific cast (Del Toro, Cheadle and Guzman stand out)and, in the end, absolutely destroyed with shamefully moralistic scenes. It seems to me a producer got a big hand in the end, which obviously had to send out a positive message. So after being entertained for a long time, you leave the cinema disappointed with such a terrible finish. And finally you don't worry about the victims of drug-abuse, but how Soderberghs career will carry on. Will this little mistake be his only one, or has he fallen for the mainstream cinema that has to have a 'good heart' instead of a real objective vision.</fullReview>

The most telling scene was the final one where ..weell, watch the movie(or the mini-series) and you'll see the same thing. The only real difference is that while "Traffic" is set between the States and Meckhico, "Traffik" is set between England and Pakistan. It was also a bit hard to concentrate on "Traffic" with all the picture theatre laughing at what was supposed to be pathos..I suppose Kiwis are just a little too jaded when it comes to the subject of drugs and scumbag dealers.</fullReview>

That he finally made it is a testament to his force of will, as well as to the bravery of his producers, his actors and technicians, and of USA Films.Since I don't want to spoil this movie by saying too much, I'd rather go Hollywood and try my best to describe it in one phrase.It's an intricate study of the drug trade between Mexico City, Tijuana, the border towns of California, and Middle America.It's a star-studded ensemble piece where we follow four sets of characters in (please, don't laugh) color-coded sequences.It's a moral study of hope amidst corruption.It's a feel-good movie for intelligent adults.More, please.</fullReview>

There is something special to this movie that should not be missed by anyone and of course it's reality. You watch action films and you say to yourself, Hmmmm? I wonder how this was done and then you look at the behind-the -scenes look. With this film there is no behind-the-scenes special effects because it's so real. It seems we walk across an action film and always ends up Fictitious Sci-Fi etc.The plot was a little complex but if you really listen to the movie it should help you understand the movie better. Each piece of event was very important a little hard to follow ,but you should be able to grasp the concept later in the movie. And to anyone who didn't like the movie I find it hard to believe. The whole plot was perfect, so original and yes deserves an award for outstanding picture. I'd be disappointed if this movie doesn't win something. ****/**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I was rather looking forward to seeing Traffic. A couple of friends had seen it and thought it was really good, and if the hype was anything to go by (not something I usually look toward though, I confess) I was in to see a really good flick. I was disappointed.The story follows a whole bunch of people - we have the Mexican cop who is wanting to battle the drug cartels, we have the judge who has just been appointed head of the Anti-Drugs Commission who has a daughter who is a user (who didn't see that one coming?), we have the society wife who is "shocked" when she discovers that her husband is a drug lord as well as sundry little stories off the main three. There was nothing new being told in this film - and I thought it lacked the punch that the hype had built. Not only that but it's overly long and seemed to be stuck in neutral half the film - it really didn't get going. The cast was terrific, but I felt that the scripting at times let them down - you can only work with what you're given, I suppose. Traffic struck me as a little Robert Altman ish in its use of several stories intersecting with each other - which I believe to be a clever genre if used well and in this case it was used effectively. Catherine Zeta Jones' character, Helena Ayala (not sure what accent she was trying to portray), was poorly written. She goes from completely ignorant of her husband's business to completely au fait then back to charming society wife without blinking - thoroughly unbelievable. Benicio Del Toro's character, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, was well rounded and Del Toro is rightly in the running for an Oscar for his performance - very solid. Michael Douglas is very convincing as the judge whose daughter is a user - showing real emotion.I was a fraction bemused by the sepia colours used in the Mexican scenes (perhaps it was the old good vs bad colour thing reinvented: America the good in colour instead of white and Mexico the bad in sepia instead of black). There also appeared to be quite a negative portrayal of the Mexicans with regard to 'the drug war' whether or not this is true I don't know.That said, it is worth seeing but I wouldn't hang out to see in in the cinema, it's a video flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some light cast on a sod of a problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt about it, Steven Soderbergh is a clever sod. He has taken the outline of a fine Channel 4 mini-series `Traffik' on the evils of the drug trade made about 10 years ago, adapted it to the US market by substituting cocaine for heroin and shifting the action from Pakistan and Europe to Cincinnati, San Diego and Mexico with most of the main characters intact. He has added his own bizarre camera angles and symbolic tinted cinematography, but without presenting an intrusive editorial tone. If anyone is singled out for honorable mention it is the modest voluntary groups like narcotics anonymous who seem to be the only actors in the area doing any good. No-one seeing this film could possibly believe that the prohibition/ war on the drug traffickers policies so zealously pursued by US law enforcement agencies could ever be effective, no matter how much money was pumped into them. One could also doubt whether a change for the better is possible. As someone points out in the film the existing drug barons have a vested interest in prohibition ? it keeps the price up. US politicians are locked into supporting the present policies because their suburban constituents are so paranoid that any alternative is `soft on crime'. There is also a strong feeling that drug `addicts' get what they deserve, a feeling echoed by the Mexican general heading the drugs agency there. He does turn out to be bent, but he probably has plenty of sympathizers in the present republican administration. I don't remember Al Gore being particularly courageous about drugs in the last election campaign either.To anyone at all familiar with the drugs debate in the US Soderbergh doesn't present anything new. But his picture of the situation is very effectively put in an un-hollywood sort of way. Running four or five main groups of characters, some of whom never meet each other, he shows the Mexican police, importers , the border guards, the DEA, and other agencies, and a youthful addict whose father, an appeals court judge happens to be nominated to be the next U S drug czar. When Dad (well played by Michael Douglas) finds out his daughter is a user he casts aside his judicial caution and becomes a vigilante ? understandable but still pretty silly. One thing a judge does learn is when to call the cops. But all the characters are presented pretty dispassionately, bearing in mind drugs tend to bring out the worst in people.There are lots of other good performances and the 140 minutes running time goes very quickly. Unlike the earlier `Traffik' there's nothing at the primary production end of the chain and one can understand why this was left out ? it's easier to empathise with people like ourselves than Andean peasants. Cincinnati ? Middle America personified - as the judge's home town seems a very deliberate choice. The film will probably take out best picture at this year's Academy awards, which is fine. But it's going to take more than even Soderbergh's movie-making dexterity to significantly change American opinion on the drug war. The people who need to be convinced, being over 25, generally don't go to the movies, even Oscar winning ones. The pity of it all is that the country went through the same thing with alcohol during prohibition earlier this century. Who would now argue that alcoholism is a criminal law problem?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this movie last night I was interested to see what others thought. I found it riveting but a little disappointing. Being a big fan of "reality" movies I am always on the lookout for a new Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, the list goes on. I don't believe Traffic reaches these heights. It is a Hollywood look at the drug trade - and the correct Hollywood responses generated. Scenes: 1) The drug-using teenagers generated audience titters at the screening I was at - somewhat reminicient of the scene from Animal House. 2) The pregnant wife going to Mexico to meet a cartel leader was unconvincing. I noted the cartel "leak" was standing in the room behind. Setting up a possible sequel perhaps. 3) The AA meetings attended by the girl seemed a bit staged and unrealistic - why was the daughter so screwed-up, anyway? 4) The Michael Douglas speech where he broke down seemed unconvincing. 5) All the Mexican bits seemed OK. The gritty reality generated from these segmants helped carry the rest of the film. Another realistic drug-use film is Christianne F from the 80s - possibly more accurate look at kids hooked on drugs than this. All in all - a good movie - Hollywood looks at drug culture - but no Pulp Fiction!</fullReview>

And I consider a movie exceptional only when it can be unique by itself.Now I don't mean that the movie is bad; it is a great movie, with a brilliantly directed script. But I fear that it is only another one in a new line of recipe movies: alert filming to make the slow pace of the script a little more bearable to the wide audience, the many storylines to make it complex. Nevertheless, it's a VERY difficult recipe, one that requires good actors and great directing, unlike others that just need good special FX.To make a long story short, I DO recommend this movie.

Miguel Ferrer interested me only in his portrayal of someone who has nothing but contempt for everyone else in the story, even himself. So, I suppose I did identify...I had contempt for everything about this movie.Years ago, when Soderbergh had a hit with "Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape", Jim Jarmusch said that his film was the future of filmmaking. Now I know what he meant. Soderbergh has yet to show me that he knows how to make a movie. His films are void of content, entertainment value, or artistic merit.

		<fullReview>It's a very good movie, but it does tend to leave you with the impression that drugs are an issue for Mexicans, for people in the DEA, for very rich people and very poor people. I suspect the middle class is involved in there somewhere!Soderbergh has directed a very ambitious movie and has, for the most part, succeeded admirably (and to release the very entertaining Erin Brockovich in the same year was quite a feat). My main complaint about the directing was the selection of an odd "lighting/texture" of the film, particularly in the Mexican sequences. It made the film hard to watch. But the performances and pacing were both terrific.I'd never noticed Benicio Del Toro in a film before, and he really fills the screen in this film. He looks like a larger, Hispanic Brad Pitt with a much broader acting range. That he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor (he dominates well over half the movie) is a shame. OTOH, it means he probably will win the Oscar, since it does look like Russell Crowe's year for Best Actor.On the other hand, that Michael Douglas was completely blown off of any major award nominations in a year when he gave two of his best performances ever (for Wonder Boys and Traffic) is also a shame!Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman have terrific chemistry as DEA agents working in drug-enriched San Diego.Catherne Zeta-Jones gives a very good performance as a confused, arrested drug-lord's wife who gradually becomes less confused.Even Benjamin Bratt, in one short but pivitol scene, is spot-on.This year has been a disappointing year for films. Traffic (and Erin Brockovich!) makes it less so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Well-Made Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a very good movie, but it does tend to leave you with the impression that drugs are an issue for Mexicans, for people in the DEA, for very rich people and very poor people. I suspect the middle class is involved in there somewhere!Soderbergh has directed a very ambitious movie and has, for the most part, succeeded admirably (and to release the very entertaining Erin Brockovich in the same year was quite a feat). My main complaint about the directing was the selection of an odd "lighting/texture" of the film, particularly in the Mexican sequences. It made the film hard to watch. But the performances and pacing were both terrific.I'd never noticed Benicio Del Toro in a film before, and he really fills the screen in this film. He looks like a larger, Hispanic Brad Pitt with a much broader acting range. That he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor (he dominates well over half the movie) is a shame. OTOH, it means he probably will win the Oscar, since it does look like Russell Crowe's year for Best Actor.On the other hand, that Michael Douglas was completely blown off of any major award nominations in a year when he gave two of his best performances ever (for Wonder Boys and Traffic) is also a shame!Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman have terrific chemistry as DEA agents working in drug-enriched San Diego.Catherne Zeta-Jones gives a very good performance as a confused, arrested drug-lord's wife who gradually becomes less confused.Even Benjamin Bratt, in one short but pivitol scene, is spot-on.This year has been a disappointing year for films. Traffic (and Erin Brockovich!) makes it less so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many a movie over the years, and I must say that Traffic, starring Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It might be more horrendous than Plan 9 From Outer-space, and at least it had a plot! Aside from the terrible performances given by Douglas, and Zeta-Jones, Benicio Del Toro delivers an incredible performance. In fact, he is the only thing that is tolerable in the film. If you are looking for a great movie, see Gladiator, but if you want to waste 8 bucks, rush out to see Traffic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A head-turning cast, a white-hot director, an issue-driven script, a long running time. What- other than lots of recognition -does it make for? Not long enough. Feels like the "greatest hits" from a longer drama- which, not having seen the British miniseries on which it is based, I suspect it might be. Rarely do I feel that a film would be improved more by adding than removing footage, but "Traffic" would be.Many characters' motivations are unexplained, or just inexplicable. Complications of drugs and the 'war' on them are raised, then abandoned. Name actors pop up, then disappear. Another 30 minutes or so could have helped add some definition to "Traffic"'s skeleton of ideas. Or, better yet, make a two-hour movie revolving around Mr. Del Toro's character. The other two stories aren't nearly as compelling, at least not as they're told here.Mr. Soderbergh's direction of the actors is assured, even delightful (I'd love to see those Cheadle/Guzman outtakes!). But his photography, while gorgeous, it's also obvious in its nature. I felt I was being nudged every time the movie changed locales: oh, we're in Mexico; ok, we're back in D.C. This, and frequent shortcuts taken by the script, underestimate the patience and intelligence of the audience. I am glad to see such a mainstream, politically-oriented, open-minded movie produced; certainly the conversation it has engendered is welcome, and we need more films like it in these respects. But, as a work of art, "Traffic" is stalled, falling short of the heady heights for which it aims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be the best film of 2K1 (so far). Coming out of this movie realizing the pitfalls of a government based war against drugs in America and in Mexico was one of many things I took out of this fascinating story. The interweaving plots, seen through the eye of varing color camera filters, keeps the viewer engaged to the very edge of their seats. Just as your gasping about the savage underworld of law and drug order in a rusty, yellow stained Tijuana your thrust into the bluey effulgence of the suited American government's war, represented by a bland to brilliant Michael Douglas, against the drugs coming in South of the Border. Then your glued to Douglas's character's daughter, herself addicted to drugs, and just as your slipping over the edge your pulled away, seemingly for fresh air, only to be confronted by the fall of the wife of a drug dealer, the heavily pregnant Zeta Jones (who, herself, is powerful in her role). What your faced with, as the viewer and as a member of a community where drugs are always an issue, is the futility in this ongoing battle. While the movie slips in the odd statistic or two, its the personal impact of scenes that really drive the nail of reality down. Each character falls into the web of drugs so deep they find themselves changed forever. From the honest mexican cop, digging deeper into a world of trickery and "keep your mouth shut or be killed" attitude to Zeta Jones's "innocent housewife to major drug dealer" metamorphasis. The acting is flawless, right down to the minor roles. The new surprises is the daughter of Michael Douglas's character and Zeta Jones's shift from her usual roles to this powerful display. Douglas goes from seemingly boring and bland to a shade of his "Falling Down" days, even earning a crack from a younger actor who plays Seth, the daughters drug swilling boyfriend, who pleads with Douglas not to do the "vigalante thing". Don Cheadle is strong as the cop who fights the war on drugs despite realizing it's futility and the unknowns in smaller roles still glue the films consistancy together. (look out for clever appearances by Salma Hayek and Jason Pratt, putting on a great acccent). In my mind, Benicio Del Toro does'nt steal the heat from his co-actors, although his performance is something you'd expect from him as being arguably the best character actor in the world.The direction, hand held bumpiness and realistic shots in each world, adds to the films doco approach. It's a technique that enhances the viewers engagement with the characters and storylines. The soundtrack is hypnotic, eerie stretches of sound that flow with the picture on screen. All in all Traffic, with it's amazing cast and direction, sets out to reveal the drug world for what it really is. It's a film with a class A script, and a story telling technique you just can't ignore. Four Stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie is beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Traffic twice, the first time with my father, and the second time with my mother and step-father. On both occasions after watching the movie, my parents and I sat down and had a long, honest and rewarding conversation about drug use. Never have I been inspired to have such a conversation with my parents. We all came clean, and admitted what drugs we've used, why, how we feel about it, etc. So, in one sense, the movie was depressing and filled me with desperation, but on the other hand, it gave me hope and inspiration because I could have such a conversation with my parents.And I agree that the ending was a little cheesy and cliche (little league and NA meetings), but what's wrong with that? I don't want to see another Trainspotting (though such movies certainly have their value). My mother is an alcoholic; I don't need a lesson on how substance abuse can destroy people's lives and families. I want some hope; I want to hear my mother and other substance abusers say what Christensen said (I'm paraphrasing because it's been awhile since I've seen the movie), that even though it'll be a long journey, she knows it's going to be okay. Granted, that was a rather abrupt and simplistic transition for someone addicted to cocaine and heroin, but it was a strong message: a lot can be done with a little love, support and compassion.So instead of mass denial and the criminilization of entire populations, reach out, talk to people (and not with lame "just say no" campaigns and public service announcements that are clearly designed by people who've never smoked a joint in their lives and barely understand the social and cultural complexities of drug use).I really found this movie profoundly beautiful. Benicio del Toro was absolutely stunning.This movie is certainly not flawless (like a lot of other folks, I found Catherine Zeta-Jone's portrayal far from convincing). It glosses over a lot of issues and can only superficially treat the complexity of substance abuse, but it is nonetheless a good "jumping-off" point.It will be released soon in Mexico and I'm anxious to see how my Mexican friends will receive it.See it, reflect, and engage in some dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Traffic' is a silent rage. Slow and devastating, like a virus. Maybe we don't see that, because we expect to have fun, we just expect to spend a quiet evening and then (maybe) to go to sleep. Still, there's so much more in the movie than the gathering of stars like Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, Guzman, Finney, Zeta-Jones, Quaid and others. There is a story based on questions so many times asked before. But, are there any answers? Yes, there are answers ? but ? do you really want to hear them?The movie is not pessimistic. The story of a drug traffic that involves many sides in it doesn't even pretend to be didactical, although it may seem so. Sure, you can learn much, but director's only intention (so seems to me) is to tell a story. In a matter of fact, to tell more stories which are united around the same topic. Steven Soderbergh is very intelligent director, he can't always stand a cliché (just take a look at his `Schizopolis'), and he must do something with it. He uses yellow filter on camera for scenes that are happening in Mexico so we can almost feel the heat, and blue one for the scenes in Washington. He puts his protagonists in the close-ups so we can know them better. One last `trick' that S. uses are the roles of Steven Bauer and Miguel Ferrer. In this movie they both play drug merchants, but in the non-fiction miniseries `Drug Wars' (1990) they both played DEA agents that were fighting against drug traffic in Mexico. Oh yes, in this movie, for a change, people in Mexico do speak Spanish, all the time. When I compare `Traffic' to `Traffik' (the original British series) I can only say that Soderbergh knew what he was doing. Do you want me to explain that? Then see the `Traffik' first.`Traffic' is slow. So, if you want action, better look some other way. But if you want something that you'd remember the next day, when you wake up, this could be one of the best choices you can make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A showcase of naive Americanism and cultural imperialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I have recently watched Traffic in a sneak preview in a Dutch theatre. This particular theatre is in the habit of rating those films and Traffic scored a meagre 5.7. Let me tell you why.Although this film tries to portrait the war on drugs from a neutral and objective point of view, I do not think it succeeded at that. In fact, this film is shot from an American perspective and practises some blatant examples of cultural imperialism. For example, most of the Mexican in this film are corrupt, and when they are not they are nicely Americanised. They end sequence of traffics illustrates this. The Mexican hero has acted well, and the Americans have favoured him by setting up nice lights so Mexican kids can play baseball in the evening. This sequence suggests that when the Mexicans have adopted American culture everything will be fine.But there's more. M. Douglas' daughter does do a record-breaking slide from being a some-time user and experimenter with drugs to become a drug addicted prostitute by the end of the film (the entire time span being a few weeks). Not only does this implicitly support the theory that experimentation with drugs leads to addiction to the worst substances, the producers of this movie also thought it necessary to involve sex to make it worse. This is a highly unlike course of events. A lot of empirical evidence has been gathered against the theory described above, and the girl hardly needs to sell her body as she had just previously stolen her mother's jewellery.The last thing I would like to point out is that the reason why America is loosing the War on Drugs, as presented by this film, appears to be not enough budget and the fact that those blasted dealers blow up every key witness. Taking a harder stance against drugs is the opposite of the more relaxed and realistic policy of my country (the Netherlands). The success of this policy can be inferred from the fact that most Western European countries (including France) has copied or want to copy our policy. Last, I feel very happy and secure living in a country that cannot send me to jail over the testimony of only 1 witness.I could go on for a while but keeping an eye on the length of this piece I will only give you some more keywords. Fill in yourself? White man's problem Too long Handheld camera (personally, I really hate it) Most bad guys &amp; gals are un-American Etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has been widely promoted and hyped on this side of the pond. Frankly I was a bit disappointed. I'm not sure the different colour filters for each of the plotlines was necessary. Michael Douglas was playing his 'victim of events' role that he does very well but his wife (Catherine-Zeta) seemed tired and lacklustre.&lt;SPOILER&gt; The redemption type ending was disappointing Hollywood mush. Erika Christianssen could at least have come down with an attack of crabs or something after selling her butt for a quick fix... Aids would have been a better outcome but I guess that would have been too derivative of Kids. The teenagers played their roles very well however. &lt;/SPOILER&gt;The Mexican story track was engaging if a bit disjointed. The Senators acted very well too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but not a great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic movie presents itself as a `hard-hitting' view of the `real' drug scene, but it looks like same old same old to me. It does some things very well, including presenting some of the real racial issues that divide and inflame people on the issue. It allows one user and one smuggler to say some harsh truths without silencing them (although both characters are sufficiently despicable that the audience is comfortable dismissing them). The acting is astonishing; a huge cast doing uniformly professional jobs; notable stand-outs are Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace, and Don Cheadle.Catherine Zeta-Jones deserves her own paragraph because, like all extremely beautiful people, she's often accused of being a lousy actress. It's simply not true. She holds her own in one of the most complex roles the movie has; showing stages of a personal transformation that has major impact on characters and situations throughout the film. She is natural, self-contained, and of course exquisite to look at.The use of color to distinguish plot locations is clever, but the shaky-cam is NOT. Both I and the person with me had tired eyes and headachy symptoms from all that artsy pseudo-documentary handheld camera work. The combination of the shaky-cam and repeated instances of film-within-film (TV screens, cops watching surveillance cameras) indicates to me that the movie's focus is `telling the truth,' which makes the cop-out Hollywood ending exceptionally irritating. What can I say? It's a good movie; you'll enjoy the performances, some of the dialogue is funny and smart, some of the characters are very engaging. But Traffic is simply NOT The Movie of the Year that everyone says it is. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic is a good, sometimes brilliant movie, but it was a little disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a great epic war movie. Yes, I consider this a war movie. Sure there are no Nazis in this, or Russians or Japanese, but in many ways this is a war movie. Many things about this movie are genius. Steven Soderbouge's directing is BEAUTIFUL. If he wins the Oscar for this, I would not be disappointed. The cinematography not only looks good, it makes sense. For example: there are three stories in this movie. Every story has a different color. The story about the Mexican cops is shot with a yellow color in the lens. The senator story is shot with a blue color. The drug-dealers-wife story is shot normal. Genius.My problem with the movie is that it is very, very, depressing. It's just not any fun to watch. Don't get me wrong, I like depressing movies sometimes. But even sad movies can be fun. This movie is one of those great, epic movies you go see once, and then you never want to see it again. Not because it was bad, but because you really don't have the care to watch it again. Oh, and like all of Soderbough's other movies, the editing is really weird. Sometimes it works in this movie. Sometimes it doesn't.My second problem: the characters. Directors have to be VERY careful when they make movies with dozens of main characters. Sometimes they pull it off and the audience gets to know each character. Unfortunately, most of the time, they don't succeed. Traffic is the latter. Because of the many characters, we are introduced to characters who seem to have no purpose, mainly because we never get a real explanation why they're there. Other characters seem to be as flat as cardboard. But, the acting in this movie is really, really god, so the poor characterization is not that noticeable to most people.Speaking of acting, Bendicio del Toro (one of my favorite actors) pulls off the performance of his career in this movie.Overall: It's a genius movie but I personally didn't like it. It is very overrated. I think that the movie was made as well as it could have possibly been made. Too bad it's just not any fun. I understand the message about how nobody can win the drug war, and I highly doubt that they could have made the movie "fun" without making it into some stupid action movie. But, the fact is this movie is still not very entertaining.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening sounds of a GameBoy fading into a sunwashed Mexican landscape to the closing peacefulness of a baseball game, Traffic grips us and doesn't let go.A personal triumph for director Steven Soderbergh, this film shows the futility of the drug war and the reasons for why it still must be fought.From the blue-tinged courthouses of Ohio (shades of The Insider), to the overexposed suburbs of San Diego, to the sepia torture cells of Mexico, Traffic presents an array of characters helping and fighting each other over one the biggest criminal and health-care issues to face North America.Using an astonishing documentary-style narrative, an ordinary filmgoer might be jarred by the naturalistic lighting, handheld camerawork, and jump cuts. All of these techniques were used to create a heightened atmosphere of reality, to great effect.The performances are fine right across the board. Michael Douglas and Amy Irving fighting over her junkie past while trying to save their daughter (Erika Christensen) who goes to such degradating lows in order for her next fix. Catherine Zeta-Jones in a nice turn as a pampered wife who(a bit too fantastically) takes her husband's role while he is in prison for smuggling drugs.Dennis Quaid as Zeta-Jones' family friend, who eases into her life with unaltruistic purposes. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as the film's moral centre, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, a Tiajuana cop faced with a great decision. But my favourite characters were Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman as the DEA agents, providing great comic relief to ease the overall tension of the film.In an otherwise unwinnable war, Traffic provides some alternatives in order to find a solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is clear to me that one of this year's great achievement in the category of acting is Benicio del Toro's fantastic interpretation of a Mexican police officer. It is equally clear that this film will take up a lot of space at the Oscar's and most likely even at some European film-festivals. The reason obviously being it's splendor and bright scary realism. For anyone living and working directly or indirectly with the many levels of the fight against narcotics and the crime that follows, this is the film portraying their situation with upmost sincerity. The lesson learnt after having seen this film is basically this: you win a few, you lose a few? That simple. But in real life, as depicted in Traffic; it is nothing simple about losing nor winning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not understand all the excitement about this movie. Having watched both Erin Brockovich and Traffic, the one thing I felt they both have in common is that both stories could have been told with 15-30 minutes less running time.By the final half hour of this movie, I was repeating a mental mantra....edit....edit....edit.Part of the problem for me was that the topic alone made it clear that there is no true resolution, which is part of the point of the picture. But if one knows this already, all the drawn out tendrils of plot are going to lead to nowhere anyway.I don't have an issue combining languages and using subtitles in an essentially English language film, but it happened so frequently I think it jarred the overall pacing of the film.One final thought...and I say this, because I believe that the Oscar pundits have already annointed Benicio Del Toro with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, BEFORE the awards. Del Toro was good, but how does anybody beat Willem Dafoe in Shadow Of The Vampire this year. I think any number of actors could have pulled off a performance comparable to Del Toro's turn here. But there are only a handful that could have duplicated Dafoe's magic and brought Nosferatu to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word can summarize the film- fantastic. It was wonderfully directed, produced, scripted, acted, photographed, edited, and so on. Traffic is clearly the best picture of the year, if not the best picture in many years.There are some comments I would like to make however. Benicio Del Toro is NOT the best actor in the film (so what's all the fuss about?), the plot is wonderful, and, finally, it has a clear shot at winningBest Picture at the Academy Awards this year (yes, Gladiator IS a fantastic and wonderfully made film, but Traffic deserves the big prize).But my words mean nothing, see the film for yourself. It's heavy, but when you come out you'll feel greatly rewarded.On a final note: pay attention to the color scheme. Blue is the story of the Washington Drug Czar; yellow is the story of the cop in Mexico; and red is the story of the suburban wife-of-the-drug king.See it...you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoiler warning: No, I'm not giving anything away, as there is no spoiler like, say, the Sixth Sense. However, in giving this commentary, I may give away things which may be considered spoilers. All I can say is if I had read my comments, it would not have spoiled anything for me.Following four different perspectives on the drug issue, this movie provides much hardship, little reward and hardly any finality. It's as if the movie dropped in, filmed the participants for a while, and dropped out. Good. The drug issue isn't something that can be packaged. I got an impression of helplessness and futility. The hands of drugs are far reaching and without barriers. What especially got to me was the perspective of the drug agents in the USA. Basically trying to clean a beach of its sand with tweezers, they go on doing their job. I found it really powerful and sad. What I really enjoyed, however, was that it wasn't being crammed down my throat. This movie doesn't tell you anything, it allows you to make conclusions. I was totally captivated during the entire movie and took it home with me to think about. In the end, that's what this type of movie should do, and that's what it did for me. 9/10 I also recommend seeing "The Insider(1999)" if you liked this movie. It's the first movie which came to my mind and, in my opinion, was the best movie of 1999.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is really a very fine film, inventively written and filmed and with a truly great performance from Benecio Del Toro. The camera work is particularly impressive, going well beyond simple presentation and adding much to the tone and story of the film. And unlike some, I have no problems with the pacing, feeling that it unfolds and refolds itself in a reasonable and compelling manner. But some elements simply didn't work with the rest of this otherwise credible film. For example, nothing in Catherine Zeta-Jones's initial performance in the film prepares you for the monumental change her character must go through later, and when that change does occur, it is simply not acceptable. Zeta-Jones can't pull off the change, and Soderbergh doesn't help her at all. Another issue is casting. Several major film "stars" fill relatively minor roles and they do so to the point of distraction. Albert Finney, Dennis Quaid and Selma Hayek all take secondary roles that should compliment the leads but instead they are out in front of the scenery, pulling focus. And Douglas's big highlight at the end -- when he walks away from the press podium - simply doesn't ring true. It is a manufactured moment that doesn't fit the character or the plot and it really weakens what should have a much stronger ending. Nonetheless, the film is well worth seeing, but it could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six kilos of separation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A conservative, family-oriented judge is appointed to the post of U.S. Drug Czar. A somewhat corrupt Mexican cop undergoes a series of crises of conscience. A woman watches as her husband is taken away by the police on charges of drug smuggling. A 16-year-old golden child dabbles in soft and hard drugs.See the theme? Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is an odyssey painted on a wide canvas, as the general theme of drugs is expressed in how drugs are produced, how they arrive in the United States from Mexico, how they are bought, who buys them, and what happens to some who use them. It is not a preachy film, however, and that's one of the reasons this movie works.Michael Douglas plays the new drug czar, and his mission is to win the war on drugs. But how to win such a war? And is it even winnable? This has never been an issue with easy solutions, and Soderbergh is smart enough not to give us a mythical cure-all. Wakefield (Douglas) is a convinced, honest man who wants to do the right thing - but even with his judicial experience, he has no idea how to proceed. His job is, in some ways, devoid of actual meaning. He is a figurehead, a symbol to the people that stands for Something Being Done on behalf of the government to stop the growing drug problem.Wakefield wants to bring down the two biggest cartels in Mexico, both of which are smuggling drugs into the U.S. on a magnificent scale. On the Mexican side, a policeman named Javier (Benicio del Toro) first turns a blind eye to the corruption and smuggling, since the cartels are being fought (somewhat offhandedly) by General Salazar, a despot in the making. Javier is recruited by Salazar to join his task force dedicated to eradicating the cartels, and we're given a close glimpse at how such "task forces" operate. Javier, like Wakefield, is a very conflicted man. Corruption is prevalent in the Mexican police force, according to the movie, but when it comes to more serious crimes, Javier is not sure what to do. Ana (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the wife of a wealthy businessman (Steven Bauer). When her husband is arrested under suspicion of drug smuggling, Ana must learn how to cope - her neighbors and friends want nothing to do with her, and only one trusted confidant (Dennis Quaid) seems to be on her side. But whose side is Ana on?Wakefield's young daughter, a National Merit Scholar finalist and class brain, is rapidly becoming an addict to serious drugs. Her friends are also addicts, and when they get together it's a lot like those old existentialist/philosophical discussions that old-time hippies used to have - only without the profundity. These kids are as deep as a puddle.This beautifully crafted film brings all of these characters together in some way or another - they're not always in scenes together, but what one character does might affect another character's actions. And, of course, the underlying moral issue of what to do about the drug problem appears throughout, no matter if the setting is rural Mexico or San Diego, California. The cinematography of a film is hardly ever what draws people to watch a movie, but it should be noted that this movie does some interesting things with the camera. For example, all of the shots in Mexico are in a grainy yellowish filter, while the U.S. shots are clear and nonfiltered. This might be to symbolize the differences in economic viability, or it could be that Soderbergh simply wanted to make sure people knew each scene's setting.As for the performances themselves, Douglas is aces as the drug czar (a demotion from president, which he played in The American President), and Zeta-Jones is fine as the victimized Ana. But it's the Oscar-nominated del Toro who's wonderful as the complex Javier, and he stands a good chance of taking home the statue.The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture (and Soderbergh earned a directing nod, too), and deservedly so. It's two-and-a-half hours long, though, so don't make the same mistake I did and get to the theater late. I had to sit in the first row for 144 minutes. Not fun. My spine telescoped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully put together interwoven story of the drugs industry and clientelle. Michael Douglas is absolutely superb as the Drug Czar father with the Freebaser for a daughter, and Benicio del Toro is also fantastic as Javier, the world weary Tijuana cop. However, I have to say, most of the other characters in this story are underdeveloped and it was hard to really get into a lot of them. Also at 2 and a half hours nearly, the movie didn't really hang well, being quite one paced and meandery in parts. But when it worked it worked really well. Don Cheadle is fantastic as always and the ending is quite a satisfying conclusion. Overall, well worth a look, but you'd probably have to be in the right (patient) mood. Disappointing compared to Soderburgh's recent efforts (especially The Limey).7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the only complaint that I can find after watching "Traffic" is that the final blow is never dealt. If this movie is meant to show us that the war on drugs is silly and costly, it could have easily pointed us to that as an inescapable conclusion, but it never does. It edges to that direction delivers some powerful punches, but never a knock out. Which, as I sit here thinking about it, may be the whole point. Casting, filming, performances, scripting... all way above par. Steven Soderbergh has proven himself with this film. Its scope is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why people might think Traffic is preachy. There are a few moments in the movie when it's all too obvious the message is that the War on Drugs is futile (Ruiz when he is talking to the cops about the cartel's operations, Robert Wakefield's speech). However, I still think it's a message that needed to be said, and besides that, Traffic is a near perfect film.The cast is superlative and spectacular. Benicio Del Toro has earned every bit of his Oscar nomination, as he gives the performance of his life as Javier Rodriguez, the distraught yet morally determined Mexican policeman. Don Cheadle is equally stunning in his role as DEA officer Montel Gordon. These two are the standouts, but basically all of the cast is great, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, who I've always considered a terrible actress and Topher Grace, who I had kind of pigeonholed as a mediocre comedic actor.The cinematography is excellent. Each locale uses its own film style and tone (Tijuana uses a hazy film style and a sepia tone, Ohio a clearer film style and a dark tone) and the camera is always held by human hands to give the movie a less polished feel.Perhaps the best part of the movie is that it flows naturally, while telling three distinct, compelling stories. Each of the stories could really be a movie by itself, but the combination of the three does a fantastic job of showing just how far-reaching and multifaceted the War on Drugs and its consequences are. Traffic is a must see as it is certainly one of the best movies of 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Traffic' is one of the most intelligent films of the year, and it will stimulate your though-provoking process. The outstanding assembled cast proves that the thespians of this film were heros and heroines. The film takes an intense look at the never ending war on drug trafficking. The outstanding performances by Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, and Michael Douglas did not surprise me because I know they are very gifted actors. However, I felt I was hallucinating when I saw that the usually non-talented Catherine Zeta-Jones was outstanding as the unsuspicious drug lord's wife. Also, Thomas Millan as the military general was for sure in command with his performance. The highest kudos should be given to Director Steven Soderbergh. He is quickly becoming one of the director lords of the movie business. So rush yourself in the next hour and catch `Traffic.' ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For them to make a movie that shows the frustration and futility of the drug war as a big budget movie took gumption. The movie doesn't seem to take a tone of what is right or wrong, but shows an illegal industry in which there is a strong demand by the children of the people who are most against the industry. Rather than deal with their children, these people would rather support attack at the source of the goods with their tax dollars.I hope this opens people's eyes.Too bad they didn't deal more with the separation of cocaine (covered in the movie) and marijuana (not covered in the movie).

Benecio Del Toro played a wonderful, multidimensional character; well written, very well acted. It does not fall into stereotypes of Latinos.It has a lot to say about the issue of illegal drugs from multiple perspectives. There are a few places where the movie had some questionable scenes that didn't "play" quite right, but it was not enough to spoil the movie.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fascinating, well-cast drama. It was a truly thought-provoking movie, examining the drug trafficking problem from several interesting angles. Street drugs certainly have a more interesting distribution chain and colorful array of distributors than most products. The movie exposes the journey of cocaine from Mexico to the nostrils of prep school brats, and shows the impact of the business on all of the players and their loved ones.I do not feel that I was being preached to, to accept a certain opinion on the drug trafficking issue. Some reviewers seem to disagree, but I feel that this movie was far lighter on morality than say an Oliver Stone film.The action was fast-paced, and the plot moved from place to place as seamlessly as the chapters of a John Grisham novel.Michael Douglas put on a convincing performance.It's been a long time since I voted a "10" for a movie, but TRAFFIC gets the "10".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it weren't for the portions of this film that take place in Mexico this film would be a joke. More than anything the film is hit-and-miss. Del Toro is great and so is the girl who plays The Drug Czar's daughter. But with the exception of Lou Diamond Phillips and the two cops, almost the entire rest of the cast is terrible. Overall, the only thing worse than the acting is the writing. Katherine Zeta-Jones' performance is terrible, but the script that has her transform from a shocked wife to the exclusive west-coast supplier is laughable. The big-bad executioner from Mexico is silly and the cops' not checking the food is something out of Starsky and Hutch.This film was billed as a real examination of the drug problem but no new issues, insights or strategies are raised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I applaud every effort this film tried to make, but, I believe, it failed on every account. This is a story that's supposed to show that drugs are a major problem in our society and that we are losing the war on drugs. Then why, may I ask, is there a happy ending? The daughter's in rehab - she'll be fine, Benicio Del Toro gets his baseball field perfect ending, and the cops plant a new bug at the drug dealer's home (even though earlier they said they check their home and offices for bugs once a day). To show that we are losing this war, there should have been casualties of this war. Yes, I know a cop dies, but he was a minor character.Secondly, I love how the Steven shoots and edits most of his films, but I found his efforts to try to seperate the three major locations using high to low contrast looks to be fruitless. If the war on drugs is everywhere - why make all the locations look different? Show the unity of the problem.And I found the "look" of Mexico - the grainy, high contrast, "ugly" look - to be rather insulting.Finally, the casting of Catherine Zeta-Jones was wrong. I can't believe that a pregnant woman who's husband is a drug dealer would 1) not know for however many years what her husband's job was and then 2) turn so drastically in such a period of time. Was her desire to have her children brought up rich with dirty money really more important to her than putting her unborn baby's life at risk while she traveled to Mexico to make the drug deal? Maybe this could happen, but the filmmakers failed to make believers out of me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Drama From Steven Soderbergh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that this is a film with a message would be an understatement, because it comes across so emphatically clear and succinct, and it is this: To wage a war against drugs, you must first come to terms with the sobering fact that the enemy is often a member of your own family; and how do you wage a war against your own family? A sobering message? Insightful? Indeed. And, when you consider the implications of it all, devastating. Ponder that awhile and you'll begin to get a sense of the futility visited upon those who would attempt to rectify a situation that affects practically everyone everywhere sooner or later, either directly or indirectly; and it is just that situation that is addressed and presented with no-holds-barred by director Steven Soderbergh in his brilliant, hard hitting film, `Traffic,' starring Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro. The film examines the trafficking of drugs between Mexico and the United States, and the long-ranging effects thereof; and Soderbergh tells the story through a number of perspectives, which effectively presents the `big picture' of the drug trade and the subsequent impact it all has on the lives of so many people.  Probably the most telling perspective in terms of futility is that which is shown through the eyes of Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a judge who is appointed the country's `Drug Czar,' and given the task of `making a difference.' It's a pivotal character inasmuch as it is through his involvement that so much information is presented, not all of which is anything new, but when taken within the context of the story has a tremendous emotional impact. Through Wakefield, not only is the unbelievably far-reaching problem of illegal drugs illuminated, but the attitudes of all of those it touches on all levels, from the heads of the Mexican cartels to the kids who use and abuse the product made so readily available to them by the drug lords. A man of principle and high ideals, Wakefield begins by educating and familiarizing himself with all facets of the drug trade. He quickly learns that although he is far from naive in terms of the reality of what he is dealing with, he actually has no concept of the depth and scope of it, like how much better equipped and financed the cartels are than the U.S. Government, for instance. Another troubling aspect of the story involving Wakefield is the lack of respect accorded him by the young people with whom he comes into contact, not only in his official position, but simply as a human being-- especially by his own sixteen-year-old daughter and her `friends.' Unfortunately, it realistically reflects an attitude prevalent within a wide faction of our society today; and it's one of the strengths of the film that it can so succinctly capture something so distressing, something that should be of monumental concern to everyone, for it's an integral part of a larger something that touches us all. Also realistically portrayed is Wakefield's reaction to all of this; the helplessness born of the limited ways of combating what he encounters is extremely well realized and conveyed by the film, and it enhances even more that already overpowering sense of futility. From the Mexican side of the border, the story unfolds through the perspective of Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a veteran of the Mexican Highway Patrol; and it's from his side of the fence that we begin to understand the ramifications of the politics, money and power, and ruthlessness that so empowers the cartels. In these segments, the dialogue is in Spanish (with English subtitles), and Soderbergh uses a tint to the film that lends a visual sense of detachment to the action; it's almost like watching an old newsreel, which gives it an air of authenticity that works because it's incorporated with the emotional substance that ultimately provides the real impact. The superlative cast Soderbergh assembled for this film includes Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Steven Bauer, Jacob Vargas, Erika Christensen, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving, Tomas Milian and James Brolin. An important film of gut-wrenching implications and staggering emotional proportions, `Traffic' evokes a sense of futility and loss (especially in the final scenes) that is, at times, overwhelming. It makes you realize just how huge the drug trafficking trade is, and how any efforts to eliminate or even contain it simply pale in the light of it's enormity. It's like a terminal cancer, spreading and eating away at the fabric of our society; a disease that reduces the value of human life to the barest minimum. It's a movie that will affect everyone on a different level emotionally, depending somewhat upon personal experience and frame of reference, but there is no doubt that this is a film that will create a lasting impression on anyone who sees it; but be prepared, for this is powerful drama that elicits a sense of hopelessness which-- I'm sure for many-- may hit just a bit too close to home for comfort. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

Endemic police corruption in Mexico set against sea green incorruptibles (black, white and hispanic) in the States evades key issues.

By the way, its kind of ironic that Benecio Del Toro, Steven Bauer and Miguel Ferrer pop up in a drug film knowing that they had once done something VERY simliar back in the late 80's on a mini-series called THE CAMERENA STORY. Also, its finally nice to see a great actor like Del Toro to finally get some recognition out here in movieland.I could'nt end this review without giving praise to my favorite moment(s), the cinematography!

		<shortDescription>Absolutely riveting from beginning to end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This whole movie, from the use of the different color filters used to color the film (or videotape) to the razor sharp script,or to the actors who deliver those lines flawlessly, is by far the best movie I've seen in the last 12 months. Everything fits together so perfectly and each and every performance is so natural and exact that it would be hard to imagine this movie NOT winning every award it has been nominated for. A movie that frightens you because it is real, things like this do happen - and they happen each and every day. If you appreciate excellent work by all involved in the film industry - this is the best movie of the year - sorry all you 'Gladiator' fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Platoon yet done with style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh is to be commended for his ambitious effort in Traffic. With very few break downs, Soderbergh managed to advocate the viewpoint that the "War on Drugs" is stale and futile without being overly pretentious. Yet "Traffic" is a far more ambitious project than either of his earlier successes, the "Underneath" or the "Limey". Multiple narratives, combined with the big budget seduction of the obligatory shootouts and explosions added a bit of weight to the 147 minute running time that could have been better spent on character development. The audience is asked to be quite forgiving as Michael Douglas throws off the cares of his high level government appointment to become a flat foot in search of his daughter, and the seemingly victimized Catherine Zeta-Jones is transformed into a savvy, ruthless drug lord. Be that as it may, Soderbergh handles the complexities of the decades old "War on Drugs" more deftly. Without standing on the alter of treatment over punitive deterrence measures, the screen play does a credible job of illustrating the myriad of motivations for everyone from the user to the dealer. While those of us with a more intimate knowledge of American drug policy over the last two decades may quibble that Soderbergh stopped just short telling the whole the truth, "Traffic" represents the most comprehensive overview of the problem presented to the viewing public other than the real life trail of Manuel Noriega. As we all know, that event didn't exactly make it to Hollywood, much less the Academy. From a cinematic viewpoint, some purists have had trouble with Soderbergh's use of filters and Stephen Mirrione's editing of the Mexico sequences. While clearly used as a punctuation for the differing challenges the drug culture presents north and south of the border, the script was effective in illustrating them without the added visual hyperbole. However, the same could have been said about Coppola's heavy use of filters in "Apocalypse Now" and Stone's overbearing utilization of religious symbolism in "Platoon". Fortunately for Soderbergh, his effort in "Traffic" comes closer to Coppola. All in all, this is a solid crime drama that in addition to entertaining the audience, may provide the ancillary benefit of perspective on a political question that is far from resolved.Benicio Del Toro shines above all in the film and from his work this year in "Way of the Gun" and "Snatch" appears to be on his way to establishing himself as one of the better actors on the scene today. On a side note, it was pleasing to see Steven Bauer cast as a state side drug kingpin while Jacob Vargas's character took on the moniker of Bauer in De Palma's "Scarface". A small tribute to those of us who care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies out there, such as Pulp Fiction and The Godfather, that can keep the audience entertained despite how long the film is. This movie is not one of them. Like Pulp Fiction and The Godfather, Traffic is a movie that is well over two hours, but unlike these two films, Traffic is unable to keep the audience interested. I was looking at my watch more often than I look at my watch during school. Just when I thought the movie was about to end, another pointless scene emerges and at the end of the film, I realized that the only good thing about this movie was the message about the war on drugs, and nothing else. As I exited the theater, I saw that my friend and I were not the only ones complaining about the movie, because just about everyone who saw that movie was talking about how long it was. The acting is decent, the plot is predictable, and as mentioned before, this is an extremely boring film. If you are currently suffering from sleep deprivation, then I highly suggest you see this film. I can almost guarantee it will put you to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I know about drugs, you could write on the back of a cigarette packet (I've never even smoked) and I was not initially inclined to spend two and a half hours witnessing an examination of the problem as exhibited in the relationship between Mexico and the United States. But the reviews and word of mouth were so good that I made the effort and - together with my 24 year old son - I found a powerful and challenging work.Both the subject matter and the style make this an uneasy experience. It's no fun seeing young people overdosing or turning to prostitution and the whole movie is shot in a grainy, bleached, jerky documentary style with rapid inter-cutting of different narratives. Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan take a social problem so often viewed in simplistic terms and present a multi-layered, multi-faceted approach, devoid of easy answers and even any answers at all. The final line if dialogue is `We're here to listen' and I guess that the purpose of the movie is to make us think rather than to offer us a solution.This is one of those films in which there are many good performances and no one is allowed to overshadow the subject matter itself. Real life husband and wife Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones play respectively a judge turned drugs czar and a na?ve wife turned drug baroness, but they never appear on screen together. There are some excellent roles for minority actors - indeed almost half the dialogue is in Spanish - with Benicio Del Toro particularly impressive as a Mexican policeman in a moral maze. You'll be thinking about this work long after you've left the cinema and that can only be beneficial, given the scale and complexity of our drugs problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I thought.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest thing this film has going for it is its poignancy. It's a grim look at what really *is* happening with drug influence/trafficking in the US. Like someone else said there are no distinctive "good guys" or "bad guys", and soon you may come to the conclusion that there are no winners or losers, no matter what happens with drugs within the years to come.Example: Halfway through the film I was wondering what was going to happen with the Douglas's character's family; how they were gonna end it "happy" w/out it looking cliche and contrived OR ending it "sad" w/out everyone wanting to kill themselves after seeing the movie! I was OK about the ending in that subplot. Even though the whole story about the girl plunging so far into the "crackwhore" scene after being miss-prim-i'm-#3-in-my-class seemed a bit too much, still, as I know this film will make many casual teen drug-users(not free-base!) roll their eyes complaining at how unreal the teenage daughter's character is, I just passed that age-group and can say with experience that this film takes ALL the glamour out of drug use for a lot of people, including me. Basically, you're wondering why this girl is being so stupid but acknowledging that well, some people really *are* that stupid.The movie asks the question whether it's better for a teen to try a drug out for themselves or to confine them. Serious issues like these about upper-class kids always end up implying that a little bit of both is always good. It's hard to say if this view is correct, but it would be cool to push a button and just demolish every single drug particle out there into oblivion.On a side note, this is the second movie I've seen Benecio Del Toro in,(also saw The Usual Suspects) and I thought he was awesome. A bigger, darker version of Brad Pitt. What more could you want in an actor? =)Using a vixen star like Catherine Zeta-Jones was fine, I liked that she was pregnant in the film. Although I think someone else could've nailed that part just as well as she could've (or better) she played as best she could.I thought the 2 guys protecting the drug-dealer-guy were funny. The Hispanic one was in Magnolia and was equally funny in that one.EVERYONE ACTS GREAT IN THIS FILM. Everyone!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!**************************************************There's even that small part with the guy who asks Benecio del Toro for a cig, then ends up getting hired by Catherine Zeta-Jones to kill that other guy but gets killed in the parking lot before he can do it. Even he's awesome. END SPOILER =) END SPOILER =) END SPOILER =) **************This is the kind of film that will probably get newcomers or already-known actors noticed.I felt the pacing of the film was also great. It was always engrossing. My boyfriend was kinda upset at the role Dennis Quaid played in it, but as long as the shoe fit...................ps. It's also with movies like these that I unfortunately don't see getting as much revenue as deserved. Most people won't want to see this again and again, because it is oftentimes disturbing. However, I admit that I'd see this again over Magnolia, simply because this relied a tad bit more on the actor's performances and the plot rather than style and score.ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!***** I thought the ending credits, with the baseball game was perfect. I was so close to crying in the end, just because the ending was so beautiful.********************END SPOILEREveryone should go see this. Even little kids. Believe me; it WILL TAKE THE GLAMOUR OUT OF DOING SMACK OR ANY OTHER KIND OF DRUG.OH........one more thing. I don't feel using 4 or 5 subplots in this kind of movie is "confusing"...on the contrary..it puts things more into perspective. In a David Spade movie, you don't want many subplots. But for an earnest view at important subject matter, I feel it is essential.Plus it keeps the film from getting boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film shows several approaches to drug use and enforcement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a reasonably good film portraying drug use and drug enforcement attempts at different levels. It touches on the actual use of drugs (which is well done as the main theme in 'Requiem for a Dream') by a group of middle class teens, not portraying it necessarily as a form of overt escapism, as is the stereotype, but as a way to have fun. The problems come in when dependency occurs, well shown by the deterioration of Michael Douglas's character's daughter in the film. The power of the cartels is brought across to show the futility of the war on drugs. Personally I don't know how realistic this is, but it is an important part of the debate on drugs.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and intelligent film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's refreshing to see a well-crafted film such as "Traffic." While some films focus less on story, "Traffic" succeeds in its narrative and vision, thanks to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan. I would also like to acknowledge its outstanding cast, including Benicio del Toro as Javier, a Mexican police officer caught between two powerful drug cartels. He is one of the many characters that the viewer(s) encounters throughout this fine film, including a newly appointed drug czar(Michael Douglas), his teenaged daughter (Erika Christensen), and a San Diego wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) who realizes her husband's a drug lord. It is through these characters and the situations they are forced into, intentionally or not, that makes this film worthwhile. Clocking in at two and a half hours, I felt compelled to know what happened to these characters. It's no wonder so many critics loved "Traffic." With its excellent direction, well-crafted characters, and a thought-provoking issue, "Traffic" is an intelligent film. I strongly recommend this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a point of view, the war on drugs is a losing battle andno one knows who the combatants really are.I enjoyed it and think it was generally well made, although there are acouple of issues: It was hard to believe the key witness in the trialwas so poorly protected, especially after one failed assassinationattempt. These agents behaved like true idiots in the way they"protected" him. The other flaw I saw was it seemed that the drug czarcould have used his "bully pulpit" to make some changes in the systemrather than just throw up his hands and walk away.I liked it very much, though. One question it implied is "What do wedo?" Do we legalize drugs? If we do, aren't we abrogating theresponsibility of the government to oppose those things that are harmfulto our society? If we did legalize drugs, would we be telling our youththat it really is OK to be addicted? Would we really put the dealersout of business?Maybe this movie really is asking why America is scourged so badly bythe drug culture. Why here so much? I suspect this movie could raisethe dialogue that could answer this question and then maybe the ear</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In search of the perfect cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some things are all a matter of opinion, but here, Soderbergh has provided us with a movie that will keep you totally engrossed. Essentially the film details a straightforward and commonly approached subject....drugs and the familial, legal and political war waged against it. However, this film takes the subject far beyond any previous film of the genre. A quality cast steadily brings the story together perfectly. Demonstrating some ingenuity, Soderbergh differentiates events from the US and Mexico with distinct changes in cinematic style to good effect. As the film progresses these differences diminish as does the filming styles. Blending together the stories of a family,a US cop and a Mexico cop we see how the drugs war impacts all sectors of the social ladder. To go beyond that here would be to do the film an injustice, but the biggest injustice will be the fact that this film will not receive the viewing figures it so thoroughly deserves. This film should be in the top 30 all time films, if you watch it I am certain you will agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without flaws but a highly entertaining, gripping depiction of an important social issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is an ingeniously directed film; I would say the best of its type since JFK. You can forgive the fact that the governmental drug czar's daughter is a smackhead, at first hard to believe, but then you think a similar thing happened to our home secretary in the UK (his son turned out to be selling a bit of hash). After all it is all leading to a point; who are we fighting the drug war against?This is a very complex debate in society and this film is intelligent due the fact that it highlights the problems facing us for a mainstream audience. Not all of the drug-dealers are cast as out and out villains; likewise the government forces are not entirely depicted as the real good guys and in fact come across as a little na?ve. Some very apt points made despite it being in a Hollywood sort of way eg. when the boyfriend explains to Michael Douglas that the fact most drug dealers are black is due to social conditioning.This film is not perfect, but it is always gripping, well directed and features some fine acting. It manages to be entertaining, whilst highlighting an important social issue. What more can you ask from a film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and "Out of Sight" I found "The Limey" and "Erin Brockovich" rather disappointing. So, to me, Traffic is an improvement on those two, albeit it still doesn't quite cut it. Yes, it is well-directed and it has with the exception of Catherine Zeta-Jones whose performance is not wholly convincing throughout a strong cast with Benicio Del Toro showing the strongest performance of them all (Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas coming close, however). Yet there are two or three points I'd like to make: mostly it's the part of the storyline involving Douglas' drug-taking daughter that bothers me. Firstly, it really doesn't get the film nor us as the audience anywhere and therefore could have easily been left out and secondly, maybe just as important, her motives for taking the drugs is not explained. The scene when she's supposed to talk about her reasons during that session reveals nothing whatsoever. I also wonder whether it was really necessary to use that special colour technique to distinguish between Mexico and Washington throughout the whole film (the "tropical" orange-brown colour opposed to the "cold" blue-grey) - I mean, as if we were not able to distinguish that ourselves once the visual difference has been established in the beginning. But that's rather a minor point: to me it is the above mentioned story arc that spoils the film a bit. Even more so since it makes the film look and feel schmaltzy. But this is not to say that Traffic is not worth the ticket, it is ambitious and entertaining and no worse for that. On my rating system it gets 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has all the elements for being one of the most memorable movies ever but falls about two rewrites short. The cinematography is a bold step that sets the different unreal atmospheres, the several storylines have beginnings, middles and ends, twists change things, characters move from where they started.But, in the end, it doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. "Messages" are mouthed as cliched platitudes when they should be unspoken subtext, characters remain two-dimensional when they should be 3-D and never really develop, and the different storylines merely cross over when they should link and mesh.It's a case of the half-finished building; it's interesting to look at but it's never more than that until it's finished.</fullReview>

I can't say I came away from the theatre with the same feeling of "having really enjoyed myself" like I did with "Cast Away." I almost wish I had waited until it was out on video. I think this movie could be a severe warning to the younger generation ...as to what could happen to them if they started taking drugs. Maybe a movie they should show in high schools. The scene of the Judge's daughter (Erika Christianson) as Caroline Wakefield under the influence of drugs is frightening, and I'm sure mothers and fathers in the audience were squirming in their seats when they thought of their own sons and daughters. Watching these teenagers snorting heroin wasn't pleasant to watch. There were many newcomers in this movie, and they all did a very good job. Some familiar faces cropped up in short roles ... James Brolin,Dennis Quaid, and Selma Hayak. Catherine Zeta Jones, pregnant at six months was convincing, as was Michael Douglas as the judge. These two never meet in this movie. Certainly not the movie to go to if you're looking for a pleasant night out. However, it is believable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see how this movie was conceived. Soderbergh &amp; Co decided to cover the Drug War. Conducting a full-scale journalist investigation would've been problematic: showing footage of real drug traffickers &amp; addicts is not commercially viable - millions of us are aren't ready to pay $8 per ticket for that. So a brilliant idea was found: make it kinda like documentary, but with a fictional story and professional actors playing instead of real characters. And that's how it looks: disturbing, kinda like real life - but still, with Michael Douglas and Zeta-Jones. Who wouldn't pay $8 for that!Overall, a great effort to fill the void, since the Drug War issue deserves to be brought to the our attention. Not the best Michael Douglas movie though - but that's OK, we love the guy anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the "Mexican" actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One comment referred to the "Mexican" actors used in this film. Well, none of them are Mexican; the Mexican characters are all American actors and not necessarily of Mexican ancestry. Benicio del Toro, although his performance is impressive, quite couldn't get the Mexican accent down. His Puerto Rican pronunciation kept coming up even though he said he used a speech coach to attain an "authentic" pronunciation. I don't think audiences in Mexico will agree. Tomas Milian, who is of Cuban descent, had a pretty good Mexican accent. Jacob Vargas as Manolo Sanchez was OK, although a little shaky at times. He is of Mexican background so he has the basic Mexican speech patterns down. Of course, the only Mexican was Salma Hayak in an uncredited cameo appearance.It would have been better to have Mexican actors play the Mexican roles, but I realize Soderbergh would have been criticized for not using American actors of Hispanic background. But this can cause problems if the actors have to speak Spanish dialogue of a particular nationality and their Spanish is rather shaky. And of course, Benicio del Toro is a rising young actor which is good for the picture's marketability rather than using an unknown (to U.S. audiences) Mexican actor. But the Mexican slang was quite authentic.</fullReview>

As a voluntary substance misuse counsellor and an individual that does drug awareness lectures this films subject matter and the fact that I like Soderberghs body of work was of great interest to me. The story is a intricate pattern of plots woven around the world of drugs and looked at its effects in all walks of life. Douglas plays a high ranking Drug Czar in the american goverment who quickly becomes disillusioned when he sees the unstoppable force that he is up against. Abely supported by a fine cast including Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro (breathtakingly good) and Dennis Quaid Tarffic adequatelly illustrates the so called 'war on drugs' is a fruitless exercise that nobody but the traffickers seem to be winning.Soderbergh directs masterfully and leaves us with no dilemmas...prohibiton does not and cannot work. Intricatelly weaving the stories around each other we see the effects of the war..the winners and the clear losers. Using a mixture of grainy film stock and hand held cameras the film has a documentary style feel about it..making it's impact even more effective. Its pace falters in places and can become to overstylish...particularly some of the mexican sequences..but overall the films length is not that noticeable. He ellicits fantastic pefromances from all concerned particularly Del Toro (if he doesn't win an oscar for this then it's daylight robbery). The film is flawed...witness the sudden change of character for Zeta Jones, from mild mannered distressed innocent wife to ruthless smuggler...which I found hard to believe. The pace of the film appears to be slightly rushed towards the end...but apart from this Soderbergh has adequatelly shown us, his best is yet to come...and what's he done so far is VERY impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A let-down of a film after hearing all the reviews in the press.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, never have I been so disappointed in a film that was acclaimed by the critics as how I felt when I sat through Traffic yesterday. Even the ratings on this site suggest that there are a lot of viewers who enjoyed it, yet the audience I was in just sighed at the end; you could also hear them muttering on the way out of the cinema about how disappointed they were too.Basically, there are three plots going on in the film and none of them cross paths. Michael Douglas plays the Judge, appointed to be the drug czar of America, only to find his own daughter is becoming an addict. Catherine Zeta-Jones has a husband who becomes entangled in drugs through his business; I won't go into that plot any further. There is also the business of the Mexican police and their clashes with a particular Mexican army general.Anyway, the camera work is very clever and good use is made of colour in the film. It's not all viewed in hi-colour, as you will see. It is basically used to remind you what plot you are in at any given time.However, whether the plot / story-line, call it what you will, whether this is interesting or not - and it is mildly, you still feel bored as the film moves along slowly. Lasting over 2.5 hours, you are feeling like you want it to end after about ninety minutes. You don't feel anything towards the characters, it's all apathy. I couldn't have actually cared any less for them - which is why I was disinterested and bored long before the end.There are a lot of clever things in the film and about how it was made etc, but it doesn't capture you as a paying member of the audience.Trust me, you will not come out feeling excited about it, or feel entertained.You will also not want to bother to watch it again. Then, however, it's up to you and your personal taste. As I said, trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really cannot see why everyone is making such a big deal about this movie. It has some good performances (Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle), but it needed to stick to a few stories instead of throwing five or six subplots at us at one time.What made "Pulp Fiction" so good was that it told the three stories without jumping back and forth and they all blended together at the end. My exact words walking out of "Traffic" were "that's it?! this is how it f*!king ends?!?!" Michael Douglas' daughter in the movie was completely uninspiring. I don't like how the segment ended with her. It does make you open your eyes to the fact that there is rampart drug use going on with young teens.Soderbergh has proved in the past he can do better than this (Erin Brockovich) and this movie just did not sit well for me. This was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie we get 3 movies from a number of different view points, US law agencies, mexican law agencies, Drug lords etc. Obviously the Mexican Law enforcement had to be corrupt, not the US ones. None of the plots go anywhere, their is no biginning no middle and no end to any of the plots. Douglas does absolutely nothing in the film with regards his job, just story on his personal life, which is just rich kids getting high (seen many times before). Catherine Zeta Jones and her husband get a mini story where the details are totally unknown. As does the General in mexico story.And the acting was really really bad, apart from Benicio Del Toro. Zeta Jones changed her accent from line to line, Douglas gave us some cheesy speeches, and lines.It was filmed as a documentary, which it shouldnt have been, it did not suit the type of film it was, they tried to make it gritty and realistic, but did not work at all, just worked in giving me a headache with the shaky camera work.Overall i cant recomend this film at all, because it basically has no plot, or has a pointless plot.And you can read all the spoilers, cause there is nothing to spoil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films that can be regarded as enlightening while at the same time entertaining are a rare occurrence. Steven Soderbergh's portrayal of the current state of affairs in the US drug war is one of the few pictures that can claim this, thanks to a screenplay that isn't afraid to tell it like it is and his own flair of spinning a good yarn. Much has been made of the fact that he was also the cinematographer (although credited as Peter Andrews after a disagreement with the Director's Guild), however while his style is certainly innovative in trying to give each location it's own individual look, it often seems a little unnecessary especially when, in the case of the washed out sterile blue effect in Washington, it sometimes seems to be employed at random. Inspired by an 80s Channel 4 series, Traffic weaves together three connected plots, each reflecting a different front on which drugs are wreaking havoc. Michael Douglas plays the newly appointed drug czar who is na?ve about the whole problem, but then finds out how far reaching it is when he has a bit of a Jack Straw and finds out that his daughter is a heroin addict. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are justly rewarded for their great supporting turns in Out Of Sight (which in my humble opinion is still Soderbergh's finest hour) with more prominent roles as DEA agents investigating a wealthy drug trafficker and are often the source of the film's comic relief. As for Catherine Zeta Jones who plays the trafficker's society wife, I think research should be done into the hormones released during pregnancy inducing dangerous bouts of acting in the otherwise average Hollywood denizen. Unfortunately her accent veers painfully frequently from Middle American to plum English and occasionally even dips into the lilting valleys of her native Wales, ironic as she has been quoted as saying she enjoys the opportunity of using an American accent in her films. The best act of this plot's golden triangle is saved for Benicio Del Toro, who you may remember as the nigh incomprehensible Fenster of The Usual Suspects. Here Del Toro brilliantly plays a world weary cop in the Mexican town of Tijuana (and would therefore be equally unintelligible were it not for subtitles), trying his best to battle the cartels in the face of police corruption and warring drug lords, while trying to maintain his own self-respect and stay alive.Each of the three stories has a very strong plot and is well acted, while bringing up pertinent questions as to the root of the drug problem and the sheer scale of any attempt to solve it. However the film drags a little in the last half hour and seems to lack the courage of its convictions by serving up a happy ending of sorts for each storyline which, rather than showing that despite everyone's best efforts the war rages on, gives an upbeat finish oddly out of character with the rest of the film.</fullReview>

The use of different filters for each story / location is ingenious.The message: that this is a problem that is unending, won't go away, and wound up in a web of politics, crime and social issues - is treated with balance and utmost care and Soderbergh doesn't allow the sentimentality of the human stories to overpower it.Deserves the praise and accolades it is getting, and potential academy awards next month.</fullReview>

It's quite unbelievable that Soderbergh manipulated his current status, to get a studio to back a documentary.We're the lucky ones to benefit though. All 3 tales are excellent, and probably worth individual films on their own. Del Toro is excellent, and proving himself to be one of the best contemporary actors.Drugs messages are usually so preachy.

		<shortDescription>Undercooked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its concept and execution, "Traffic" is very well-made and crafted. And it takes the "correct" stance that the American War on Drugs, at least as it's now being waged, is unwinable by its very nature.Yet in the end, what do we have? Three stories that have no pat resolutions, but no cliffhanging tension, either. It's never entirely clear what motivates Del Toro's character to do what he does (for family? for faith? for Mexico?); we never really see Zeta-Jones' lust to keep the lifestyle to which she's become accustomed (for a woman who was supposedly oblivious to how her husband made their money, her transition to hit-ordering drug moll scarcely registers), and the whole undercover segments seems to have been purloined from a 40's police caper. And I'm willing to have "Traffic" end unresolved, but shouldn't there be some sense of OUTRAGE that things are the way they are? Instead of feeling that we ought to do something about the drug war, we're left feeling just as complacent as if there really HAD been a happy ending after all.And whose fault is this? Steven Soderburgh's, who's likely to become the first director to be Oscar-nominated for two films in a single year since Michael Curtiz in 1938. Which, given this lousiest film year in memory, is par for the course. I can't believe I'm saying this but -- go rent "Erin Brockovich" instead! Better yet, go rent "The Limey," Soderburgh's 1999 outing with Terrance Stamp in perhaps his best performance.</fullReview>

Most people that is, not me. Poor script, poor acting, ugly Catherine Zeta Jones. It just seemed to me, all the way through the film, that they were trying to do the Tarrantino style blending of different storys and failing miserably. The best acting came from Del Toro, and i think that if they had taken the Mexican story, advanced it significantly and had released that instead it would have been a FAR better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One brilliant film, two good , but flawed ones, combined...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with reviewing Traffic is that it is not one film, but three films in one. While that might work with the Holy Trinity,it is dangerous to try on screen.Soderbergh, however, does pull it off..the total film IS more than the sum of its parts. There are three narrative threads.The first, and the best thread, is set in Mexico, using Mexican actors, and ayellow filter. Here, Benicio Del Toro gives a performance as a morally ambiguous, but strangely dedicated Narcotics cop that is nothing short of brilliant.The second thread is police procedural of a different sort, with the DEA going after a drug kingpin and his wife. This thread is shot in rich, glowing colors, almost a parody of Miami Vice. The best things in this sequence are a terrific performances by Don Cheadle, as a skeptical DEA agent, and Miguel Ferrer as an extremely articulate "informer" who offers a devestating critique of U.S. drug policies.The biggest weakness of this sequence is a flat performance by Dennis Quaid as, the drug king pins double-crossing "best friend".Catherine Zeta-Jones is surprisingly good,as the drug -king-pins wife, who begins the story as a sweet-natured, charnming society lady and has degenerated into a cold-blooded criminal master-mind by the end. The third thread is probably the one that will have the greatest emotional impact on American audiences, as it shows the impact of drugs on "middle America". It is also I thought, the weakest sequence.Micheal Douglas plays a conservative Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, who gets named federal drug czar, probably by the Bush administration.Ironically, he is so wrapped up with the war on drugs that he doesnt notice that his gifted, charming young daughter is ON drugs. Douglas and his wife ( played by the recently invisible Amy Irving) finally manage to get her into treatment. This thread is hurt by some cliched sequences and an unsubtle performance by Douglas. However, even here, there were good things.Topher Grace gives a truly fine performance as a preppy drug pusher. Albert Finney is effective in a cameo as the President's Chief of Staff. There is also an amusing sequence early on when Douglas is a t a party, getting advice from various U.S. Senators-Hatch, Nickles, Reid, Grassley( who merely smiles and nods his head vigorously as Orrin holds forth)and Boxer.This sequence may be the first time since Advise and Consent when political conservatives have actually been portrayed in an Hollywood film as saying intelligent things. Of course, the most intelligent conservative advice on the Drug War was offered by Bill Buckley and National Review a long time ago. END IT. Decriminalize drugs, and focus on treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is like a cinematic nesting doll. Each scene introduces another deeper scene with an even more fascinating character. Each of these startlingly realistic people is then portrayed by riveting actor after riveting actor. What a great movie.Now at over two hours of evolving plot scenarios of each story-ette, you'll feel, at times, a tad sedated. In fact, a primetime- drug documentary-when's- it -gonna-end fog may overcome you, but stick with it. Traffic has many subtle rewards.As each layer peels into the next, god-like director, Steven (the hits just keep-a -comin) Soderbergh's, unique if sometimes off style-approach draws you in deeper and deeper- like an addiction. The players are so three-dimensional that it's more like voyeurism or a twisted version of Real World than a scripted film.Story goes...Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio "I'm here baby" Del Toro) is starting to feel a touch of corruption flowing like soft-serve ice cream, stuck on serve, into his hometown (that hot, broke, tattling town-o-tourists mecca, Tijuana). The two top Mexie drug cartels are warring against each other for control of Baja California. Who can he trust? Who's on the take? Who works for whom? Who's out for his full order of nachos supreme? Everyone it seems.Then the movie shows us interwoven lives-lives connected in different parts of Mexico and America, all with the common element of drug trafficking. And how the trafficking it is affecting each of their lives.Cut To: A spoiled housewife, Helena Ayala ( A very pregnant Catherine "Oy, my achin' freakin' back-can you be a doll and get me a double corned beef sandwich from the catering table" Zeta-Jones) discovers her husband's line of business is not all Krispy Kreme &amp; Starbucks Coffee portfolio choices. She's faced with all the ugly laundered truths. Her husband has been arrested. Appears he's a big quasi Escobar wannabe. Upon the news of his arrest, her hoity toity-Rodeo Drive shopping-Louis Vitton designed- SUV- driving friends become (surprise) fair weather conversation snorters and desert her faster then liposuction takes away those multiple canapés and Chateaubriands of the holidays... And her biggest blow? Credit card after credit card is gone- even her beloved Macy's card had been revoked! What's a girl to do? Forget the father of her children and take in his consigliary Arnie (Dennis "I'm sorry, Meg who?" Quaid)? Get a minimum wage job at the Piggly Wiggly baggin' her exfriend's Deli style cappacio and lead-free mineral water? Or buck up and learn the trafficking biz? Hmm, maybe.Cut To: An Ohio mansion filled with ivy league-ettes snorting and cooking varieties of blow, pubescent style fu**ing and top shelf drink swillin'. One of the debutante druggies, Caroline ( Erika Christensen), is the daughter of the newly appointed US drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael "Sure, I'm Nostferatu-ing facially, but I still got a hot cuchiass" Douglas). Daddy's got a colossal case of denial and daughter's got a big old case of the Shanghai shakes. Heroin will do that to a gal, I'm told.Cut To: The noble law enforcers who battle the revolving-door judicial system. Day in, day out, these guys play catch and release, like a bad cable fishing show... Officers Gordon (Don "Megatalent" Cheadle) and Castro ( Luiz -you'll recognize him instantly- Guzman). They bust Ms. Country Club Helena's husband's affiliate and the drug ring circus begins. Creepy hitmen show up. Wire taps are put in strange places.The stories connect and continually intertwine till each reveals its plot.Let's talk talented salsa beefcake for a moment...Benicio Del Toro, a pet actor/mansteak here at Blunt Review, will be up for awards galore if I make my guess. What a brilliant actor. Okay, he's a bit chimichanga- with- a- side- of refried beans- porked out in this...But so was Kevin Spacey circa 1990, before GQ got a hold of him. Hollywood will reshape and remold him into their next leading man. Ben will have trainers and stylists, and, by this time next year, he will look like a neuAnglo-Armani wearing- pugilist - manmeat portion of Antonio Banderas with darker circles under his eyes. For now, Del Toro is still a bit shaggy-edged, a touch smelly looking-and shines for it. He was in the semi-sleeper Way of the Gun. And he's in two other flicks presently, Snatch and The Pledge. Bennie also sits in everyone's video collection in Usual Suspects-yep, the garbling oddity, Fenster. Wanna know more of his impeccable work? Click here for full details. (I keep hearing that song, El Matador, when I see this big beautiful guy...)Sadly, it would take about eight thousand words to give each actor his due here. Simply, see this movie. It's not for everyone. It's realistic and at times overtly blunt in its drug scene portrayals- be warned NSYNC fans. Traffic is a true film lover's film. Intelligent, well acted and unique.Film and acting students will be viewing this one for years to come. No Hollywood formula here kiddies! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh no! They did a sequel on Insider!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that directors have found a new path to commercial success. Take a well known age-old social problem in America, build a meaningless story around it and pretend to have made the defining docu-drama, the social-awakening masterpiece, the ground-breaking work of art. As far as the impact of the movie is concerned, Traffic is annoyingly self-important and pedantic, but nonetheless empty. It's the same emptiness we find in Fight Club, Magnolia and of course Insider. The shock value? Zero. We have seen it all before. Kids taking the wrong way? Try Kids. Kids using drugs? Trainspotting. More close shots on drug use? Pulp Fiction. Spoiled rich kids? Tons of flicks. Nothing original. Or is it the DEA against the cartels? Also we have the extremely boring and predictable family scenes and the cheese-o-rama of the group therapy scenes. I hope this dumbing down of our intelligence will stop (I know, it won't, but let's be optimistic).Apart from that, the Mexico segments are the best part of the movie. I guess they could make a very good movie on their own. I would go for Benicio Del Toro at least for an Oscar nomination. But in general I found much more realism and feeling to this part. I guess Latino actors are simply better. Also camera angles and filters are top-notch, which gives overall quality and partial visual redemption to the audience, but doesn't save the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audio Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left the subterranean parking structure yesterday (February 1, 2001) after viewing TRAFFIC with two audio memories. The first was a comment heard in the screening --one row behind me -- by a man making a comment to his wife. This moment was fifteen minutes into the movie when he said, "This is a good movie!"I knew this as fact five minutes before his comment. TRAFFIC is not a usual type movie by any means but one in which I found my own heart racing in anticipation of another experience in the politics and power of drug movement between Mexico (Tijuana) and the US. I felt as if I were personally living every Los Angeles Times article that I ever read that deals with scandal and corruption within local and national policing departments.The second audio memory was two hours later, when I emerged from the subterranean parking at Century City (Los Angeles). My radio was muted by a weak or non-existent signal on its preset digital to a local NPR (National Public Radio) station as I drove around and up the structure to exit. At the moment that sunshine slapped my windshield at street level, the radio was clearly tuned into an NPR commentator mentioning Mexico's frustration with police corruption in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico with specific reference to Mexican President Vicente Fox's declaration of a "war without mercy" against drug trafficking. We all know the latter as fact five years before this movie. But, somehow, TRAFFIC cuts though the politics of politics and denial, and provides an easy path to a clearer vision of the drug addiction problem in the United States and a solution that goes beyond police effort against the local seller or user.The supply-and-demand curve must be attacked with aggression, but not from a supply side perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the hype is true -- "Traffic" is a dazzling film, one of the very best of 2000. Director Steven Soderbergh has created a big, ambitious movie that in its style and storytelling brings to mind such classics as "The Godfather," "GoodFellas," "Pulp Fiction," and "Boogie Nights." Three stories all related to the United States' futile war on drugs are intricately interwoven and allow a superb cast (as well as a number of real life politicos playing themselves) to shine, particularly Benecio Del Toro and Michael Douglas. Del Toro is getting all the Oscar buzz for the film -- and he is terrific -- but I was amazed by Douglas' understated, sympathetic drug czar. It is one of his finest performances and one of the many reasons to see this timely, smart, and genuinely thrilling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm actually a really open minded person with movies. I've taken appreciation of film classes and love the use of camera angle and color. My safest comment I could make about this movie is I need to see it again. Other than that the movie was wholly depressing! I walked out of there needing to see a happy-fun movie like the portrayed addicts of the movie needed a hit or a drink.One problem was I walked into this movie thinking ?action movie' from what I'd seen of the trailers. Wrongo! It is an extremely in-depth view of the drug world, and a reminder of the every day addictions we take for granted. And BEWARE of the ?Blair Witch' camera movement this movie provides, for anyone that gets motion sickness. My girlfriend nearly had to walk out in the middle of the movie due to sickness, and I had a cute little headache myself. But, I did not think this movie was bad. In fact, it was a great reminder to the American public of addictions and how far they do and can go. But I do not suggest this movie to anyone `going out for the night' to see a movie unless they are prepared for a thought-provoking, and yes down right depressing view of a society addicted to drugs. My after thought of the movie can only be described as ?white-noise', because coherent thoughts about the movie are nil and when I try to think about it all I get is a TV with snow on it. I need to see it again.In my own classification of movies, I would not call this a ?theater quality' movie. It would be better rented and watched twice over the course of a couple days.</fullReview>

The plots involving the black and Mexican cops in America, who are assigned to protect the head witness works... the plot involving the judge with the addict daughter works... but the Mexican cops who are double and even triple crossing each other and everyone else totally lost me. i watched the movie and still couldn't tell you the outcome or conclusion of that part of the movie. All that said, I enjoyed the movie I found it refreshing to see a movie about the long drawn out genre of cops, drugs, dealers and the legal world dealt with somewhat successfully in one movie. The way in which each "world" was shown left you with no uncertainty which plot of the film you were involved in at any one time and you did actually feel like you were there with the characters. Excellent acting from a mixture of mature and fresh-faced actors gave the movie interesting layers and added to the diversity from one plot to another. I advise you to watch it. it is an interesting movie. And if nothing else you may be able to tell me what was going on with the Mexican plot.Hotty.</fullReview>

One of the main problems I had with this movie was it's lack of character development. As I was watching I found it hard to care what happened to any of the characters and after awhile I started to lose interest in the story in general. I think the film would have been much better had it focused on maybe one of the story lines in the film. I also felt that the subject matter, although, somewhat interesting might have been more relevant in the early 90s or late 80s. I think everyone at this point is well aware that the so called "War on Drugs" is a waste of time and money. Over all a good movie worth seeing but it wasn't anywhere near the level of "Out of Sight" and definitely does not deserve a best picture nod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, this is not a bad movie at all. But I've seen it in many rating lists as best movie of the year, and taking that into account it has to be measured against somewhat higher standards and - at least for me - fails to come up to them.True, the movie plays with the imagery, different colors for the different locations and the overall look of the movie is not the standard Hollywood boredom we are so fed up with. But is that really all it takes to give a movie an "independent" movie character?The development of the characters and their decisions to change their directions would be a nice parallel, if each of the turns wasn't so stereotype. The cold-blooded politician (Michael Douglas) turning back to his family life, giving it a higher value than his career suddenly; the decorative wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who discovers her intelligence and talents to become a successful criminal; the straight cop (Benicio Del Toro), who uses his knowledge about a criminal organisation to follow his own philosophy of drug abuse prevention by getting the american police to finance a baseball stadium for kids (!). It sounds as if it could be meant ironic, but I am not so sure, that that is really Soderbergh's intention. He cannot be really serious about "the daughter's" (Erika Christensen) renunciation of drug's with the help of her parents and a self-help group, though. If this is not a joke, the movie is just too ridiculous.It must be noted that the performance of the actors is remarkable, especially Benicio Del Toro and Erika Christensen, who succeeds in not looking silly in a few scenes which could have easily been such (the drug taking and "turkey" scenes), deserve to be mentioned.Altogether a poignant narration, without the need for drastic effects, that still remains to be a totally american movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be thrown into....Traffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It just kept going and going and going. Two and a half hours of some of the most boring, disjointed, detached film footage I have ever seen. Sort of like cops but without the drama. From the trailers you would think that it was an action movie. Very misleading. Less action than a lawn bowling tournament. (Spoiler) near the end when Douglas falters during his speech I was honestly thinking "Wow, even he's board with it". I would have fallen asleep but I was afraid that my snoring would wake others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a stew into which an entire pantry of ingredients has been dumped, each carefully measured against each other, resulting in a mush with no identifiable taste. Benicio Del Toro is outstanding; even the over-the-top mixture of film format and technique makes an impression. Blemished with more than enough contrivances and a cloying refusal to get close to some kind of issue, the characters and any ideology they may have championed languish together, entangled, like a box of beautiful but useless left socks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wouldn't have gotten too much notice in a better film year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping that this film would turn out to be a masterpiece because I watched some of it being done in the building I work in here in Columbus. However, I would have to give it just a 7 out of 10. It says a lot about the poor film output year of 2000 that many seem to think that "Traffic" is so outstanding.I have no problems with the techniques that were used. It's the believability factor that is lacking. A film of this type must rank very high in that factor, but several aspects had me cringing. One was the treatment of the DEA agents -- I cannot believe that even an agency as questionable as theirs would be so inept. Second was the Judge and his family -- I just couldn't accept him being in his position and his daughter being so plainly stupid.Perhaps this film tried to bite off way too much. The drug issue has many angles, far too many for one film (that is also supposed to be entertaining). There was one good story for a better film in there; maybe someone will pick it out and try again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is the type of movie I usually wait to see on video release, but decided to see what all the hoopla was about since it received several Golden Globe nominations. According to this film, 68 million kids are among the end-users of drugs smuggled into the United States. Our "war" on drugs is seemingly futile as long as there is a market for them. And the profit margin from the sale of drugs is so high that we as a nation do not have enough money to throw at the problem. We simply can't compete. The best part of the movie is that it shows how unglamorous drug use really is. If I had teens, I would run, not walk, with them to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drugs are bad. That's the message of Traffic, a new movie by Steven Soderbergh. From Washington, DC to the ritzy suburbs of San Diego, from Guadalajara to the Cincinnati suburbs, as the tagline says: `No one gets away clean.'The wonderful part of Traffic is that the viewer gets to weave in and out of all of the varied storylines, like a Porsche through rush hour. Some of the characters never meet, some just miss each other in Traffic intersections and some go crashing into other plots.It's an adult film, mainly because there's a lot going on, and it's hard to keep track of the characters and their motivations. Many of the scenes in Mexico are subtitled (and they're all tinted yellow). And, Traffic is 2 hours and 27 minutes long. Don't go if you can't sit still for anything more intense than an Adam Sandler flick.Those who do pay attention are rewarded with an intricately crafted story thanks to writer Stephen Gaghan and editing Stephen Mirrione. The acting is fabulous, starting and ending with Benecio Del Toro as the Mexican cop who's good, or is he? Catherine Zeta Jones and Erika Christensen are strong as women whose lives are driven by drugs in very different ways.Traffic is rated R for pervasive drug content, strong language, violence and some sexuality. I remember when a major politician blasted the movie Trainspotting, saying it glorified drug use. I think, despite the ultimate message, that hard drugs looked a lot more attractive in Traffic. I didn't like that, especially since that story line preyed on the fears of every parent. Traffic earns three and a half stars on my scale, 0-5. It's a crowded stretch of road filled with high octane story telling and full throttle cameos. And while the production is high, the message brings me down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why all the fuss about this movie? Okay, it was well-made and well-acted, and it delivered a "message" that a lot of people are still stupid enough to have missed. But really, two-plus hours of this to tell us that the Drug War is bad? And that it's bad because it's unwinnable (the standard wisdom now about Vietnam), as opposed to being bad because it's no one's business what drugs you take? How far behind the curve can Hollywood be? Then there's the covert racism. I've been to Tijuana, and it doesn't have the sickly sepia tone that Sonderbergh insists on filming it and the rest of the Mexico scenes in, making the country look like some kind of bizarre third-world hellhole. And of course, you know your precious blonde daughter has hit bottom when she has to have sex with a young black man in order to score some drugs: White people, beware!Rent it if you must see it, but don't spend the $8.50 - $10.00 they're charging at the theater these days.

		<shortDescription>Very well done, with exceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a pretty good knowledge as far as drug investigations go, being that I worked undercover for 3 years. Movies have become somewhat of a hobby for me. This movie had some very unrealistic views of how investigations are done, but still made a very definite point. There is a war going on out there and families have become the victim. Normally, I would not give a very good rating to a movie that had shaky camera work and subtitles throughout, probably, 50 percent of the film. In this case, I will have to forego my normal opinions and give this movie a good rating, as far as movies go. The subtitles and shaky camera work seemed to enhance the effects on my visual stimuli. This is my opinion only, but I feel that because the shaky effect and bad lighting made me squint more, I had to concentrate more to catch all of the visual effects. I, by no means, am an expert on lighting effects, but this seemed to keep my attention. I believe that if a film can get you involved in the movie, somehow, it will succeed in the Box Office. This is why I think movies like the low budgeted Blair Witch Project and the high budgeted Sixth Sense, did so well at the theaters. I don't think that it was an accident that the theaters were so cold during the sixth sense. I think this was a way of getting the audience involved. I do believe Blair Witch was merely an accident. Overall, Traffic, was a good movie and the acting met up to the call.</fullReview>

It is a shame that Traffic will get all the hype, while Requiem will be written off as another indie overkill (or so it has been by many critics), so I encourage everybody who liked Traffic oh so much, to give Requiem for a Dream a shot, and then reevaluate whether or not it really is the best drug movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't say this very much but this movie was perfect. Its hard to explain but when I left the theatre I was shocked. The movie goes on with three different stories that are all done in a different special way. You would expect that the three stories come together for some kind of final story. Well thats not the case. When the movie starts the three stories are already started and at the end of the movie none of them are finished. The feeling I got from this movie was amazing! The camera shakes a little instead of being completely steady which starts out to be annoying but after a while you forget about it and it makes you feel like your in the movie more. There is basicly three plots but they are not in depth at all. The characters never have there moments and nothing is as you'd expect. Put all of this together and you'll notice that everything just happens and there really is no plot. That sucks you might think. Well its perfect. Its too hard to explain.

The Mexican portions were exceptional and are probably the film's most impressive elements, but Michael Douglas playing the utterly impotent "Drug Czar" was unbelievable and that whole portion of the film could have been left out. It was like we had this excellent film and they spliced in sections of a Turner Television Movie of the Week. I can't take seriously the image of a Judge and a senior government official wandering through the poorest section of town asking drug dealers where his daughter is. Would the Secretary of State do this? Maybe if he is Joe Acountant I could see him doing this alone and desperate but Douglas' actions are not those of a man in power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will get my gripes out of the way first though. The movie really should have been made in widescreen and Soderbergh's direction did kind of annoy me. For someone I previously though was cool he resorted to TV commercial directorial style and Jerry Bruckhiemer editing techniques in way too many scenes.Sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't. But there was so much going on the film that I was distracted from this for most of the running time. For a film that lasted 147 minutes I felt that it was very fast-paced and time just seemed to disappear.And any film in which Benicio Del Toro DOESN'T die is automatically worthy of my praise. Michael Douglas's character was displayed as being a man of power but power is the one thing he did not exude in the film. Turning into a mild vigilante and not really impressing me with his new drug enforcement policies was a bit of a let down. But he was hardly in it much anyways. It would have been worth it if he gave that rich kid's ass a royal kicking. But he didn't. I so much wanted to see that. I thought the plots about Del Toro's dedicated cop, Douglas's daughter and Miguel Ferrer to be the best moments in the film. It was wise to cast interesting and likable actors in these roles as wanting to see more of them makes the film go faster. Before I saw this I wasn't much of a fan of Don Cheadle either. Most of his movies (Family Man, Out of Sight, Boogie Nights) really annoyed me and so did he. But he was very good here as a DEA Agent. Playing a tough guy character without being bullheaded and irritating is pretty hard. But he seemed to pull it off with great ease.This film gets a definite 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked one of the movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is, the one that took place in Mexico. Who was the actor whoplayed General Salazar! That was one of the most physical andstrange performances I've ever seen. Del Toro and the actor whoplayed Manolo were wonderful as cop buddies. The Mexican movie was fast paced, never tried to grab atsentimentality and forced one to keep up with the story and stayalert. It worked for me and I saw real craftsmanship all the waythrough. The San Diego movie lacked a sense of place, a sense ofurgency and a strong enough actress to make the story believable.I thought that Catherine Zeta Jones was way out of her leaguehere. Of course, she didn't have much help. The writing in the SanDiego movie was ridiculous and the only ones who seemed to beable to make it work were the cops with witness (Don Cheadlewas very good,) but even that element wasn't all it could havebeen. Dennis Quaid was out and out awful in this film. The closingscene where Cheadle kind of gets his revenge goes absolutelynowhere and I have no idea why it was left in the movie except tomaybe let us know that Cheadles character was still trying. Butthat's another thing. It takes Soderberg about two hours to defineCheadles character when he has the witness guy go into a monoabout what motivates Cheadles character. I spent the previous twohours wondering if these guys were good cops, buffoons, caredabout each other or themselves. The Cinncinatti/Washington movie was almost as bad, but it wassaved by some interesting filmaking. The characters were weakand the situations they were placed in were almost silly. The drugczar of the United States busts into a private school and drags astudent off by the collar. A drug dealer holds a gun to the head ofthe Drug Czar of the United States and teaches him a little lessonabout who really has the power here. Okay. I think this is the major problem with this movie. Undefinedcharacters who move through the movie and are well photographed and are appealing, but one is never moved by them. I didn't feel for Catherine Zeta Jones when her son wasthreatened. My heart didn't ache for Michael Douglas when hefound his daughter doing drugs in the bathroom. I didn't feel hisanger and frustration when he said, "I can't do this..." at the pressconference. Even in the Mexican movie, I felt little for Manolo's brideas she worried about her missing husband, or her pain when hedied. The only actor who really drew any emotion out of me as aviewer was Toro, who I felt was given a chance shine. But let's faceit, he didn't have to say too many of these lines. Other than that, theonly one I felt for was the kid who played the boyfriend of MichaelDouglas' daughter. I wanted to strangle him. But that might havemore to do with the fact that I really hate him on that Fox show. All in all, a very ambitious attempt and some beautiful filmaking,but there is no substitute for a strong, believable storyline andlines that a decent actor can be expected to be able to deliver. Anddon't have the drug czar of the United States turn into a vigilante.That is just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great performances across the board, confident and striking direction and a wide-ranging but accessible script all helped to shape this film into the best movie I've seen in a long time.In spite of the two and a half hour length, by the time the directors credit appeared at the end I would have happily sat through another couple of hours to see what happened to each character after their final scenes.I'm delighted Soderbergh didn't feel pressurised into cutting the film down to a more multiplex-friendly running time. Every single scene was critical either to the plot, the film's emotional impact or (most often) both.This film is yet another indication (like The Insider before it) that mainstream cinema is once again prepared not only to begin tackling big issues like drugs without resorting to blockbuster explosions, but to do it in original and compelling style. Directors like Soderbergh are finally being given the reins, and every cinemagoer out there stands to benefit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the movie shows the futility of the present War On Drugs. And no, it doesn't make a great movie; it doesn't even make a good movie. Douglas' performance is wooden and his character is totally redundant to the story. His role could have been replaced by a 'voice-over.' The director's use of choppy camera work to achieve reality only serves to provide choppy camera work. The color changes from sepia to bad color make it look like an experiment in filming in color. The script approaches being pathetic and the plot line is totally contrived. Overall, after being a movie buff for more years than I care to remember, this is at least in the worst five movies I've ever seen. I forget which movie mogul said, "If I want a message, I'll call Western Union." The director should have paid closer attention to his predecessors. (I should add, in leaving the theatre, most comments I heard from the audience were very negative and several people left prior to the ending.)</fullReview>

Yes, it focuses on one of the most serious issues that the U.S. society faces today, and it tries to address the reality of supply-demand of drugs that exists in all levels of society. Ok, fine, but the story is drawn out way too long, CZJ only spoke less than a dozen lines, not an Oscar performance. M. Douglas is ok here, but not one of his better films. As for Erika doing the drug stuff, its ok, but again, annoyed the hell out of me, trying to say some one who does so well in school is a chronic drug offender is pushing it a bit far, reminded me of MTV's "RealWorld"... hardly real. The whole Self-Help-Anonymous sessions seems to say to me that America is full of weak-willed people who can't help themselves, whether drugs, alcohol, etc. YEA right, if that is the case then this country deserves to fall apart? but I beg to differ. I kept looking at my watch thinking when is it going to be over, because the pace is slow, hardly involving. The best film of 2000 is co-owned by `Gladiator' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I first about traffic i was quite skeptical. It was not until a read review upon review each giving it praise. So i finally had to see what they where talking about. To i went and downloaded the trailer. It looked great. It was something i had to see. It had a all star cast and was about an issue that is gripping this country now. Not something that happened 1000s of years ago. The first thing that struck me was the actors. While in the cinema waiting for the movie to begin. I was confronted with some poor trailers. So i waited impatiently. Then the movie began. I expected a big blow out intro. Instead i received a little "Traffic" in the corner of the screen. From then on i was grabed. The movie got straight down to business. during the next 2hrs i was introduced into the drug society. I was given an in site as to how drugs are brought over to this country. I was amazed. I knew the basic. But after seeing this movie i was surprised as to how the screenwriter could have known about all of this. Some of the thoughts in this movie are frieghtining. It shows what life is really like. The characters where well introduced. Michael Douglas gave an oscar winning performance. He showed the grief of a freightened parent and husband. He was able to protray the role as it should have been done. I left this cinema hoping and praying that this epic would win. There was a only one subject that this movie did not prosper in. That was music. But come to think of it this movie evolved from converstation in the movie. Music during these scenes would have made it hard to comprehend on whats going on. Catherine Zeta Jones played a reasonable role as a mother and wife, protecting her child. Don Cheadle was just plain fun. He didn't have a major dramatic role in the movie. What he did show was his capability to be serious. Given the chance he could have blown us away. Well the one person we have to thank for this great movie would have to be Stephen Sonnefeld. He was defiantly robed for a golden globe on award night. In my personal opinon the best actor in the movie was Beninco Del Toro. He gave riviting performance of a Mexican cop surrouned by corrupt officers. He shows how easy it is for even your best friend to betray you. He has future in acting. This movie had alittle of every thing. It contained action, drama, and even a little comedy. Every critic review i have read gave it rave reviews. The next movie i can't wait to see is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Directed by Ang Lee this is going to show life from a different perspective. One message portrayed in this classic is that one that give you drugs is not your friend. I recommend this movie to parents. Directing them not to push there child away but to interact more. Be able to know where your is at night. And with who doing what. Don't be the one that just puts roof over their head and gives them money. Be closer then that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Soderburgh is definitely one of the best, if not the best director out there. How many director can pull of four excellent films in a row (Out of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brokovich, and now Traffic)? Traffic is an achievement from beginning to end, and shows the power that film can have.Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Del Toro, Cheadle, and the other cast members give the performances of a lifetime. Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance is particularly riveting, a testament to her underrated abilities. Douglas is utterly convincing as a man struck down by the irony that he is leading the war on drugs but can't even win a battle at home. Benicio Del Toro controls the screen as a torn Mexican cop. Don Cheadle delivers, as always.Traffic is considered by many to be three films crafted into one. Yes, that is true, but each part indirectly depends on the other. Soderburgh uses a different color for each of the stories, an effect that helps delineate between the separate plots. Each plot is affected indirectly by the others, yet each plot manages to maintain it's own identity. Surprisingly each story manages to reach you on an emotional level as well, we feel for those on both sides of the law, good or evil.Traffic, besides being thoroughly engrossing, has a message, and what that message is can only be determined by the viewer, because believe you me, there are several.Soderburgh has done it again, and will probably continue to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies like Traffic are few and far between. A movie that grabs your attention and forces you to watch it. This isn't a movie to see in a case where you are looking for laughs. For laughs, go down the hall to Miss Congeniality. Anyway, it is a drama that is gripping, intelligent, and smart. It is based on the British mini-series Traffik written by Simon Moore. Stephen Gaghan writes the screenplay for Traffic and it won him a Golden Globe. The plot is a little complicated. There are about three different stories going on at the same time. One of the plots involves a Mexican police officer, Del Toro. He is working against a Tijuana drug cartel. These sections are in Spanish and that adds to the authenticity of the movie. The next plot involves Michael Douglas. His character is a speaker against drugs. But the irony of it all is his daughter, Christensen, is a cocaine addict. She will do anything, and I mean anything for drugs. The next one is about Catherine Zeta-Jones' husband who has been arrested for drugs. Two cops, Cheadle and Guzmán, think she might be involved, so they follow her around. The movie isn't as complicated as it sounds. You can tell what story is taking place by the color tone. The Del Toro scenes are orange-ish. The Douglas scenes have a blue tint, and Zeta-Jones' is regular. The drama and suspense build as the movie progresses. The performances are great. Del Toro won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor, a well-deserved win. There is every sign of a great drama: Good plot structure, good performances, and, most importantly, it is interesting. The movie shows all the bad things about drugs. It leaves in all of the ugliness of them. Because, in life, there is nothing pretty about drugs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that everyone says the really liked just because they don't want to be un-cool. It's well made and disturbing in it's depictions. It's well done but overblown, the 2 1/2 hr running time could've been trimmed by at least 40 minutes....that being said they are a few very good acting jobs here including Don Cheadle, Benicio del Torro, and the sublime Michael Douglas. If you're a fan of Subtle nuances and acting this is a good flick to watch, just don't make other plans for the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. Motion Picture of the Year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it, and I'm completely blown away. Movies like this are so very rare... and wonderful. It impacted me as much as Thin Red Line, Il Postino, and Life is Beautiful. The acting was brilliant, the characters completely believable, even those played by actresses that have not shone so brightly previously. Had there been a "based on a true story" line, I'd believe it, and not just because I live in San Diego. I loved how the film used lighting, the blue and the yellow to represent not only location but also the two realities portrayed. I won't delve further because I don't wish to spoil it for anyone. I don't know what else to say other than I sincerely recommend this film and hope to see Steven Soderbergh get an Oscar for Best Director and for Cinematographer, and Benicio Del Toro for Best Supporting Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic was a top-notch crime drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many who have reviewed this film have listed it as the all time worst film they've seen. But that distinction belongs to 8mm.Traffic was a riveting movie. Entertaining, to be sure, but real enough to strike another nerve that leaves you thinking.It's a trio of stories, each with its own heroes and villains. And as the picture moves along, the stories begin to intersect, and you see how all of the protagonists affect each other.Catherine Zeta-Jones is wife to a man who is a major narcotics dealer. But she has no idea whatsoever until he's arrested as the result of an undercover sting. At first she is appalled, but she soon becomes desperate to keep living the life style that she's become accustomed to.Benicio Del Toro plays Javier, a cop in Tiajuana. He's just an average guy who, like most cops in Mexico, views police work as an entrepreneurial venture (according to the film). He is approached by General Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian). The general lets him know that there is plenty of money to be made if Javier is willing to do the right things. Salazar is interested in finding a man who contributed to, or committed murders of Salazar's men. But he may have other motives as well.And finally, Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield who's a special appointee of the President to lead the war on drugs in the U.S. Slowly, as Wakefield sets about this task, he finds out that the war he's looking to win has to be waged in his own home as his daughter sinks into a world of free-basing and heroine.I found this element to be the most real. The plight of the young girl, played by Erika Christiensen, seemed to be lifted right out the local papers here. Last year, a young girl from a very well-off family told her story about lying to her parents to hide her drug use. She wrote about traveling to the worst neighborhoods in the inner city, driven by need for drugs in spite of fear. And then eventually, doing whatever she had to do to get those drugs. You will see that chillingly portrayed in Traffic. You find yourself thinking "How can these kids not know any better?"This was an interesting and entertaining film. Even for someone like me who's seen so many movies that it's hard not to think "this movie is like such-and-such movie". 3.5 out of 4.0 stars...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very decent film, but not quite good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**WARNING - LITTLE BIT OF SPOILER MATERIAL - DO NOT READ, UNLESS YOU SAW THE FILM**I'd like to shortly comment on this, because of what I thought was not quite finished. I think that this film makes a point, and gives us great understanding of how big of an effect drugs have on a human being. In addition, the film outlines what happened in the Tijuana cartel, which is very thought out and is well written, however, - the only part I thought needed more, and supposed to be the number one backbone to the film is the actual resolution that had to take place in the USA. First, Douglas' role had to be written more thoroughly. Secondly, what does eventually this film accomplish? I just want to understand Soderbergh's idea for the film - which seems to me that - drugs is a problem that cannot be prevented, and as a result, we should not try to fight it because we cannot win. The reason I say it is because of the moment when Douglas comes to the drug addict, and asks him where his daughter is, and the addict sticks out a gun in his face. Douglas does not have any power at that moment, or at any moment in the film following this scene. This is also outlined in the end, when he cannot give the press conference speech, because he knows that he cannot fight the war against drugs. This was the main problem with the film, otherwise the film is fantastically made, and I don't want to go into the detail on how it is made, because there are fantastic reviews already. Think about the purpose of the film. I do not think the film accomplishes the task it was supposed to accomplish, and I think it the issue should have been substantially researched further, Drug Czar's role re-written, and the U.S. part re-shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Traffic" is NOT the solution. You are!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only wanted to review this film because I felt that so many people I've heard talk about the movie dismissed it as an anti-drug war film. I thought "Traffic" did an amazing job at NOT taking a side and allowing the audience to decide what it thinks about the subject. It presented a story--a very credible one in which it shows the United States losing badly to the drug trade with Mexico--and it walks away leaving you to decide what to think and do about it.The problem with so many audiences today is that they want to be told what to think. In my humblest opinion, the mainstream wants to be hit over the head with a message and when it doesn't get one, it will invent one where one doesn't exist. I actually heard someone in an elevator the other day say, "Don't see 'Traffic'. All it says is, 'We're losing the drug war and we're not going to win it so why even bother?'" This is NOT what 'Traffic' is about. I also had a friend tell me one of the movie's points was, "Once drugs make their way into our family's homes, there's nothing that can be done." WHAT!!??? I assure you, "Traffic" does NOT make this point either.I think the line in the film that negates those views comes at the end when Michael Douglas' character tells his daughter's support group that he is there "to listen." The movie definitely makes the point that our current campaign against drugs is a miserable failure. That leaves two options if you believe this. One is to quit the war on drugs, legalize everything and hang on for dear life. Or the other is to talk to these people who are creating this overwhelming demand, find out what personal and societal problems cause them to become addicts and try a more tolerant, empathetic, educational approach (see the Netherlands and their statistics on drug addicts and crime). The current strategy by the United States of thinking that blindly arresting drug lords will wipe out a major supply when all it does is create a new drug lord is obviously not working.I think THOSE are the things "Traffic" wants the audience to think over and to talk about afterward. It does not go into the solution whatsoever (which again is why I think so many were disappointed). But I found it to be an outstanding film for that very reason. Hopefully it will create better dialog on this sensitive subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the Best Film of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to the movies this weekend hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed at another movie from 2000 that I was looking forward to. For once, the movie didn't disappoint. "Traffic" is excellent is every way - all the performances are great(although one minor quibble was the on again off again accent of Zeta-Jones when she visits her husband in jail). Douglas does a great job yet again, I hope he get nominated for either this or "Wonder Boys." Benico Del Toro should get best supporting actor - he was fantastic. Each of the stories interlink with one another as pieces to the whole pie and never do you become uninterested. The film doesn't offer much in the form of a solution, but expresses some of the gritty realities that no other film to my knowledge has done with such excellence. In an otherwise lousy year for movies (how annoyingly disappointing were Gladiator, Cast Away and Perfect Storm?), this film lived up to my expectations. As an FYI here are my top picks for 2000 1. Traffic 2. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 3. Unbreakable 4. Wonder Boys --- I can't praise "Traffic" enough. Go see it. 10 out of 10. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Exactly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite the pro-legalization and pro-treatment piece so many of the reviews take it for. Watch what it does, not what its characters say.The free market argument that demand inevitably creates supply is made by the two least appealing characters in the picture -- Ed Ruiz, the dealer turned informant trying to save himself, and Seth, the preppie smart ass. One other character doesn't discuss the idea but simply lives it. Once Helena Ayala finds out how her husband actually makes his money, she doesn't have a single thought about anything except hanging on to her life of wealth by picking up the threads of his business -- by any means necessary. She's playing the same tough, gallant widow woman role that Sally Field played in Places In The Heart, but it ain't the family cotton farm she's trying to hang on to. She doesn't care. Poverty is the only sin, and she'll never be poor again.On the other side, the only two people in the movie with both honor and understanding are the Mexican cop, Javi Rodriguez, and the American DEA man, Montel Gordon. Speech isn't these guys' language. They can't explain why they do what they do. They know they are trying to shovel back the ocean with a pitchfork. But they keep trying, because they despise the people they chase and want to see at least a few of them suffer for their greed and arrogance. Something they can't articulate tells them that people who knowingly prey on human weakness by selling poison to fools deserve to be humiliated and crushed.Caroline Wakefield is the exemplary fool. Her fast track degradation as rich white girl seduced by a smooth talking cynic who winds up selling her body to a black dealer-pimp for drugs is right out of D.W. Griffith's Broken Blossoms, by way of Reefer Madness. She's every middle class parent's cliché nightmare about drugs and sex among their teenage children. But she isn't simply seduced. For reasons not explained, she wants to lose herself. At every stage of her descent she reaches out eagerly for the next new drug, and the next new high. She's willing to pay with sex because as long as she's high, none of it matters. The key to her character is the flat, stoned, affectless "Okay," with which she receives Seth's offer to have sex and take a hit at the moment of orgasm. She's just as zonked when Daddy finally shows up to rescue her.Soderbergh gives us no sustained character who exemplifies treatment. The dialogue pays lip service to demand reduction, but the few glimpses we get of social workers, twelve step programs, and rehab meetings in church auditoriums lack faith and power. Nobody with the intensity of Rodriguez or Gordon is shown trying to save people like Caroline Wakefield from themselves. As on Judge Wakefield's flight back from his dog and pony show at the border, there's no one from the treatment side on the plane.In this day and age, none of the characters have an argument to answer the combination of free market capitalism and hedonistic individualism spouted by Eddie and Seth. But we're set up to despise both of them, because they both accept the self-destruction of Caroline and other customers as just one of those things, and they're both willing to profit from it as it happens. Eddie is in it for the money. Seth doesn't feel the need for money, but he has a 16 year old boy's willingness to get the customer hooked just for sex -- and for the sense of his own power to get away with it. The two honest cops on the other side aren't naive. They've seen it all, but they're still idealists in spite of it all. Their open eyed idealism about their hopeless, self-imposed task makes them the most attractive characters in the movie. You want them to wipe the smirk off somebody's face, whether it does any good or not.Traffic accepts the futility of law enforcement, but it won't say that those who violate the law are just businessmen filling a need who should be left alone to do it. The Hollywood coda of the San Diego story is meant to reassure us that the bad guys will someday suffer their just deserts. The slick defense lawyer gets what's coming to him, and we are promised that the Ayalas haven't gotten away scot free either. That only makes dramatic sense if they deserve to be caught and punished because the drug traffic is not only illegal but immoral. A straight brief for legalization wouldn't have that premise. Even so, it isn't consistent with the general sense of hopelessness that has come before. Soderbergh doesn't think the cops can win (who does), but he's rooting for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I was entertained by this movie. It had a good message and many of the performances were brilliant. But there were a few things that bothered me about it.I felt the characters were way too carefully scripted. It seemed that every character had their own unique perspective on the drug trade. It's like, I don't want the drug lackey to have to tell me that "We're both working for drug lords." Show me. And I don't want the snotty drug addict kid (played brilliantly by Topher Grace from "That 70's Show") to have to tell me why black people sell drugs. Show me.With that said, I really did enjoy the movie. The stylistic film choices were quite well done. Whenever we are in Tijuana, the film is tinted yellow and grainy. When in Washington, everything is in shades of blue. I liked it.And if Benicio Del Toro doesn't get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, I'm going to scream.</fullReview>

I gave it 7/10. It's a quality and worthy piece of work; they clearly aimed high.

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is one of the best movies that I've seen in quite a while. Directed by Steven Soderbergh ("Erin Brockovich"), this is a movie that takes a look at the U.S. drug war and does it brilliantly. Three separate stories about this subject are told here in "Traffic". One of the stories has Michael Douglas as an Ohio judge who becomes the nation's new drug czar. Then one day finds out to his shocking surprise that his honor student daughter (newcomer Erika Christensen) is a drug addict. Another story takes us to Mexico and follows two drug enforcement cops (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas). The third story takes place in San Diego, where a middleman (Miguel Ferrer from "Robocop") imports and distributes drugs, and two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Lius Guzman) who are on his trail. And we meet the top executive for this operation, a respectable millionaire (Steven Bauer) and his socialite wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has no idea where her money comes from. These three stories intervene throughout "Traffic" and the film moves at a brisk pace. The thing that amazed me about this movie is how it held my attention from beginning to end. I also liked the way director Soderbergh photographed this film (he did his own photography here under a pseudonym). When the film is in the U.S. it looks normal. But when the movie takes us south of the border into Mexico, the camera has kind of a yellowish grungy look. I thought that was real interesting. There are great performances by the big cast. Douglas is good as usual; Christensen is a terrific newcomer; Cheadle and Guzman are amusing; but the best performances are turned in by Del Toro (who says most of his dialogue in Spanish) and Zeta-Jones. Expect "Traffic" to be a major Oscar contender.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trusting the Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We tend to trust a filmmaker who has a strong point of view. Many times that trust is misplaced. Oliver Stone created a stir with his `JFK' premise that everyone killed John F. Kennedy EXCEPT Lee Harvey Oswald--until the American public stepped back and realized how much the writer/director had misrepresented history. `Elizabeth' was critically acclaimed until an article in `The Washington Post' showed how historically inaccurate it was. And `Hurricane' was battered-and perhaps star Denzel Washington lost the Academy Award for best actor--when critics began to point out its inaccuracies.The fact is that few people have the time or knowledge to challenge the accuracy of what's being portrayed on the screen. Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's `Traffic.' Soderbergh marshals some statistics about how the money spend in transporting drugs far outstrips the amount being spent on stopping the flow of narcotics into this country, and shows the political posturing of the American government and the corruption of the Mexican government. He also does a bit of preaching: A scene in which Michael Douglas and Amy Irving blame each other for their daughter's drug use makes the familiar argument that there are all sorts of narcotics out there. His conclusion is that the situation is continuing to get worse, and the war is unwinnable. Soderbergh may be right about all this-we just have to trust him. But what if things are getting better?Aside from that caution, this is a good if not film. Soderbergh does several fine things. First of all, his structure involves three separate stories that interlink at points, but not always. Secondly, he does an interesting thing with lighting. He films scenes in Mexico in a washed out tone, creating a feeling of both desolation and dread. Finally, he assembles an outstanding cast. Michael Douglas and real-life wife Catherine Zeta-Jones-though they never appear on screen together-head the list of Academy Award possibles. So does Benicio Del Toro as a decent Mexican cop. His role is almost entirely in "Mexican" Spanish, a dialect he had to learn for the movie. Don Cheadle turns in another strong performance, as does Miguel Ferrer, who might finally gain some recognition from this film as a great character actor.Soderbergh does trip up at one point. An attempt(s) to take out Ferrer portrays the DEA as being unable to perform the most basic type of security. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnolia + Drug War = TRAFFIC (Best movie of 2001)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Magnolia, and this movie was really Magnolia but revolving around the drug war. Magnolia may have also had better camera direction, but the acting and script for both movies were better then great. But why compare these two movies, lets talk about TRAFFIC.The film had a documentary type feel with the camera never staying still. Also each story was told in different tints and colors which helped you figure out where you where and who's story you were watching. The performances were dead on with no one doing a bad job. Michael Douglas did awesome, and nods to Erika Christensen.The interesting part about it is that TRAFFIC doesn't pretend to have answers. There are explanations why things are the way they are, but no real solutions. TRAFFIC focuses on human tragedy on different levels, in different ways. This movie is far from perfect. Most of the storylines loosely interlace, while others are very involved. It seems like they tried but couldn't connect them all fully. The production was great but no Magnolia, but hey, what is...Don't see this movie if you think 227 minutes is too long for a movie, because it just might be. Don't see this movie if your expecting the best movie ever, because it isn't, but it just may make top of the year.Pete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 10 (even though I was thinking a 9)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of film criticism is filled with cliches, but I will submit yet one more: this film was one of the best I have seen in a long time. The plot has been covered, so there is no need for me to do that again; but what needs to be stressed, above all the good things about this film, is the quality of performance by the actors. Benicio Del Toro played a character that I will not soon forget, and his Golden Globe nomination proves that (as should his win). A pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was not only beautiful but believable in its complexity. Michael Douglas is Michael Douglas, and I think he is beginning to turn his "name brand" into something more than meaning just a solid performance. Juan Guzman and Don Cheadle are hilarious. Particularly Guzman, who, as Paul Thomas Anderson might say, was F***ing terrific. And don't forget Miguel Ferrer playing yet another nasty person (I am reminded of his character in Twin Peaks, who gets decked by Sheriff Truman and threatens a lawsuit).They all blend into an intriguing film that I could have watched for another hour or two and not felt encumbered or angered by the loss of time. Benicio Del Toro deserves an Oscar nomination, but I think most people understand that he will probably not get it. And this is a shame too. But if you have followed the Oscars over its history you understand that the award has always been a popularity contest, the award is given out to bolster the image of the film industry. Just look at all the great films and great performances that have never won and all those that have been forgotten that actually did. But I don't want this film to be forgotten. It has something to say, and it doesn't hit you over the head with it. To put this review even more briefly, and to add yet another cliche: go see this film. Notice the rating by IMD users. We do not lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Moving Traffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is an ambitious, lengthy, and often dull film that examines the effects of drug smuggling and use in the lives of three people, two involved in diminishing its availability and another unaware her livelihood comes from illegal drug trade.Call Traffic a mixture of last year's poignant, masterful emotional Magnolia and The Insider's slow but utterly effective character study. However, take away the smooth story and cinematography transitions from character to character in Magnolia and Insider's thoughtful, meaningful moments of slow movement and solitude and you get Traffic. Not to say Traffic is a bad film - it never gets preachy or goes the way of Oliver Stone and turns into a loud diatribe. What it is missing, however, is a charge of electricity that never truly gets the thrills going.What Traffic lacks in solid storytelling it makes up for in a heap of fantastic performances, most notably Benicio Del Toro's turn as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, caught between serving his personal belief on the drug war. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman also serve up two witty characters, and Miguel Ferrer's best role since 1987's Robocop as a dealer turned witness who believes the drug war is futile.That's the main message of Traffic, and again, thankfully, we are not beaten over the head with it: the war on drugs is futile and the best prevention of drug addiction comes from the support of family and friends, not from a billion dollar government project to stop drugs from entering the country and taking down drug cartels.Despite its loose, meandering, and sometimes unsuccessful interweaving storylines, Soderbergh still manages to illicit some great performances from his cast. Traffic could have benefited from some trimming, however, and some tighter, faster pacing would have guaranteed it to become not only a film with a message, but an entertaining one as well.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it was by design and maybe it wasn't but one of the best aspects of Traffic is that it doesn't preach. It does show us the potential damage hard core drugs can do to you but it never really comes out and says that drugs are bad, drugs ruin you and drugs should be forbidden. What it does instead is tell about five different stories that all inter-connect in some way or another. There is the Michael Douglas story about an Ohio judge that is appointed to head a committee on drug enforcement, and also has a daughter that is hooked on crack cocaine. Then there is the story of a wealthy business that is the biggest supplier of narcotics in So Cal and his wife. He is fingered by one of his associates when he is busted and hopes to weasle his way out of his impending prison sentence. Then there is the story of the two cops that are trying to keep the witness alive long enough to testify. Don Cheadle has an astonishing performance here and he could be nominated for an Oscar. Then there is the story of a Mexican General that is trying wipe out the drug trade in Tijuana, or so he says. Then you have the story of the other drug cartels that are trying keep their business thriving and finally you have the most intriguing story in the film and that is the one about the two Mexican State policemen that are trying to help General Salazar wipe out the drugs. Benitio Del Toro plays one of the officers and this is one of the most intriguing performances that I have ever seen, in any language. We'll get to him in a minute.Every story is given ample time to grow and develop and we are equally intrigued by each of them. Traffic is brilliant in every way. Especially intriguing is the use ( or lack thereof ) of music and the way it is photographed. There is no music in the film except when people are moving around. But never during dialogue is there any musical interludes. This gives it the feel of reality. It looks like you are watching either a documentary or like you are watching a Super Eight home video tape that one of your friends filmed. The editing is so obvious and deliberate that it looks like someone just spliced the pieces together without any care, and yet it just the opposite. Technically speaking, this is a film that goes against perhaps everything that you may learn in film school. No music, choppy editting and a grainy look to film that may put some people off. Others will appreciate what the film stands for. I am not talking about the message because frankly the message is one that we have seen before. But what this film stands for the triumph of film making. There are incredible, grandiose performances and Steven Soderberg should easily win best director this year. There is no other film out there that can come close to this one. What is also incredible about the film is some of the ideas and the writing of the thoughts behind it. It will go on to tell you that drugs are an intracal part of American society and no matter how great an effort you give to eradicate them, they will always exist. Put one drug Lord out of business and another will thrive. Don Cheadle's character actually shows his only sign of mistrust towards himself and every ideology that he ever believed in when one drug dealer tells him that his whole life is transparent because by having him testify means that one drug lord is gone but the other is waiting eagerly to break into the same market. In essence, Don Cheadle and the rest of the DEA are really working for a drug lord. Deal with that, he is told. It is one of the great moments in the film.Far and away my favourite part of the film is Benitio Del Toro, who plays Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez. We may all know him as Fenster from Usual Suspects, whose performance has given drones of loyal fans hours and hours of enjoyment by imitating his talk, his mannerisms and his whole persona. I honestly did not know if his accent was that of the one as Fenster, an American accent like the one in Way Of The Gun or if he was really as Mexican as he is in Traffic. That is how layered and brilliant this man is. I would not have understood a word he said in this film without the aid of subtitles, but I would have been just as mesmerized by him even if I didn't. Everyone that I saw this film with ( all four times ) knew that this was a performance of monumental significance when we saw Rodriguez walk into a San Diego bar and work his magic to try and pick up an assassin named Frankie Flowers. His smile is perfect, his nervous walk is brilliant and his flow during the flirtation with this man is nothing but perfection. Then we see him telling the DEA all that he knows and he is troubled. He goes through the widest spectrum of emotions in this film and we can feel every one of them with him. Del Toro is, in my opinion, the best actor working today and he should be proud of his turn here. If he does not win best supporting actor this year then the person that does should just give it to him and apologize. Traffic is the best film of the year and if anyone else tells you otherwise, don't listen to them. See it for yourself and be your own judge.10 out of 10- Will garner many Oscar nods this year and will make everyone aware that Del Toro is a special actor. I absolutely love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please award Benicio Del Toro with an Academy Award for his brilliant performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my mom on opening night, and we both loved it. A truly brilliant, gritty film and everyone in this cast is wonderful, especially Benicio Del Toro (who was also wonderful in The Usual Suspects). I hope that he wins a Golden Globe on Sunday night, and that the Academy awards him with a nomination, and even better the Oscar himself. Steven Soderburgh directs with all the stops pulled out, and the writers develop the characters at just the right moments. When you think you know what is going to happen, something else develops. All four stories are connected in some way, and the ending is gripping. I won't give anything away, just go see the film. Michael Douglas is wonderful as usual, who becomes the new drug czar while unknowingly his daughter is doing drugs right under his nose. Catherine Zeta-Jones' story involves her and her husband who is arrested for drug smuggling, and her character takes a surprising turn (no spoilers!). Hands down one of the best films of the new year. It has my vote for all the awards. Oscar should shine on this gem. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is the Pulp Fiction of the 21st century. In the Quentin Tarantino fashion, Director Steven Soderbergh, of "Erin Brokovich" and "Out of Sight" fame, tells multiple stories, weaving them together seamlessly into one amazing picture. Traffic relates the tale of Robert Wakefield - the newly appointed "Drug Czar", or the man in charge of all American Anti-Drug related activities, his daughter, Caroline Wakefield - a former 4.0 student ranked third in her class turned drug addict, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (yes, that's Rodriguez Rodriguez, it's not a typo) - the righteous Mexican cop that works to shut down the drug trade in Tijuana, Montel Gordon and Ray Castro - the team of American cops that provide comic relief while hunting down drug dealers in California, Helena Ayala - An everyday, common housewife whose husband is charged with Drug trafficking, and who eventually takes control of the family business, Eduardo Ruiz - A former drug-dealer for the Ayala Syndicate turned snitch, who just happens to be the only evidence against Carlos Ayala, General Salazar - A Mexican General out to destroy one of Mexico's two major cartels, but not for the righteous reasons he presents; The list goes on and on. What makes Traffic unique, however, is not the multiple stories, but the way in which these stories are weaved together. Soderbergh gives no single character importance over another. All of the plots in the movie are given equal importance. Also, none of the major characters, whether anti-drug, or pro-drug, are portrayed as "good" or "bad", they all are human, and thus at times can be a bit of both. Another major factor contributing to Traffic's success is its all-star cast. The film features Michael Douglas (Robert Wakefield), and Catherine Zeta-Jones (Helena Ayala), it also stars several lesser-known stars like Benicio del Toro of The Usual Suspects fame (Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez), Don Cheadle from Bulworth and Out of Sight (Montel Gordon), Luis Guzmán from Magnolia (Ray Castro), Dennis Quaid from Any Given Sunday and Frequency (Arnie Metzger - a friend the Ayala family), and Topher Grace of "That 70's Show" (Seth Abrahams - a friend of Caroline Wakefield's). The film also features several cameo appearances by Salma Hayek, five real senators, and the governor of Massachusetts. The clear stars of the movie, in terms of their acting in the movie, are Cheadle and Guzmán. The two of them are hilarious as a team of cops, and add basically the only constant comic relief throughout the movie. My favorite part of the movie though, is the small details. The movie, evenly divided into a half set in Mexico and a half in the US, uses novel techniques to provide insight as to the settings. When showing America, the picture is extremely bright, and very blurry, suggesting that America's feelings of superiority have served only to blind itself of the truth. When showing Mexico, however, the picture is dark, and the quality is extremely grains, thus implying the exact opposite. The sound is also innovative. At times, the sound is deafening. The gunshots are loud enough to make someone cover their ears. Yet other times, there's complete silence. You see events that should be loud. You see people moving their lips, yet you hear nothing. All of this serves only to heighten the immense tension. So go see Traffic. Although it's a long.long movie, it's so interesting that you wont even notice the time pass.</fullReview>

What more can I say except that I thought that "Traffic" was an even better movie? And that fact that this movie may actually be seen by some in the corridors of power (legislators will watch this movie to see their friends appear in cameos) gives me hope that the crazy War On Drugs may be reassessed by politicians.The best of 2000, along with "Requiem for a Dream".

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 2000, Soderbergh has crafted a remarkable masterpiece of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a running time of two and a half hours, Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is one of those movies that grabs you and hooks you into its world right from frame one. The film is never boring, connecting four interlocking stories, all taking place within L.A., Mexico, and Ohio, each of which are masterfully told and brought together in a remarkable resolution in the end.The first story given to us is an account of Mexican drug informant Javier Rodriguez, played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro much deserves the oscar for best supporting actor. Rodriquez is in the midst of taking down two different drug cartels in Mexico, where we learn that law enforcement is a profitable business. Javier is above all an honest man in his profession, determined only to recieve a little pay, stay alive, and do his job.Then the story moves to Ohio, where Judge Robert Wakefield, played to perfection by Michael Douglas who deserves a best actor nod, has just been appointed by the President of the United States as the new U.S. Drug Czar. Wakefield is a true crusader in his fight in the war on drugs, but his family life is near destruction when he realizes that his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is doing drugs right under his nose, which poses as a threat on his professional life.The third account is that of federal agents Gordon and Castro, played by "Boogie Nights" alumnists Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, who capture high profile drug kingpin Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer). They plan to keep Ruiz in custody and have him testify against against the DEA's principal target of the drug business, which leads directly to the fourth story.Around the same time the feds arrest Ruiz, San Diego DEA agents arrest top billionaire executive Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). His wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is completely unaware of her husbands activities, until Carlos' business associate and lawyer Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) informs her that Carlos is no a legitimate businessman, but the most wanted drug distributor in the nation. Helena is first stunned by the news, but then soon develops some criminalistic manuevers of her own in order to ensure her husband's safety from a life in jail.Traffic is without a doubt the most effective motion picture ever made about drugs and the terrible effect it has had on our government, as well as the youth of America. One distinctive aspect of the movie is the brilliant way Soderbergh switches the use of color in order to give his settings the proper look. The scenes in Ohio, are shot in dark metal like blue, while the scenes in Mexico consists of effective grainy, desaturated look, much in the same way "Three Kings" was shot. Soderbergh also puts some hand-held camera action to very good use in a number of key scenes.Traffic is an undeniable brilliant epic of a film with an effective message under its belt. It includes one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen before, and it has boosted its director, Steven Soderbergh, to movie-making stardom, in addition to directing last year's hit "Erin Brockovich", which I didn't rank as high as most critics did. Traffic I easily consider Steven Soderbergh's masterpiece, with "Out of Sight" in a close second. Hands down the best film of 2000, and it should get all the oscar nominations it can get!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that I'm not the only one disappointed by this movie. The director and screenwriter, lacking enough of their own original ideas, rip off Law &amp; Order, the Partnership for a Drug Free America commercials, ABC Afterschool Specials, Miami Vice, etc. He also sucks off Oliver Stone and Robert Altman. As one would expect from a souffle with this many ingredients, it's tasty in parts but generally falls flat. The character writing is wickedly uneven except in the case of Benecio del Toro, who was obviuously so regretful that he made Way of the Gun that he turns in the most understated star turn I've seen in a while, and overshadows the rest of the cast. With one possible exception. This is not to say that there are not strong performances here, but hey, when you cast Luis Guzman, Don Cheadle, Michael Douglas et al whaddaya expect? The script can't match the depth they try to bring their characters. The exception I'm referring to is Mrs. Zeta-Jones. Her vengeful matron evokes Glenn Close's more diaboloical roles. And it's a good role.S</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Flava Flav once said, "Don't believe the hype."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is seriously flawed and shame on so many of you for ignorantly praising it. Here are some of the problems with Traffic:1. The cinematography is NOT innovative. Soderbergh stole the color scheme from his own Out of Sight (Detroit was shot in a metallic blue), and just because he shot it all with handhelds doesn't make it 'great.' If this film gets nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, then The Blair Witch Project should've been nominated for the same award in 1999. He wasn't even consistent with how he framed some of the characters. 2. The points made in this film are made and made and made until the viewer feels beaten over the head. Much of the anti-drug dialogue felt like a third-string Dateline reporter wrote it. 3. Not enough time is spent with these characters for any of the events to matter to the audience. (SPOILER ALERT!!) And what motivation did Catherine Zeta-Jones's character have for putting a hit on the informant besides maintaining her upper-class lifestyle? We go from her not even knowing that her husband's business is legitimate to her taking control of a drug empire? Where's the transition time? The only character that I remotely cared for was Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, and it's only because he's trying to do good with the money he comes upon.I liked the plot in how the characters interacted, and when someone wasn't preaching about how easy it is to get drugs in America, the dialogue was decent. But I have to wonder what this film would've looked like if Soderbergh had made it before Erin Brockovich. Before that film (which I did like, by the way), he was an independent-minded filmmaker who made films that also appealed to the mainstream. Traffic is a mainstream feel that tries to appeal to an artsy crowd. One of the best movies of the year??? It's not even one of the best drug-based movies of the year.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching this film, I suddenly realized that this was a movie style I've never seen before. The four plot lines outlining four of the areas of drug traffic and the dealing with it, in four different locations, using different filming techniques were new to me. The director, Soderbergh, has done good work in the past but this is his "Citizen Kane". The performances were uniformly good but this is Benicio Del Toro's movie. He owns it and controls it. Not since I saw De Niro in "Mean Streets" has a performance by a relatively unknown actor blown me away.In addition to all this, the film gives a message to all of us who think that drug use is under control. The message is so strong that several politicians participated in the cocktail party scene, telling new drug czar Wakefield (Douglas), their opinions on the status of the drug war.You come away from this movie excited because after all these years, there are still new ways to tell a story. This film will win the Oscar for best movie. Of that there is no doubt. Del Toro will win for best supporting and the young actress, Erika Christensen, who plays Douglas' daughter, has a great future as well.Thank you Mr. Soderbergh.</fullReview>

It is great for condos.. if you haul in 1000 tons of of landfill.It was long, unexciting, trite... and frankly ... BORING... the acting was average at best even though it was loaded with some name brand stars ... it had no real plot and its central theme was mundane b.s... not to mention disjointed... moreover, it was more than mildly annoying in filming with video camera and color coded geography for so-called "effect"... i.e. yellowish for mexico!! Give me a break! Heck, the Blair Witch Project made better use of this technique.. but it added nothing to this movie... IMHO.I would urge people not to buy into the hype, and save their $7-$10 on tickets... if you are curious to see what all the fuss was about, rent it on video in a few months!

		<shortDescription>Best film in a year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*mild spoiler* I saw *Traffic* the other day and it was the best film I've seen at the theatre in a year. Many of the past films that won or should have won the Oscar were better, but, given the dearth of great movies this year, it should win Best Picture. Benicio Del Toro, as the Mexican cop Javier, reminds one of a world-weary James Dean. Michael Douglas is good, playing a non-adulterer for once. As for some of the negative criticism on this page, a film does not have to be highly innovative to be great. So what if Soderbergh previously used many of the same techniques, which were used by others before him? I found the Mexican cinematography visually arresting rather than annoying. I don't know or pretend to know why that device was used - if it was a comment on the DEA's and America's distorted view of Mexico then it contradicts attempts to show the real travails of Javier - but it was a very immediate way to transport the viewer to Tijuana without relying on context. *Traffic* was not at all boring, and the two and a half hours flew by. As for charges of propaganda, guess what? Free-basing cocaine is bad for you! Of course not everyone who does it derails his life, but many do. If the daughter's story seems unbelievable, it is because of her uniqueness - a daughter of privilege and top scholar at an ivy prep school who likes her drugs hard and frequent. Probably the most unbelievable thing was the notion that America's Drug Czar would radically change his mind about the "war" on drugs and hold his ideals above political survival. Ultimately, the best thing about *Traffic* was the acting, and it is on this basis that it should win the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Overrated Film from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I must have walked in to the movie theatre with my expectations set too high. I really had no interest in seeing this movie, based on the previews, but I gave in and decided to see it after the media talking heads blabbed about what a fantastic movie it was. Never again will I listen to them. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie--it isn't. But it certainly isn't 'Best Picture' worthy. The directing and cinematography are fantastic, and I enjoyed the acting of all the players, but the story itself is seriously lacking. This movie is trying desperately to be important, yet I walked out of it and didn't feel like I got anything out of it. (Warning: There may be some slight spoilers following.) First of all, there is too much going on, yet nothing really happens. I actually had a hard time following the Benicio del Toro plotline--not sure if it was because of the subtitles or what, but my mind kept wandering. Del Toro's performance is awesome, though. (Salma Hayek's cameo is great, though--she's much better in Spanish than in English!) The plotline involving Michael Douglas's daughter was laughable. They show her getting high with her friends a few times and then she's all of a sudden a strung out drug addict selling her body? Sorry, I don't buy it. That should have been explored a little more. Also, the portrayal of the 'inner city' drug zone seemed extremely racist, as if they were really trying to drill home the differences between Michael Douglas's world and the world of drugs. Yeah, we get the idea. The Catherine Zeta Jones storyline was also quite unbelievable. Her about turnaround to take over her husband's empire was ridiculous. Some foreshadowing there would've been nice. First she's mad at him in prison, and then she starts doing the same thing he did? I don't buy it. Also, how many times do I need to be preached to about the world of drugs? I know that's what the movie is about, but it was too much. It doesn't end with a bang, either. It just ends. (End of spoilers.)This movie really drags in parts. After about the first hour, I was constantly checking my watch. I don't know about this one. I don't regret seeing it, but it's not as phenomenal as everyone is saying. I think it just goes to show how lackluster the past year has been for movies when people are raving about this. It's not bad. It's just not great. A little more character development would have been nice. Go see it for the direction and cinematography only. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WORST MOVIE EVER I am sorry guys, I am not usually the one to ruin someone else's fun, but this was horrible. 2 hours and 37 minutes of the most mindnumbing, incapacitating, idiocy placed on disgusting film using amateurish camera work. I just came back from watching this monstrocity, and i feel like i have been violated in so many ways.I saw the preview, and was intrigued. However, 15 minutes into the film i knew that the trailer was the highlight of the entire film. I still do not understand how so many tallented actors and actresses could make something that sucks so bad.Don't get me wrong though, if you want to see the skinny kid from "That 70's Show" smoking crack, or Catherine Zeta Jones pregnant go ahead and watch this movie. But other than that there is no reason to watch this"film".Slow, uneventful, developes like an episode of the Wonder Years. Do yourself a favor do not dull your brain with this piece of trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The enemy within.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows us the parallel worlds of the drug culture - the supplier - a poor, third-world country, and the consumers, our children. When these kids from the burbs wander out of their comfort zone, their parents may find the resources, the concern and the ability to pull their kids back from the brink (and oh, what a dark, wretched brink it is) but we know all too well there are those parents who don't, or can't, or won't, and it is their children this story really underscores. This film knows how to basically ding a bell next to the head of every mother and father in its audience, as I'm sure parents walked out of this movie with one and only one thing on their mind - protecting their sons and daughters from what lies on the other side of the tracks. We see what happens to one promising young woman who's lucky enough to have a boyfriend who introduces her to hard core drugs. Amazingly, this film shows us that despite their geographic, economic and political differences, all players in the war on drugs (the poor mexican police officer, his innocent wife, the corrupt mexican military, the DEA, the rich white kids using and the poor black kids supplying) intersect at certain points, points that are drawn on the same map, a map detailing human suffering, survival and success. Shot in sepia tones, we see the other world, that of the poor mexican, living alongside official corruption, reminding us that we see their plight through different eyes; they are on the outside, we are within. This isn't a pro-legalization or an anti-drug film. This film sums up its analysis of the war on drugs with the simple message of "Support" and "Listen".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yawn,too slow, Benicio Del Toro was the highlight movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have to keep looking at your watch to see when the movie is going to be over, something is wrong. Some of the finest acting I have seen in along time is Benicio Del Toro as Javier. His non verbal communication in this film was superb. I enjoyed the style of filming when the shooting was in Mexico. I go see movies 2 and 3 times to pick up on the things I missed because of the intensity of the film or characters. I don't think there was anything in this film I would go see again, except Del Toro's performance. Guzman and Cheadle's performances also first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year has been a bumpy one in the movies. From a great movie at the beginning (Wonderboys), to a period of bad movies (Charlie's Angels), and now Traffic. Not only does it deserve best movie, but Del Toro deserves best actor. He has played many great and funny roles (Usual Suspects, Fear and Loathing in Las Vagas), but his role in Traffic is his best performance yet. Another rising actor, Don Cheadle, gives an amazing performance. The director Soderbergh does a well done job with the color filters. He doesn't color the screen too much but does it just right. The story paints a dark picture of the "drug problem" of America, but it is only telling the truth. On top of all this, it is not too bloody. It is violent, but everyone should be able to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I saw the movie because of all those glaring reviews from all the film critics around the country. What did I get? Overall the movie was entertaining to watch, it held my full attention till the last minute, when I realized there wasn't even a legitimate ending. Maybe Soderbergh was trying to leave the viewers to think about it, but at least he should have given us something to think about? The separate stories are interesting, especially with Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Del Torro on screen. However the US parts with Michael Douglas and his daughter are rather shallow. I don't really feel a connection between me and those characters. Some parts, especially with the daughter are just used for the shock factor instead of actually being meaningful.The cinematography is definitely unique, the different looks are great.Overrated, definitely overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, complex film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a film that can't easily be put into words. The scope of the film goes beyond any idea that you may have had about the "war" on drugs. The film tells several interlocking stories with great ease. First, there's Benicio Del Toro as possibly the one honest cop in Mexico. He's trying to fight the war on drugs even when his superiors are the main perpetrators. When it's necessary, they use him to take down other cartels. Then there's Michael Douglas who is the country's newly appointed drug czar. His take on the drug war becomes rather skewed once he learns that his daughter is a user. Then, there's Catherine Zeta-Jones as a well to do socialite who learns that her husband was a smuggler of drugs. Through a very large cast, and finely tuned script, Steven Soderbergh infuses Traffic with an energy that slowly pulls you in. His use of color to differentiate between settings. Mexico is seen in a kind of sepia tone, dirty filter. The halls of justice in the heart of America and in The White House have a cold washed out blue palor that underscores the politicians take on the drug war. That it's not someone they know, but a statistic on a sheet of paper that they feel is the problem in America. And San Diego is given a warm day glow tone to it, but underneath there is a sense of menace. Pretty soon, all the locations start to bleed into each other as the stories begin to intertwine. The camera work gives you a you are there feel that takes you from being a third party observer, to a first person participant. You are out in the desert intercepting drugs. You are walking around the drug infested lower parts of the city and you are being hounded by the police and other interested parties. Traffic is a complex puzzle that demands your full attention. The film presents you with a current problem that has plauged the US for the past forty years. The answers that one gets from the film may not sit well with many people, but it opens your eyes to the fact that perhaps the current war on drugs, is not the right one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar for Soderbergh? Not so fast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is the year's best film. Scary thing about this is, Soderbergh's best work may be yet to come.This crime drama is his finest work to date. In 1998, critics were heaping praise on "Out of Sight," but it was virtually ignored by the Academy. The Academy was wise enough to know that awarding him for that film would be premature. It's like they were telling him ?you have promise, keep going, make us proud.' Off he went, making "The Limey" and "Erin Brockovich." The latter seemed to be the ticket. Big-time actress in a solid human drama gives performance of a lifetime. The director finally connects with an audience, for the first time since "sex, lies, and videotape." Is "Brockovich" the film Soderbergh went to the mountain and came back with? Heck no. It's not THAT good.Then, nine months later, comes "Traffic." Shot almost exclusively in handheld, it feels a lot like a documentary. the central character is Robert Wakefield, the President's appointee to be the new Drug Czar. Michael Douglas is having a great year as well. First with "Wonder Boys" and now this. Seems like he's being very choosy about his roles. Apparently, though, he wasn't Soderbergh's first choice. Douglas stepped in when Harrison Ford passed on it (Ford must have a screw loose). We're so used to Douglas giving these great performances, this one hasn't raised one eyebrow, at least not with critics. Who listens to these people anyway?Wakefield's story focuses on his transition into his new office, his confirmation jeopardized by his teenage daughter, who's become a drug addict. It sounds corny on paper, but just watch the film. There is real power in this storyline. The best performance in the film is given by Erika Christensen, who plays Caroline, Wakefield's daughter. As with Douglas, critics have ignored her while heaping praise on the film and its director. Maybe the Academy will see it differently.Many different stories are told, intersecting each other now and again over the film's 2 hours and 20 minutes. Every character is connected with the other in some way. All of it has to do with the flow of illegal drugs across the Mexican border into the United States. If we're to believe the film, the War on drugs is unwinnable. The War is about containment, not outright victory. This is fiction, but there are facts the back up this story, scary facts. One example: The cartels spend more money on their intelligence than all of the U.S. government agencies battling drug trafficking combined. Another: from a business perspective, drug trafficking may be the most successful industry in the U.S., maybe the world.The film visits the War on all fronts. Wakefield's battle is waged with the cartels themselves, but also within his own family. While he's spending time away from home, taking meetings with agency officials and visiting the U.S./Mexico border and Mexico City, preaching the merits of winning the War on the demand side and not the supply side, he's losing touch with his daughter. His empty sermon: If the kids stop wanting the drugs, seeking them out, then the War is over.The reality is that the drugs will keep on coming and the government will never stop fighting. The cycle will continue forever and ever. Knowing the government cannot win, the cartels claim victory. They're laughing at us. If anything, `Traffic' is a call for the DEA, the FBI, Customs, to get serious. Mere containment is not enough.The entire subject of the drug war has been forgotten lately. It's still raging as intensely as ever but it's become an unpopular subject, like nuclear weapons. think of `Traffic' as a public service, its intention to renew interest in a vital issue. It's an excellent composite of the War's effect on our country. Probably the best ever made.If Soderbergh doesn't walk away with Best Picture for this, I'll be very surprised. In the end though, the Academy may find they spoke too soon, that Soderbergh had yet to go to the mountain and bring back his REAL masterpiece.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravest movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" surely qualifies as the most daring film of the year 2000. He has set out to provide a capsule look at America's drug problem, telling the tangled tale from both sides of the Mexican border, and throwing in a number of human stories to boot.And while he isn't completely successful, Soderbergh has made a riveting movie that tackles a complex topic, one that has been turned into a cliche by so many other Hollywood films.The plot line is much too complex to go into, but essentially centers on a new US drug czar who is just taking office, just as his teenage daughter at home is getting deeper and deeper into the heroin and coke scene. At the same time, the story flashes back and forth to a San Diego, California couple suddenly rocked when the husband is busted as a drug trafficker. There are also a number of stories south of the border, mostly centering on a power struggle between cartels for control of Tijuana as a drug export capital. The film features a stellar all star cast, with Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid and many, many others. The standout performances come from Benicio Del Toro as a half way honest Tijuana cop trying to navigate his way through a cesspool of corruption, and Don Cheadle as an American cop with a sense of humor.The film uses a semi-documentary style and even tints the various stories differently, presumably to make it easier to follow the cross cutting.Overall, the movie works and works well and it is easy to get caught up in a lot of it. Where it begins to go wrong is the third act. Maybe because it wants to end on an hopeful note, maybe because the filmmakers have no real solutions to the drug problem, "Traffic" loses believability in the end. From a far fetched assassination plot against a key witness in a drug case to Dougles' conversion to caring parent, "Traffic" stumbles in its closing minutes, trading in its hard nosed realism for feel good solutions. It almost seems to be saying that if all Dads just quit their jobs and stayed home so they could pay attention to their teenagers, there might not be a drug problem. If a few good Mexican cops turned down the big bribes and ignored the constant threat of assassination, the cartels might be broken. If the Washington politicians ...well, you get the idea. "Traffic" spreads the blame for the failed "war on drugs" around so that everyone gets a little, and nobody really comes off looking all that bad. Nobody on the US side of the border, that is. That's my political complaint. My cinema complaint is that a sometimes brilliant film that is well written, well acted and very well directed changes styles in the end, transforming itself from gritty documentary to Hollywood fantasy."Traffic" earns an "A" from me, but it should have gotten an "A+" and would have, if it had stuck to its guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disingenuous virtuosity, tediously deployed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film, I found "Traffic" a bit tedious and too long. As a comprehensive treatment of the so-called "war on drugs" I found it disingenuous at best.Drug use is, of course, a complicated matter. And much of that complication is not well-suited to dramatic presentation. However, with its elaborate inter-weaving of three stories, "Traffic" pretends to be comprehensive. My problems with this movie center around the teenaged drug abusing daughter of the newly appointed drug czar.What bothers me is the preachiness about how teen drug use is clearly a manifestation of family pathology, neatly balanced against daddy's scotch drinking. Well, certainly, family pathology can lead to various things, including drug use. But surely an awful lot of drug use starts as simple curiosity and continues on the strength of the various pleasures afforded by drugs. That was completely missing from this movie, which seems to take the view that drug use is simply and unambiguously wrong.The film was enlightened only in that it comes down on the side of love, peace, understanding and therapy as the proper way to deal with teen drug use. That's certainly better than jailing teens, but it is not a very useful way of thinking about drug use. By linking drug use unambiguously to family pathology it underlines the assumption that drug use is itself pathological. I don't think things are so simple.Given that assumption, of course, there is no way the film could even hint at the numbing facts about drug-related incarceration. It's nice that it shows us that official Washington doesn't have a clue about interdiction, but I regard that as an example of Marcusian repressive desublimation (yeah, I know, the term is awful). Soderberg goes liberal on that angle to distract us from the fact that, at the core, this is a moralistic tract against drug evils and in favor of old-fashioned family values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Oscar Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the Oscar buzz that was made about "Traffic," claiming that it was one of the best depictions of the drug war ever produced, the movie hardly lives up to its reputation. The disjointed and often confusing story line jumps from Mexico, to San Diego, to Washington D.C. (not to mention several others), every few moments. In addition to the fact that you'll be squirming in your seat waiting for this excruciatingly long piece to end, one comes to identify all the locations with a different color film. Mexico is signified by a gasoline-smeared, orange tint, while our nation's capitol seems to be in a blue haze. Whatever symbolism this seems to represent, escapes most movie-goers, and just makes for another annoyance. My recommendation: don't see it if you don't have to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of, if not the, best films I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Traffic" today and after reading both good and bad reviews, I was a little suspicious of how much I'd enjoy this movie. Well, I loved it. There was never a boring moment in the entire film, and I was captivated from beginning to end.The plot, in a nutshell, is how drugs affect everyone and all of our lives, from informants (Benicio Del Toro) to drug czars (Michael Douglas) to house wives (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to High School prep students (Erika Christiansen, Topher Grace): cops Javier and Monolo (Del Toro and I think Miguel Ferrer) are caught in a drug corruption, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), on the verge of becoming the nation's new drug czar, has just discovered that his daughter Caroline (Erika Christiansen) has a serious drug problem, and Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) must do her best to protect her family when her husband (Steven Bauer) is arrested by the DEA, no matter what she has to do.This cast was incredible. Michael Douglas did a very impressive job, as did Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Miguel Ferrer. Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman added much comic relief as two joking DEA agents keeping an eye on Helena and her family. This is the first time I've seen Erika Christiansen perform, and she made a very good first impression-she had the ability to make you feel sad for her character. And after watching Topher Grace play nice boy Eric on That '70s Show, I was very impressed with how well he played the role of scuzzball Seth Abrams, who gets Caroline hooked on drugs in the first place.While some people might've been annoyed w/ the jerky camera movements (Soderbergh used a handheld camera), I found it great, since it seemed to give the movie a realistic feel. I also like the color coordination of each place: in the first part of the movie, it would say on the bottom where the story would move to. But after awhile, they no longer needed to do that-you just had to see which color was being used and you'd know where the movie was now. Very, very well done!This movie deserves Best Picture. I loved it, and definitely want to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone else has told you, this is one of the worst movies you will ever have the misfortune to barf through! It truly is hard to know where to begin, and imdb's 1000 word limit truly limits me. I really only have one question and please email me with the answer if you know it. Who do I sue to get my money back?1) Numbingly long. 2 hours and 40 minutes of painful, boring, incomprehensible, crap! Typical film maker who thinks if he bores you long enough, he will get the critic's to start wondering if there is something here. And, the sheep will surely follow!2) 3-4 story lines that are largely unrelated to each other. If you like a garbled mini documentary styled movie then this is it. If you are like me and want to go see a movie that has a beginning, a middle, and an end where all story lines are related somehow, then this is the LAST movie you want to go to.3) THE WORST CAMERA WORK IN THE HISTORY OF FILM!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely no exception to that and I challenge anyone to show me one that is worse. For one thing, every scene in Mexico was visually washed out. The theory, I suppose is to somehow try to convey the washed out nature of Mexico. But, I got news for you. IT WAS IRRITATING AS HELL! Also, the camera was CONSTANTLY jumping around on every single scene at every single second. I needed dramamine just to keep from getting sick. Thought I was watching a jeans commercial for 160 minutes. I suppose the theory is that it gives it that edgy feel. Well, I got news for you. IT WAS AS IRRITATING AS HELL! And, then there were hundreds of times when it was intentionally out of focus on specific characters or surroundings. I suppose that the theory is that it makes things less "clear" in this muddled druggie world. Well, I got news for you. Yeah, you guessed it. IT WAS AS IRRITATING AS HELL!4) If I want to go to a movie to see Zeda-Jones, I'm not going to see her pregnant. Comprendo? And, Amy Irving has never looked worse. In fact, she has never come close to looking even as bad. Just so I'm not totally sexist, Peter Reigert was a true stick figure. Cheadle and Douglas gave good performances, but Douglas always does and this wasn't his best.5) Can't begin to tell you how many ludicrous things happened. Like we are going to believe that a teenager is going to start spouting statistics to the drug czar in the front seat of his car while he is looking desperately for his daughter. Like we are going to believe that a self-professed non independent woman is going to suddenly become a drug kingpin in place of her jailed husband - without his help no less. Like we are going to believe that a drug czar is going to give a speech to the Washington press and then stutter like first grader caught stealing out of his momma's purse - only to spout the pat "I can't do this." PLEEAAAAASSSSE!!!! And, believe me. I could go on.Suffice it to say, that the only reward I have for going is the opportunity to exact my pound of flesh on the internet. Save your time and money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I Missing Something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, you run across a filmmaker whose works, despite their obvious qualities, just do not click with you. It's something on a metaphysical level, something about the filmmakers' sensibilities, that do not jibe with your own and prevent you from truly appreciating the films' merits.For me, Steven Soderbergh is such a filmmaker. Watching his films, I appreciate his visual and editorial acumen, his reasonably interesting way around a character. Yet something, somewhere, does not work. His films have a remote, cold quality to me that nothing in their acting or style can circumvent. I like Soderbergh when he goes for a complete stylistic 180, as in the baroque "Kafka" and the truly trippy "Schizopolis", but when he makes a "Soderbergh film", as with "Out of Sight", something in me just shuts off. Such is the case with "Traffic", Soderbergh's drug epic which is being hailed as a masterpiece in many circles, but which was to me just another pretty good crime drama...only longer.The film's screenplay, adapted by Stephen Gaghan from a BBC mini-series, follows several stories Robert Altman style, as we meet several combatants on both sides of the drug war. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is the U.S. government's new drug czar, but his war on the national drug scene is preempted by his own struggle to save his crack-addicted daughter (Erika Christensen). Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a privileged druglord's wife, is desperate to protect her cushy lifestyle after her husband is jailed, and she gradually evolves from pampered mother-to-be to ruthless, calculating criminal. Down in Tijuana, Javier (Benicio Del Toro), a morally conflicted Mexican cop, goes to work for a drug-bashing general with sinister intentions. Rounding out the cast are Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman as chatty DEA agents assigned to protect a standoffish witness (Miguel Ferrer) and Amy Irving as a suburban wife blind to the abuses going on around her.All of these parts are invested with conviction by the all-star cast. Standouts are Cheadle and Guzman, whose casually witty banter points up the paradoxical mundanity of the DEA man's violent life, and newcomer Christensen, who anatomizes the drug addict's downward spiral with impressive empathy. Actually, there isn't a duff performance in the bunch, and hopefully this group will be remembered when the Screen Actors Guild releases its nominees for best ensemble cast.Soderbergh, admittedly, does some nice things with this material. His cinematography (credited to "Peter Andrews") is jittery and immediate, switching beautifully to washed-out sepia tones for the ultra-gritty Tijuana segments. He skillfully juggles this rather dense material, and the numerous subplots never get confused, which would have made for a really hellish experience considering the film's already excessive two-hour-and-twenty-seven minute length.So what went wrong? I think part of the blame lies with Gaghan's screenplay. Based on the hype, I was expecting a life-transforming illumination of the hell of the drug culture, the futility of attempts to curb the spread of narcotics, and the vicious cycle whereby addicts and dealers feed each other. Instead, I got relatively standard material, reasonably well-done, but nothing that would warrant the film being called a masterpiece. What the film teaches us is that drugs are dangerous, the system of dealership is so much a part of our capitalist culture that it is perhaps inextricable, and that the government's minor victories do not add up to a routing of the drug kingpins. Thanks. I already knew that.And of course, part of the blame for the movie's failure to achieve masterpiece status lies with me. I just can't click with Soderbergh. He's a good director, and "Traffic" is an entertaining and well-made film, but a masterpiece just has this buzz that it creates in you, something inexplicable and wonderful. And "Traffic" doesn't have it. Sorry, Steven. I hope you don't take it personally. It's not you. It's me.</fullReview>

Instead, it stimulates conversation on the way home, and long into the night. So much about the movie pleased me. It was thourough, touching upon a range of viewpoints and characters. The rather lengthy film used it's time wisely; the characters had ample room to develop and mature as the movie progressed. Camera work was great, an omnipresent documentary style. Depending on the location, different camera techniques (and filters) were used. Very cool. My only complaint is that the kids partying together seemed really weak... like they were idealized versions of the kids that parents come to expect... even down to the way they lie and sneak. But otherwise it was really powerful. I gave it a 10, because everyone should go and see it.</fullReview>

Instead, it stimulates conversation on the way home, and long into the night. So much about the movie pleased me. It was thourough, touching upon a range of viewpoints and characters. The rather lengthy film used it's time wisely; the characters had ample room to develop and mature as the movie progressed. Camera work was great, an omnipresent documentary style. Depending on the location, different camera techniques (and filters) were used. Very cool. My only complaint is that the kids partying together seemed really weak... like they were idealized versions of the kids that parents come to expect... even down to the way they lie and sneak. But otherwise it was really powerful. I gave it a 10, because everyone should go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1999, we were blessed with such masterpieces as "American Beauty," "Being John Malkovich," and "Magnolia." But what have we to look back on from the movies of 2000? Sure, there were some very entertaining movies, like "X-Men," but none of these matched the exhilarating experiences of "The Matrix" and "The Sixth Sense." The only movies that deserve recognition are "Gladiator" and "Almost Famous." The year 2000 was a year filled with utter atrocities and just downright bad movies. However, the movie industry is starting the new year on the right foot. With movies including "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," "Shadow of the Vampire," "Thirteen Days," and, of course, "Traffic," my faith in the movie industry is being resurrected."Traffic" is the first of these critically acclaimed movies being released this year that I have had the pleasure of viewing, and I was exceedingly impressed. Every performance was top-notch, the cinematography was excellent, and the screenplay was perfect. "Traffic" is the first sign of land after a year lost at sea. I was drawn in immediately and it held me in its grasp until the credits were over.I recommend this movie to anyone, film connoisseurs and casual movie-goers alike, but especially to those as disappointed as I was with the movies of 2000, it is a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the rare long films, which I did not want to see end. I was absorbed into the multiple and interwoven story lines. I was fascinated with the use of lens filters, camera techniques, cuts and sound. A living canvas, as only the best of films can be. Even the familiar segue technique of having characters from different story lines pass one another in shots seemed fresh. The cast was like an all-you-can-eat gourmet buffet. No disappointments. The film is less like a viewed object and more like a place where you find yourself. It avoids "The Message" by simply taking you where you need to go to understand the drug and political cultures, which it portrays so well. The inspiring Brit series, "Traffik", which I have seen, has been respected and translated very well into this American version. I will see this film again, and I am sure I will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic", which features Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid, is an interesting film about the drug trade and the war on drugs funded by the U.S. government. The film follows three different stories, and is a little overwhelming to be described. Director Steven Soderbergh has done a great job with the story and characters for the film. The cinematography is really brilliant, and Benicio Del Toro gives a fantastic performance. An impressive American film. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Face Time with Significant Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. And this time I do mean darkness. The overrated Steven Soderbergh takes us into the belly of drug dealers and trafficers. Sorry, it is a somewhat fascinating topic, but sure seems difficult to relate to. The scenes in the Mexico desert seem cleaner than they should. I enjoy overlapping story lines, and Soderbergh's use of grain/filters/lighting/color to dramatize the different worlds is a nice touch. However, there are 15-20 minutes of the movie that could be lost and the pace would improve drastically. Michael Douglas, with his strange amber dye-job, sleep walks through his role. Face it, he is not the strong, silent type. He is much more effective when he wears his emotions on his sleeve. Two actors steal the movie: Benecio Del Toro and Don Cheadle. Del Toro is marvelous! Talk about quiet explosiveness - this guy has IT. Cheadle continues his string of strong support roles, both serious and funny. The craziest thing about this picture is noticing how many of the actors are affiliated with real-life significant others or family members. Of course, there are newlyweds Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones; Benjamin Bratt (Julia Roberts); James Brolin (Barbra Streisand); Miguel Ferrer (son of Jose Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney); Dennis Quaid (ex of Meg Ryan); Amy Irving (ex of Steven Speilberg), and Selma Hayek (OK, no famous relatives, but she is gorgeous!). My tidbit on this one is Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers lays down a wonderful bass line for the soundtrack, and check out Topher Grace from TV's "That 70's Show" as drug addict Seth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deals with the drug trade between the United States and Mexico.There are 3 stories going on at the same time during the film. This film has a great cast : Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle and Dennis QuaidThe most impressive actor in this film is Benicio Del Toro who plays a honest cop in Mexico. I haven't seen this actor much in films but I can say that he'll go far. I just saw some previews of this new film that he's in called "Snatch".The cinematography in this film is interesting. When showing scenes in Mexico, the cinematographer changes the color of the scene into a sandish color. Gotta see it.My first time seeing one of Steven Soderburgh's films and I find it amazing.Michael Douglas also plays an impressive role. He's a Supreme Court Judge and is given the job of fighting the drug war between the United States and Mexico. Great Film!!! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ditched my work, to attend this 'masterpiece', and boy did I regret it. I must admit the directorial ship was magnificent, the script superb, the acting could have truly used more work. Don't get me wrong I loved Cathrine Zeta-Jones in Zorro, who didn't! But from the second she came on screen I didn't buy her acting, I felt that she was 'trying' to act rather than just 'being' the character. The same goes for Michael Douglas, the drug kids, and on and on and on. I was very disappointed in the acting. The only reason I actually stayed in the theater was solely due to the director, and the acting skills of Benicio Del Toro a truly honed actor in my opinion, and the buddy side of the flick involving, Don Cheadle &amp; Luiz Guzman. All in all I would probably give this movie a 'rent' rating, (if I had a rating system), so if you have an evening to spare, or if you are like me, and you want to ditch your work or even better your school! Save the disgrace and forget this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically good, though overrated- big budget afterschool special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been fairly disappointed with this year's films, and looked forward to something that might truly impress me. Traffic is a solid, well-crafted film, with good acting, and a profoundly mediocre script.Do I need an upper-class, white, A-student victim to know drugs are harmful? Extracurriclars are going to save society? Corruption in Mexico, advanced drug cartels, and the witness at trial. Sigh... The good minority characters, the bad minority characters, the loving father, average joes in support groups...sigh. An irritating boyfriend who spouts the occasional lecture to knock us into place. Actually, 100,000 black people wouldn't make it into a white neighbourhood...there's more to life than econ. I disliked him so much I ignored almost everything he said, good or not.Technically, the camera moved too much for me. I usually appreciate some fancy cinematography, but some of those angles seemed to be there just so it wasn't straight, it didn't mean anything more than...look, real life-jerky film.I don't expect perfect answers from a movie, but frankly, for something as heavily touted as this was I was disappointed. An afterschool special with a heavy budget. I had expected this movie to be informative, and it was. As something touted as eye-opening, it wasn't. As someone who considers himself marginally aware of current events, I either knew it or saw it coming.Sigh...Jesse is so scared...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better movies of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compare this movie to something like 'Magnolia', an attempt to inter-weave several plot lines and 'Traffic' is much more successful. Michael Douglas continues to maintain himself as a fine actor. No matter the role, this guy pulls it off. However, the best actor of this movie is Benecio Del Toro. Even in Spanish with subtitles the guy acts better than most English speakers, he really gets the character and you should have no problem rooting for him. And rooting for someone in this movie is hard, because this film has one of the most accurate tag lines 'no one gets out clean.' A very good film in a kind of sleeper of a year. Great bookends for Michael Douglas: "Wonder Boys' and this one.Just one more thing, Soderburgh does a great job, it is as stylish and compelling as Michael Mann's 'Heat' and 'The Insider.' However, leave it to Hollywood to maintain their same old ambiguous approach to the topic of drugs. I am not saying they need to appeal to the Christian Right and send a strong message condemning drug use, they could even promote and glorify drug use for all I care; but once in awhile, take a stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie not knowing what to expect. I saw it opening night and it started and I thought to myself, wow, this is a good movie. The acting was great, the different moods for the different cities was great. I liked it. Then a problem arose. The theater I was watching this movie in was beeping. This was normal to me because I have seen many other movies in this theater and I knew about the beep. Apparently the woman next to me didn't think it was the theater. She thought I was for some reason playing a joke and beeping every five minutes. In the middle of the movie she cursed at me and told me to stop. I told her it wasn't me, but she didn't believe me and told her very large husband about the situation. He gave me a look. I was scared and remained scared through the rest of the movie. Every time the beeping happened, I tensed up and was unable to pay attention to the movie. She would whisper in her husband's ear everytime it beeped and he would give me a look. I'm sweating now. I tell my friend of the situation and he laughs. Because he laughs, she thinks he's also making the beeping noise. At one point she went into her purse and pulled out what looked to me like a can of mase, but ended up being lipstick. So as it went, I didn't enjoy the movie. I kept asking my friend what was happening. I would get a piece of gum out of my pocket and the beep would happen at the exact same time, making it look like I have a beeping device in my pocket. So the credits came up and I wanted to get out. I turned and looked at this woman for one last look and she attacked me. She grabbed my hair and my ear and bounced my head off the arm of the chair five times. (This is true) When I came to, I escaped and stood up. The lights came on and I realized we now had an audience. I called her a bad word and her very large husband stood up. He must have been hot because his face was all sweaty and he looked very mad and I think me calling his wife the swear word didn't help. I jumped over the seat and managed to escape my attackers and get into my car with my friend. I got a baseball bat out of the trunk just incase, but yeah, Traffic was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant performances in abundance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic details the continuing war on drugs, by telling 4 interlocking stories. There is Michael Douglas as the newly appointed drug czar whose daughter (Erika Christensen) ends up a freebase addict, Benicio Del Toro as an honest Mexican cop with his partner (Jacob Vargas) trying to survive in a lawless land, Catherine Zeta-Jones as a wife of a drug kingpin who gets arrested and faces a possible huge jail sentence from a former partner, and Don Chealde and Luis Guzman as the DEA agents who bust a big informant that plans to testify at the kingpins trial so that he can get immunity from prosecution. Watching this film, it only confirmed what I already now about the US drug war. It is an exercise in futility. This is a great film where every single actor and actress gets their part to shine. We jump through every scene of the drug war, to Soderbergh's sunburst colour film shots of Mexico, to highly orchestrated scripted meetings in clandestine Washington. Douglas, and Benicio are EXCELLENT in their roles and one thing that is for certain that Traffic shows, it is that the war on drug produces no winners. It only produces bodies.Although the film has some predictability, it is a very IMPORTANT film and will remain so for years to come. It's not perfect, but Soderbergh's use of interlocking the story and showing the characters acting ability is superb. From the great main performances of Benicio and Douglas, to the supporting cast of Don Chealde, Luis Guzman, and Catherine, AND even to the minor characters such as assassin Francisco Flores (Clifton Colins Jr.), and General Salazar [MY FAV!] (Tomas Milian) make this film so enjoyable to watch. Powerful performances are in abundance in this film, also it has a great score that really creates a fantastic mood. Can't believe this was done by the same guy who did Erin Brokovich.Rating 8 out of 10</fullReview>

The soundtrack is conspicuously absent for many parts of the film and there are a number of times when the reality of the situations can be felt through the silence of the theatre patrons. It is a commentary on a familiar topic, but it does not preach a message, it just makes a point. Really should be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the day after it was released in Pittsburgh. I was disappointed by one thing...that I hadn't seen it the day before. Traffic is the most exhilerating movie I have seen since 'Pulp Fiction.' It offered a new perspective on the drug war and its partisan views gave it credibility. I was especially interested in the story of Caroline, as I am also a teen. I thought the way they depicted the teens was pretty realistic. Teens do rebel but they can also be very philosophical. I've watched Don Cheadle since his days on 'Picket Fences' and was happy to see his great performance. I loved the movie's gritty style and was impressed by the films realism. A soon-to-be classic. 10/10.</fullReview>

Del Toro is simply amazing, and should be seeing gold come Oscar. Weaving back in forth between very different settings and story lines would be confusing, you would think, but it is done effortlessly. This ensemble cast is one of the best I've ever seen, and even though Del Toro shines, it is hard to find just one good performance in this movie, since there is not a weak link to be found.

Sure, there is plenty of action and gunfights but the story is carried by intelligent plotting, intermingling of substories, and excellent acting by most of the players. Benicio Del Toro stands out as the uncorrupt Mexican police officer and he gives a controlled understated performance with facial and dialogue subtleties which remind me of James Dean. The very interesting color and especially the sound choices of the production team are perfect complement to the story. Try it, you'll like it . . . if you bring your brain with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie about drugs I have ever seen, along with Gus Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy".I loved the directing; in particular, I liked the documentary-like feel of the movie because it made me feel like I was watching a documentary about real life, not a Hollywood movie. This helped me get really attached to the characters (although much of that is, of course, due to the script and many other factors); normally when I'm watching a movie, I'm thinking "well, I wonder if they're going to kill this guy off now" but in Traffic I was surprised to find myself actually caring about the characters as though they were real people.One of the greatest things that I think Traffic has going for it, much moreso than other anti-drugwar films like Drugstore Cowboy, is due to the potential impact the film has on the general public. Most drug films I've seen are very liberal and are geared towards a younger audience; I would be fairly reluctant to show Drugstore Cowboy to my 50-something mother, for example. However, despite the fact that some say that we know everything Traffic tells us about the drug war, I think there are a lot of people who don't know everything Traffic tells us about drug war, and Traffic is the best movie to enlighten them precisely because it's so accessible to all audiences--not just to the Green Party supporters who think drugs should be legalized, but to anyone concerned about the drug war, whether they're ultra-liberal, ultra-reactionary, or somewhere in the middle. For instance, my mother saw Traffic and said she learned a good deal from it.Another thing I liked best about the film was its sympathy (and realism) in portraying all parties involved--most of the main characters who used or trafficked drugs weren't portrayed as the "no-good punks" or "heartless profit-mongers" that the elderly have often stereotyped drug users and traffickers as, and most of the main characters who were fighting the war on drugs (particularly Michael Douglas' character) weren't the blind idiots that young liberals have often stereotyped government officials as. Of course, such stereotypes do come from reality, so they should be in the movie to some extent, and they are: but fortunately most of those stereotypes weren't the main characters that the film focused on. Rather, they were embodied by the individuals who shaped the environment around the main characters, which I think was a great idea.Someone mentioned that they thought the idea of the "valedictorian drug user" was a total cliche in Hollywood, but I don't think that could be further from the truth. Maybe I haven't seen the same drug-oriented movies as everyone else, but I can't recall a single film other than Traffic in which such intelligent and downright "dorky" people--people like my friends, who play trivia games answering questions about Greek playwrights on their laptop in their spare time--were avid drug users. In my opinion (and my mother's, actually), the film's portrayal of teenage drug use was actually one of the most poignant parts of the movie.And as for those people who were disappointed that the film didn't mention the legalization of drugs: I think this movie is meant to portray the problems with drugs and the drug war; it is not meant to offer solutions. Furthermore, the film would've had to be extended by at least an hour if it even delved into the issue of legalization, and moreover it probably would've freaked out conservative audience members to the point that they wouldn't listen to everything else important and eye-opening that the film had to say. It also probably would've had to take a stance on the issue of legalization if it brought it up, and since legalization is about as touchy a topic as abortion or euthanasia, it's probably a good idea that the film didn't address it. Taking a stance on such an issue would've undoubtedly branded the film as being either liberal or conservative: and in my opinion, the greatest asset of Traffic is that it essentially denies itself a political stance, which is a rarity amongst drug-themed films.</fullReview>

It also probably would've had to take a stance on the issue of legalization if it brought it up, and since legalization is about as touchy a topic as abortion or euthanasia, it's probably a good idea that the film didn't address it. Taking a stance on such an issue would've undoubtedly branded the film as being either liberal or conservative: and in my opinion, the greatest asset of Traffic is that it essentially denies itself a political stance, which is a rarity amongst drug-themed films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Traffic' is an incredible movie ? the story itself is provoking and highly involved whilst the cast members superbly portray their respective parts (especially Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglas, and Don Cheadle). Camerawork also is a major (and unique) part of this film, and it helps greatly as a story-telling device. I don't just want to mention tidbits of the components (like the numerous perspectives that one sees the world of drugs from) of this overwhelming film, so I'll just say that ?Traffic' is one of the best movies I've seen, and that everyone involved in the making of the movie should be very proud of themselves.Go and see it![10/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic features excellent acting, direction, and story lines.But, somehow, Traffic falls short from being a great movie.If you have read, as I have, reviews and plot summaries of this movie, you have found them to be almost universally extravagant in their praise of this film. The critics are all awed at the powerful performance of Benicio Del Toro. Steven Soderbergh is praised for his second great film of 2000. Either Moore or Gaghan has garnered a screenplay nomination.The fact is, this movie doesn't deserve that much credit. Yes, all of the actors... ALL of them, and there are many, many, many of them due to the three convergent story lines... did a fantastic job with portraying their characters. But the script leaves little time for any of them to truly develop the characters. A perfect example of this is Zeta-Jones. Her character begins as a naive housewife to a drug lord. She is disgusted to even see her husband in court. Then, without much on-screen metamorphosis, she hires an assassin to target the lead witness against her husband. That's pretty far from naive.Del Toro's Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez is more of the same. From what I have read about the film, he is supposed to be on a one man mission to stop drug smuggling, and willing to go to extreme measures to see this done though never crossing lines. Well, the critics must have been given a Cliff's Notes of the film to peruse during their viewing, because Del Toro's character is never portrayed that clearly on film. We know through two or three lines of dialogue that he wants the kids to be able to play baseball and have the parks back. We know that he fraternizes with the enemy, but his motives there are very, very hazy, especially when he explains to US DEA agents that he feels like he has sold out by helping them. In the end we see him watching a baseball game, as if to say he's a good guy? No, it doesn't work that easily.And I haven't even touched on the story line involving Michael Douglas.In the end, let me just say this: Traffic would have made a FANTASTIC eight hour television miniseries. But there is way too much going on for what was approximately two hours and twenty minutes of cinema. The scary thing is, it's not even an editing problem, I dare say there's nothing that could have been removed. But so much more could have been added. It would have saved us the jumpy three minute segments that dominate the first forty-five minutes of the film. It would have let the exemplary cast really delve into their characters. It would have allowed the story to really hit home in a way that wasn't quite possible in this version, lest you live in an American border town, I suppose.For those of you wondering, I scored the film a seven out of ten. It's supremely acted, well directed (despite the sometimes obnoxious filtering used in all Mexico scenes), and well, if under, written. But as a moviegoer, sitting through this, I had plenty of optimism that things would continue to get better and the film would grow into the triumph that had already been proclaimed by critics nationwide. Sadly, Traffic never became that film. Perhaps I should watch Ebert's copy, instead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benicio Del Toro is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw traffic today, it was the best movie I have seen since Saving Private Ryan, and it maybe just as good. Benicio Del Toro is amazing as the Mexican cop with a wonderful dream. Catherine Zeta Jones CAN ACT! Who knew, I thought of her only as window dressing until now. Her hubby Michael Douglas is great and is Don Cheadle the best working actor today? If he isn't he is right up there. The writing is great and Steven Soderbergh directed this with a masters touch. One small complaint, I would have liked them to reduce the level of sepia tone in the Mexican scenes. I know why they did it and I agree with the decision, but it was a bit over done at times. The three stories themselves were stand alone movies, each good enough to have been a great movie on it's own. Steven Soderbergh has done Altman here and has done it better than Altman ever has. That is great praise indeed, as I LOVE Altman. I cannot say enough about this movie. It has something very important to say and say's it very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all of Steven Soderbergh's movies, Traffic does not fit completely into any category. Each of the movie's five overlapping storylines has its own unique look and feel: one minute you're watching Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in a buddy cop picture, (complete with good cop/bad cop routine and one-liners); the next, you're watching Michael Douglas in an after school special. Does this interfere with cohesion? Yes. Does it cost the movie in terms of dramatic impact? Of course. This is not a movie with a spare, elegant narrative arc; it is not an emotional bombshell. Soderbergh's genius lies in recognising this as a necessity and playing to it: instead of trying to maintain a consistent tone for three hours and 30-some speaking characters, he gives each storyline its own tone of dialogue, color scheme and editing style. He could have made a three hour epic about any one of his themes (trafficking, corruption, addiction, public policy, money laundering,) maintaining a consistent message. Instead, he made a series of loosely organised shorts, threw in an enormous amount of detail, and explored almost every aspect of the drug problem.Everyone gets their say in Traffic: DEA agents tell us that drug trafficking is immoral and strictly a law enforcement issue; a mid-level trafficker argues in turn that he is on the side of history. A teenage cynic (Topher Grace, brilliantly slimey,) rails against uneven enforcement of drug laws; an angry parent responds with a long, contemptuous look that asks where a spoiled little rich boy gets off lecturing him about the realities of the world. I have heard this movie decried as both preachy leftwing propaganda and preachy rightwing propaganda, (although most people seem to *really* like it,) and what strikes me is this: every claim made in Traffic is disputed. There are no easy answers, nothing is agreed on, and nothing is solved. And in that, in feels more like a documentary than anything else.Plus, the last shot is haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh's most recent film, in my opinion, is the first to live up to his debut, "Sex, Lies, and Videotape". I left the theater with many of the prevalent themes lingering in my mind after sitting through an intensely intriguing film. The two most important characters, I think, are played by Benicio Del Tora and Catherine Zeta Jones. Both would not have been nearly as effective without the talents of these two actors. Del Tora's subtle take on the tortured cop is very representative of the film's message that we are trying to do right, but are we really making a difference? Zeta-Jones is full of surprises here, leading us to never quite be sure what to think of here, even at the end. My only real criticism for "Traffic" is the teenage daughter that falls so rapidly into drug addiction. It was a little difficult for me to believe how low she sunk in such a short period of time, especially considering her privileged background. For all purposes, "traffic" really is the type of movie that has been missing all year. A though- provoking social commentary, it forces us to think without giving us all the answers while allowing us to enjoy an intricate story and brilliant performances</fullReview>

This is a movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone sixteen and over, and one that should be used by politicians to change policy, rehabilitation counselors to demonstrate the ugliness of drug use, and by society, wherein all of us need to accept responsibility for creating a stigma that prevents users from seeking treatment, and an indifferent attitude that makes it okay for drug cartels to seek a profit at the expense of people's lives. This is the most important movie of the past ten years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I didn't like this movie at all. Here's why:The plot was remarkably weak. I did not find the stories in depth at all. In fact, I thought the movie lacked any cohesive plot, despite telling several different stories at the same time. This, I think, is where the movie fails. SPOILERS The individual plots are shallow, and where they are not shallow, they are unbelievable. I am surprised that anyone was really taken by the Catherine Zeta-Jones plot line. A young mother, who knows nothing about her husband's business, doesn't use drugs and seems righteous, careful and law abiding, ends up becoming an international drug dealer to save her husband. She has people assassinated using car bombs and handguns, she transports drugs across the Mexican border herself (drugs formed into the shape of little dolls). She manages to get the car bomb placed on a car outside a courthouse where the leading witness is testifying and there IS NO SECURITY. It's laughable. How naive is this movie? They have the witness holed up in a secluded hotel, protected by several DEA agents, and yet when they approach the courthouse they take no precautions whatsoever? It's ludicrous.Another plot line is the drug addict daughter of the leading man in the government's war on drugs. At no point is it explained why the girl is on drugs or what she is going through, the true effects of addiction. I believe at one point she states that she is "bored". I sympathize. There is even a scene where she is completely out of her head and having sex with a local drug dealer. She can barely see when she finds a needle in his stash. We are supposed to be shocked that she's about to move on to the hard stuff. The question is if these are the hard drugs, what was she doing to get her to sleep with a drug dealer in a dangerous neighborhood in the first place? There is no impact in that scene at all as she's already doing outrageous things for drugs. Bad movie making, sorry. If we were supposed to feel shocked at seeing her lying helpless beneath this dealer, it didn't work. I have never felt so detached from such an integral scene to a movie. It was completely emotionless. To cap this plot thread off, Douglas has a speech to accept his position as Drug Tzar. He stutters, falters, and eventually says he can't do it (after what he's been through with his daughter). Anyone who did not see this scene coming from the first scene of the movie must be blind. It was all so damned predictable.Thing is, it's very well acted. Apart from the expected good performances, Catherine Zeta-Jones puts in the best film performance of her life (that I've seen). Michael Douglas is strong as always, and Del Toro brings life to a very dull and minimal script. The camera is used well, so are filters but none of this style can cover the simple lack of substance. The film is empty, and is more a study in the director's panache than than it is a piece of entertainment. The movie needed solid, simple structure, not steady cams clever sound design. It's a mess.I have a feeling that this one will not be remembered. Despite the good reviews it is receiving, a second look at the movie will reveal all the glaring omissions and plot breakers, not to mention the lack of originality (if you're bored watching this movie, try to spot all the stolen moments from other Movies like the French Connection etc). Two and a half hours of shaking the camera and adding blue filters does not a movie make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending Muddled in Traffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic (in my humble opinion) is the second best film of the year. "Almost Famous" was better, but thats another discussion for another time.Traffic is indeed a fine film... star-power cast, a superb story, with an adequate script. The visual style of the film is gritty -- no punches pulled. The cinematography is beautiful, but in a different way from the most beautiful film of 1999 (American Beauty)... the angles used are so "out of the box" that its gorgeous.What is not gorgeous, however, is how the story gets pulled together in the end. The audience is sold-out... after investing over two hours in this film, the viewer is treated to a flimsy, very preachy, sad-excuse-for, slapstick, and quite frankly disappointing ending. There is no payoff for the viewer. Might as well have slapped on some footage of a man getting kicked in the groin, because it would have made for a better ending. I won't give away what happens, but the ending takes Traffic from being a poignant piece of social commentary, a terrfic piece of storytelling (much as American Beauty was) to being another popcorn flick. Audiences aren't idiots... yet Hollywood continues to treat the masses as such.Don Cheadle is such a fine actor -- and continues his high calibre of acting in this film, yet at the end of the script, he's reduced to much of the same schtick we see in the lackluster Eddie Murphy films as of lateI gave Traffic 8/10, but that's being VERY generous considering the way the film ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a well made journey into the heart of America's drug trade and an important film with enough intense storytelling to hold you for two and a half hours. We know America is not winning the war on drugs primarily because of both high demand and high profiteering. Even as pervasive as this problem is to every community, we tend to be complacent because it isn't as visible as, say, racism or homelessness. "Traffic" brings it home and more. It reminds you a lot of "The Deer Hunter" in projecting an important issue on a personal level. Even though there are no chase scenes, you also feel the realism of "The French Connection" in tracking down drug dealers. In that respect, director Steven Soderbergh has deliberately given us two cultures trying to deal with drug trafficking in their own ways, perhaps no more evident than the technique of switching over to a orange-tinted, raw looking celluloid every time the action takes place in Mexico. America pours money and pretends the 'drug czar' will have enough political clot to carry the day. Mexico makes no pretense of even trying to curtail the flow, instead giving in to drug lords trying to monopolize the trade for themselves, through whatever means. In "Traffic", characters criss-crossing each other in a well orchestrated manner. We meet Javier (Oscar caliber performance by Benicio Del Toro) the Mexican policeman who has a streak of decency and honor even as corruption envelops him. There is General Salazar (Tomas Milian) who could be ruthless and charming at the same time. The American drug agents, Montel and Ray (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) are believably human even as they have to carry on with their mundane interrogations and surveillance. Eduardo (Miguel Ferrer) and the teenage couple, Seth (Topher Grace) and Caroline (Erika Christensen), serves as the preachy mouthpieces of the film, as they expound on why the police are mere pawns to the drug dealers they are trying to catch, what is wrong with NAFTA, and why over 100,000 white kids search every day in black neighborhoods for a fix. And then there is Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, already six months pregnant with his child even though they don't have one scene together. Douglas as Judge Wakefield is the perfect foil, a man of seeming strength and character who falls victim to a horrible family life. Zeta-Jones, on the other hand, starts out as an innocent victim but quickly learns to be cunningly savage to preserve her pleasurable way of life. "Traffic" doesn't try to give answers as much as it demands we try to find those answers ourselves - like why we should try to 'think out of the box' more or try to reach out to the very family members addicted to drugs who should be getting, not less, but more of our attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`No one gets away clean' reads the tagline for Steven Soderbergh's new film `Traffic.' This is the most accurate way to summarize an engaging and disturbing film that blows holes into the `war on drugs' we see on television. In this film, Soderbergh takes on a contemporary subject with courage, showing the reality of American's drug problem as in issue that touches all. Following disparate stories taking place simultaneously in Tijuana, San Diego, Cincinnati, and Washington D.C., `Traffic' illuminates what our leaders try to hide from us everyday. The war on drugs isn't a practical, traditional war that can be won through force; instead, it is one that thrives on force and turns that force around to kill the supposed good guy. The multi-layered storyline of this film portrays drugs in America as an issue all should be concerned with, not just politicians, police, and dealers. By using separate stories spread across states, cities, and suburbs, Soderbergh sheds light on the food chain of drugs in this country. The producers, middle-men, dealers, buyers, and law enforcers are all caught up in a battle where the goal is blurred and the ending nowhere in sight. The vital character to this story is Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), an Ohio State Supreme Court judge who has been chosen as the new federal drug czar when the film opens. While his official role links him directly to the war on drugs, it is his personal dilemma, as the father of a drug-addicted teenage daughter, that makes his story complete. He is, in effect, a symbol of the two-sided drug problem in America. He sees both the small picture and the big picture: his daughter is an addict in need of help and discipline; his country and government are addicted to a solution that solves nothing. Soderbergh enhances Douglas's role with a wonderful ensemble cast. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a drug importer who ruthlessly frees her husband from a trial that would have certainly put him away. Benicio Del Toro, in the film's best performance, plays a bilingual police officer from Baja California caught between a two-timing Mexican drug official and the lure of helping American D.E.A. agents in San Diego. Also adding strong roles are Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, and Luis Guzman. Soderbergh effectively moves between cities and strong, important characters without ever confusing or cheating the audience. In the end, this film works so well because Soderbergh avoids moralizing; he leaves the judgement to the audience. Some may walk away from this film thinking our war on drugs is a terrible failure; others, like conservative Utah Senator Orrin Hatch (who plays a quick cameo), may believe this to be an anti-drug movie which illuminates how hard, and necessary, our current form of fighting drugs is. At one point in this film, Douglas' character has an awakening to his job and his government's role in fighting drugs. After seeing his daughter fall victim to drug addiction and his plan to destroy a cartel in Mexico fall victim to corruption, the drug czar sees that the `war on drugs' has become a war on each other and, in his case, a war on his family. Soderbergh shows us that the `war on drugs' isn't simply a war on drugs; it's a war on everything and everyone associated with drugs, from a Mexican policeman to a teenage addict to a dealer's wife. And no one gets away clean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's ambition got a little ahead of itself as the characters developed at a slower rate than the frantic pace of the movie.Take for example the incomplete development of Arnie Metzger, played by Dennis Quaid. This character goes from business accomplice of Carl Ayala, to making a silent pass at Helena Ayala, to being murdered by Carl's thugs for plotting against him. These are the only three scenes that this character really appears in the film so I assume that any other developments depicting his traitorous acts ended up on the cutting room floor.If the director wants to make a social commentary about the state of America's war on drugs, why include unrelated subplots?This underdevelopment extends to most of the character w/ the exception of Javier Rodriguez who miraculously betrays both Mexican cocaine cartels and the Mexican drug enforcement agency and lives to tell about it.Obviously at this point, the film has lost all elements of believability and basically unravels into a celebrity display while delivering a stern message that the war on drugs begins and ends with consumer demand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the whole, fails to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was I the only person who wasn't overly impressed by this movie? Sure, it had its strong points... very persuasive acting by many of the film's co-stars (del Toro, Cheadle, Guzman)... some very well-directed realistic action scenes (the two that come to mind instantly are those involving Cheadle and Guzman)... and let's not forget the interesting filming techniques and unique cinematography employed by Soderbergh. However, the film as a whole is not satisfying. During many of the scenes involving the "Michael Douglas and his Daughter" thread, I was bored because of the sheer predictability of it all. Although the chemistry between Cheadle and Guzman in the DEA thread is enjoyable, it's something that has already been done before in a number of movies. It appears as if the only thread that brings something new to the table, is that involving 'Manolo' and 'Javier' (del Toro). In addition, most likely due to Soderbergh's "realism" angle, the film is awfully slow-paced; in some scenes, downright boring. Soderbergh's earlier effort "Erin Brockovich" is by far the better of the two, and I don't see how this movie can beat an epic like "Gladiator" for the title of "Movie of the Year", which seems to be a possibility. But I don't let critics make my opinion and you shouldn't either. I suggest you see this film, both to decide for yourself if it was worth all the hype and to gain a realistic, inside look at America's War on Drugs. My rating: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. Being a film student now, and being taught about everything film proper, this film breaks the mold, Soderburgh spent 50 mllion bucks on a hand held no lighting shoot and pulled it off. It used the film medium to tell the story, it is told using sound and pictures. Good films allow film to tell the story, not have the story have to be told on film. This was such a great movie, the acting was tremendous, especially by Topher Grace and Erika Christensen. I really liked how Soderburgh did not insult the audience by using too many unnecessary cutaways and ended the movie basically in the middle. The drug war will never be won, why not watch a game?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first it's almost like an indie type art house film with blue, yellow, orangish frames. Several stories are going on at once. Although the pace somewhat drags, you can't help but stay to find out what happens next. I warn everyone, this is a LONG film. The stadium seats became very uncomfortable. this film would be better enjoyed at home were you can change your seating positions. However, the harsh realities that are portrayed, the acting, the cameos, make the film worth it. For those that got up and left, you missed a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw part of traffic being filmed in San Diego, so I was predisposed to liking it. However, it really has nothing interesting to say. Yea, the war on drugs cannot be won. But like one of the characters says in the movie, "Tell me something I don't already know." I think movie buffs will be much more interested in the style, both the Dogma 95 techniques, of handheld cameras, all location shooting, etc. Go see Crouching Dragon instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie with two (2) absurd scenes. 1. The speech by Michael Douglas at the end of the movie before the press corps. Absolutely unbelievable. 2. The scene in the parking lot outside the courthouse after the key witness is temporarily unable to testify. You mean to tell me eight federal agents can't see a guy in dark glasses and a dark suit pulling out a gun about 15 feet away from them?! Huh?! Also, the food delivery scene at the hotel stretches the imagination. Two cliches I hate in movies--the frantic, hysterical woman and the stupid cop. Both scenes could and should have been written better. Overall, a very good movie. But give me a pair of scissors and I could have brought it to you under two (2) hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Over Hyped Film of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the very high rating that most of the media gave "Traffic" I was excited to see what was obviously going to be the best film of the year. However, the first night it showed, the theatres were so full that I had to buy advance tickets for the next day. The next day I was surprised when the theatre was half-full when we seated ourselves. Now that I've seen the film, I figure the word of mouth must already be out on this overly-long, mockumentary.Others have written that some storylines were vastly superior to others. That's a major understatement; the Don Cheadle (Montel Gordon)and Benicio Del Toro (Javier Rodriguez)segments were the only ones that had any active acting and a storyline worth watching. Prior to the film, I read reviews about Katherine Zeta-Jones "Oscar caliber performance," and my only question is, "Who paid those people off?" She gave a lackluster performance in a nothing role. Michael Douglas's storyline was so insipid, and his performance so uninspired, that I halfway expected the audience to acknowledge his segments like the professor's on "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" with a resounding chant of "Boring."This film needs some serious editing. Based on a BBC miniseries shown on PBS, it shows like someone taped all the episodes of a miniseries and strung them together. It is overly long, and the Michael Douglas segments were so stultifying that they incited a mass exodus for cigarette and potty breaks, refreshment runs, and cell phone conversations by the audience.By the way, the real low point of this film was a Douglas segment where his daughter is (gasp) having sex with a black drug dealer, and I heard audible disgust from a viewing audience that had ho hummed an earlier scene where she's shot up heroin. Nothing like using racism to jolt the sensibilities.There were some good performances, most notably Cheadle, Tomas Milian as General Arturo Salazar, and Del Toro. However, regardless of Del Toro's standout performance, if Steven Soderbergh was hoping to achieve a gritty authenticity, he really should have used a Mexican actor because Del Toro's Puerto Rican Spanish sounded very out-of-place in Tijuana. He seemed at a loss when trying to use Mexican slang. This also underscores a cultural insensitivity because Steven Soderbergh doesn't seem to be aware that there are differences in accents and idioms between Hispanic cultures. After all this time, there should at least be a "token" acknowledgement for differences in Hispanic culture in films. For example, if a film is set in Florida, actors of Cuban descent should be used; if it's set in NYC Puerto Rican actors might be used; in California, use actors of Mexican descent. If not, at the very least, for the sake of authenticity, use a language coach.I rate films on a tier of "big screen," "video," and "cable." I recommend this one for the "video" category because you can employ the fast forward button to maximise your viewing enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Deserves all of the 5 important Oscars, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview for this movie, it didn't really interest me. It's not that I thought it would be bad, it just didn't catch my eye. However, after reading 4-star review after 4-star review, I went to see it. Boy was I glad I did. The acting was superb, the filmmaking was great, and the cinematography was outstanding. This film deserves all of the 5 big oscars (picture, director, actor, actress, &amp; writer). There's only one problem: there really is no main actor in this film. Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, and Benicio del Toro all had equal amounts of time on screen. There wasn't one actor that appeared much more than another (of the three listed above). So I guess it could win 4 of the big 5, plus best supporting actor (that would be a hard choice to decide which one gets it though). But I can tell you right now that this film will get the Oscar for Best Cinematography.Anyway, Oscars aside, this film is purely outstanding. Get off of your computer chair and run to the nearest theatre and go see it.10/10 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the finest films I have seen in a very long time. It takes a complicated and seemingly intractable subject and examines it at all levels, from the intensely personal to the universal political.The writing is exceptional.Obviously, director Soderberg can get a stellar performance out of just about anyone, even Orrin Hatch. Attention to detail (notice the pupils of the actors playing drug abusers) and a refusal to preach or engage in cinematic politics makes this film a real winner.Among a fine ensemble cast, I was most impressed with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Dennis Quaid. Both turn in world-class performances, and watching their transformation during this film, seeing the choices they make and the reasons they make those choices, is absolutely riveting and believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made, some fine acting, didn't blow me away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so the buzz on "Traffic" was that it was FANTASTIC, already one of the must-sees. So I must saw.Bear in mind, now, that having just seen "Gladiator" recently, I was only moderately impressed, rather than being floored. Same thing here. I thought this was a VERY well-made film, with lots of fine acting and some good scenes. But memorable? Nah.Overall, it just didn't grab me in the way "Requiem for a Dream" or even the predictably David-vs-Goliath "Erin Brockovich" did. Several of the killings were virtually telegraphed, as predictable as a hundred TV shows. The relationship between Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman's characters was fun, but not a big stretch from Don Johnson and Cheech Marin on "Nash Bridges". And, as with "Gladiator", the grass roots scuffling of a highly placed person may make for a good dramatic premise, but is plain unbelievable. Even more so in modern times.Lots of good things, of course. Fine acting, especially from the Mexican cast. Arty but clever use of filters for two sides of the border. The drug sequence between the teens is made way more believable by their very true-to-life philosophical babbling.Just, somehow, it didn't coalesce for me into a single powerful forward movement (as "Requiem" for instance certainly does.) I found myself admiring pieces rather than being swept away by the whole.Amusing too at the end to be reminded that it was produced by the guys who did "Thirty Something". When I saw "Bedford Falls Productions", I kept waiting for a folk choir to go: "And DANCE by the light of the moon...".Jim Chevallier</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drugs are bad, mmkay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have appreciated this film much more if before it started, there was the following disclaimer:Drugs are bad. This is the conclusion it took us millions of dollars to articulate. If you want to waste the next two and a half hours of your life seeing how we did this, please stay in your seat._Traffic_ is just inexcusable, especially when you consider the fine talent that went into it. I don't even know where to begin... I suppose we should just go point by point.1) Screenplay: I heard an interview in which Michael Douglas said that this film was meant to present three closely interwoven stories. I suppose "closely interwoven stories" is supposed to mean "unrelated and random episodes concerning similar themes." The entire film was completely disjointed and made only minor attempts to connect its three major plotlines. The number of characters in the film is beyond unwieldy, as evidenced by the thin dialogue and number of lines we hear from each actor. Quaid, who gets near-top billing, probably has about 20 lines throughout the film.2) Style: Every story in this film looks different. Now, I'm just a college student with some background in film, but I'm not sure that this promotes cohesion. It smacks of a bad Kubrick imitation.3) Overwhelming and oppressive agenda: the political anti-conservativism of this film is just overwhelming. If any other group had been portrayed this badly in a film, there would be a major poop-storm over it. Honestly, though, the teens-doing-drugs-under-the-noses-of-their-conservative-parents scenes were so over the top that I actually found myself wondering if the film was trying to be funny.Ugh...if this film wins Oscars over _Quills_ and _O Brother Where Art Thou_ I will be be seriously disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Awesome Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i got wind of this movie a couple months ago, I was thinking it would make for an interesting movie. When the trailer came out and I viewed it, I got sucked in wanting to know more about what the movie was truly about. I saw it last night at a sold out theatre (people were sitting in the aisles!!) and everyone was blown away. This movie left me thinking how the war on drugs might be going on in this country. It is interesting to think how someone fighting the drug war would have someone close to them as an addict. The corruption in Mexico and the trafficing and dealing into the states was just as important as well. Steve Soderbergh did a truly remarkable job: It was perfect to have all the Mexico scenes filmed in the yellow hue and the Washington/Cincinnati scenes be filmed in blue...it made following things a lot easier and eventually the connections came together as scenes shifted. Performances were outstanding: The more i see of Benecio Del Toro, the more i think he is gonna make it big one day. I think he just did. Douglas and Zeta-Jones did over the top jobs. If you do not get this movie...it might be cause you had a hard time following the scenes shifting...that is what makes this film great...Thankfully i understood it and it is a great film 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, the definition for `Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?' [French Connection]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dive head first into the Belly of the Beast. Drugs! Where do they come from, where do they go ... and how are real lives affected? If you really want to know, this cesspool spills skillfully onto the screen in several intertwined tales that riveted my attention for 160 short minutes. Two governments (US and Mexico), a drug lord and an American Family offer storylines that intersect and leave you with more reality than you could possibly hope for.The belly of the beast (a drug shipment interception) is where you start. You slide deeply down into the bowels of the cartels and their oily circles of influence. Separating the good from the bad and the ugly is a daunting task for the viewer. Little is as it seems to be. Nice is ruthless; ruthless can be nice. It's a business. Move the powder. All of it makes this film believable.Though only an expert could confirm, logic and the senatorial cameos tell me this work accurately microscopes into the drug world's inner workings. It's laundry day for the cartel machinery, hanging it out on the line for viewers to inspect. It delivers an entertaining education into a reality affecting 22% of the U.S. population: an eye opener for those of us (me!) who live with our heads in the sand vis a vis this reality.The cast is spectacular. Their reputations each deliver the goods, so I'll save the accolades. There are, however, two noteworthy `coming out' performances. Topher Grace (Eric on `That 70s show') demonstrates he's got range beyond just hanging out in the basement. Erika Christensen (Caroline, the daughter) will be a pursued Hollywood commodity on the heels of her addict portrayal. Summing: Casting's Debra Zane, `. . .ya done good.'30 years ago, in the French Connection, 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) asks an addict, `Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?' Traffic gives you the HOW TO version while defining his catch phrase question once and for all. The picture itself is a course in the ways of the addict; but the film is so well-crafted on the consequences side of the balance, it's a course from which wise people will veer clear.A second viewing will be necessary for me to collect all the gems this movie has to offer. Viewers and moviemakers alike are the winners. My first rock solid, irretrievable, whole-hearted IMDB `10' goes to Traffic. It earned it. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three different shades of colours...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie basically for two things:1) Screenplay - For a movie that lengthend to about two and-a-half hours, I was impressed as to how the screenplay kept everyone in synch with the movie. Every scenario got it's share, and every scenario ended up blending in with everyone else's scenario somewhat.Probably the most interesting part was when Benicio Del Toro went to the baseball game at the end of the movie. I had no clue that the cast was going to come up like it did. For a movie of it's length, I could sense when it would end. For "Traffic," I couldn't see it. It's like it struck me in the face with cold water softly. That element also gave me the idea that this movie had no begining or end. Everything started in the middle, and everything finished in the middle. There was no positive solution; Montel (Cheadle) continued to keep his eye on Zeta-Jones' husband, Caroline (Christensen) tried her best to get off her addiction with the aid of her parents, and Jaiver (Del Toro) saw the youth that were going to be the future in the baseball scene.2) Cinematogrophy - Spotting the imagery in a movie for the first time is very interesting and it gives you so many ways of looking at that particular movie. In "Traffic," there are three basic locations for the three scenarios: Mexico (Tijuwana, Mexico City), San Diego, and Cincinati/Washington, D.C. Everytime a scene took place in Mexico (mainly Tijuwana), the camera's quality was a bit different and a strong reflective colour of sun yellow was always there. In Cincinati and Washington D.C., the colour was always a clear morning-sky blue. In San Diego, it was right in between Mexico and Cincinati.The point is, I noticed that where ever corruption lingered around (where it was visible), it was surrounded and shown by the strong yellow light of Mexico. Whenever the blue light was shown, it was in a place where order and attempted resolve to drugs was present. Supposedly, this blue light symbolized purified American; perfection. And, in San Diego,the light was not too strong. No one could tell that Zeta-Jones' husband was the leader of a cartel. No one around their neighberhood could tell.The light was neutral.Bottom line: The movie's elements' two main elements (stated above) were what I could see flat out. If it hadn't been for those two main elements, not even the acting (which was excellent, by the way) could've saved this movie.Excellent job, Mr. Soderbergh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*one spoiler at end*After reading comments on this film. I kept reading the term "cliche". But this film was based on the truth. I think the truth is cliche. The reason why people do drugs IS cliche. That is the truth. Some parents don't pay attention to their children. That is the truth. Lots of people in the world don't feel loved. That is the truth. People do drugs to feel good for a few moments. That is the truth. And I very much appreciated the last scene where Michael Douglas says "We are here to listen." Thank you. That is all people who get caught up in drugs asks for. They want to feel loved. They want to feel like someone cares about them. They want to have something else that makes them feel good.You want to fight the war against drugs? Love your children. It all starts in the home. I know that sounds "cliche", but that is the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary: Non-stop jerky camera. Bad color. Cliché-ridden.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good news. Kids who see this movie will not want to do drugs; and you care about the Mexican cop. The rest is bad news. This movie has "Important Movie about Drug Problem" written all over it. Every other spoken line is a cliched message about some aspect of the drug problem, accompanied by non-stop jerky camera motion, and followed by the same funny noise that substitutes for a film score. The color is artsy.Bleached yellow for Mexico and bleached blue for the US. The political message is so broad in scope that Democrats will be able to embrace it as politically correct, and Republicans will not be offended. The plot is cliched and predictable beyond belief. It steals broadly from all the drug movies you've seen. Big chunks of the plot are stupid. Rich judge searches ghetto for daughter. (Why didn't he think to hire a PI?) Cops can't protect key witness. (They trust anybody.) Politicians argue in vain about how to/differ ways to stop the flow of drugs across the border. (But of course no one suggests asking Pat Buchanan or the Israeli Army how to do it.)Another thing the movie does is point out how quick family members are to save their loved ones after they do something stupid. Catherine Zeta-Jones(Douglas)' character's husband is arrested. She yells at him, but then suddenly changes her mind, and sets out to have a bunch of guys killed. Too many abrupt changes in story line makes movie hard to follow. Stephen Soderbergh should have made this movie without all of the jerky camera garbage, color changes, and actually have a film score. Please, for god's sake, change the movie when you release it on DVD. Then again, judging by how many theaters this film is playing in, people may forget that it was ever released</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow.... what a letdown.... with all the hype and the critics comments i was expecting this to really be a film to remember... i walked out thinking that maybe some of the themes of the film were gutsy (showing the rich elites of america involved in the drug trade), but even they weren't original, since the film is a re-make..... the cinematography was excellent... some of the sepea shots of mexico were grand...but the acting... oh how awful some of it was.... Michael Douglas, surely his worst ever role... Dennis Quaid... did he actually add anything to this film? Catherine Zeta-Jones... yeah, i know she was supposed to play a plastic La Jolla type, but she was terrible... but thankyous to Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro and Erika Christensen.... they made the movie interesting....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie exploring drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best movie I've seen covering drugs. I rated it a 9 only because of a few small flaws:1. There are a few times when I felt the characters were preachy on 2-3 occasions.2. I felt the excellent cinematography had some undertones of racism towards Mexicans. None of the friends I watched the movie with noticed them and I don't think Soderbough had intentions to have them especially in the light of his pro African-American spiel.That said, I haven't left a movie feeling so personally affected by a movie since possibly _The_Mission_. Even though my life has never been directly affected by drugs, the movie let me feel personally involved. I think it was so effective because a high level of excellence pervaded almost every part of the movie: directing, acting, writing, and cinematography are the portions that particularly stood out to me.This movie is a perfect example of what the best movies should be. It examines a tough issue and makes you think about it long after you've left the theater. In fact, it is the type of movie that could help change public policy because of how it affects its viewers. I highly recommend the film to any interested readers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-key but powerful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The overexposed film and hand-held cameras make for a documentary look to this hard-hitting but low-key, realistic look at the drug tragedy. The film shows the spider web interconnections of power, money, drugs, violence, and our self-inflicted addictions. We want a "Fun Zone" life that takes us "Straight to the Top" (watch for those two phrases in the movie). We have "legal drugs" pushed by drug companies, and we have the over-the-counter drugs of alcohol and cigarettes. But we make fools of ourselves by thinking that a puny "drug war" is going to free us of the terrible problems we create for ourselves.An all-star cast portrays the intricate sides of the drug tragedy. This is not a simple good-vs.-evil issue which too many people believe it is. It won't be solved with more money, more police, and more prisons. The film clearly shows that the US, while preaching against drugs, is impotent to stop the tragedy as long as it is easier for teens to get illegal drugs than it is to get alcohol. The "drug war" will always fail as long as ghetto kids can make fortunes selling drugs rather than working "regular" jobs.The futility of fighting a war against foreign drug dealers is depicted vividly as the film reveals that the war is actually a civil war against our own families -- the users who create the demand for drugs. The film offers no simple formulas as solutions, but it does suggest that the only way to win this "war" is to listen to and support the people who have become enslaved by their tragic addictions. The final scene at the baseball game makes a soft, silent, but profound concluding comment.The real miracle would be if this movie wakes people up from their smug assumptions that something is being "done" about drugs when, in fact, the problem is right here under our own noses -- literally and figuratively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows, deep down, that the war on drugs is a failure, a fraud, a joke, and a cancer, except the people at the top who are perpetrating it. Some of them may be good hearted, and they just don't know any better. There have been lots of movies which tried to be an expose on the futility of the drug war, but what influence will they have on the law? Does anyone think that the drug czar or any senator has actually seen Grass or Bad Lieutenant, for example?So then this movie comes along and does a brilliant thing, it makes a movie showing the drug war for what it is, and it casts Senators (such as Utah Mormon Senator Orrin Hatch) in cameo roles. I know that Orrin Hatch has seen the film (he gave an interview to the Salt Lake Tribune about it), and I'm fairly certain that many of his colleagues, and not just the ones who appeared in it aside him, also have - because everyone wants to see a movie if their friends are in it. This is such a great ploy on Soderbergh's part. Upon first hearing about this I thought Soderbergh was doing the same thing Bunuel did with Viridiana. Viridiana was a blasphemous film made with the full cooperation of Franco's Catholic Spain - Spanish officials even praised it and accepted the award at Cannes for him, until they saw it, were humiliated, and banned it. Bunuel was delighted. So here's Traffic with a cameo by clueless Orrin Hatch, who is later giving interviews about how he supports the film's "strong anti-drug message", and I thought this was Soderbergh's way of getting a laugh. Then I realized it's the way he's trying to make sure the message gets to the right people.That's the best thing about the film. As far as just a film, it's worth watching, it's good, I enjoyed it a lot, even though it is a little sappy sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic is an excellent depiction of an international epidemic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the explosion of illegal drug use in America in the 1960's, countless films have been made that try to give an accurate depiction of what has become an international problem. Until Traffic, most of these films never seemed to get it quite right. From eye-candy action flicks to well intended thrillers like Clear and Present Danger(1994), these previous efforts were usually entertaining; but the angles that they took often felt inaccurate and overdramatized.Unlike these earlier films, Traffic delivers a certain realism that fuels the numerous angles that are investigated in its telling. These perspectives gradually come together as the story progresses, providing the film with a sense of scope that is unparalleled in its predecessors. Ingenious cinematography aids the story in its plot transitions, most notably when the focus of the story shifts across the border from the United States to Mexico.The entire cast delivers brilliant performances, especially Benicio Del Toro and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Look for Traffic to receive several nominations from the Academy, including best picture, not to mention best director, Steven Soderbergh, who may also be nominated for Erin Brockovich. Traffic is easily one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

The extensive use of spanish sub-titles were sometimes distracting. The brownish-tint colorization of scenes taking place in Mexico is overdused.Benicio Del Toro (of Usual Suspects fame; "He'll flip ya.

		<shortDescription>A very different drug movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic: On September 5, 1989 George Bush announced his "War on Drugs" platform intended to combat the explosion in cocaine use among the yuppies of the "Me Decade". Good intentions aside, the program was doomed from the beginning: there was no consensus on how to attack the problem, the different law enforcement units (local, state and federal) refused to play well together, and unlike the arms race, there was no way the government could outspend the nouveau riche druglords. Consequently, several years and billions of dollars later, America found itself on the losing end of its third war. It doesn't look like anything is about to change anytime soon.As the new drug czar it is Robert Wakefield's job to solve the nation's drug problem, but he faces several dilemmas: should he target supply or demand? Fund treatment, or pass stiffer sentences? And how can he hope to solve an omnipresent global issue when he can't even keep his daughter away from crack? Meanwhile, in the border town of Tijuana, Javier Rodriguez is the one good cop in a bad town trying to wipe out the local cartel on a whopping salary of $350 a month. Will he sell out or keep fighting for the principles he has sworn to uphold? Finally, when her husband is arrested, Helena Ayala discovers that her upper class lifestyle is funded by his cocaine smuggling business. This is accompanied by the realization that she really likes the finer things in life and isn't about to give them up for something as minor as a major felony. Six golden globe nominations, "Best Movie of the Year" predictions, widespread accolades and "Traffic" hasn't even opened yet. Is it that good? It depends on how you rate a movie. I like to start with the cast. Michael Douglas is riveting as Robert, turning in his second great performance of the year (remember "The Wonder Boys"?). Robert is a committed man and arguably one of the most powerful people in the world, but he becomes so wrapped up in his work that he doesn't realize that his home life is crumbling. When he finally takes notice, and discovers his daughter's problem, he is humbled to discover that he is utterly powerless. Douglas avoids becoming the cliched "Death Wish" dad out for vengeance, instead he sincerely tries to understand and help his daughter. Benicio Del Toro does an outstanding job as Javier, the poor Mexican cop trying to do the right thing. Del Toro's understated man-of-few-words style serves him well and you marvel at his character's determination. Erika Christensen is fantastic as the beautiful-straight-A-student daughter who also happens to be a drug addict. Her freshness is matched only by the burned out shell that remains after her binges. Keep a close eye on this young woman. Then there is Topher Grace, the smart mouth from "That 70's Show" who plays a smart mouth, street-wise rich kid whose gift for glib is amazing. Finally, the bulk of the supporting cast, notably Don Cheadle, Miguel Ferrer, and Luiz Guzman, does a wonderful job. But there's more to a movie than the cast.The parallel plot lines are not only different in terms of locations and characters, indeed, almost pulp-fictionesque, they are also very different stylistically. Whenever the story is following Robert or the characters in his world, the scenes are shot with ever-present rich hues of blue. When the story follows Javier in Mexico, the scene is shot in sepia, with the same washed out look that was used in "The Three Kings", and is reminiscent of an episode of "Cops" - rapid, jerky, camera movements, and quick zooms. The shots for Helena however, slowly evolve, changing from bright locations, to shadows and dimly lit rooms as her character changes. One of my favorite scenes is the shot of a moving and descending helicopter filmed from beneath - it is striking, and made me feel claustrophobic. With the good, comes the bad.The change in Catherine-Zeta Jones' character is too rapid and extreme to be believable. The audience is expected to believe that a pregnant upper-class woman who believes her husband is a legitimate businessman can be transformed into a sophisticated big time drug dealer and cold-blooded killer in the space of a week. And she manages to do this- by herself - while her husband is in jail. It was simply too far fetched. And what is with Benjamin Bratt? I realize he is dating Julia Roberts, and is a good-looking specimen of a man, but I wasn't sure what I found more ridiculous - his character or his accent? I also had problems with the pat ending - everything turned out too well. And although I enjoyed the stylistic use of color in the film (previous paragraph), I liked it better when I saw it the first time around in "Tuvalu". Finally, I think several sequences could have been edited out, and brought the runtime down from 150 minutes without adversely affecting the final product.An interesting take on a complex issue, and definitely worth seeing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the arty look of Traffic (differing film stocks for differing story lines) and a stellar cast (Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Cheadle and the subtle, yet intense, Del Toro), this is nothing more than a "message movie". An "After School Special" all growed up.And not that it would excuse anything if it were, but it's not even a nobody-knows-what's-going-on, we-have-to-get-the-word-out kind of message. "The War on Drugs was Lost" has been an oft heard lament (not to mention a bumper sticker) for over a decade. And "Treatment, not incarceration" was voted into law two months ago, at least in California.Frankly, I expected more than just savvy camera work from Soderbergh. He broke the Cardinal Rule of film-making (a practice rampant in Hollywood) "Show! Don't tell!" Artists illuminate, they don't preach.If this heavy-handed, propagandistic, yet beautifully filmed (i.e. American Beauty) trend continues we'll have to hire someone (Randy Newman?) to compose a National Message Theme Song to march to at rallies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual excellence and earnest exploration could have gone further in "Traffic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With complexity and hopelessness at best, and symbolism and subliminal messages at worst, Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" is a visually stimulating drugOne of the very best films of 2000, Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" percolates on a canvas that stretches from the American Midwest to Washington's beltway, to El Paso, Texas, to San Diego and into and beyond Tijuana, Mexico. "Traffic" has the visual feel, style and breadth of Michael Mann's "Heat" (and "The Insider" for that matter), a film it matches in mood, tone, music and well-sketched characters - who have nuance and complexity. The film has an ensemble cast to display solid acting skills. These performers include Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Steven Bauer, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Salma Hayek, James Brolin and fine acting from Benicio Del Toro.One of the great things "Traffic" illustrates is that the only people who remain clear about what they do are the drug dealers, who appear on the international landscape as uncomplicated as ever. The "good guys" are the ones crossing the fine line between conviction in their objectives to fight a battle and contradictions in their own behaviors. The villains are not the drug dealers. The villain as exemplified in "Traffic" is hopelessness. The futile exercise of fighting drugs when they are already a worldwide, multi-trillion dollar business. The film is at its best when it becomes intricate and its characters' complexities multiply. The final 45 minutes unwinds in a poetic spiral, as tangled ends are either loosened or tied, or twisted and tangled tighter. Soderbergh is smart enough not to provide answers.Soderbergh does provide a stunning pallette of cinematic pictures. The director's use of different film stocks, including Super 16mm, complete with jump cuts, color drains and tints -- excellent cinematography by Soderbergh (whose alias for that particular credit is "Peter Andrews") -- give each of the venues in "Traffic" a distinct identity. The Kodak/Ecktachrome(?)-processed film stock for Mexico's golden hues brings us into the heat and heart of the many rival drug cartels; the ice-blue tone of the American Midwest renders a jaded, hopeless, colorless, lifeless and antiseptic existence that frames (and is metaphor of) a promising young woman's drug addiction; the dry, drab, officious look for Washington, D.C. that suggests an ordinary, methodical "business- as-usual" attitude toward the so-called "war on drugs"; and the deliberately too-bright glare of sunny San Diego - a glare suggesting that the everyday sunshine in one neighborhood is just too good to be true. All of these colorful and colorless textures are priceless. Most memorable is the shot of a deep blue-tinted corridor that flaunts numerous lights and intricate architecture, as Robert Wakefield (Douglas) takes a solitary walk from its entrance in the far distance until he passes us close-up, in silhouette. Wakefield's voice echoes as this shot is seen. This is the film's most outstanding photographic image.There is memorable dialogue from a smart script (Stephen Gaghan), spoken in particular by character Seth Abrams (Topher Grace) in an exchange with Wakefield in his car. This moment and several others ring with humor and truth at the same time. Another clever aspect of "Traffic" is its display of the network of characters that seamlessly pass by each other like cars, or cargo on the drug-runners' highway. These drivers, passengers and casualties of the drug trade do not suffer from road rage - they are strangers in the night and in the light - but they are connected because they are pawns of drug lords' mendacities."Traffic' plays like a documentary but avoids diving into deeper, provocative and appropriately relevant waters (like the U.S. government's funding of certain drug cartels by supplying arms to them; law enforcement shakedowns/takings of drugs from suspects - read the book "Buddy Boys" by Mike McAlary; and the heavy presence of billboard advertising of alcohol and "planting" of drugs by corrupt police in poor Black neighborhoods in America and how all of this impacts Blacks). Such scope and exploration would have made "Traffic" the vital and thought-provoking epic it deserved to be. Soderbergh could have been even more ambitious than he was. Interesting enough, he does show a subtle yet sinister effect in symmetry - specifically in the transformation of Caroline (Erika Christensen), Wakefield's daughter. Near the film's start, Seth (white) introduces Caroline (white) to cocaine at a friend's house and they end up making out. Near the end, a young man (black) is having sex with Caroline in a hotel room and injecting her with syringes.Though this scene is drug-hazed - almost dreamlike - the black male-white female sex here serves to both subtly and powerfully represent to white America one of its worst nightmares: the Black male's sexual "conquest" of the white female. This scene also subtly states that "Daddy's little girl" is really in trouble now - because the drugs that have consumed her have enabled her to go beyond drug addiction - it has now reached the penultimate horror: the Black male - and has become deathly - syringes/intravenous drug use...leading to AIDS, perhaps? - Soderbergh seems to say to white America that it should pay attention to the consequences that drug use (by some white females) might bring. At least the scene suggests such a message. Alternately however, the sex scene could instead represent the subtle metaphor for some Black men's drug of choice - the "white lady" - which in this scene has a double meaning (see "Jungle Fever".) Again, an exploration of the devastation of drugs in some Black neighborhoods (chronicled endlessly in the mainstream news media - some of whose film reviewers had asked Spike Lee why there were no drugs in the Black neighborhoods of his films - this was pre- "Clockers") and the complexities therein, would have been more honest. Instead, the background black (neighborhood) is a cardboard scenery backdrop in "Traffic." Perhaps Soderbergh, by not meaningfully exploring the Black terrain, is making another point, or reinforcing one - that nobody, especially white America, cares an iota about the drug problem as long as it remains in Black neighborhoods.There are many divides in America and around the world - generational divides, language divides, family divides, border divides and racial divides - but like music, drugs unite these divides, making them one. Unlike music however, the hazy blur of drug/people unification makes for deadly consequences - which "Traffic" eloquently depicts - most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite state of the art film making.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I greatly admire the tone and message of this film. Steven Soderbergh is a director with the good instincts to avoid the trappings of Hollywood visuals. 'Traffic' has an extraordinary documentary style look to it. Example, one scene has a car bomb going off and instead of editing it from a zillion angles, Soderbergh mutes the sound and shows it looking natural in such a way as you might see in an A&amp;E documentary on crime. He uses grainy photography when filming many of the scenes in Mexico and sharper images when contrasting it to the United States. A very subtle approach to such a powerful subject as drug trafficking and addiction and it works. There are great uses of hand held photography also. The cast is in good form although I must disagree with many who say that Benecio Del Toro will win the best supporting actor Oscar. He is good but his performance is not great. Michael Douglas plays a judge appointed to the position as head drug czar for the U.S. government. Douglas plays his part in the same way he did in 1983's 'The Star Chamber'. A family man caught in a moral dilemma, this time when he finds out his daughter is a drug addict. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays her part as a cross between a hapless and unsuspecting wife and a spider about to devour the fly caught in its web. The actor who really impressed me in this film was Don Cheadle. He plays a stake-out cop who knows his job well. Writer Stephen Gaghan's script has a few holes in it but it works. Finally, having said all of this, 'Traffic', for some unknown reason lacks that touch of greatness. It's simply in the way you feel it after you leave the theatre. You feel as if the story and final cut has been under played and it may require a few viewings to truly appreciate it.</fullReview>

Great actor, hope to see more of him in the future.While certainly not glorifying drug use, the story's truth lies in the fact that this 'war on drugs' is ridiculous and a complete waste of the taxpayer's money. Highly recommended and a good movie for parents with teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's best film to date!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Soderbergh has used some very interesting styles with his latest series of films. With OUT OF SIGHT, it was hip and humorous, THE LIMEY was dark and violent, ERIN BROCKIVICH was a harsh look at a corrupt and dangerous world with someone trying to do good. Now Soderbergh returns with a solid one-two punch at the view's with TRAFFIC. Entertainment Weekly predicted that TRAFFIC would be a mixture of THE FRENCH CONNECTION and NASHVILLE, and guess what? They were right! This film is very similar to a Robert Altman film, a series of characters who all have different stories to tell, but they all have one thing in common: drugs. First there is Judge Robert Lewis (Michael Douglas) a Ohio judge who gets appointed to the Supreme Court as the drug czar and is cracking down on illegal drugs being brought into the states from Mexico. The tragic irony is that Robert is so busy looking for the drug kings that he is blinded to see that his won daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) is a drug addict. Then there's Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) a Mexican police officer who is cracking down and stopping the traffic of narcotics in Tijuana, despite his superior's corrupt affairs with the drug barons. Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) are American DEA agents who are gathering information on prosecuting the biggest dealer in the U.S., Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). While Carlo's wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is talking with her husband's attorney, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) on seeing how she can prove her husband's innocence, and getting an assassination hit on Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrea) the prosecuter's lead witness. All of these stories intertwine together giving the viewer a disturbing look at the war on drugs. How Mexican officers kill and tourture associates of drug leaders just to get information on their bosses whereabouts is similar to the cruel punishment that German and American soldiers gave their enemies during the two world wars. The "battle" being fought in the homefront with the wife of a drug king doing her part on how she can get her husband safely back home. On the battlefront with both DEA agents and police officers hunting down and even shooting and killing people. The politics on how two sides can unite to fight this war when both sides have their skeleton's in the closets. And even family envolvement with the war, on how a leader doesn't realize that his only child is his own enemy, yet doesn't see it since she is a honor student. I found TRAFFIC to be a powerful and excellent film, this is the kind of movie that gathers a dozen Oscar nominations in Febuary. I found the acting in this film to be first-rate, especially by Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro. Douglas has been getting well received praise from his last film WONDER BOYS, but in TRAFFIC I found his performance to be more emotional and more realistic. And Benicio Del Toro give a performance with most of his dialogue spoken in Spanish! Yet, Del Toro still does a fantastic job with his character as a lonely soldier in enemy territory. And Erika Christensen gives a welcome performance that will be noteworthy in her career. And Steve Soderbergh does a brilliant job with so much with this film. First is the connection of all of these stories in the film, how a character in one story will sooner or later connect with a character from another story. Then there's the cinematography, Soderbergh has a different color and texture with each of the three locations in TRAFFIC. For Mexico he gives it a bright yellow color with grainy or dirty image similar to THREE KINGS. For California, it's more wholesome, brown for a homestead setting with families like OUT OF SIGHT. And for Ohio and Washington D.C. it's more of a cold and blue coloring which was also in THE INSIDER. The pacing of the film is very fast as well. For a 150 minute film, it went by very quickly, that I couldn't believe how much time went by so quickly since I was so engrossed with the feature. Along with ALMOST FAMOUS and THE CONTENDER, I found TRAFFIC to be among the top movies of this year! It's a film that deals with a controversial issue that effects all of us. We all know someone who is or has been involved with drugs. Even I have a few friends that have and still are part of the drug culture. And it gives us a look at what is perhaps the longest war that America has been involved with. It's been going on for over twenty years, and there is no end in sight for it. And what's even scarier is how a few of the characters in the film that are involved with drugs, make very good points on why the police should stop this enforcement on drugs. It's similar to the bootlegging stories that were told in THE UNTOUCHABLES, although it's illegal, everyone is either doing it, or knows someone that is doing it. This is a remarkable film, and should easily get a nomination for Best Picture! Do yourself a favor, if your a film fan, go see this movie! And if you or know someone who uses drugs, then see this as well. Because no matter how hard we're going to try to fight the war against narcotics, it's going to be a long war. And war is hell. Don't miss it! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long but very absorbing.Benicio del Toro IS fabulous: whenever he's on-screen, the attention is fully occupied by his subtle inhabitation of a multi-faceted character; his body language is perfect and his hooded face somehow reveals whatever is needed.So many other actors and actresses also deliver wonderful performances, no matter the role or level of star-power...and there's lots of both in this drug-war epic. (The actors playing "Frankie Flowers" and "General Salazar" are just two shivery examples of excellence.)I saw the British miniseries this movie is based on ("Traffik"), and Soderbergh's version goes much deeper in exploring complex and confusing humanity, and primal, controlling forces.The movie's cinematography is sensual, with lovely hues: Mexican scenes slightly sepia; the U.S. washed in cold blue. All locales are filmed with a caressing attention to texture and detail, whether rough and weathered or sharp and polished.For me one lingering theme of Soderbergh's "Traffic" was the power of strong-willed, risk-taking individuals to affect their environments in ways that may seem small and isolated, but can have tremendous impact.My only caveat is the ending seemed maybe a bit pat in terms of tying up loose ends.Warning: Considering the topic, there are surprisingly few drug and violence episodes, but those are VERY graphic and wrenching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is trying way too hard. There are so many holes and undeveloped characters. Michael Douglas' daughter is so over the top, that you can't take her character seriously. You never learn why she has so many problems??? You'd think that Soderbergh would have been able to sort out some of these issues in the overbearing 2.5 hours of running time, but he doesn't. Most people will be bored out of their minds and those that aren't will just say that they like it because the critics tell them to like it. This is a very amateur attempt, especially after such films as "Erin Broc." and "Out of Sight." I give it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about impact of drug use in USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at an Amazon.com pre-screen. It is really good. It's long (2.5+ hours) but I really enjoyed it. This is an anti-drug movie. It shows how drug use affects those around them, and how the war on drugs is failing. The impact of the war on drugs and its impact on their families is more far reaching than you think. It affects many, many lives. The "two-tone" camera work (Mexican scenes are grainy, high saturation film, where USA scenes are standard) is really neat. The all-star cast (and I mean ALL star, deep down to the bit parts) is what makes this movie. It does run a bit long and takes a while to get to the point, which I took to be that a kid using drugs today impacts everything -- and creates the cartels, drug dealers, and ruins families. Michael Douglas is pretty good as the US drug czar who's own daughter is a smack/crack/dope head, but his, as other characters, could have been developed better. The exception to this is the fantastic Benicio Del Toro, beefed up for this role, and he does shine as a the Mexican state police officer. His all-Spanish speaking role is subtitled throughout (as is all the Mexican scenes, a smart move which lends authenticity). Also well developed is Don Cheadle, who plays an American cop who loses his partner. The USA-side scene stealer is Topher Grace whom who know as "Eric" on "That 70's show" making his feature film debut. His (unintended) funny political introspective on the white American drug problem is well-written and played. He will be back on the big screen. If you saw "Kids" and was shocked by how "in your face" the acting, sex, and drug use was, this movie will rekindle those feelings. It can be very, very disturbing. This is an all-drama movie, very little "action" and its causes you to reflect on drug use in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, until the final ten minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching Traffic until the final ten minutes, which struck me as a slapped on Hollywood ending. It was so bad and full of ridiculously unrealistic hope. Sappy and schmalzy. Really. If the fascinating pastiche and intertwining narratives had ended where they should have, with the death of the scummy lawyer who was going to abscond with $3 million of his client's drug money and steal his wife but instead got whacked, then the film would have made sense.But no, we learn that the highly driven US government administrator who obviously spent his whole life in singleminded, obsessive pursuit of success has renounced his position and professional future to ... drumroll ... attend AA meetings with his boring wife (by his own characterization) and their teenage daughter and former crack-ho. As though that were not enough, we are told that the cop whose partner was killed by the drug dealer will eventually exact revenge, having planted an ILLEGAL bug in the couple's home. Hello? Okay, granted this story was produced pre-NSA snooping, but even then the evidence would not have held up in a court of law. Soderbergh should have stuck with the ambiguous oscillation between nihilism and crass realism. That was a thought-provoking film with flair. I recommend this for viewing, but do yourself a favor and turn it off at the ten-minute before the finish mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, that's not "Traffic"&nbsp;as in "cars on the road"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, that's not "Traffic"&nbsp;as in "cars on the road", and it's not a remake of Jacques Tati's classic comedy. That's "Traffic" as in "the&nbsp;illegal drug trade". The film is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the style of film-making which uses several different story lines intercut with one another rather than following one another sequentially (as in the "portmanteau film"). Generally, these various story lines have a single unifying theme, here that of drug trafficking. The style is said to have been pioneered by the late Robert Altman in films like "Short Cuts" and became popular in the 2000s; "Crash", "Syriana", "The Hours" and "Babel" are other well-known examples from that decade. Here there are three separate story lines. In one a Mexican general launches a crack-down on the operations of a drug-smuggling gang, but only because he is in the pay of another cartel who want their rivals put out of business. In another a San Diego businessman named Carlos Ayala is arrested by America's Drug Enforcement Administration who believe him, with good reason, to be a major drug dealer, much to&nbsp;the shock of his pregnant young wife Helena who always believed her husband's business to be legitimate. The third story concerns Robert Wakefield, a judge who is appointed as the&nbsp;President's&nbsp;drug Czar but who discovers that his own teenage daughter, Caroline, has a serious drug problem. There is a certain amount of interlinking between the stories; one character from the Mexican story, for example, is hired as an assassin to try and kill the main witness against Ayala. Director Steven Soderbergh uses the device (also used by&nbsp;Stephen Daldry in "The Hours") of adopting a distinctive&nbsp;cinematographic&nbsp;tint for each story; this is particularly noticeable in the Mexican scenes, which have very muted colours. From my perspective, the best of the three story lines was that involving Judge Wakefield, a sombre but moving tale involving characters with whom the viewer could identify. There is a particularly distinguished contribution from Michael Douglas as the judge, a hardliner who finds his hard line beginning to soften when he realises that the drug issue, previously something of which he had only had academic knowledge, is something which affects his family personally. (The role was apparently first offered to Harrison Ford, who turned it down partly because he was not offered enough money and partly because he wanted to "reconnect with his action fans.") Erika Christensen, only eighteen at the time, is&nbsp;also very good as the tormented Caroline, which makes me wonder why she was so bad in the only other film in which I have seen her, "Swimfan". The other two stories have a certain amount of dramatic power, particularly the one involving Ayala, but neither have what one might call a character with whom the viewer can identify. Catherine Zeta- Jones's Helena might initially seem a sympathetic character, a victim of her husband's cruel deception, but after his arrest she quickly reveals herself to be just as ruthless as he is, which must call into question her protestations that she was unaware of the true nature of his enterprise. Benicio del Toro's Mexican police officer is a man of integrity, but does not really emerge as the hero of the film. Like "Syriana" from five years later, "Traffic" is a film with a message, the message in this case being that the so-called "War on Drugs"&nbsp;is unwinnable and that a more liberal approach to the issue is needed; this message is driven home particularly strongly in the Wakefield story. (Both films were written by Stephen Gaghan, who in the case of "Syriana" also acted as director). "Traffic" is certainly the better of the two films; "Syriana" is over-complex, overlong and overly didactic. At least in "Traffic" Gaghan does not allow his political message to get in the way of the story, as he was to do in the later film. I would also rate "Traffic" as being more original than many of Soderbergh's more recent efforts, such as the formulaic "Ocean's" crime capers and last year's dreadful "Haywire". The main problem with the film, however, is that it is only fitfully (mostly in the Wakefield scenes) able to capture the sense of emotional power which marks hyperlink cinema at its best, as in "Crash", "The Hours" and especially "Babel". 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot synopsis sounds simple enough, until you realise we're following two other story lines simultaneously: A policeman in Mexico starts working for a drugs cartel company, and an upstanding woman finds her life in turmoil when her husband is arrested for smuggling. Oh, then of course there's the stool pigeon who wants immunity from prosecution for dobbing his mates in... In other words, this is your typical Soderbergh epic, with so much going on your head will probably spin off it's axis.The different threads are handled well though, and we're drawn into the lives of these characters... Who couldn't sympathise with a devoted father whose daughter is selling her body to feed her habit, or a cop forced to cooperate with bad guys to save his and his partner's skins? Of course, there are evil people featured too, and the film doesn't shy away from highlighting the fact that good doesn't always triumph. But no-one here is one dimensional: they all have chequered pasts, and aspirations for the future, which makes the film much more than a simple diatribe against drugs. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, and what's wrong with that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's stand apart film, may stall hungry movie goers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt, you would have people who have scathed this movie, because not much happens in it, or expected it to be like an action movie. As hearing the radio trailer for it, that was my impression. And I was sorely mislead. But more so the movie is a well shot scenic piece, with three different sets of characters. 1) is the scumbags that profit greatly from selling cocaine, etc. 2) You've got the good guys trying their best to stop them from the DEA and prosecutors, where we see realistically it's a revolving door. 3) The most essential story, is it's victims, including a teen addict, the daughter of a Judge (Douglas) who's given long chunks of dialogue, in a part we're not surprised to see him in, although they're better performances. Shot in darker but duller color, this works effectively, in what is at most times, a pretty flat movie. My favorite scenes were with the pimp, Sketch, who was on top of Christensen, in a breakthrough performance of believability, as a Douglas's daughter addict, who even when put in a treatment facility, flees off for another fix, to a place of regularity. Here, she's soon resorting to hooking, probably half aware of it, in her drugged state, or just wanting to believe it's one beautiful dream, and the client's her prince, who can take her away from all of this. But this is no fairy tale. It's still happening today, right in front of our very eyes. At times Traffic has a doco feel, with some realistic sounding conversations, like Catherine Zeta Jones and her friends at a golf club. Although the dialogue involving wine and duck bears no real significance at all to it's story, we at least get a taste of her character, when she's not moving product for her husband (Steven Bauer, one of the better character performances). He's head of the this drug operation, involving a few cartels where he has a witness killed off, and in turn escapes another hearing. But also here one DEA agent buys it in a rigged car explosion. His obsessed partner and friend, retaliates secretly, hiding a bug under a table, in Bauer's place. You automatically know, that Bauer will beat it again, after the movie finishes. That's realism. As far as Benecio De Toro's Oscar win went here, me myself didn't think it was of Oscar standard. If viewing it again, which I haven't for a while, I might have a change of opinion. Although I must admit I found his character intriguing. His partner, also an undercover cop who buys it, impressed me, as after all, this is the same actor who played the dyslexic kid in The Principal back in 88'. James Brolin, Albert Finney, and Amy Irving-(remember her?) as Douglas's wife turn in solid performances, especially the latter, where this great actress should be doing more bloody films. But the performance that really made my head turn or stand up, was that of Clifton Gonzalez Junior as a young hit-man, donning a French accent, an actor who shows true professionalism, as seen in other films, of course that searing debut in 187. I admit, I found the movie grinding in some parts, in "nothing much happening land", the sudden ending too, flat. But this film, director Soderbergh took a big risk on, (Sex Lies And Videotape, still my favorite) it's the very good performances from a big ensemble of actors, some of who we saw last, in I don't know when, that make it work. It's enjoyable in the fact, you follow the characters and stories, in realistic terms, like how this bloody drug problem is approached, and the affect it has on the needed addicts, and the ones that try their hardest to takes these pr..ks down. There's a difference between a movie and a film. A movie earns it title as being an escapist fare. A film is a more serious movie, with many realistic themes and that's what Traffic is, a film, which unquestionably will leave a few people, pi..ed off or jaw dropped. I know a guy and his girlfriend who walked out half an hour into the movie. But again, I reiterate, it's a film, and not a bad one, and definitely one you can't term as poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's Shrewd, Intricate Drama is Compelling Expressly Because It Doesn't Moralize With a Unitary Ideology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our drug laws behave as a price support routine for the criminal drug enterprise. They do not stop drugs. Regardless of billions of dollars spent and a high rate of fatalities, addictions, atrocity, demoralization and lives splurged in prison, it is easy today, as well as almost a decade ago when this film was made, for anyone who wants drugs to get them. "For someone my age," says a Cincinnati honors student in the film, "it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol."Who shoulders the drug law enforcement effort? Plenty of conscientious and sincere people. Also politicians who may know drug laws are exhausted, but don't have the audacity to be seen as gentle on the issue. And untrustworthy police and other officials, who find drugs a fruitful begetter of buy-offs, percentages and blackmail. And the drug cartels themselves, since the laws make their business so rewarding. If the elimination criminal penalties for and removal of legal restrictions against drugs were ever actively contemplated in this country, the opposition would accommodate not only dignified public servants, but also the kingpins of the illegal drug industry.These are the resolutions I gather from Traffic, which follows the drug traffic in North America from the bottom to the top of the sequence of inventory. They may not be your resolutions. Soderbergh himself does not endorse legalizing drugs, but affirms substance abuse is a public health problem, not a crime. Of course drugs generate crime, as addicts steal since they must, and a more realistic approach would culminate in a lower crime rate and a less dangerous culture.In one regard, Traffic is fundamentally about borders and what it means for an individual to cross those that are bureaucratic and territorial, mental and temperamental, physical and conceptualized. For Soderbergh, also, there were other borders to cross, those amidst independent film-making and Hollywood, amidst organizing a self-controlled conception and finding a larger audience to appreciate it. It helps that the cast is enormous and top-drawer, even down to cameos, some billed and some not, by Salma Hayek, Albert Finney and Benjamin Bratt. Their minor but particularly enthusing presence carries tremendous weight. The leads are likewise persuasive, such as Douglas, convincing as Conservative Ohio judge Robert Wakefield loses touch with the less quantifiable things in life such as how much he loves his family.With graceful restraint, Soderbergh introduces the characters in irreducible scenes that simultaneously let us know who they are when the story begins and who they soon will be. In an extensive mansion in the affluent Cincinnati municipality of Indian Hill, Wakefield's 16- year-old daughter, Erika Christensen, an honors student wearing a private school uniform, is introduced to freebasing by her boyfriend, a very socially aware smooth-talker played by Topher Grace, her noblesse oblige ethics dissolving. In San Diego, after a lunch of idle chitchat and foie gras at the local country club with a sprinkling of the neighborhood nobility, the pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones, with ethereal charm and, for now, genteel diplomacy, spies another possible future after her husband Stephen Bauer is arrested and the family's assets are frozen. In a flash, besides the indirect self-assertion of Dennis Quaid, she is caught between her husband's affiliates, who are urging money she doesn't have to give, and the DEA, which urges collaboration she doesn't want to surrender, while Bauer remains eerily resilient behind bars.Granted Traffic unravels continuously, the altogether amount of characters requires that the film have a intricate framework. In order to function as a compelling film altogether, even characters who never meet work in opposition. To that end, scenes don't just cut together, they appear to propel and fall against one another intrinsically, rhythmically, coincidentally.Traffic develops swiftly, then swifter still as the story shuffles promptly from Tijuana to Washington, D.C., to Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle electronically monitoring Zeta-Jones outside her San Diego estate, then back again to Mexico. Soderbergh tends to discard as much exposition as he knows the stories can endure. Each new scene has to pull its own weight, dispense its own briefing for the greater entity. In Traffic, this prominence on plot efficiency was encouraged by an inspired resolution to give the three main stories different colors. Using a compass of techniques, shooting without color-correcting filters, for example, Soderbergh conceived a sweltering, faded ocher for Benicio Del Toro's Mexico, his performance captivating in his understatement, alternating from sociability to shyness, the film's softly kindling ethical axis, and a graphically contrasting icy blue for Douglas' surroundings from Washington to Cincinnati. In comparison, the San Diego scenes of cat- and-mouse between the DEA and Zeta-Jones seem to bloom with ripe, virile shades that highlight the story's day-to-day nonrational automatism and unexpected juxtapositions. It's an audacious artistic design with a pragmatic profit: The colors inform the action, where you are and with whom, right away.This political crime drama, the cream of Soderbergh's diverse crop, is compelling expressly as it doesn't moralize with a unitary ideology. It is so subdued that at one moment, Michael Douglas's final speech, one wants one more declaration, reaching the bottom line, but, we having been shown the vast uncertainty of the drug wars, the movie lets us accommodate that thought for ourselves.</fullReview>

The fact that there is a big budget drug trade on the US border with Mexico is something that we should've looked at a long time ago before Steven Soderbergh did and thank you indeed for that.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing and compelling examination of drug trafficking - a clear cut masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRAFFIC (2000)Top 100 - All Time "This is an understated modern classic. Relevant, powerful and effective. A masterpiece"When you watch films like 'Traffic' you start feeling appreciation for the medium of film. Traffic is a restrained outcry to the problems in our society. The problems with the measures against drug trafficking; how the authorities deviate power from one drug baron to other without even knowing it. Furthermore it looks at the ever existing cracks in our society. There is this great scene, where Michael Douglas is searching through the deprived neighbourhoods of Cincinatti to find his drug addict daughter with one of her classmates:Robert Wakefield: I can't believe you brought my daughter to this place.Seth Abrahams: Woah. Why don't you just back the f*ck up, man. "To this place"? What is that sh*t? OK, right now, all over this great nation of ours, 'hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are cruisin' around downtown asking every black person they see "You got any drugs? You know where I can score some drugs?" *Think* about the effect that that has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities. I... God I guarantee you bring a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, into f*ckin' Indian Hills, and they're asking every white person they see "You got any drugs? You know where I can score some drugs?", within a *day* everyone would be selling. Your friends. Their kids. Here's why: it's an unbeatable market force man. It's a three-hundred percent markup value. You can go out on the street and make five-hundred dollars in two hours, come back and do whatever you want to do with the rest of your day and, I'm sorry, you're telling me that... you're telling me that white people would still be going to law school? Traffic is an important film. Powerful, gut-churning, effective. It revolves around three interralated stories in the USA and Mexico, involving a newly appointed naive Drug Tsar in the USA (Douglas), his family, an honest cop in Mexico (played exceptionally by Benicio Del Toro), and a San Diego millionaire who gets arrested under suspicion of drug trafficking - his wife (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) trying to rescue her husband. The film is tense, perfectly directed and edited with a great screenplay.Steven Soderbergh, in his film, simply lays out a story and lets the viewer make judgements. How do we deal with the 'Drug War'. Around 20 billion dollars are spent in the United States every year to combat the seemingly impossible forces of the Drug Empire stretching across the Latino Americas. Would investing 20 billion dollars in rehabilitation programs and regeneration of deprived areas help the problem more.There is a great scene at the end of the film, where Robert Wakefield and his wife attend a group support meeting for drug addicts and alcoholics. Robert exclaims, that he stand by his daughter. A group therapy session was the easier method for Wakefield to help his daughter, with just a few hours dedication. Not the war he fought, against drugs and corruption.The most important film of 2000 and quite possibly the best.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me very, very Cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a movie I'll never really understand. Yes its intelligent, yes its very well crafted but all the same it really only demonstrates to me that Stephen Soderbergh doesn't know how to handle emotion. The film follows a number of parallel story-lines, all of which follow the central theme of drug-running. Many characters in the film are on collision courses with each other, men and women who have really forgotten who they are.The storyline sounds very promising. Maybe there is an exceptional movie in Traffic somewhere. But this definitely isn't it. For example one of the story-lines follows the tale of a U.S. Drug czar (Michael Douglas) who slowly comes to realise that maybe not all is right at home. His final speech at the end of the film is indicative of his story on the whole: yes its very intelligent, but at the same time it leaves you cold. Its too cerebral: there's really no tragedy, or even the slightest hint of emotion in the tale. The film gets you thinking, but not for very long. Themes come first, characters later, creating a cinematic experience that while enlightening us, never shocks or touches us.Another one of the story lines that left me unmoved was the tale of a Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) who takes on a powerful drug runner. Although there is a lot of potential there for a great story its never really used to its full potential. We never get to know the character: he's incredibly distant, almost forgotten by the film at its finale. There's not enough there for us to become convinced that he's a real hero. Although one would be foolish to call the character a villain, he never really inspires us at all.The film would have worked wonderfully had it been a documentary, following the real life story of drug addicts or drug runners. Maybe then Soderbergh would have had an excuse for leaving us so untouched by the end of the film. He could have claimed the movie was only meant to make us think, not immerse us in these characters lives. Nevertheless the direction is pretty amazing. Soderbergh has a wonderful eye for beautiful images and colour schemes. As I've said before, its just sad that he just can't handle character's lives. Steve Gaghan went on to do wonderful things with Syriana. This film however, is a major letdown for the writer. Maybe he's the one to blame: his story keeps us distant from the characters, never really revealing anything about their lives or motivations. They're cold figures on the horizon, nothing more, nothing less.This was one of those films I just wish I could have loved. Unfortunately it only strengthened my secret conspiracy that maybe Stephen Soderbergh is in fact a robot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good acting but overlong, ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is entertaining, well-written, and at times captivating. Recently bought at one of the cheapy sales after recalling that I liked it while on a plane ride near when it was released. Upon second viewing I was a little disappointed at the fact that my attention waned here and there. This is a long story and in fact in some places drags - it has over 12 main characters that it tries to divvy out screen time. Especially memorable were Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro both who rarely disappoint. However the family subplot with Michael Douglas doesn't due too well. As parents they seem hardly believable. And the girl's friend was highly grating to listen to. The color filtering was annoyingly bothersome as well. Still there are some great scenes especially with Cheadle and Guzman as well as with Del Toro in Mexico walking along the streets of Tijuana. The movies topic on drugs is clichéd, and the message on the war on drugs goes without saying that its pervasiveness and negative affects on people close to you make it sort of an ineffectual campaign. In point of fact people will continue to seek out drugs whether legal or illegal. Worth a sit down viewing -</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has not only a very raw story, it also has a very raw look. "Traffic" is told almost documentary like and the most excellent cinematography, acting and dialog all contribute to the movie its raw documentary like feeling.The movie features several different plot lines with different characters but all stories are connected by one thing; drugs. The movie doesn't try to make things look better than they are, or give a hopeful message, it just shows how it is. The movie is very direct, straight to the point and confronting. The story and the situations all feel very realistic and that's also one of the reasons why this movie looks more like a documentary than a movie.Each storyline literally has its own color which works perfect and truly also adds to the atmosphere. Each storyline line is told like a movie on its own, with equally as much running time.The actors is also a reason why this movies works so well and is so extremely powerful. All of the actors give a very natural performance. Not only the main actors (Again director Soderbergh attracted an impressive cast with lots of big well known names.) but also the supporting actors. Apparently the movie has 135 speaking parts and I haven't seen one case of bad acting. But truly the one actor that really stands out is Benicio Del Toro. What an extremely good performance! Truly Oscar worthy. Also worth mentioning is Tomas Milian as the Mexican general Salazar.Seriously I can understand why a person will find this movie to be boring, I guess you just have to a bit of a movie-buff to fully appreciate and see the 'beauty' and the profession this movie is made with. The acting, the directing, the cinematography, the editing, it all works just brilliant in this movie!A brilliant, unique, one of a kind movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been wanting to see Traffic for a long time and it always seemed interesting to me and plus it had a lot of actors in it that I liked. So I borrowed it from a friend with high expectations. After the film, I did have more positives than negatives but the negatives were kind of strong. I'll have to say the interrelated stories are great and my favorites was the Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman story. The actors did all great but with the only exception of Catherine Zeta- Jones acting. Her performance was lacking with entertainment and she looked half asleep when she was acting even when she cried. The movie was intense and had good dialogue and the cinematography was brilliant but the big thing that launched it down was how boring it got. I mean there were parts when it was entertaining but most of the film was boring and needed to be built up way up. All the Salazar and drug finding crap got a little boring to me, but that's just me. Overall, not a bad movie and I enjoyed most of it but it wasn't the high expectation I expected.Hedeen's Outlook: 6.5/10 **+ C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite, with a Beautiful performance by Benicio Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film a year ago on TV and wanted to watch it again undisturbed. I recently purchased it and was thoroughly moved by it. It would be terribly understated to say that Steven Sodorbrough really knows what he is doing...a hardcore realistic drug drama with just an awesome array of interconnecting web of stories played out through brilliant performances. The cinematography is brilliant and VERY effective building the tension and conveying the energy of the wonderful performances. Shooting through hand helds adds further realism and energy to the film. Traffic also has a hauntingly effective musical score which stays with you long after the film.*SPOILERS*BENICIO DEL TORO is just astonishing and really lets the character's anguish, restraint and heartbreak shine through. He is truly the heart and soul of the film. He breaks your heart with his inner struggle with split loyalties and the constant fear for his and his partner's life, his desperation in knowing how futile all the effort may be and his inability to keep his partner safe. The scene in the car before he goes to make his statement with the DEA says it all about this wonderful actor who never lets us see anything but Javier in every scene he's in. Javier's integrity and HUMANITY somehow shines with perfect clarity through Del Toro's extremely complex performance and that innate ability got him the praise he deserves and more. His performance is so complex and multi faceted, as real people are, that at times we do not know for sure where his motivations lie. Javier certainly represents the Good in the drug war but he is also thick skinned and calculating as he has to be. He represents not only the struggle on the other side of the border but he adds a very emotional sense to the WHOLE movie and very often you'll find yourself getting teary eyed. Del Toro captures the extremely deep and three dimensional persona of Javier so perfectly that you wonder where Benicio ends and Javier begins. This is an ensemble piece but after viewing this film a few times, I am certain that it would NOT be even half as effective without Benicio Del Toro playing Javier. He makes it all work. By the end of the film, I was so moved by his performance that the only word I could think of was simply BEAUTIFUL.Another plus: I was very much taken in my Don Cheadle. I remember him from ER and he was definitely a scene stealer in that show. I loved the exchanges between Cheadle and his partner. The little chuckle after he is thrown out of the drug baron's house towards the end of the movie is priceless! Cheadle's character parallels that of Benicio Del Toro. He is riding some high stakes as well but not nearly as high as those faced by Javier. I didn't know that Topher Grace had such a pivotal and solid role. He is definitely going places. Erika Christensen hits you hard with her eerie and hardcore performance. The scene when Micheal Douglas finds her (his daughter) in the lowest of places is gut wrenching and Erika makes it believable. One of the most chilling elements I found was the idea of a pregnant mother partnering up with the cartels to distribute drugs in a DOLL and hiring a known assassin to kill the trial witness! She doesn't have the moral center anymore to realize that one day her own children will be faced with that tempting fiend. The film succeeds in conveying what the director set out to do, that is to give us a glimpse of the multi faceted drug epidemic and just how far up and deep it goes. All the stories are compelling and the sense of despair of it all lingers throughout the film. Traffic also has the most MAGNIFICENT movie conclusion I have seen in a long time. In the midst of the despair and corruption, we are left with one shiny ray of hope which is achieved through the romantic vision of one good man, Javier Rodriguez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diluted version of the British original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two stylistic features of this movie are immediately striking. The documentary style and the use of monochrome colour cast, being a sepia for the Mexican scenes and anti-Tungsten for the U.S parts. In summary, these things sound gimmicky but in practice they work extremely well.Whilst the plot line of the original German / British TV version remains essentially intact the axis of UK / Germany / Pakistan has been transposed to U.S / Mexico. In and of itself this has the effect of distancing the separate elements from each other. The Douglas character lives in a completely different world to the druggies and the Mexicans might as well be on another planet. Whereas, in the original, the English equivalent character lives in London, where communities of politicians, druggies and Asians from the sub-continent all live cheek-by-jowl. This creates a kind of friction and dissonance between the different elements which is entirely lacking from this version. Perhaps it is to compensate for this that the director works in scenes where the different characters pass by each other oblivious, in their travels. Which, in fact, seems extremely contrived and gimmicky indeed.On a related point, the plight of the daughter seems somewhat softer than that of her counterpart in the earlier version. If for no other reason than that she is an American living in a huge house rolling in money with which to fix her habit. Whereas the British equivalent character endures her fate amidst irredeemable grittiness under the grey-skies of claustrophobic England.Another weakening of the story centres upon the cartel-wife played by C.T.Jones. In the original, she is a German married to a Pakistani and when she is forced into her husbands "business" she ends up continuing to run the operation after his release, giving him the orders. Whereas, in this version Jones' character seems to retire back into the role of housewife almost as soon as Her Man is home.Connected to this is the failure to truly clarify the way in which she is sucked into the drug business and the moral choices that "law enforcement" cause her to face, forcing her to choose the "wrong" side. Similarly, Toro's detective starts with a cynical attitude towards Salazar but after snitching on him say's that he feels like a traitor. But we are not shown any intervening explanation for such an emergent sense of loyalty to Salazar, who is perhaps the nastiest character in the story.I personally found all the ways in which alcohol issues are worked into the story as a rhetorical way of raising the question of whether drink is a drug to be extremely heavy-handed. again, it may be that there is more of an inhibited attitude towards alcohol in the U.S which makes the comparison between cocaine and Scotch more credible. The argument is spurious and detracts from the main theme of the story, being the futility of the "War on Drugs". Nonetheless, in spite of these failings, the movie is an engrossing and suspenseful tale. The sub-text remains provocative in spite of having maybe been diluted for the U.S. market and the visual style makes it very watchable indeed.( Viewed 26.3.05. Previous version commented upon recollection of viewing several years previously ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wealthy privileged daughter of the U.S. Drug Czar ends up living with some seedy street-level dope pusher in his crack den? Uh huh, that's believable. After the scene in the bathroom, that plot line veered wildly into some strange pornographic "After-School Special" territory, and was impossible to take seriously. If Topher Grace ventured into that neighborhood, in that schoolboy outfit, he'd have been beaten and robbed in the blink of an eye. To believe the U.S Drug Czar would personally knock on some dealer's door, alone no less, is ridiculous at best. Eliminate that entire plot line, and i think this is a pretty good movie, all in all. This movie is overrated and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When it comes to drugs, no one gets away clean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic is a film I believe many people would rather not watch considering how distressing a topic it is dealing with. However, I feel people need to watch more movies just like this, to understand that issues such as drugs are not going to go away without some sort of backlash against them. Drugs affect everyone, not just the users and the distributors, and Traffic proves this to be true. Traffic is a film that pushes beyond new boundaries.Interweaving three complex stories about the international drug trade, this story cuts to the very heart and soul of the fight against the drug epidemic. From the highest level of the US government, where a conservative politician who's just been appointed as the US drug czar learns that his daughter is a drug addict. The story then follows to the corruption on the streets of Mexico, where a crooked, yet dedicated cop struggles with his conscience when he learns that his new boss may not be the anti-drug official he made himself out to be.Praise for this movie has to go to Academy award winner Steven Soderberg, who did one fantastic job to bring this film to our screens. I enjoyed his work on `Erin Brockovich', but I think this film proves that he is a great talent. It must have been difficult to keep up with all the different locations this film had, yet Soderberg did it as only he can. He deserved the Academy award for Best Director of this movie, and rightly got it.The story of this film is so heavy, yet intriguing I am not sure where to start with it. I enjoyed the storyline that contained the US government official dealing with the drug problem, as it probably was the one character that I could feel compassion for the most. It would be difficult to have any child dealing with drugs, whether they distribute them or take them. Yet with this story we see how bad drugs can be for both the young teenager and for the parents, and what effect it has on the father the most. The situations that the audience gets to see the young teenage daughter put herself through and what she will do to get her next hit was also distressing and good to see on-screen. No ghosts were let lie in this part of the story. Then you have the two undercover cops, who are on the lookout for a drug ringleader and his wife. This part of the story involves a young wife and son, whose life could be endanger if the wrongs of their Husband/Father are not righted. This shows how drugs not only affect individuals, but also people that you are connected to and love very much. The two cops are very good in this story as it is funny how they look after another criminal connected to the drug racket, and will help prove that the drug ringleader is guilty of the charges that have him facing a lengthy prison sentence.Finally the story also follows the drug problem in the streets of Mexico. People are heavily into drugs here, and could be blamed for the problem infiltrating its way into the United States. With the laws not being as stringent in Mexico, drug dealers can get away with giving drugs to anyone they feel like, whereas in America, the deals are done more cautiously.The cast of this film is of the highest quality. To have the now happily married couple of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones on the same film was a good thing. The reason I say this is because at no stage do we see the pair together onscreen. If this was to happen I believe it would have ruined the feel of the film, it would have for me anyway. Erika Christensen brilliantly portrayed the role of the Caroline Wakefield. I believe she would have needed to go into some sort of drug counseling environment to get the feel for this role, and whatever she did, she made this role her own.The winner of the best supporting actor Benicio Del Toro, was a worthy winner with his role in this film. I felt he brought a very uneasy feel to this movie, which suited it perfectly. Yet there are so many other stars that make this a great cast. With Stars like Benjamin Bratt, James Brolin, Miguel Ferrier, Don Cheadle and ?Erin Brockovich's', Albert Finney.The story of this film is definitely a poignant one. Drug dealers might get money for what they do, and some romantic action in the bargain, but do they consider the consequences of who they are selling the drugs to? If young people are experimenting with drugs, then the chances of an overdose is very realistic, as young people are not mature enough to realise that what they are doing to themselves is bad enough to even kill them. This was evident in one of the opening scenes of the film, where one of the young drug users has overdosed and suffers a fit. The others around him panic and have no idea what to do. So all in all this movie is something that needs to be followed up by topics that include alcohol, sex, smoking, criminal activities, drag racing, where the problem can be as big as that of drugs. This movie is what people have needed to see in a long time, as it proves no-one wins when it comes to a topic like that of drugs. If we can learn from movies, then I believe they have done one part of what they are meant to do, teach us about what life is really like. If it is easier to get drugs than alcohol, then the world needs to have a go hard look at itself. If that is the case we need to start to protect people from something that is very dangerous. Rating: 9/10 or 4.5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>close to perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overwhelming in its ambition and far ranging in its scope, Steven Soderbergh's eye-opening and mind-expanding `Traffic' comes as close to being a masterpiece as any American film in a long, long time. Indeed, it reminds us of why we fell in love with movies in the first place. Here is a film that finds not only the courage to grapple with a major social issue, but the artistry necessary to illuminate it. `Traffic's greatest virtue lies in the nonlinear nature of its dramatic structure. This allows director Soderburgh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan to weave a complex tapestry of characters and plot elements, permitting us to see the issue from a myriad of different angles. The result is nothing less than an epic survey of the `drug war' as it has come to be waged in the homes and streets of our cities and towns all around the world. `Traffic' is not content to provide a simplistic moral lesson, as so many socially conscious films are wont to do. Instead, it tries to provide as honest and comprehensive a view of the subject as is conceivably possible, concentrating on the depressing futility and murky morality that exist on both sides of the `war.' In its panoramic survey of the issue, `Traffic' looks at characters from all levels of the social strata, from the users to the sellers, from high government officials in charge of bringing an end to drug trafficking to the corrupt leaders of the drug cartels who live to ensure its continuance, from parents, spouses and friends caught up in the tragic effect of the drug world to soldiers on the front line who come to question the validity of their life cause. `Traffic' seems to be suggesting that, in the war on drugs, it is we, as a society, who are the ultimate losers. Even those of us who never use drugs are inadvertently affected by the problem.`Traffic' spares no one, yet, at the same time, it offers shreds of compassion to any number of the characters caught in the vicious cycle. Caroline Wakefield is, in many ways, a typical adolescent: pretty, bright and strangely drawn to what she feels is harmless experimentation with drugs, unaware of the consequences of her usage not only to herself but to society as a whole as she becomes a small but intricate part of the whole vast problem. Her father, Judge Robert Hudson Wakefield, who also just happens to have been appointed the nation's new `drug czar,' is a fairly typical modern parent as well. Here is a man so dedicated to the advancement of his own career that, despite his love for his daughter, he has begun to reap the tragic effects that come with parental neglect. As played by Michael Douglas, Wakefield is a good solid man honestly confused by the fact that the very problem he is dedicating his life to eradicating on a global scale is occurring right in his own backyard ? and, like most concerned parents, he hasn't a clue how to deal with it. Suddenly, all the clever slogans, buzz words and shibboleths that he has used to deal with this issue on the official level become meaningless in the context of his own personal crisis. His wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), faces the problem like many good parents who have themselves tried drugs in their youth, not wanting to blow the issue out of proportion, thereby providing little in the way of moral direction for her child.`Traffic' is filled with innumerable other complex characters as well. In his Oscar-winning performance, Benicio Del Toro plays Officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, a corrupt Tijuana policeman who must decide which side of the law enforcement fence he will ultimately end up on. Don Cheadle appears as Montel Gordon, a DEA agent who finds himself dedicating his life to a cause he may no longer believe in. And Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Helena Ayala, a young wife and mother who receives a rude awakening as to the true character of her wealthy husband when he is suddenly arrested for drug dealing. Each of these characters becomes an intricate part of the big picture and contributes, in his or her own way, to the moral ambiguity and complexity that distinguish this fine film.In addition to all the brilliant performances, `Traffic' is distinguished by superb directing, cinematography, editing and scoring. As both director and cinematographer, Soderbergh reveals a fine eye for texture, relying on a variety of color filters to root each scene in its own particular milieu. Stephen Mirrione's tightly-knit, award-winning editing keeps this sprawling tale from unraveling and Brian Eno and Cliff Martinez create a haunting, otherworldly quality to the film with their richly somber musical score. One would be hard pressed to explain exactly WHY `Traffic' did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2000. It was certainly the finest film of the five that were nominated. Whatever the reason, `Traffic' is a film that will live in the hearts and minds of those who have seen it for a long, long time. It renews one's faith in the artistic possibilities of the American cinema ? a faith that has been undergoing a large number of tests and trials in the past several years. `Traffic,' for all its depressing qualities, will make you hope again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare film where the "hype" does justice to the final film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a really, really fine film. Although it is based quite convincingly on the real war against the drug traffic from Mexico to the USA, it is presented entertainingly in three parallel stories. The first about the judge who is becoming the new USA drug czar (Michael Douglas), and whose teen daughter is on the track to becoming an addict. The second about a drug sting operation, designed to get to the big distributor. And the third about the rival drug cartels in Mexico, and the way they work the Mexican police in their favor. These 3 stories do not converge, but instead are all related by common connections to the "traffic". And, some characters (e.g.the Mexican assassin, the Mexican cop) end up being a part of 2 or 3 of the stories at various points in the film. The use of a basically "yellow" filming format for scenes in Mexico works very well, I think.Benicio Del Toro won best supporting oscar for his role as the policeman. There are lots of "name" actors like Catherine Zeta Jones, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, James Brolin. I rate it "9" of 10. I read some of the "user" reviews where some said "bad movie, do not see." I smile, for those obviously either fell asleep during the movie, or simply do not understand what makes a good movie. This is a very good movie, well-scripted, well-acted, well-directed, and makes a meaningful commentary on the state of the drug traffic problem, without being "preachy".The DVD is very well done, and the D-D 5.1 surround sound is very effective. You need a good speaker system to reproduce some of the very low "mood" tones present in key scenes. The extras are not plentiful, no deleted scenes, but there is a very interesting "making of" special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five words, first word "the", second word sounds like "mouse"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any professional reviewer who didn't take a paragraph (or more) out to complain about the jittery camera, the frenetic jump-cutting, and so on, was derelict in his duty. If such barbarisms must find their way into common cinematic parlance, at least they shouldn't be allowed to walk in unchallenged.Soderbergh processes his film three different ways, so that the Mexico footage is burnt gold, the Washington footage is blueish, and the human storylines are natural but with a lot of white. I suppose this was worth a try. That's what they thought back in the 1910s and 20s, anyway, when they would tint night scenes blue, violent scenes crimson, "warm" scenes sepia, etc. Soderbegh's colours are more attractive than tinted monochrome (not surprisingly), but it's worth noting that not too long after colour photography was invented directors found more creative and effective ways to play with the overall colour balance.But the real problem with "Traffic" is that it didn't want to be a film in the first place. Educating people about the absurdity of the United State's drug policy is commendable (especially since so many other countries, including my own, have a similarly silly policy because of American pressure), but the film doesn't educate. How could it? That's what the printed word is for. A picture is NOT always worth a thousand word; pictures cannot convey arguments. I don't know how this film came into being, but it showed every signs of having been created when Gaghan (or Soderbergh or someone) wanted to deliver a reasoned argument, realised that people don't bother to read reasoned arguments, so cynically made a film instead. It's like watching someone mime "the house is on fire" during a game of charades. (Of course, if people really refuse to be told that the house is on fire any other way, it's worth a try.)It's still a competent, mostly involving film, because of the human stories (or the fragments thereof), which are well scripted and acted - and Soderbergh is consistent, if nothing else, in the way he uses his camera. We really become interested in the US drug tsar and his daughter. On the other hand, the plight of the drug importer's wife is cliché-and-water. There's really no character there at all.I wonder about the scene with the four youngsters playing with drugs - drugs in general, not any drug in particular. They inhale marijuana and snort cocaine and shoot heroin like they're at a buffet, mixing different kinds of cheese. Does this kind of thing ever really happen? In any case, everyone to speak of has had marijuana; few make the huge leap (in a different direction) to heroin.</fullReview>

Watching Traffic is like watching NYPD Blue with blue and yellow tint.Member 1: We can't vote for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It has kung fu in it and people may think we're less intelligent. Besides ... it's foreign and we can't let foreigners take over the Hollywood crap market. Ang Lee can have his best foreign film, but he can't have director.Member 2: So what you're saying is that even though Traffic is not that good of a movie, boring as hell and has direction that makes you feel like you just got off a roller coaster while standing on your head, eating liver and onions and watching the Blair Witch Project, we should vote for it so we can pat Hollywood on the back?Member 1: Exactly.Member 2: That makes sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's greatest director updates 'The Wizard Of Oz'. (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Traffic' is, ultimately, an affirmative film. Like any movie from Hollywood's golden era, its impulse is towards resolution. A genuinely troubling film would not have had Montel Gordon return to the Ayalas to plant an incriminating, feel-good bug, or ended with Mexican children - the future - playing baseball, Javier's dream of a cleaned-up country.Each narrative charts disruption and rupture, usually linked to family - Javier the policeman discovers his partner and boss are in league with drug barons; Wakefield's stagnant marriage reaches crisis point, the fallout being a junkie daughter; Helena, a seemingly WASPish wife, sees her husband arrested for extensive drug traffiking, and her son almost kidnapped; a cop watches helplessly as his partner and buddy is murdered in a fluffed assassination attempt.The journey Soderbergh takes us on into these characters' lives is at times deeply harrowing, especially in the narrative of Caroline, descending the circles of hell from drug addiction, date rape, jail, alienation from family, institutional therapy, becoming a runaway, until she reaches the very nadir. This scene, where she lies semi-conscious having sex with a black man, is the film's most troubling - although Caroline is perversely serene, it is shot as a nightmare, the blur on her face suggesting all kinds of dissolution: social, identity, moral etc.; and the tight shot from behind her partner making us feel that he is crushing her, like a slab.That he is a beast-like exploiter is confirmed by Soderbergh's own, almost ostentatiously non-exploitative shooting of the scene, no nudity, no salacious opportunity for voyeurism. It's as if the worse thing that could happen to a nice, rich, white kid is sleeping with a black man. After this, she is in hell, numb, living in a dazed temporal blur of prostitution and drugs. This scene is filmed like a nightmare, - and I'm sure it IS many racist WASP's nightmare; it's certainly not Caroline's nightmare in the film, so who's is it?And yet there is even an exit from this hell, and with a little parental understanding, everything might be okay (the plot - a young girl turns to drugs because daddy is never home - is reassuringly familiar). It's up to the viewer how much one reads certain strands, as drama or satire. Is it amusing that Helena's shallow, thoughtless wife can easily transform into a ruthless ganglord, or is it a very believable response to danger threatening the family (husband, son, home), that blood locus of drug cartels; is it a satirical point that all white middle class wives are compromised in some way like this?Is it satire that America's drug czar has major drug problems in his own home? Or is it another moving narrative of an emotionally dead man who finds redemption through suffering and renunciation? Javier might or might not achieve his dream at the end, but he is forever denied any chance of partaking in it. His will be a furtive life of identity-changing, looking over his shoulder.Stephen Gaghan's script IS brilliant, one of Hollywood's best in years - it creates believable characters not by giving them contrived 'traits' or personalities, but by showing them in, and reacting to, action. The connections between the various strands are skilfully done, and sometimes frightening - the mirroring of the two drug czars for instance. The police are not the usual agents of state oppression, but Pasolini's class warriors.Even the overall, unAltman neatness is based on a terrible irony - in a society where alienated elements drift further apart; where the rich get richer and are all bascially gangsters or emotionally paralysed; where the poor or dissatisfied can only get relief through oblivion; where on America's border is a terrifying fascist state created in its own warped image; where children and parents don't even talk any more; where the President is always somewhere else - there is a connection bringing all these characters and social ruptures together, creating unity, structure, a map with which to grid the chaos, and that's drugs.In its linking of vastly different social milieux, its density, texture and length, 'Traffic' has the satisfying feel of a Victorian novel (a name like Wakefield is Dickensianly symbolic). In its narrative of borders, outlaws, military, disguises, assassins, poisoning, it's like a Victorian adventure thriller. It is this old-fashioned groundbass that makes the surface modernity so affecting.Soderbergh, America's greatest director, is like Hawks, Minnelli, or Sirk, a maverick who works the system to smuggle in his own subversive art.'Traffic' is a difficult film - splintered, violent, disturbing - but it all connects and resolves. The important thing in a Soderbergh film is not the script, but his direction. 'Traffic' is full of his usual themes - surveillance/voyeurism (another frightening medium of connecting characters); the breakdown of family (especially fathers and daughters); the tensions within groups; the dissolution of the individual. As in the mighty 'Limey', Soderbergh reveals his Western-like sensitivity to landscape, his arthouse-like sensitivity to interior space, and the resonantly mathematical way of filming both. The explanatory apparatus of intertitles, news montages etc. serve to connect, explain, clarify, but Soderbergh's way of filming militates against it. The'Wizard of Oz'-like formal division of sepia monochrome and colour creates a kind of fantasy world, where borders become magical thresholds of transformation. Every character crosses some border and becomes different.But change can be self-negating. the mirror effect of stereotypically mysterious and sinister Mexico and normalised America creates unstable effects whereby the colour strategy of one realm seeps into the other. The fantastic, Surreal, 'Fantomas'-like fast-motion/distorted resolution texture of the Mexican sequences and the bleached, chalky blues of the Wakefield search. In other words, the kind of boundary-blurring narcotics supposedly effect.Benecio del Toro has rightly been getting kudos for his awesome performance, but it is the opposite of what usually passes for Great acting, which is showing, revealing, expressing. Del Toro must spend the entire movie like an Agatha Christie murderer, playing roles, revealing nothing. It is the kind of self-effacement people take drugs for. He is the one character who dissolves boundaries, and yet seems to dissolve himself, melting into intangibility. If he's part of the solution, than 'Traffic' IS pretty scary. A modern masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a few problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I do like this film, and I do feel that it might be the most important movie about the drug problem in the United States ever made (I don't know how many films could even compete with Traffic in that respect; how many films actually deal with this problem?). However, most of the characters in the film are two-dimensional, and the situations they experience are somewhat cliche. There are three main plot lines: 1) In Mexico, a police officer struggles with his own morality as he realizes that he is doing nothing but helping drug lords. 2) A pregnant woman's husband is arrested for being an alleged drug lord in California. She did not know what his business was before, but she is forced to deal with her husband's problems in a hurry as her life and the life of her son are threatened. And 3) A politician assigned to be the nations drug czar, the position which is basically the general of the "war against drugs," finds out that his daughter is addicted to very serious drugs (freebase).Plotline 1 is interesting and exciting, but it is rife with cliches. Benicio del Torro is very good as the main character of this line. He is the cop who is involved in a corrupt system and who is getting sick of it. del Torro is good at showing his inner struggle, but the whole inner struggle thing is a cliche in itself. 2 could have been an episode of Hawaii Five-0 (not an insult, I love that show!). Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent here, and she could be worthy of an Oscar nomination. Her situation is similar to the problem of Micheal Corleone in The Godfather (the first one), where he was the only law-abiding member of his family, but is forced to become a criminal. We watch Zeta-Jones go from offering lemonade to two police officers who are tailing her to trying to murder those same two officers. These two officers were my favorite characters throughout the film, mostly because of the actors who played them, two of the best character actors we have today, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. They are pretty cliche, too, but I guess any police officer in this situation would be. They wise crack as they sit in a van listening to bugged conversations, and when protecting a witness. The whole witness-protecting part is a little silly, though. They actually have hotel staff deliver food instead of police officers, which I'm sure is NEVER done. Maybe if the characters in this film were familiar with Hawaii Five-0, they wouldn't have made such a ridiculous mistake.3 perhaps works the best out of all the plotlines, and would work the best as a film of its own (the other two sections, I believe, would have failed on their own due to the cliches). The cliche here is that a busy man has too little time to deal with his daughter, so, isolated, she experiments with drugs. Micheal Douglas is excellent here. His final speech is very powerful in its simplicity. They could have written for this character a very long speech with heavy music playing behind it, but instead he has two lines that hit like a sledgehammer. The daughter is also excellent as the addict. My complements also to Topher Grace, Eric Foreman from Fox's That 70s Show, as the rich kid who gets everyone addicted to drugs. Liking him so much in That 70s Show, it is actually kind of hilarious to watch him here, especially with some of the very difficult lines he has to speak. The entire situation is, alas, all a cliche, though. I think it is Micheal Douglas' acting ability and his final speech, and even this section's conclusion, that make this the best part of the film.I actually like Soderbergh's other two crime dramas a lot better, The Limey, which was a very good movie despite the distracting editing (I reviewed it, if you want to link off of my name), and Out of Sight, which was one of the best crime dramas of the 90s, even competing with Pulp Fiction. Those two films were extraordinarily original works, while Traffic is more or less a collection of cliches. Luckily, the cliches are held together by both acting and direction (and cinematography, also, which was actually done by Soderbergh). It does turn out to be better than the sum of its parts. Its message is gotten through quite well, even if it is a message of hopelessness (although segment 3 ends positively; I'm not sure why we end with segment 3, del Torro watching a baseball game; perhaps I missed something). I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me multiple viewings of Steven Soderbergh's magnum opus "Traffic" to fully appreciate its zeal. And with each viewing I learned something from it, something that was slyly hidden beneath the skill Soderbergh so wonderfully inculcated in it. There's no doubt that few filmmakers know the craft better than him. I mean, look at "Sex, Lies And Videotape". Does it seem like someone's directorial debut? Nope. And yet Soderbergh managed to assemble a movie that was nothing less than a lesson in screen writing and film-craft. "Traffic" is no less. The plot follows intertwined stories of the people involved in drugs through four perspectives : Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican police officer, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a conservative Ohio judge and drug czar, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), who runs an undercover DEA operation with his partner Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the pregnant wife of an arrested drug lord Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), who is trying to keep her husband out of prison. Javier Rodriguez wants to keep his nose clean even though the corruption is escalating around him. Wakefield, who plays the prime role in the war against drugs, finds out that his own daughter is a druggie. Gordon, who had arrested Ayala and is out to nail him for good, tries to protect a whistle-blower after his partner is killed. And Helena wants to get rid of the debts that her husband has piled up and try to keep him out of any trouble. The story-lines entwine to give one plot wherein every character tries to, in some way, wreck the drug business.In the movies that I've watched, there has rarely been a compelling portrait of America's war against drugs. And here's the ferocious "Traffic" with its ambitions too heavy for its own shoulders trying to pull off what many have - and failed - before it. To tell you the truth, I hadn't anticipated the prodigious power that "Traffic" withheld. But the marvelous script from Stephen Gaghan and Soderbergh's assured direction made it an interesting mishmash of a striking narrative and visual treat that chronicled the events smoothly. I especially noted the hand-held camera technique that Soderbergh employed on several occasions, giving it a documentary-like aura and believably recreating the right mood. Yet another notable film technique that stood out was the effective use of lighting for each of the sub-plots. A grainy, tinted look and feel is given to each separate story and that's requisite if the makers want us to invest into 135 speaking parts and a story that spans over 7 cities. That's cheeky but beneficial, real beneficial. Though I savored "Traffic" in every which way, I found the Wakefield storyline to be the best among them all. Yes, it did contain an intimate account of the effects of drug addiction but I found it to be more engaging precisely because it felt real. And yes, it also contained one of Michael Douglas' very best performances. It's one story that you could easily relate to, you see, because it had characters that surround you everyday, doesn't matter where you're from or where you live. That was the one sub-plot that got closest to being a documentary.Benicio Del Toro, who won a deserving Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work on this film, is a live-wire with his powerhouse performance. He feels astonishingly real and his performance as Rodriguez ranks a point higher than the one as Che Guevara in "Che", another Soderbergh picture made in 2008. Douglas should've nicked an Oscar nod too but sadly did not. However, he is excellent as Wakefield, chiefly in one of his final scenes where he has to deliver a speech in front of a live press and instead has a minor breakdown. Cheadle and Zeta-Jones are likewise very convincing in their respective roles.Though many may not agree with me on this but I find Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" to be his best work yet and certainly his most ingenuous. Vastly undervalued, it ranks among my favorite movies of the '00s because it takes a difficult story and works wonders with it. "Traffic" is not so much about drugs as it is about its characters. If you want a different cinematic experience, an enthralling cinematic experience, then I'd recommend it to you. Brilliant. I find no other word to describe it any better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Mexican policeman (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself and his partner caught in an often deadly web of corruption; a pair of DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) work undercover in a sordid and dangerous part of San Diego; a wealthy drug baron living in upscale, suburban America is arrested and learns how quickly his unknowing and pampered wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) takes over his business; and, the U.S. President's new drug czar (Michael Douglas) must deal with his increasingly drug-addicted teenage daughter," according to the film's official synopsis.Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic" is so long and layered, it sacrifices the emotional connections you need to have with its characters. A less holistic (or, more liner tracing of the drug trafficking) might have been more appealing, The film's editing doesn't take advantage of its emotional peaks, which should have built to a climatic crescendo. And, the camera, in an effort to enhance the strung-out storyline, shakes too much. On the plus side, the production and players are very good. Mr. Soderbergh comes close to capturing a 1980s (Cocaine Decade) feel; and, while unrelated to that mood, his cinematography is beautiful. Happily, the film realizes you don't declare "WAR!" on things like poverty, drugs, and terrorism. Worth watching. ****** Traffic (12/27/00) Steven Soderbergh ~ Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Low-key, quasi-documentary take on the ongoing U.S. war on drugs and the futility of it all. It does so by looking through the eyes of a conflicted Mexican cop (Benecio DelToro) who gets caught up in a cartel war and a newly appointed drug czar (Michael Douglas) with a heroin-loving teenage daughter. Douglas and DelToro are excellent, although I feel Douglas was in this for name value only, as it really isn't his movie. The film does not preach; it simply observes. Some odd color choices for certain sequences (washed-out orange for all Mexican scenes and steely blue for the D.C. scenes) are a bit jarring but definitely create an effect. The film will not be for everyone, as it contains numerous graphic drug usage sequences.</fullReview>

The movie is so boring and depressing I keep having to turn it off. This time I may not turn it back on. It doesn't seem to make it as a drama, as a suspense film, or as a documentary. Here are some of my problems: Can anyone who has sat on the bench and is appointed Drug Czar be so naive about drugs? Does no one in the Hudson home have a sense of smell? Can the major drug distributor in LA be penniless? And can his wife be totally ignorant of his real job? Did Gen. Salazar study dramatics under Hannibal Lechter? Where is Anthony Quinn when we need him!?! I've decided; I'm not going to watch the rest of it.

		<fullReview>BAD POINTS: This meandering, over-populated movie was a critically acclaimed hit, but its attempt to shoehorn all the characters into a feature length film a serious error. Director Soderbergh's hand-held camera shots get old after about a half hour, but the movie is nearly 2? hours long and could easily cause migraine headaches. With the exception of Benicio Del Toro, most of the actors look like they're simply putting in an appearance and that's exactly how they come across. The script is self-important, pretentious claptrap and thoroughly predictable. Despite the "documentary" feel, there isn't a believable moment in the whole movie.GOOD POINTS: Attractive photography and Benicio Del Toro's excellent performance.SUMMARY: If you can ride roller coasters without puking, you may be able to watch this without hitting the pause button every 15 minutes.

		<fullReview>It's been twenty years since I've worked in the Hollywood movie industry and I'd forgotten how dim-witted and easily impressionable the members of the Academy can be. But all that came back when I got around to seeing the multi-Oscar winning movie, Traffic.It's truly hard to know where to begin in the list of weaknesses and insults this film lays upon the viewer. The performers log in uneven performances--each of them having to fend for himself in the modulation and reality of the performance. OK, that's the director's fault, but sometimes that can be overlooked if there's a good visual articulation to the movie. None such luck in this movie: the directorial style is trite and derivative. Usually cinema creates a new language which is then adopted by TV, but Soderbergh takes tired tropes from TV commercials and re-introduces them in a movie as if it were some new visual language he's discovering.Take the use of high-contrast and sepia printing in the lab for the Mexican sequences, and the absense of an 85 filter on the filmstock in order to get the blue effect in the Michael Douglas sequences. Well, all that was done in the 'sixties in Europe, in the seventies in independent American cinema, in TV commercials in the 1980's and now in the next century Sorderbergh usues these cliches and the Academy gives him an Oscar??? Get serious.The script is laughable. Anyone with half a brain can see holes in the plot and logic that a Mac Truck could drive through. And perhaps the most insulting, is the never-ending parade Black, Latino and Gay bad guys. (If I were the Mexican government, I'd sue the producers of this dreck.)PS: I wonder what Guillermo Gomez-Pena would think of this movie...?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Torture to watch, not much to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this on pay per view after not seeing it in the theaters. I did not see it in the theaters, because I was afraid it was going to be one long lecture. Guess what, it was just one long lecture about drugs. I just don't think that Hollywood has any business commenting on the war on drugs. I guess this is supposed to be one of the good films that Hollywood puts out so that they can get away with all of the violent unrealistic films that they constantly release. The whole thing seemed like a very trivialized summary of the issues to me.I have mostly liked the work of Steven Soderbergh in the past, but this movie was not very good to me. The blue and yellow color shifts were just plain annoying and I have no idea what they were supposed to symbolize. None of the acting stood out for me.This was just one overhyped bad movie. It gets 0 stars out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drugs are bad. It's so simple!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one very over rated film. EVERYONE in it is affected, andlearns the lesson that drugs are bad. It's like those films theyused to show us in school, that are so slanted in one directionthey become laughable. That being said, there are some very fineperformances in this film. Don Cheadle and Benecio Del Toro areboth fantastic and transcend the material with truly movingperformances. The rest struggle with stilted dialogue and silly plotdevices. (Catherine Zeta-Jones, six months pregnant, goes toTijuana to talk to the big cheese of a drug cartel? Titters in theaudience). I think it's well crafted clap trap that happened alongjust at the moment in film history that needed some stab atsubstance, but take another look in five years, people will wonderwhat we saw in it.</fullReview>

If you want to listen to constant anti-drug messages for 2hrs+, go for it... No wonder White House paid portions of this movie under "Ant-Drug" campaign. If anything, the scenes in this movie teach you how to abuse drugs. Don't even get me started on the stereotyping of Mexicans... even a different camera filter was used to show off Mexico in the worst light possible. Soderbergh's a sellout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Mexico, state police officers Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Sanchez catches a truck full of drugs. However General Salazar stops them and confiscates the drugs. Salazar gets Rodriguez to capture Obregón brothers cartel assassin Francisco Flores.In the US, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is a tough-on-drugs Ohio Supreme Court judge. He is appointed to head the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy as the drug czar. His straight-A student daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) falls into doing harder and harder drugs with her boyfriend Seth.In San Diego, undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) catch dealer Eduardo Ruiz and turns him against drug lord Carlos Ayala who is a big distributor for the Obregón brothers. His wife Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has her world turned upside down and she takes matters into her own hands as the cartel demands payment. Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) is their business associate.Director Steven Soderbergh skillfully weaves together these great stories. The pitfall for these types of multiple-storyline movies is the uneven interest in the various stories. In this movie, every story is interesting headed by top rate actors. They compliment each other as the movie unfolds. Del Toro is terrific. The washed-out colors give this a documentary style and separate the different story threads. It is simply an all-around well-made movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows different connected stories in Mexico and the USA about drugs, showing how it affects themselves and the people around them. About some who sell them, about some who try to prevent this and about some who consume them. I think that this film seems very realistic. The actors are good, the music is good, and the colours also. There are exaggerated scenes of Mexico in the film though. Mexico is not as bad as they show it.But the point never really is shown. The film ends and nothing has really happened. But it has some good lessons about life and drugs. I enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I had no intention of seeing this movie but I am actually very glad I did. The movie was visually and technically very good. I really liked how the film used two different filters for the two different story lines. I also enjoyed how they kept the two story lines very separate but still left you feeling that they were strongly intertwined. The director did a great job of making you side with people who were involved in illegal activities. It also showcased that not all drug addicts are sleazy low-lifes. There are parts in the movie, that I won't spoil, that make you almost feel wrong for watching it. It really takes you on a journey of dark emotions. It was really effective in this aspect. This movie came out in 2000 and it covers an old story but I still found it really interesting. The movie may be a bit out-dated but even today it still stands as a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect connections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three stories intersect in the darkness of traffic of drugs, each story takes place in a different city but even if they look so far they touch and are deeply connected. All the stories are linked by the same drama, the drama of drugs that could be really intimate and private in a family but at the same time also political and universal in every kind of society. The acting is great, each character is unique and help us to understand the reality of different places, the one that I like most is probably Benicio del Toro that shows his feelings and emotions just with his face and body, he doesn't even need to talk. The stories are set in different cities and are characterized by different vivid chromatic colors. An episode, set in Tijuana in Mexico, is filmed in a way that every scene change quickly, the muggy yellow color of this story shows the difficult atmosphere of a country where corruption is clearly visible. The scenes filmed in Messico look like old paintings. Ohio and the rooms of power in Washington are wrapped in a blue that is cold and gelid; the main character of this story is Robert Wakefield ,that works against the big world of drugs, but he doesn't even know how to fight this problem in the intimacy of his family; the cold colors of the city are perfect to represent the cold atmosphere inside his family. The sky of San Diego has a neutral light but this apparent perfection is not real. All these differences in the way the stories are filmed are unified by a drama that is way beyond each character.</fullReview>

I loved how the main characters daughter happened to be a drug addict herself while her father is dealing with the drug war. It was very ironic and this made the film as good as it was. It was very shocking to the father to find her daughter passed out in a drug dealers condo. Although it had a slow start it became better and better throughout the film.

		<fullReview>I thought traffic was an okay movie. It has good camera angles and creative shots throughout the film. The plot line is really well written, but in my opinion it is overcomplicated. I feel like the film strays from the main plot line while trying to follow the journey of numerous people. I think the main cop played his role really well. Traffic was well directed by Soderbergh. Alongside him, the acting in Traffic made the film much better. This movie also had well selected music that set the scene and mood of the film. Traffic is interesting to watch because it shows what the drug world can be like. It also shows how different people can be involved. Traffic takes us into a raw Mexico and America and makes visible the corruption that occurs because of drugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining &amp; still up-to-date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to mention that the film was produced in 2000 ? 15 years ago, which makes it to me an old looking movie nowadays. While writing this I try to ignore that fact and not get into 'negative' aspects, caused by older technology or other techniques used that time. The story line has some very interesting parts and is still in the year 2015 up-to-date, if we take a look at the teenage drug problems for example. As a teenager I know there are lots of problems with drugs and I can imagine there are lots of young people, who want to try new things and explore even the more dangerous drugs (like shown in the movie). The part I cannot really relate to is the very bullheaded behaviour of Caroline (Erika Christensen) in the movie. It seems a little too much to me, but that's my personal opinion ? anyways, great that people like Steven Soderbergh make the effort to show and call attention to these problems. By the way, in the movie the father of Caroline, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is a conservative judge, who's been appointed as the US drug czar, what makes this part of the story pretty controversial and funny. Another big plus for this movie are the absolutely impressive locations. "The film has 135 speaking parts and was shot in over 110 locations in eight different cities." (Quote of 'Did you know' IMDb) Personally the most impressing venues for me, were the ones in Mexico ? very realistic and I think there is no movie nowadays I can remember, that has more suitable or better looking locations for this kind of film. Also the color treatment fit here very well. I really appreciated the great acting performance of Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez a Mexican cop (he got an Oscar and other awards for his role) and the connections of the different plot lines. On the whole the movie was entertaining with all its action scenes (gun-warfare, sniper scene etc.), acting performances and story lines, but not my favourite movie, it got a little boring in between sometimes.</fullReview>

I thought how they portrayed Mexico in warm lighting and the US in colder lighting was a great idea and made a complicated and in-depth film like this clearer and easy to follow. The tangent of story lines almost seemed too much or unnecessary at times, but even though they could be unnecessary I didn't care because they were intriguing. Something great about this film was there were so many different main characters you could relate to. Whether is was a drug-abusing teen or a father who is looking out for them. Family life or work life. The film had a good balance, which is something hard to pull off the bigger your story is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made one of my top favorite films for many reasons. The writing was really really good and the story line intertwining between the the teens, the Americans, and the mexicans made it very enjoyable to watch. I think they did this well because they could end an exciting scene in one of the story lines and move to another and then they go back eventually to the first which keeps you always interested even if it's a slow scene with no action. I really enjoyed how they left out some of the end of scenes and left it to interpretation to what it would have looked like; for example when the guy is going to shoot heroin in her foot it cuts the scene, and when one guy is torturing another guy with some kind of liquid it cuts but keeps the audio. The other element I thought really added to it was the colour correction. At first I was weary as to if I liked it but after a while it made sense and I thought if it didn't have the colour correction it wouldn't have been as powerful for some reason. Maybe the writing enhanced the colour correction... I thought the acting was very mature and quite realistic. There were a few scenes that were maybe not as realistic but added for effect but everything from the sweat and dilated pupils to the tense conversation kept it very realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three stories related to drug trafficking and the spread between the US and Mexico are the subject of the film. During the film, the main characters of each episode they meet casually with the other protagonists of the other two stories, the director managed to control to perfection the three different stories. The episodes set in Mexico and Washington respectively were toned with a very warm yellow and deep blue, I really loved this director's choice. I enjoyed that in Mexico everyone speaks Mexican during the whole movie and this makes it more real. The actors are remarkable, first of all Benicio Del Toro who deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Sometimes I found myself a little bit uncomfortable because this movie faces a really heavy topic and I felt those feelings not because I didn't like the movie, that I love it, but because the subject, I didn't know a lot of things about that. It's interesting that even if this movie was filmed 15 years ago, we nowadays have almost the same problem regard the drugs. The part about the teenagers was my favorite, probably because I'm almost the same of the girl in the movie. This movie talks about a real and serious topic, now and also 15 years ago and it faces this subject really well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A skillfully constructed drama dealing with major worldwide problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is a harrowing look at the war on drugs ? a war that is not only political, but also familial. Told through multiple interconnecting plots, the heavy themes unfold smoothly without succumbing to melodrama. It manages a tonal balance that equates to an interesting, exciting and thought-provoking experience with help from its massive ensemble cast, introspective screenplay, sharp editing and grounded though effective directorial touches ? all of which earned Academy Awards for their achievements.Representing the U.S. in this modern drug war is a conservative judge (Michael Douglas), who struggles to uphold a positive reputation when emotions intervene upon the reveal that his very own daughter takes drugs herself. Meanwhile, a trophy wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) attempts to save her husband's corrupt drug business when he is arrested, while fearing for the lives of her loved ones. Protecting a witness with significant knowledge of the business are a couple of DEA agents (Don Cheadle &amp; Luis Guzmán) who simply want to do their part for the sake of good. Finally, a Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) has trouble in this department when he realizes his boss may not be as dedicated to the same purpose, to say the very least.Among this stellar cast including Del Toro's Oscar-winning work, there are plenty additional appearances from other big-time players such as Dennis Quaid, Albert Finney, Salma Hayek and even Topher Grace in a surprisingly notable performance. All of the main actors convey their characters' internal conflicts with realistic nuance and along with the writing create a much more involving story out of material that may usually feel wooden due to a lack of humanness at its core. Traffic feels like an important drama that takes a grounded approach to themes that have a universal impact on people in the real world.Equally responsible for the success of the execution is Soderbergh himself, setting the atmosphere with decidedly un-cinematic camera angles and consistent cuts benefiting the illusion of reality, almost akin to the style of a documentary. The editing is commendable as the nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime flies by. The different story lines are highlighted by different color filters, often melding with the tones of each respective segment. The soundtrack is aces too, thanks to the great composer Cliff Martinez and a particularly memorable use of music at the very end, carrying on into the closing credits which keeps the viewer stuck in a profound emotional state of melancholy as the clarity of the big picture sinks in. Everyone has once been as innocent and happy as a kid playing baseball, and only later do their lives take drastic turns leaving many of them confused and joyless, and in some cases tortured by drug addiction. Whether such detriments are avoidable or inevitable, none of it is even a concern when you're a kid on a field playing a good old game of baseball with friends and family.Overall, Traffic is a very good film that surpasses others of its kind due to extra attention devoted to the emotional end of a spectrum as substantial as the issue of illegal substances. With equal focus on technical aspects, character development and entertainment value, it evades any kind of forced sentimentality or over-dramatization and instead makes its mark with refreshing subtlety and purity oozing through each colorful frame, even including some organic moments of natural humor. It doesn't reach awe-inspiring heights nor does it falter in any particular way. Amidst the traffic of other similar films aspiring to achieve greatness, it does weave through and drive steadily ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All-around Traffic was a fresh and accurate look on drug trafficking. It wasn't sugar coated nor was it sorrowful. The use of colour during the edited process set the tone for the film which made it feel somewhat real. Together with how the director related sound into the film added an extra dimension to the viewing experience. This was most prevalent during the first car scene.The acting in this film drew you into the characters and their stories. Personal I was drawn to Catherine Zeta-Joneses character Helena Ayala largely because of her character development. At the beginning she was naive and fragile yet by the end of the story she had transformed into a strong and bold woman. Likewise with Michael Douglas's character Robert Wakefield who played both a conservative judge and father of a drug addicted daughter. He was set in his ways about the war on drugs but by the end he no longer believed what he once fought for. Another clear example of character development.When it came to the storyline I loved it mostly because I am drawn to films with multiple story lines. The reason why I love films like this is because you get to see multiple points of view on one underlining theme. This makes it easy for multiple demographics to relate to one story. And this issue on drugs is still current which doesn't age this film a bit. Drugs and Alcohol will be an ongoing issue. I was somewhat surprised that the film was 15 years old. Overall I would recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

Corrupted governments, politicians, police forces, they all are corrupt. The only way to win the war on drugs is to legalize all drugs and make them cheap. You will still get the losers that want to get high but at least they won't commit any crime to get their next fix. But it's all utopia because even the governments are so corrupt by all the money that there is to be made that they don't want to win this war. The cast was really good for this movie.

		<shortDescription>Why the war on drugs is a war we're losing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 2000 brought us two very different films centering around drug addiction and the war against drugs.Traffic is a sweeping epic that flawlessly weaves three separate stories together in an incisive examination into the war against drugs and how it is a battle that, no matter what we do, we will continue to lose.One story revolves around a judge, played by Michael Douglas, who is appointed by the President of the United States to be the new Drug Czar and as serious as he is about his job, his neglect of his home life is revealed to have its own consequences as it is revealed that his own daughter has become addicted to crack cocaine, an addiction that has led her to selling her body to a drug dealer in order to continue getting high.Another story involves the pregnant trophy wife of a major drug trafficker (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has tried to turn a blind eye to what her husband does, but when her husband is arrested and facing serious jail time, she opens her eyes and takes charge up to the point of ordering a hit on the primary witness against her husband and continuing to negotiate international deals to keep her husband's product moving.Benecio Del Toro won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in the third story, a somewhat corrupt Mexican border cop who finds out his new boss is not who he thinks he is and how his work has put himself and his best friend (Jacob Vargas) in serious danger.Director Steven Soderbergh blindsided Ridley Scott by winning the Best Director Oscar for his brilliant weaving of these stories together, which also includes riveting turns by Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as cops assigned to keep their key witness against Zeta-Jones' husband in one piece. Though Del Toro won the supporting actor Oscar, I personally would have given it to Cheadle, who is just magnificent here. Erika Christensen is very effective as Douglas' daughter as is Dennis Quaid as Zeta-Jones' husband's sleazy attorney, who has always had his own agenda regarding his boss and his boss' wife. Miguel Ferrer also scores as the witness Cheadle and Guzman are assigned to protect.Soderberg proved to be a master cinematic storyteller with this compelling drama told on a large canvas that sustains interest and stirs emotions in equal doses, a sobering indictment regarding a war that we continue to be in denial about losing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is a movie about drug's influence on people in United States and Mexico. Movie follows various different characters in 4 different story lines. These story lines intervene with each other over the course of the movie. The movie is complex, not cause of a twisted plot, but because there is so many characters that you have to pay attention to. The movie can be slow at times and it sets up the story for quite a while.The acting is great. Benicio Del Toro gives a scruffy but great performance as a narcotic cop from Mexico. Michael Douglas plays a more conservative character from the other side of the border. Movie features other great actors like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Don Cheadle who play their parts equally well.Movie deserves credit for it's change in cinematography during scenes in different locations. Scenes happening in Mexico are always brighter and are shot with lower quality. As we move to West Coast USA the picture becomes clearer but the brightness stays. This is a great way to express how USA and/or it's habitants are richer and live more "secure" life than those in Mexico. Scenes taking place in the East Coast are cold and almost blue-ish.Traffic also has a depressing ambiance. The heavy topic has that effect. It's sometimes hard to watch the struggle of the characters being taken over by drugs. Traffic is a hard movie but recommended.</fullReview>

The whole movie is about drugs. It also details the corruption of the police officers in Mexico and the U.S.A. involving drugs.Traffic follows four separate plot lines all woven together. Michael Douglas is an Ohio judge appointed to the President's Office of National Drug Policy taking title of drug czar. He has his own personal matters with drugs within his family.Benicio Del Toro plays a police officer who gets caught up in corruption in Mexico. His partner and him go through the struggles of blending in with the corrupted officers.Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman, his partner arrest a man who is deep into drugs and deal with him giving up his boss.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a pregnant mother who is married to Steven Bauer who is Carlos Ayala. He is the boss of the drug trade.How these four stories pan out is amazing! The end result of each story line is shocking.Drugs really need to be stopped, and this movie gives you the reasons why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drugs are shown in three different stories that all come together in "Traffic", one of the best films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drugs have been a major issue all around the world, and in "Traffic" we see three different stories revolving around drugs and how each character is affected. The first story is about a Mexican police office named Javier (Benicio Del Toro) who gets enthralled with taking down a Mexican drug hit-man for a huge cartel. Javier soon finds out about the corruption and danger he gets caught up in, and his life gets full of energy. Next we have Michael Douglass playing a conservative judge in Ohio who is head of the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy but just so happens to have a daughter hooked on drugs. Then there's the most intense story, where in San Diego two DEA agents played by Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman try and take down a drug dealer and get caught up with even more crime. As they take down their first target, the man gives up the name of his boss causing that man's wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to get involved as well. The three stories emerge together and cause great intensity and experience to the audience about the different types of law enforcement on drugs and how many use drugs as well. The comparison between the law enforcers like Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglass, and Don Cheadles characters and how kids like Michael Douglass's daughter played by Erika Christensen get hooked on drugs due to the failures and corruption of law enforcement, and due to the tremendous amount of growth the drug industry as seen. Steven Soderbergh directs this film beautifully, using great intensity, complex shots to show the chemistry of each scene and show how each character transforms due to their experience with drugs. "Traffic" is just visually so complex with every film technique. The acting ensemble is very rich, and every character especially Benicio Del Torro gives a powerhouse performance that are historical. This intelligent story is a film that shows different aspects of drugs and how there is a future for stopping this issue, but to raise its awareness, a monumental film is necessary. "Traffic" is one the greatest films of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addictive traffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The insidious nature of drugs and the efforts -sometimes useless to stop their use- are revealingly exposed through the anxious lens of director Steven Soderbergh in his work, Traffic. In a mosaic of intertwined histories, Soderbergh again speaks about a controversial subject of deep common interest, one that affects all the social layers and triggers ominous conflicts and tragedies. Two Mexican policemen, Javier Rodriguez and Manolo Sanchez, working in the border with the United States to stop drug traffic, will be caught in a corruption network. In the United States, Judge Robert Wakefield is named the new Czar Antidrug of the country, and while he looks for allies at the Mexican government to fight the war against drugs in both countries, he and his wife sinks in a personal battle against the increasing addiction of their adolescent daughter. At the same time, in San Diego, DEA special agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro work in a case to eliminate one of the most powerful Mexicans cartel, and when they catch Carlos Ayala, key contact, his wife Helena will be dragged to the squalid world of her husband in order to save both hers and her son's life. Histories of the innocents, the guilty, the manipulators and the victims connect all in Traffic, an excellent cinematographic piece that stands out for being a vehicle for entertainment that sends out an important message. An absolute triumph of direction, screen writing and performances, Steven Soderbergh's film is a powerful "docudrama" that challenges our intelligence, impresses us and it affects us. The cast is sublime and everyone without exception offers a memorable interpretation. Each actor inhabits their space without nothing or nobody robbing their momentum. Stephen Gaghan's script slowly involve us in histories of common people, until we entered in the different worlds where their lives take place, from the vast and hard Mexican desert, passing by the most luxurious offices of Washington, to the suburbs where the drugs abound, waiting for their next victim. Soderbergh, a director capable of wonders, again improves himself giving the film a different look, using colors to represent diverse atmospheres and histories and using the camera-in-hand technique to intensify the realism of the scenes. Generally, the world of drugs is displayed in movies to reflect the self-destruction of the people who use them. In Traffic, is not about an affected person, the whole society is the victim, addicted in one way or other to this terrible affliction. Many people are in the incessant search of answers to end this situation. Answers that, -judging by Soderbergh and Gaghan's expositions of -, have never had effective solutions. The movie is not about criticisms, nor does try to propose ideas, is simply trying to show a reality where nobody will get away clean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, it is an excellent movie. Shame so many in our dumbed down society are incapable of understanding anything as thoughtful and complex as a 2 hour movie with a brain. Excellently acted with a great cast, Traffic is a quick and dirty tour of America's disastrous war on drugs. The inherent failing of the war, the movie argues, is twofold. One: The government intends to wage the war on moral grounds. The understanding that doing and selling drugs is morally wrong. This posture is hypocritical, intrusive &amp; pretentious. What place does a government have in establishing and enforcing a code of morality? Also, the drug laws are draconian, unrealistic and inconsistent. Potheads and people who deal crack to minors are treated as one and the same. Also, there is the simple fact of the matter that drugs in America are treated with the same nod and wink attitude of every vice from pornography to gambling to adultury. Universally deplored and widely practiced. Two: By the time the gov't got around to declaring war on drugs, the superstructure of drug trafficking throughout the world was so developed and well-financed, it was like fighting machine guns with bows and arrows. Too little, too late. There are dozens and dozens of ways to circulate drugs between and throughout countries. The pipelines are mindboggling complex and numerous. Nothing less than a 100% military effort to shut down the drug trade will be of any use &amp; that has never been the case. For instance, nothing less than a military takeover and declaring martial law in Columbia will kill the drug cartels. That will never happen for obvious reasons. By the mid 80's, when the War on Drugs was announced, drugs had been a part of our culture for decades. Movies about drug use and drug dealing were made as early as the 40's, mostly as film noirs. Sherlock Holmes, the English Victorian sleuth created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sniffs cocaine in stories written over 100 years ago. The gov't was rather late to this ballgame. Talk about closing the barn door after all the animals had gotten out. If the American Gov't is really serious about prosecuting the war on drugs; it needs to start over from the ground and rethink every aspect in both philosophy and implication. This movie provides ample food for thought and proof of that assertion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic visual experience. It's moving, powerful, and tells you the truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I haven't written about this movie. I watched it when it first came out in cinemas and to date, I can proudly say that it's the best Hollywood effort to display the crude and raw reality of drugs and th war against them. Drugs in general is a difficult topic because it affects any society. This movie perfectly displays the horrors of drug dealing, drug abuse, and worst of all, how drugs generate ambitions of any kind of people from any kind of social level.Drug dealing is the spinal cord of the movie and it's told in three parallel plots. It deals with the new American system against drugs and it's new chief. It also deals with a Mexican-American cop who gets into the drub business and mafia even that he's not the typical corrupt official. The other story has a wealthy American family involved in the dark business and how it changes their life including a nasty trial that involves two detectives and a witness.As a Mexican, I'm surprised that the movie talks about the reality in my country. Specially when it has to do with the General Rebollo's dark character. He was in charge of fighting against the Tijuana Cartel but it was later found that he had an alliance with another powerful drug cartel. A shameful truth.Another strong point in the movie is how it displays the crude reality when teenagers get into drugs.It changers everything in your life.Steven Sodenverg does a magnificent job by putting you the choice of whether drug traffic is relevant or not for your life and society. He just displays the truth of how it works in the legal system, American investigation methods, and Mexican corruption towards it.This is truly a powerful movie that will leave you breathless. One of the prime examples of how it displays a complex research towards the topic is Carl Ayala's trial and how all levels of justice get involved.Sure, the character of Javier is an utopia if you take in advance that everybody gets a piece of the cake when you get into this dark business. Take my word. Still, it was a great character that makes us believe that corruption does not necessarily happens.The ending musical score by Brian Eno is haunting, moving, perfect for the movie's tone.The best movie of 2000 and overall, one of the best from the new millennium. Fantastic performances by Douglas, Christensen, Del Toro (special mention), Zeta Jones, Cheadle, and Bratt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2 1/2 hours of this film flew by. I was riveted from the first scene to the last. The tempo is set in the first moments and does not let up. Despite the fact that it follows three different story lines, it never feels disjointed. Bravo to Soderberg for creating this substantive and important movie. Afterwards I felt like I had just finished reading a great work of literature. It almost leaves you feeling drained. The performances are excellent. Benecio Del Toro bring a gentle, quiet intensity to this role that is moving even when he is saying nothing. This man is perhaps the best actor of his generation. Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Benjamin Bratt and Salma Hayek were also impressive in their parts (though the latter two have just a few minutes of screen time). It has my vote for "Best Picture", though due to its disturbing subject matter, it may not fare well against the epic "Gladiator." If nothing else, Soderberg deserves the Oscar for directing. This one will be hard to top. Definitely worth the $9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-told 2.5-hour debate about the war on drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film sets out to tackle a big issue, there's usually a lot that goes untouched, but not with "Traffic." This film doesn't hold back anything or give anything but a balanced look at the reality of the situation caused by drug-trafficking in North America."Traffic" follows many slightly interwoven story lines. The first is the side of the story in Mexico with two cops (Del Toro and Vargas) from Tijuana trying to catch the area's top narcotics dealers. The next is the story of Robert Wakefield (Douglas) who is the newly appointed Washington official in charge of the crackdown on drugs. We also follow his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) and her recreational drug use despite being a straight A student. Lastly there is Helena (Zeta-Jones) whose husband has been arrested for drug- related crimes she knows nothing about. She is also being watched by two agents (Cheadle and Guzman).There is a lot to follow in all of these story lines, but their slight interconnectedness allows the plot to succeed without getting too complicated. The result is that we see so many different ways in which drugs affect people. The most significant thing this film does, is really challenge the mentality and opinion of those who identify with the white, upper-class politician that is Douglas' character. It is clear director Steven Soderbergh wants us to identify with him and the movie as he learns about the harsh realities of drug use in America.This film is most effective in challenging the notion that drugs can just be stopped. Those who try and end it, every character, whether Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, they all find there is a big price to pay for such little reward and minimal difference made in stopping drug use. While that might suggest a bias in the film, there seems to be no suggestion made by Stephen Gaghan's awesome script that the war on drugs is futile and that the effort should be ceased. This film highlights the difficulty and in an incredibly convincing fashion.Soderbergh and Gaghan make a great team in this movie. Soderbergh uses different techniques and lighting, particularly with colors, to help make the distinctions in plot lines that are already solid to begin with. When everything appears yellow, for example, you know immediately that the scene will follow Del Toro and take place in Mexico. It also sets a tone for these plot lines on top of that."Traffic" ends up just being a really fantastically told, eye-opening lecture with encouraged discussion on the war on drugs. The film ends and there is a sense of the futility, the perpetual nature of what this illegal business does to people, but there is also a sense of hope, that ending drug use can start in the smallest of places with the people who have developed attachments to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is categorically sensational. The ratio between good and bad is incredibly entertaining. Benicio Del Torro gives a performance of a lifetime, worthy of the title of the best Hispanic actor to date, and Catherine Zeta Jone's portrayal of the at first broken to the latter conspiratorial murderer is flawless.Stephen Gahghan's screenplay is worthy of every award possible to a human being, he defines new meaning to the word "writer", he has created a different style to cinema that will be studied and admired until the end of film.Stephen Soderbourouhg's direction at times is patchy and it lacks enthusiasm at times, almost to the point of confusion, however and most importantly it does not dissipate into a voyage of different characters with meaningless tales, it cleverly intertwines all of the plots into one that delivers a imperative message on the war on drugs.Without divulging any of the plot and secrets of this masterpiece, it is easily an advert for excellence in screenplay writing and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, uncompromising, honest portrayal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor, best film editing.It is quite obvious how this picture got its acclaim.More often than not, the narcotics industry is glamorised, or portrayed with stylish gangsters. More often, the actors are being theatrical, or the violence is brutal, even in a given context. More often than not, the thread is quite simple, and involves lots of people getting shot, or mutilated, or meeting a grisly demise.Not very often it is, that a picture can convey the effects of the drugs world on all social tiers of society, which such uncompromising honesty.Traffic, with an all star cast that are so incredibly natural that it is quite easy to see the characters and not the actors themselves, has four running story threads, that occupy the same world and era in time: The upper class politicians family, the drug lords wife and her child- entwined with the two cops that are striving to make a case against him. And the honest, hard working Mexican cop, trying to do the best that he can in a dangerous world that he believes is worth fighting for and preserving.It would go as far as to say that Traffic is not a film you watch for thrills. It is not a jazzy crime thriller, nor is it full of explosions and fireworks and car chases. What it is, is beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and driven with maverick skill.The messages- there are many. One, as mentioned above stands out more poignantly than the rest. Narcotics affect us all. They affect our families, are streets, our neighborhoods, our parks, they affect 'us'. Sodenberg shows us, with a documentarians eye glass, how things are beneath the sugar coated iceberg. After the beaches and the duck course luncheons and the Georgetown mansions there is a world that many of us would like to shy away from. To close our doors and smile sycophantically and pretend does not exist. Only to shut our doors, is to perhaps to confine ourselves to the real war, at home.Indeed what fools we all are, going to law school, undertaking a hard days work with our lunch buckets, teaching a classroom full of rebel children. Why, we could be out there, earning multiples of our paychecks by running and pushing an industry that far exceeds any government resource levels.I strongly recommend this picture to anyone seeking an honest, emotional, yet also artistic ride. There is an all star cast including Michael Douglass, Katherine Zita Jones, Don Cheadle Luis Guzman- to name but a few. All of which, give incredibly natural, and honest performances.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable film by an encore cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film dealing with a subject as wide and varied and intense as the international war on drugs, Traffic deals exceptionally well. It balances the four stories so effectively that we sometimes forget the film is two and a half hours. Each story is carefully built upon itself until they all come crashing together. This reminds me of another film dealing with racism in the same way, Crash. This film is way better. Soderbergh's use of hand-held cameras and off-color film is brilliant to capture the gritty, messy side of America and Mexico that deal with this subject every day. The acting is excellent with Douglas and Del Toro both giving the best portrayals of a drug czar dealing with a heroin-addicted daughter and a Mexican cop who gets caught up in a corrupt web of drug dealers and police. The screenplay here is the key, and Gaghan is very good in keeping us up to date on all stories and ending them right so as not to reveal too much or too little. This is a film that provokes a lot of thoughts and opinions on drugs and how to deal with them. The film never takes a side, except to show how drugs are affecting the American youth and getting into this country with ease. Still, the audience is left to dissect this remarkable film and come up with a decision amongst ourselves of how we are going to deal with this. We need to; as Traffic shows, this is a serious situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing.It takes 4 different stories in four different places and connects them with drugs.Let me start with the Washington D.C./Ohio story.... Robert Wakefield (Douglas) is the president's new drug czar. While fighting against drugs, he learns that his daughter (Christensen) is a drug user. Michael Douglas portrayed Robert Wakefield wonderfully. He's a great actor. Erika Christensen played Caroline Wakefield. Erika is so talented. She played a very difficult part flawlessly.Let's go to the DEAs' story... Ray Castro (Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Cheadle) are two cops who are in charge of making sure nothing happens to Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), the leading witness against Carlos Ayala (Bauer). Guzman and Cheadle are great. Their parts are very entertaining. Their characters are very serious about their work, and yet, they throw a bit of humor into the movie.Onto San Diego... Helena (Zeta-Jones) is the classic trophy wife. Helena learns that her husband has been smuggling illegal drugs into America. Only having her husband's best friend Arnie (Quaid) to lean on, Helena takes over the drug business and also tries to keep her husband out of jail. Catherine Zeta-Jones was definitely robbed of a Golden Globe. Her portrayal of Helena Ayala was incredible. She played the part perfectly.And finally, Mexico... Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro) is a cop who is dedicated to his work. While trying to help the people of Mexico, he learns the secrets of his boss. This story was very confusing the first time I watched it. The second time, however, I saw how amazing it was. Benicio deserved his Oscar. He played Javier with complete ease.This movie was amazing. Every actor and actress was the perfect fit. It's a movie that should be seen by every high school student so they can see how drugs affect everyone in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly inconsistent, but overall great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just start out by saying: I loved this movie. I recommended it to all my friends. I even wrote this review. It definitely did not get the attention it deserved. With a somewhat confusing ending and web-like plot, it was intellectually challenging on many levels--a very good thing in movies, but not too popular, as evidenced by the remake of The Manchurian Candidate and the recent flop Syriana. Basically, an upstanding San Diego businessman (Steven Bauer--whom some may recall from the 1983 Scarface) has been busted for drug smuggling. His shallow wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) feels betrayed and in danger. Two cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) keep her on constant watch, while guarding a corrupt tuna fisherman/coke trafficker Ed Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who also happens to be the main testifier against Mr. Bauer. Meanwhile, back in Mexico, morally ambiguous vigilante cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his sidekick Manolo execute odd jobs for Gen. Salazar (Tomas Milian) while simultaneously dealing with the fact that Salazar may not actually be as "anti-drug" as he says he is. Politician Bob Wakefield (Michael Douglas) must deal with the drug demons within his own home as he attempts to battle them in his career.Overall, this movie is bittersweet. Some of the characters get revenge, others don't. Some conflicts are resolved, and some aren't. Mostly this movie is memorable for its portrayal of drugs and drug culture. When you ask most people what should be done with smack addicts, they aren't too concerned..."Oh, ship them off to rehab" "They're all corrupt, amoral excuses for human beings" but what happens when all that gets closer to home? This movie shows the bridges on the gap between the private and the public, especially with the Bob Wakefield storyline. The Catherine Zeta-Jones storyline seemed mainly concerned with one woman's incredible power to survive and pull herself together in the face of loss--and her discarding of any morals about drugs she may have previously had. OK. Let's talk acting. Basically, watch this movie for Del Toro, if nothing else. Benicio Del Toro is a diamond in the rough--he never overacts, which perhaps lends some to believe he is flat--but everything he does is completely natural and unaffected. For instance, his somewhat stony demeanor is temporarily interrupted by a pure animal reaction when a colleague is killed. Michael Douglas's acting is OK (not great) but I can see him acting. Del Toro I cannot. The very idea of movie cameras surrounding him seems absurd. Another cool part is when Javier (straight for all purposes) pretends to be attracted to Clifton Collins Jr.'s character in a seedy San Diego gay bar so that he can be deceived and led into interrogation. His half-suppressed smirk (which Collins must have interpreted as flirtatiousness) had me convulsed in laughter. For more comic Del Toro goodness, see him as the infamous Dr. Gonzo in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas...an experience not to be missed. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrible, for reasons many and colorful. The inflection on her sentences is wrong, her facial expressions are wrong, her character development is wrong. She neither convinces us of her love for Steven Bauer, nor convinces us she is a ready and willing adulteress. And with the drug-dealing thing at the end, that was completely out of the blue. Truly horrible stuff. I also disliked Michael Keaton's daughter. I'll give her one thing, she did "stoned" really well. So well, in fact, that she felt obliged to show it off for the whole movie, even when her character wasn't supposed to be stoned. I liked the idea of her character--so many great drug movies (such as Scarface, and Carlito's Way) do not have anybody receiving the brunt of drug abuse; it just shows the top lords and their glitzy lives. There is nothing romantic or operatic about her addiction. Yet why, exactly, is she addicted? I don't care that she's a popular prep, they can be depressed too, but she showed no reason or glimpse into Caroline's darker side...just a stoned prep. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman were...well, awesome. I loved them as a team. Luis Guzman just did "Luis Guzman" as always--comforting bordering on the vaguely irritating--but Cheadle was completely natural and played off Guzman very well--and was not, for all the comedy, 2 dimensional. His reaction at a tragedy involving Guzman is extremely sad. I won't go into everyone here, but some minor performances I really liked were Topher Grace as Caroline's well-meaning yet weak dealer boyfriend, and especially Clifton Collins Jr. as the endearingly pathetic psychotic gay assassin Francisco "Frankie Flowers" Flores. Collins has a tendency to completely submerge himself in his role--for example, I was surprised to learn, after watching this movie, that Collins is not actually gay. For more Grade A acting, watch him as ambiguously psychotic gay serial killer Perry Smith in Capote. I thought Frankie was a character with a lot of potential to be interesting (especially in his dinner conversation with Salazar: "I've always liked stereos. Most people don't understand.") I was sad that he didn't have more lines.The cinematography was again incredible. At times I thought it approached the annoyingly artsy, but symbolically it outlined the impenetrability of different cultures and economic classes, with a cold blue light shadowing the lives of the upper-crust politician and his family, a glimmering golden light showing off the easy lives of San Diego rich whites, and a mud-spattered, dirty-looking front for the story of the independent cop who makes $300 a month.Overall, some of the acting could have used help, the screenplay was not very good (note quotability factor: nil) and some of Caroline's lines were just embarrassing--but some of the acting, directing, video editing, and cinematography were just too good to miss. And let's not forget how it shows up the drug issue...Conservatives, get ready to revise your opinions. A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is a good film, with a good plot, great acting and great directing. Each different story is given its own visual style which is a really nice feature. The stories are well interwoven and the acting is flawless throughout. However, I felt that this film was too distant. The stories were all great but never went into enough depth to draw you in. There seemed to be so much potential but it never really came tougher.The cast is amazing, and in my opinion they make this film. Benicio Del Toro is absolutely brilliant; unfortunately you never get to see further into his character and his story which is a real disappointment. The acting is the best feature in the film; it holds it tougher and makes it a worthwhile viewing experience. But acting alone doesn't make a film. The story and directing may be good, but that is it.In my opinion Traffic is no more than good, which is a shame because it could have been great. If you're a fan of Benicio Del Toro I would recommend you watch it but other wise, its nothing special. Had they taken every story and made separate films of them then that would have been worth watching, they all disserved more time but never got it. I never got the chance to fall in love with traffic simply because it chooses the multiple stories route but never quite pulls it off leaving the stories feeling rushed and wasted.I give it a 7 out of 10 because it is well directed and acted but never really drew me in and ended up seeming rushed. Luckily it saved itself with a brilliant ending which all ads up to make it a fairly good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am wondering why this film got four Oscars. The reason could be that there was no serious concurrence in that year. It's okay that Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar but for the rest? Even Michael Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones couldn't save this disaster. There was a cheesy picture and a terrible soundtrack. All the camera work is shot by hand and we can talk here from a low-budget-movie. Perhaps the director wanted to create a film-documentary atmosphere but it didn't work. The whole story could have been told in a shorter way. There was absolutely no action and no suspense and that should be very important to entertain the audience. Okay the film shows us the problem with the drugs between California and Mexico and that hits an interesting theme. I think this movie is worth showing in all schools. I'm sorry but this DVD has no place in my collection because I simply don't have the time to watch a film with a length of 147 minutes!! Just average with 5/10. On IMDb the vote of actually 7.8 is no doubt too overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The innovative cinematography, hard-hitting plot, incredible acting performances and fast-but-not-too-fast editing all seemed to be brilliant when I first saw it. I thought Soderbergh was a guru for thinking all this up until I paid a random visit to the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City soon after seeing the film. The Museum showed clips from a British television series called "Traffik" which aired in the early 90s. The plot was EXACTLY the same; only the locations were different. So Soderbergh is less brilliant than I first assumed, but his cinematographic techniques have to be commended, along with the performances he got out of the cast. It's worth getting a hold of the British series too; it's great stuff also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mainstreamed Hollywood remake full of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic", a technically interestingly made movie based on the British BBC mini series "Traffik", comes with three plot lines and suffers highly from bad script writing. While we have no remake here per se, the script is based on original material of a 6 hours BBC TV mini series from the 1980s and compared to the original material this movie looks very pale indeed. Soderbergh could have done a lot better than this.Plot one: a new judge is appointed by the president to fight the war against drugs (weakest, superfluous); Two: an US cop duo tries to nail a drug dealer boss (cop soap style); Three: a Mexican cop duo fights drugs on their own peculiar way by working for one of the drug bosses (the heart of the movie).Plot #3 has the most screen time and is far more compelling than the other two, mostly due to brilliant acting from Benicio Del Toro. Plot #2 is so predictable that it hardly serves any purpose at all and plot #1, the father-daughter conflict between the drug fighter judge (Douglas) and the drug addict daughter (Christensen) is mediocre and shallow at best. Granted, there are a few lines that go deeper but far too few to prevent this movie from reiterating clichés.Eventually, in the best tradition of Hollywood cinema, we are catered a mainstream "happy ending" on all plot parts, everything is explained to the last detail, the good guys will get the bad guys eventually and the kids will overcome their drug addiction.Go see the original.5/10</fullReview>

Salazar's role is breathtaking and "bigger than life" but stupid and pathetic end ruins the movie. Mr. Douglas' panic attack during the press conference, bug under the table of scum (preparation for "Traffic II" ??) and - finally - cheesy family pseudo - community: Gooooooood !!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Traffic' plays out like 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' by connecting three dissimilar stories together by loose narrative threads. Each element feeling like it was created by a different filmmaker.Whereas that was literally true for the team of TZ directors, 'Traffic' is one man running the show...yes, I'm talking about Soderbergh. I respect the man because he isn't like such directors as Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, or Steven Spielberg. He didn't start with childish work and hasn't degenerated into childish work. Then again, 'Erin', 'Frontal', and 'Eleven' are signs he may be leaving his raw phase. God forbid. Stone did the same, look where he is now.This is your only spoiler warning...The first of 'Traffic's tripartite plot in Mexico plays like Robert Rodriguez. The Cheadle/Zeta-Jones cat &amp; mouse game resembles William Friedkin. The last section, Douglas and family, plays like a mainstream Spielberg movie. I found the first subplot the most interesting and refreshing, the last two are no different than TV cop shows and family dramas.The actors aren't required to do anything more than read lines and move around. Soderberg isn't concerned with highlighting any of them or making an engaging image, just telling a story. I am not impressed with his cinematography, though. Making the audience into a member of the action via the camera is nothing new, I wish more video game adaptations would do this, but Soderbergh's placement isn't right and too often he resembles glossy commercials.Overall, watch this with Scarface to see the different interpretations of the drug war. This is the most mature. (60%)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film by looking at the high IMDb user rating and I just wasted more than 2 1/2 hours of my time. Many people on this board say everything comes together at the end of this movie but I'll say this movie is getting nowhere at the end.Firstly, it's boring. Always talking. Talking is not a problem if they are talking about interesting stuffs but rather stuffs like "What did you eat yesterday?"...etc. That's why, when the movie ends, you'll end up ask yourself, what's the point of the movie?Secondly, it's has a great cast, both US and Mexican speaking, but such as waste in this movie.My generous rating: ***/**********</fullReview>

The movie provides an ultimately cynical view of the so-called "war on drugs" and sustains interest in all the stories all the way through. If anything the movie gets better towards the end and we are left with some hope. Well-acted all round and well worth the look. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a good balance of importance and entertainment value.Granted, it's dangerous to put oneself above an issue as weighty as the War on Drugs, as Soderberg has done here, but the result is a pretty believeable telling of the way things are.Sometimes Forman from That 70s Show gets annoying and you want to smack him. Sometimes Michael Douglas says a stupid line and you want to stomp on his face. But hey! That's the way real life is!Benicio del Toro is cool as heck, and if you understand Spanish you'll be treated to some bonus one-liners from him that aren't in the subtitles ("Leche en polvo, guey?"). And, if you are like me, you will find Catherine Zeta Jones both dramatically convincing and mind-bendingly knockerific.Every time I see that car blow up, it makes me sad.This review is getting out of control. Traffic was a good movie. It should have won the Oscar, instead of Gladiator starring Russell the Crow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Traffic is an average movie which does not inspire enough interest to get out of that pigeon hole. It deals with many stories and they are all related on some way, obviously the director was watching some foreign films, for this is nothing new. Most of the stories are preposterous, take for example the wife of a drug dealer, in a few weeks she is talking to dangerous drug leaders in Mexico as if she knew what she was doing. Also, the drug czar wandering around in the ghettos of Baltimore, these scenes do not add up and as a result the film is mostly a compendium of utter boredom that drags on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ermm, oh... not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I don't really have a *huge* problem with the movie per se, more the abundant praise rained on it here and elsewhere. Sure it's nice to escape the manipulative Hollywood sacharin of "Pay It Forward" and friends into the realistic quasi-intelligent pastures offered up by Traffic, but gritty grime alone does not a good movie make. This is a busy film with lots flitting in and out by scores of similar characters seemingly not doing much. Brief scenes dart from one part of the country to another relieve the boredom but I walked away fully aware of the fact that I hadn't enjoyed the last 150 minutes at all. None of the characters are developed beyond their pop-up introduction and they may as well have tattooed 'bad guy', 'corrupt policeman', 'dea wife' etc onto the actors' heads. Ultimately my biggest issue with Traffic was that I simply didn't feel anything about a single one of these people; they could have all died or got married or flown into space for all I cared, and frankly I wish they had. It would have at least offered some entertainment value that this docu-wood rendition of a Mexican edition of 'Cops' failed to deliver - the movie didn't move me. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest ensembles of all time have collaborated on one of the greatest films of all time. The acting in this is first-rate and brilliant, and if one of these actors had been left out, this movie could not have been what it was. I was a huge Benicio Del Toro before, but this movie has sent me into obsession. He is spectacular as a Mexican cop who is forced to make a moral dilemma. Michael Douglas seemed right at home in his man in power role, this time the President's new drug czar, but it was refreshing to see him have emotions. It was also refreshing to see Catherine Zeta-Jones as something besides a pretty face. She was tremendous as a San Diego wife who finds out her husband's "true" life. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman provided some humor and yet some serious and emotional points as well. Jacob Vargas was enjoyable as Del Toro's partner in Mexico. However, for me the real stand out in this film has got to be Erika Christensen, who plays the drug czar's (MD)addicted daughter. She will be a force to be reckoned with.One of the best parts of this film was the cinematography, the color choices made by Soderbergh were absolutely astonishing. The colors represent feelings about the towns involved. The "dustiness" of Mexico shows us all how difficult a life it is below the border. The "blue" of Cincinatti, shows how upsetting life can be with drugs in it. While the "normalness"of San Diego and La Jolla, show how this could be Anytown USA involved in this phenomenon. The way Soderbergh and film editor Stephen Mirrone allowed these scenes to flow was a highlight that any movie would love to have.This will one day be on the next top 100 of all time list because of it's message and sheer enjoyment. For me this two and half hour film sped by in no time and I was sad to see it end. The one thing this movie has that others have not, is the fact that it has America talking about a situation that needs to be discussed. If you want to see a movie with an excellent cast, cinematography, direction, and an important message, that isn't preached at you, this is the one that should be chosen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see this movie please dont say that Mr. Del Toro was great because im tired of hearing that. He was okay. The film tries to add good actors, snazzy directing and a semi-good script but it doesn't try to prove a point. Yes we have all seen the drugs are bad for you movies. Whats so different about this one. Because its got an Oscar winning script? Because the Erin Brockovich guy did it? Is that it? Because if it is then that is a pretty lame excuse. This film make people in the suburbs think that they know what is goin on with drug trafficking. When they walk out the theater and think thats what is really going on, I get sick to my stomach. This has been done before. the only thing that is different is that this one won 4 oscars. That doesn't mean anything. Requiem for a Dream was 100x's better. But it didn't 50 million + budget. It didn't have Michael Douglas. It didn't have Mr. Soderburgh. It did have quality, it did have fresh new talent, it did have a new beat to the anti-drug films. Next time you're at the video stores, instead of getting the mainstream Traffic, pick up Requiem.If you agree or disagree with my review please e-mail me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terribly mediocre cinematography if not downright awful. Acting was good. This is true. Direction was solid, but as a whole the film was nothing more than a hyper-long dragged out episode of Homicide. We've seen all these story points before. The drug warrior's daughter on drugs who ends up the victim of the black drug dealer? Not new. The depiction of the kids getting high was interesting and Soderbergh did a good job of nailing that, but as a whole the movie glossed over the problems with the drug war. And I just don't know how people can comment on the cinematography as being anything above average. If this is how we are holding the bar for values in the cinematic field, Directors Of Photography all over the world are breathing a collective sigh of relief.</fullReview>

But the performances by Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Miguel Ferrer, Albert Finney were also brilliant. In fact, the only weak performance was by Zeta Jones. Maybe because of all the other great performances its unfair to compare her to the others. Director Steven Soderbergh directed this daring film with great courage and determination, and I can hardly wait to see more of his films in the future.

		<shortDescription>Worst movie about drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in January, and again, recently. The movie sucks. It sucks, Sucks, SUCKS. This is a bad, unoriginal movie that Soderburgh even rips off his own styles for. I hated this movie and can't understand what people see in this movie. The plots on their own were highly unoriginal. We have drugs corrupting a mafia-like Mexican law, we have the rise of the next head of a drug crime syndicate, and the story of parents dealing with their kids doing drugs. Could be, without a big stretch of the imagination called Goodfellas, The Godfather, Requiem for a Dream/Sunday night movie.That's the most base of qualms for this turd that stunk up the theaters. Another is the style. It took the style of Magnolia or Short Cuts. But, it insulted my intelligence with the color schemes. The color schemes do not mean anything deep, it was just a way of separating the stories. Now that's insulting. I can watch Short Cuts and keep those stories straight, give me some credit.Another stylistic fault is the color schemes themselves. When changing around they started kind of cool, but got irritating. I had seen the bluishness in Out of Sight and the brown in the other nominated (and much better) Erin Brockovich. Both directed by Soderburgh. In both movies they worked because they fit the theme of their scene. In this, they just got boring.And, finally, the camera work. It was another case of over-stylized camera work whelming the movie. Do we really need the slo-mo/fantastical/sped-up camera work? It was highly unnecessary and boring. I do wish that style had a point when it was used. Like in Requiem for a Dream it had a point. IN The Doom Generation it had a point. In this movie, it didn't.The only thing good about the movie, I must concede, is the acting. Unless you survive off acting, it can't save a movie from the doldrums. Skip this movie, and go watch something redeeming instead.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this tonight with very high expectations and the acting lived up to my expectations. The story was choppy and at times hard to follow but after about 1 ? hours and lots of sub-titles the stories started to slowly come together and make sense. What just about destroyed the entire movie was the way Soderbergh shot the movie. I think half of the movie was shot with a 8mm hand held video camera and a cheap one at that. There was so much unnecessary camera motion it totally distracted me from the good acting and interesting story. And if a hand held cam was not enough we had close in shots with the main characters face out of focus and at times off the top or the side of the screen. It looked like a ten year old with daddy's old super 8 video shot 1/3 of the movie. What was Soderbergh thinking? I gave it 6 out of 10 and that's generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This long (150 minutes), big drug movie with a large, talented cast has gotten a lot of critical acclaim. Why? The multiple plots have all been done before and the outcomes are totally predictable. Also director Steven Soderbergh's camerawork gets annoying. It's sometimes very jittery and he's constantly using different colored filters for different countries. It's jarring and frustrating. Also cutting off the sound and adding music during dramatic scenes does NOT work. It's used too often and kept throwing me out of the film. The main problem with the film, however, is that's it's so slow. Everything moves at a snail's pace and I was bored within an hour. This movie could have easily been cut down by half an hour. Also there's a very bad performance by Tomas Milian as an evil general--talk about overacting! However, everybody else is great (that's why I gave this movie a 5)--the acting is what kept me watching. Best performances are by Catherine Zeta-Jones who comes to realize her husband (Steven Bauer) is a drug dealer; Benicio Del Toro as a Maxican cop unwittingly drawn into a drug war and Erika Christensen as a teenager hooked on drugs. Still, good acting can only help such a slow, long movie to a point. There have been better, more powerful movies made about drugs. I really can't recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that Traffic more than adequately shows how futile the war on drugs really is. As long as tax dollars continue to be needlessly wasted on the war on drugs, the criminal element will continue to profit and benefit from the illegal status of drugs.A big plus for this movie was Del Toro. Robert DeNiro is the only other actor whose movies I will watch because of his name being associated with them. Del Toro has joined such fine company. I would have to say, hands down, that Del Toro is one of the top five actors in Hollywood today.The negatives of this movie were the length (2 hours would have been sufficient) and the atrocious acting of Catherine Zeta-Jones. She was like an automaton and very uninspired. The movie would have been 10 times better had Zeta-Jones and Salma Hayek's roles had been reversed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soderbergh's message against drugs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never a film explored the world of trafficking and it consequences in such a realistic and magnificent way as Steven Soderbergh did here in his masterpiece."Traffic" is a superb film that takes a deep look at the drug world and the trafficking between the USA and Mexico, through the stories and lives of several characters. The film does not tell the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), an Mexican police struggling to keep its distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; is not the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to transform the drug dealer low Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against drug cartel chief; is not the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the innocent cartel drug boss who suddenly discovers that her husband really is, and what he does for a living; is not the story of a new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so involved in his mission end the war on drugs, he fails to realize that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack. It's not only one main story, it is all these stories that construct the film in a fantastic way, showing the traffic world from various perspectives. And much like in the real world, the events of each story, directly or indirectly affect each other.In terms of history, "Traffic" is absolutely brilliant, Stephen Gaghan (screenplay) uses a writing so incredible, delivering over 100 scenes of dialog between the characters and their stories. They all serve even as an anti-drug message, and the direction Soderbergh helps complement everything.The film is so well directed that the public feels suffocated. There is no background music at all, leaving the viewer feeling as if witnessing scenes of real life, not just watching a movie. These techniques to make a very personal experience for that Soderbergh, as in previous films, uses various shades of color specific to enhance a mood or a feeling of awareness of what is about to happen in each story of a character.The film's cast is totally flawless. There is no better or worse in the film, each and every character adds something significant to the history of film, and each actor is excellent. But three actors, in particular, stand out: Benicio Del Toro simply superb gives a performance so realistic and PERFECT to his character; Don Cheadle fantastic as always; Catherine Zeta Jones delivers a performance so complex and gets better with every passing minute.A stunning movie, "Traffic" has a steady gaze hard on called "war on drugs", which is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan stand up the various points of view of the drug culture, ranging from users, traffickers, police and politicians. And weaves his characters and their different stories into one story that is deep in his ideas, but very simple to understand with pure realism that the film manages to show. In terms of history, direction and characters, "Traffic" is easily the best Soderbergh film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traffic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic attempts to look at the drug trade from several different angles, from the head of the Director of USA's drug control office with his cocaine addicted daughter, to the drug trade in Mexico and the attempt by the DEA to bring a drug lord to justice. The stories are interconnected and although the characters do not meet their actions influence one another. Traffic does show some of the effects that the drug trade has on people. Several innocent lives are cut short and previously law abiding citizens are turned into criminals, by the drug trade. The futility of the "war on drugs" is also well illustrated as one drug lord escapes prosecution when a key witness is killed. The problem with the film is that in attempting to show the drug trade from so many different angles it spreads itself to thin and none of the stories or issues get looked at in enough detail. Whilst the idea may have worked as a miniseries (I haven't seen Traffik) or even as a full length TV series such as "The Wire", but as a film there is not enough time to give the characters emotional depth or the issues enough focus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? It is simple:For first, the story is not only a big puzzle, but also very previsible and too unbelieveable. Two hours are really so much to "Traffic" because of the many stories developed in, and not enough because each story finished in a "flash": V.gr., Can you imagine the anti-drugs zar of Occident World running alone straight an unknown street somewhere in the U.S., looking for his daughter? Can you think as "posible" to be a drug-addict for years and suddenly came to the "best one" in therapy sesions?Secondly, the movie is "politically correct", as it shows the "war against drugs" as something both possible (think about the super-hero Benicio del Toro) and impossible (think about all the rest) to face to a nation as great as U.S.At least, all those stories flying inconstantly over the theater air, collapse with the role playing of each actor/actress, and, besides Benicio del Toro (who is great as a mexican super-hero) Douglas, Zeta Jones, Quaid, etc., falls in the nonsense of the puzzle.It could be the worst movie about drugs ever.

		<fullReview>I think I'm missing something. Really. I rented Traffic with the highest of expectations. I had heard it was brilliantly done and got rave reviews. Not only did my expectations go unfulfilled, but I wanted to turn it off 40 minutes into the movie. The colors used in the movie, I assume for some artsy reason, were inconsistent as well as extremely annoying. Another thing I didn't like about this disaster of a motion picture was the fact that in a span of like one day, Catherine Zeta Jones' character learned all there was to know about drugs. That scene where she melts the statue made of crank or whatever it was was awful. In short, don't see it. This movie gets my vote for "Most Overrated Movie of All Time". What a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF SEEING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traffic was the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought it was going to be one of the best, so as soon as it came out I rented it from Blockbuster. I took it home, popped it in the DVD player, and let it go.Every five minutes or so the scene changes to follow different people. Each different scene is a different color, like, one is the real color we see, another is just shades of blue, etc. In each scene, new people are introduced all the time without saying who they are. And, some of the scenes aren't even in english!I was outraged. After I finished the movie (which was as slow as could be) I went back to Blockbuster and talked to my friend that works there. I managed to convince her to give me a refund. She said that lots of people that had rented the movie had come back 15 or 20 minutes later, demanding a refund.I highly recommend not watching this movie, it will only disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A monumental achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surprisingly fresh and stunning take on the so-called "War on Drugs" and how the film's characters (in three separate stories) are either benefited or afflicted by it. Part of the film's unbalanced pace in "Traffic" reminded me of another great and very edgy thriller that also dealt with the drug trade - "The French Connection". Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan have carefully created and mended a story that feel completely like reality (and it's believable, too). The question that I have about the film is who is the main character and it tends to lean more towards Benicio Del Toro, who portrays a by-the-book Mexican cop who's up to his neck in corruption than Michael Douglas, a judge from Ohio who has been picked as the new Drug Czar. Besides, I was still amazed and impressed by the movie and the effect it left on me. "Traffic" is a monumental achievement for Soderbergh himself and the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best overview of the Mex/Am drug problem yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Traffic" is a lean and sinewy flick which walks astride the US/Mexican border (mainly Tijuana, Baja CA) as it takes the audience into the "war on drugs" at many levels. The film interleaves several stories in a Magnolia-esque fashion so as to tell its tale from top (US Drug Czar) to bottom (street pusher). Sonderbergh uses a variety of techniques including jiggly shoulder cams, color filtration, grain/contrast, background music &amp; sound, etc. effectively to help create coherence from the chaos which is the drug war as well as for artistic effect. The result is an excellent fast moving overview of the paradoxical Mexican/American drug problem in a 2.5 hour watch with drama, action, and even some moments of humor delivered by a stellar cast. A good adult drama which may be a tad over-touted and is more interesting than compelling and more compelling than evocative.</fullReview>

Let's just hope this doesn't damage their career. You had to read half the movie and guess which city you were in at any given time. Catherine Zeta-Jones cursing was not impressive, it was demeaning to her.I saw the same plot in a CBS movie a few years back. It's old already. Never thought I'd wanna see vampire movies come back, but after seeing THIS movie I'd take Cable Guy II. Unless you're someone who lives to have useless drama (Actually, there WAS no drama in this movie)in their lives, there is no need to see this movie. See the movie "Quills" if you like drama.....And it's a true story. If you feel you want to see this movie, please wait until it comes out on video. Believe me, you'll thank me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're excited by this mediocrity, don't even try a truly good film because you might get a heart-attack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soderbergh's pretentious and clumsily pastiched-together look at drugs in society is just as overrated as one would expect.The movie isn't without merit, in the sense that it's watchable, if nothing else. The colour-shifts did not impress me; the idea was okay but the visual look of the movie is quite bad as a result.Although I like Del Toro, he was surprisingly bland, which brings me to the obvious reason why he got the Oscar for this: he was a Latino star speaking Spanish in a critically-acclaimed movie, and because they (the 5000 moronic Tinseltown voters) gave a couple of Oscars already to several black actors in recent years, it was time to give the fast-growing U.S. Latino community one, too. (Lucy Lu, get ready to get one for the Orientals...) Hopefully this is nothing new to anyone who might read this: it should be obvious by now to anyone with just half a brain cell that the Oscars are awarded for reasons that have solely to do with financial success, nepotism (the voters love giving awards to kids of other actors), and politics. It fascinates and amazes me that tens of millions of movie fans still use the Oscars as a measuring stick for quality. " 'Brokeback Mountain' got 38 Oscars?? Wow! Must be a great movie!" Toward the end of "Traffic" some of the points Soderbergh tries to make about drugs become obvious/cliché - and even dubious; e.g. Douglas's press-conference speech when he declares that a war on drugs is a war "on our own families", which is total and utter bulls**t. We've also got Douglas's daughter saying some nonsense about her experiences, as if this were some TV drama-of-the-week. Besides, her character gets absolutely no sympathy from me, as she is an ultra-privileged spoiled preppy who deserves neither pity nor government money being thrown on her recovery. Generally, the part of the movie with Douglas lacks realism, plus I always had trouble accepting Douglas as a politician.Soderbergh only made two noteworthy movies, and both were made earlier in his career: "Kafka" and "Sex, Lies &amp; Videotape". Ignore everything he made after that. He falls into the Zemeckis/Howard/van Sant category of "useless overrated commercial directors".</fullReview>

Douglas's wife's character was a good example of the cardboard caricatures most of the actors in this film were saddled with. She had the job of being the "liberal" parent who let's her child experiment. Yeah, right. And why was Catherine Zeta-Jones even in this movie? Shouldn't she be making cell phone ads?

Mr. and Mrs. Douglas overact like the Mr. and Mrs. Burton in their heyday, and Mr. Douglas's storyline--drug czar's daughter descends into drug hell--plays like an afterschool special circa 1982. Del Toro is fine and gets the best story, tho it all becomes a bit confusing. Overall, I just found this to be a pretty flat movie of the week.</fullReview>

If, at some time in the future, it would begin to make a lick of sense, it wouldn't be the fault of the filmmakers, who tried to obfuscate everything that might actually be coherent. (The first 6 minutes is entirely in Spanish, without subtitles. The only words I recognized were the dirty ones.)The premise (as stated on the IMDB page for the film) seems like a good one, but this is so arrogantly made, ignoring the audience, that it seems designed only to appeal to equally arrogant critics (who scorn anything that's actually popular).In summation: Ghastly, unless you're one of the latte and croissant crowd who calls movies "cinema."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by the amount of votes and positive feedback this film had. What is lacking is a decent story, many dreary scenes and total boredom! I've seen plenty better than this. My friend fell asleep 5 times in this film, only adding to the ludicrosy as to why this film was brought out in the first place. This is beyond me. Trust me, this film is best avoided. If you've got a wish to be thoroughly bored for the day, then see this. It should rise to the occasion on that level at least.So what about positive things about the film? I suppose there is one or two rather well crafted scenes in the movie, but mostly it makes for dull viewing. Even Douglas and Zeta Jones' screen presence didn't enliven the proceedings much. Very disappointing and not recommended. Certainly not a film for the family. However, another positive thing about the film is that it does portray a dangerous insight into the world of drugs. It's certainly a good thing to learn from about the dangers of drugs.This film alone makes dire viewing, but the fact that it highlights the dangers of drugs gives it reason to watch it, but mainly, it's a boring film. However, it should make parents and kids more aware about the dangers of drugs. I'm sorry if this review offends anyone in any way, but I simply did not enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(No spoilers in this.) Most reviewers claim that this movie is not preachy, or that it doesn't offer suggested solutions to the pointless and casualty-laden War On Drugs. Actually, there are numerous and continuous preachings: all the Michael Douglas "treatment" stuff early on and the continuous "I know this is not doing any good but I am morally bound to do it" paradigm explicit in the actions and words of every single law-enforcement individual shown on screen (both the good ones AND the bad ones). The implication that it is somehow OK to condone corruption in matters of petty car theft and police bribery as long as your higher calling is to be a moral crusader in the far more important initiative to bring down drug lords makes a mockery of the otherwise benevolent message that Soderbergh presents in this marvellous movie. I have seldom seen such sustained intensity and sheer quality in an ensemble of actors/actresses. Del Toro certainly deserved his Oscar nomination. Why Christensen didn't also get one is not at all clear to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate the word "overrated" when it's used to describe anything in general (particularly films), but it's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of "Traffic." I've never been very impressed by Steven Soderbergh and this film continues my disappointment. It starts off brilliant - a rough, gritty, European-like art-house epic with filtered colors and beautiful cinematography...but soon it goes downhill. It runs out of steam - fast. The characters and all their many stories start to become dull and plodding; I didn't really find myself caring one way or another about Michael Douglas and his daughter, played by Erika Christensen (who had the honor of acting in the film "Swimf@n" with resident IMDb spammer and self-promoter Monroe Mann, who claims to be "Oscar bound").Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply unimpressive (as always) and I was only really interested in Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro's characters; they were not only the deepest but also most intriguing and well-acted.The plot - or whatever there is of it (it just seems to be a few stories connected by the central theme of illegal drug trafficking) is based on a European mini-series called "Traffik." The miniseries is better.I didn't hate this, but I was disappointed and soon found it testing my patience. Clocking in at around three hours, I felt it tried too hard to be a big, powerful, Oscar-seeking epic and instead should have just focused more on developing a powerful story.</fullReview>

Its Long Running Time is Tolerable because of the Fine Performances Across the Board, but Certainly not from the Annoying Orange and Blue Tint that Draws so much Attention to Itself and being not Only Boring but Artistically Anemic.This Film states the Obvious so Obviously that it is Condescending and Embarrassing at Times, that is when it is not Completely Embarrassing and Illogical. Like, for just One Example, having the Audience Believe that the Only way Ultra-Rich Preppies can Score is in Run Down Rooms with Peep Holes and Naked Black Men.The Movie does not Fail as Entertainment but its Failings are Monumental. Like the Complete Absence of CIA as Drug Traffickers and the rest of the Government (cue: Ollie North) as Complicit Profiteers and Hypocritical Posturers. This is a Reader's Digest Version of an Expensive, Utter Failure of a Policy Perpetuated by Wimp Politicians and Corruption so Vast it is Beyond Belief. It is Condensed and Served for Mass Consumption and Feel Good Enlightenment.Taken on that Level it is Not Bad. But Certainly don't be Hoodwinked into Thinking that this was a Scathing Indictment on its Subject. It Only makes You Think You got a Buzz. It is a Placebo. So if it Works, Fine. Just don't be Fooled by the Label, it's All Packaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven), I had heard about this film mostly from the awards and its featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I thought to take a look. Basically it is set in the modern day, focusing on the world of America's growing war on drugs, seeing the users and addicts, the narcotics trade, and of course those trying to fight against it, using multi-strand storytelling and three main plots connected in subtle ways. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a Supreme Court judge from Ohio, has appointed a new drug tsar for his nation, but his position is made daunting when he discovers his teenage own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is addicted to cocaine (and maybe some other drugs). Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) are DEA agents pursuing Helena Ayala (Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of kingpin husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) who is in jail, as she takes over his business, including of course the involvement of drugs. Javier Rodriguez (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Benicio Del Toro) is a corrupt but dedicated police constable in Mexico who struggles to make the right decisions when he finds out his boss may not be against the drugs market. Also starring Dennis Quaid as Arnie Metzger, Clifton Collins Jr. as Francisco Flores, Miguel Ferrer as Eduardo Ruiz, Topher Grace as Seth Abrahms, Amy Irving as Barbara Wakefield, D.W. Moffett as Jeff Sheridan, Albert Finney as Chief of Staff, James Brolin as General Ralph Landry, The Mask's Peter Riegert as Attorney Michael Adler and Salma Hayek as Rosario. Douglas is good as the father struggling to control her daughter's crack habit, his wife Zeta-Jones is really good as the unknowing and concerned pregnant wife of a gangster, and of course Del Toro gave a calmer and sensitive performance rather than gritty villain like usual. Every once in a while one of the stories blends in to one of the others, only very slightly, it was a little hard to understand each story individually, but I understood some of what was going on, so from what I gathered, it is quite a worthwhile crime drama. It won the Oscars for Best Editing for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, Boring and Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really good, easily one of the best movies from the 2000's. A lot of people don't like it because it was extremely boring, but they're wrong.Yes, okay, it was extremely low in the entertainment department, but the storyline was fantastically dull and that's what makes it good! Why can't these people see that? The movie's lacklustre plot tackles America's increasingly mind-numbing war on the sale of illegal drugs. The film features a number of minimal, snail placed plots that reflect on this lacklustre 'war', featuring such uninteresting characters as a drug dealer's wife and some boring Mexican guy.The film is brought to life by Michael Douglas, who puts in the most boring performance of his career, Catherine Zeta-Jones was equally, if not more boring and Benico Del Toro's performance bored me away.This movie features two hours of increasingly tedious plots and characters and if you can stay awake throughout the whole movie, you deserve my respect, not everyone can act like they're enjoying something that's as tiresome as anything you've ever seen.However, despite the fact that it's unceremoniously boring, this movie isn't quite perfect. One thing that it was obviously lacking was an 'Arnie' type character. he could have been employed by the US government to burst into the drug dealer's apartments and steal all their drugs. Then it could turn out that the government were stealing the drugs so they could sell them and build an army of super human cyborgs and take over the world. Actually, I suppose that might be entertaining, nevermind.So, in conclusion: this movie is extremely boring, and therefore award winning and therefore good. Watch it if you're in need of a nap.</fullReview>
