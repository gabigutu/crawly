		<shortDescription>Gee, everyone is so sensitive to a mob comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the comments below, I guess being a hitman is not much to laugh at...and the term 'black comedy' doesn't come to anyone's mind? Does that extend to the fact that without George Raft going after Jack Lemmon &amp; Tony Curtis in "Some Like It Hot", they would have no reason to meet Marilyn, get on a train to Miami, etc. etc. ??Of course its not funny in real life that people get killed. But this comedy starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry is very well done and had me laughing about it even when it was over. It was so over the top and so overpopulated with killers and gangsters and contract killings that at times its hard to remember what's going on and who is out to kill whom, but it does not matter at all since its all in fun.I do not like either of the leads, generally speaking. I liked about five out of all Bruce Willis' movies and Perry I've seen on his tv show and enjoyed him but never really thought about him much. In this they are both very well cast and when they strike up a friendship, its believable. Willis does not do a 'goombah, fuggetaboutit' attitude or accent, thankfully, even though his character has an Italian surname, and does not mug for the audience at all. Amanda Peet is very funny as a wanna-be hitwoman and a fan of the real killers, and Michael Clarke Duncan is also very funny. Only downside is Rosanna Arquette - bad casting choice here! Maybe someone owed her a favor. Ironically, she is not one of the people who has a contract out on her, though God knows she's annoying enough for one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Screwball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Whole Nine Yards" is surprisingly effective screwball comedy that reminds me of such classics as "Bringing Up Baby" though with way higher amoral body count. At first the actors seem to be each in a parallel movie, with Matthew Perry doing physical slapstick comedy, Bruce Willis deadly serious, Rosanna Arquette just nasty, Amanda Peet being her "Jack and Jill" character (one of my TV guilty pleasures) and Natasha being like a super-model.Then something clicks in and it just gets funny and I couldn't help laughing and laughing.I hope Michael Clarke Duncan gets to keep those fancy suits, because it must be hard to get ones to fit him; with "Green Mile," this performance impressively shows his range.(originally written 3/19/2000)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Comedy from Jonathan Lynn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is a guy who has killed seventeen people necessarily a `bad' guy? Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you? It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two. Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry. Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam. He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland). When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas. It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time. So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy. Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes. But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble. And the only way out, it seems, is down... What Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic. The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about. There's not a lot of depth, but it's not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story. Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end. Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried. Willis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective. Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally. Like Chow Yun-Fat in `The Killer,' Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm's length who he is and what he is capable of, it's a bit disconcerting. And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn.  Perry is excellent, as well, as `Oz.' Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in `It's A Gift' or `The Bank Dick,' although a bit darker. Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect. His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work. And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments. The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez). It may not be the most original movie ever made, but `The Whole Nine Yards' is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do: Entertain. It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles. Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10.   </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lots of laughs, surprises, and spirited performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perry is an unhappy dentist stuck in a dead marriage and burdened with financial problems; as if that isn't bad enough, he learns that his new neighbor is in fact an infamous contract killer with reprehensible mob ties. Against his better judgment, Perry decides to try and rat out the lowlife for his own personal gain, but soon gets in over his head. The film's humor is occasionally too silly for words, but the cast is good and full of enthusiasm?especially Peet?and the script throws out a lot of unexpected twists and turns at just the right moments. Surprising and very funny, with a perfect part for Willis who finds just the right tone for a gangster with heart. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Whole Nine Yards Of Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented The Whole Nine Yards a few days ago, and just watched it this morning, I'm such a huge Bruce Willis fan, I don't see him that often in comedies, so I was curious how this would work. But after viewing this film, I have to just say that this movie was just so funny! I couldn't believe how much it made me laugh, I know it's such a dark subject, but it was pretty cool how they just turned into a zanny comedy. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry were just the most perfect choices, they were like ying and yang. Matthew as this guy who just is scared of everything and finally has something at the end to say where he has control and Bruce couldn't have been a more perfect choice as the cocky and yet charismatic hit man who could be threatening but yet the most likable guy in the world. The story was just very clever and worked so well with the cast.Nick is just your average guy, he is a dentist and a very likable guy, but he gets walked on quite a bit, especially by his wife who he feels like he owes her family, so he won't divorce her. But one day, a new neighbor moves in, Nick notices him pretty much off the bat, it's Jimmy "the tulip" Tudeski, the famous hit man who has killed 17 people and also ratted out his boss. He's on the run from his boss in Chicago and has a ransom on his head. Nick actually likes Jimmy, but his wife, Sophie, says to turn him in and get the award. He goes to Chicago and falls in love with Jimmy's wife, Cynthia. When Nick comes back home to Canada, he learns from Jimmy that his wife has gone to hire a hit man to kill Nick. But Nick also learns that Jimmy wants to kill Cynthia, Jimmy's boss wants to kill Nick, Nick's receptionist is also a hit woman, pretty much everyone wants to kill everyone.That's pretty much the best way to sum up The Whole Nine Yards, but trust me when I say that this is such a fun movie. I really had a good time watching this movie, Bruce Willis was just so great. But I have to admit that Amanda Peet's performance floored me when she was just admiring Bruce's work and getting advice from him on what her first hit should be like. She was just so adorable while being deadly. So please, I would recommend this film, it's a dark comedy, yes, but it's all good, just learn to let go and have fun if you're very sensitive on the subject.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, light entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this one on the dish the other day, eager to see Montreal in a movie actually playing Montreal, as opposed to masquerading as New York or Chicago or some other city. Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.I was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.The movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.Those are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From slaptickey sight gags and pratfalls to more sophisticated humor such as Arquette's negotiation of a hit man's retainer at that moment during sex when he's most likely to be agreeable, this nonstop barrage of humor has something funny for all adults. Whatever this film may be lacking in quality, it makes up for in quantity. It's broad comedic appeal may be it's greatest virtue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS (2000) ** Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollak, Harlan Williams.Matthew Perry is one of my favorite comedic actors in that he's kind of a throwback to the light comedy fare of Jack Lemmon and Tom Hanks: handsome, charming and an utter neurotic mess with a sharp self-deprecating wit with his nonchalant sarcastic jibing that is all play and totally harmless, with a twist of slapstick. Here all of that is on display with a finely tuned tailor made character not unlike his tv alter ego, Chandler Bing (love that name!) from `Friends'.Oz Oseransky is a mild-mannered affable dentist whose life is in flux when his trampy French accented wife Sophie (Arquette in full blown voluptuosness) decides she wants to end their marriage. But not by the usual traditional method of divorce or anulment; instead she takes out a contract on his life Enter newly arrived next-door-neighbor Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis in barely restrained comic form) a hitman keeping it low since there's a contract on him by a really ticked off Russian thug (Pollak oozing Eurotrash unctuousness). But when Oz's wife approaches him he is hard-pressed to do what comes natural since Oz turns out to be the good neighbor he never had and an unlikely ally as things progress in the plotline that eventually involves Jimmy's estranged, va-va-va voom wife Cynthia (Henstridge, best known as the sexy alien in the `Species' sci-fi flicks) who wants a divorce but knows that it's more likely a hit would be necessary.Meanwhile Oz is struck by love at first sight when he meets Mrs. Jimmy and winds up bedding her (in spite of the fact he knows who Jimmy is after some hilarious reaction shots as the story moves on with each new trickle of information on his new `friend'), which only complicates things when Jimmy announces he is going to `whack' her and Janni, the mad Russian.Perry is a marvelous reactionary actor and plays very well off a unique ensemble including the babelicious Peet as Jill, his receptionist- turned - assassin - wannabe , who has a knack for displaying her natural assets to dissuade any potential violent threat and Duncan (recently nominated for a Best Supporting Actor as the gentle giant in `The Green Mile') has a sweet low-key turn as the hulking pal of Willis who provides some funny sight gags (including his first meeting with Perry who literally bounces off this wall of a man).Yet no matter how game the cast is - including off the wall comic Harland Williams as another seedy character who doesn't appear to be who he claims to be - and the fast pace of the storyline, there aren't that many memorable lines of dialogue or full grasp that a lethal killer like Jimmy actually has a heart of gold for the likes of a schnook like Oz.It would be easy to blame the less than compelling story line on screenwriter Mitchell Kapner (who gives an original spin on a plot twist and complex scenario involving dental records and a corpse) or director Jonathan Lynn (`My Cousin Vinny'), but both make the best overall. It just isn't a fresh idea (think of `The In-Laws' which set the high water mark for odd couple/fish-out-of-water hybrid with a criminal element) that seems to hook the attention of a much needed audience. But it is divertingly fun just to see Perry slamming himself silly like a pinball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Friday Night Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here is a rare breed: a mainstream movie that works at just about every level without dumbing anything down or making the average viewer think too hard. "The Whole Nine Yards" is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.Nicholas "Oz" Ozeransky (Matthew Perry) is a mild-mannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him (Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously over-the-top performance) and a huge debt that his partner (his father-in-law) left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor, much to Oz's horror, is none other than Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), the infamous hit-man for the Gogolak gang. Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a "finder's fee." Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy's fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is, and it's great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win."The Whole Nine Yards" is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the "good girl" (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre: the twisty plot. "The Whole Nine Yards" boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that's a good thing."The Whole Nine Yards" may not be classic film material, but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I was only interested in this film because of members of the cast, and I recognised the title, but that's really all I can say for the reasoning. Basically miserable dentist Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Friends' Matthew Perry) meets his new neighbour, and realises it is hit-man Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), and Oz's wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) gets the mob to find Jimmy. Oz is having some people wanting to know what Jimmy is up to and making sure he is staying hidden, including his friend Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan), and he also finds out that Sophie has hired a hit-man to kill him. Alright, I will be honest, I dozed off and lost track of what was happening, but I don't think it matters too much anyway, I found it confusing anyway. Also starring Species' Natasha Henstridge as Cynthia Tudeski, Amanda Peet as Jill St. Claire, Kevin Pollak as Janni Pytor Gogolak and Dumb and Dumber's Harland Williams as Special Agent Steve Hanson. The performances are tame, the story is easy to lose track of and far fetched if you do get it, I just found it a very disappointing black comedy. Pretty poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually very funny and entertaining, with a great cast. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS / (2000) *** (out of four)Matthew Perry plays Oz, a down-on-his-luck suburban dentist whose wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), a spoiled French Canadian, wants him dead. She has already hired a hitman, the secretary at his office, Jill (Amanda Peet), but she got to liking Oz and ended up permanently working for him. Bruce Willis is one of the nations most nitrous professional hitmen, named Jimmy. He moves in next door to Oz, conspires with Oz's spouse, and that leaves Oz in Chicago to find Jimmy's arch enemy, Ganni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), and his estranged but beautiful wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) over legal issues.Other important characters include Frankie Figgs (Michael Clarke Duncan), a huge, bear-like individual who takes Oz to meet Janni. There is also "Rocketman" star Harland Williams as a local undercover cop who becomes involved with the devious doings of Sophie. What do all of these characters want? Jimmy, Cynthia, and Janni are after a ten million dollar prize on each other's heads; Jill wants to become a professional hitman; Frankie wants to kill people and please his leaders, and Oz just wants out of the entire mess. "The Whole Nine Yards" has an engrossingly entertaining setup, even without thorough character introduction. This kind of movie does not need character development as long as we can enjoy the premise. The comical atmosphere makes up for the few holes in the writing; the story moves along smoothly. Although we have seen this kind of material before in "Grosse Point Blank" and "Analyze This," never has it been this imaginatively zany and hilariously inventive.  What makes this movie so effective is the array of perfectly cast characters. Matthew Perry is hilarious in a reactive, clumsy role that clearly fits his personality. Rosanna Arquette is also flawless in an annoying, biting character. Bruce Willis is stunningly suave in a portrayal that, for the first time in a long while, creates a calm, cool, and collected character. Amanda Peet ("Whipped") and Natasha Richardson ("Species") are both immensely beautiful; all they really need to do present themselves on screen for audiences to enjoy their presence. The labyrinthine plot in "The Whole Nine Yards" becomes more complicated than many viewers might expect. Bruce Willis eventually becomes more of an underlying tone in the film to propel the story along, and a lot of active material is discarded rather than performed. There is a cute little romantic subplot, also, but it does not feel like much in a plot where so much transpires, and the important story nuggets are scattered all over the board. Because of this, the third act suffers from a mild case of the hiccups when the initial conflict is completely resolved, only for the writers to build for yet another climax. This is an unusual structure...but this is an unusual movie.  "The Whole Nine Yards" is not a terrific movie, but it is a funny and amusing one. Compare this comedy caper to other so-called parodies released within the past year and you will see why it is such an achievement when a comedy comes around that actually fits the definition of a comedy.</fullReview>

I don't know what the competition was that year, but it must have been something out of this world for this movie to be so overlooked.This is a comedy to set the acting standard for, not only, Best ACTING IN A COMEDY category, but for drama category as well.Fabulous acting AND directing, since it is hard to get such fabulous performances without a terrific director.Matthew Perry's timing and style is ever so right for his character, I cant imagine it being played by any other actor. Each of the others, principle and supporting actors, were outstanding as well.I still cant believe that this movie didn't get nominated in more than two categories.I watch this movie even now (2006), the acting is so dead on. The story line is very funny, very entertaining, and such a nice diversion from serious reality. Perhaps the awards committees don't take incredible story line movies seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I have with this movie, which is the only reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10, is that it's only funny once. The jokes are hysterical the first time, but each time you watch it again, they become predicted and give at most an internal chuckle. Matthew Perry does a fantastic job as a character absolutely out of his mind with fear trying to get out of the situation that he has landed himself in. Bruce Willis plays the part of an ex-mafia hit-man decent enough. I don't exactly believe he would be interested in tomatoes, but that doesn't make the punchline of that scenario any less funny. The writing of the story line is fluid and cohesive, making an enjoyable one-time viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As the title indicates, this palpable comedy is a funny-bone short of a first down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Whole Nine Yards' just doesn't go the distance. Short of a first down, it never gets close to scoring a touchdown. In fact, it barely has enough kick for a field goal. Cracking a smile here and there, it's one of those run-of-the mill comedies you forget the minute the clock runs out.The lead performances are efficient but smack of déj? vu. By now Bruce Willis has a patent on the cool, smirking, know-it-all tough guy and he barely lifts a finger here to do anything effortful. You know his game. And though he has top billing as an infamous contract killer on the lam, he pretty much passes the ball to Matthew Perry, in typical sheepish form, as an innocent dentist by trade who, goaded by a greedy, acrimonious wife, gets caught up in new neighbor Willis' murder-for-hire imbroglio. Granted, we've seen THIS Perry many times on TV (his comedy bag of tricks is littered with little 'Chandler'-isms), but he is still an undeniably talented and appealing actor. Somehow Perry manages to hustle on the field a bit, pulling off some great (if not always fresh) physical schtick and reaction shots along the way. He is the comedy quarterback in this film.But while Perry and (to a lesser extent) Willis front the team decently enough, the featured cast comes off more like bench-warmers than players -- supportive but ineffectual. A tightly-coiled Kevin Pollak as Willis' `brutal' nemesis carefully toys with his eyebrow to establish his character's menace and that's about the extent of it. The usually interesting and offbeat Rosanna Arquette is jarringly ineffective and annoying as all get out as Perry's nasty, ungrateful Gallic spouse anticipating the joys of widowhood. Her talent for comedy is suspect here and highly questionable too is her attempt at a foreign accent (ditto Pollak). Michael Clarke Duncan, who was so poignant in `The Green Mile,' has yet to find an equally rewarding part, finding himself typed yet again as a looming behemoth. Though his henchman gets to play both sides of the war zone, his role is pittance and adds little to stir up the proceedings. Natasha Henstridge starts off promisingly as a femme fatale type, but her character quickly turns to jelly and peters out by film's end. Amanda Peet's idea of comedy is to use a lot of overt facial gestures, mugging shamelessly throughout. Memorable more for her gratuitous topless scenes, at least she and Henstridge fill the bill as fetching eye candy.Director Jonathan Lynn's comedy record has been rather mediocre thus far -- some hits (`My Cousin Vinny'), some misses (`Sgt. Bilko'), mostly errors (`Clue'). Add this to the list of errors. The gags tend to strain for laughs, the set-ups are frequently pat, predictable and calculated, and the situation covers old ground (1979's `The In-Laws' starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin). After a somewhat diverting first half, the story dries up, running out of clever maneuvers. I'd say a passable time-filler at most.However, if you are a Matthew Perry fan, get out the popcorn, the beer and the pennant because he IS the entire game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather original and not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad, not bad at all. I found the movie to be quite original for its genre. The plot is based on an original an innately funny idea, which gives the movie much support. The acting was, of course, not the best but there was no need for it to be good; no one was trying to make this story believable. The movie never drags on and is quite entertaining with a few nice laughs. Also, there are no annoyingly repetitive jokes. However, the movie is very predictable and reeks of "happy ending for (almost) all" from the very beginning.I would say this movie is worth watching if one simply wants a light comedy with a happy ending. This is one of those movies made for its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly well done feel good situation comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this escapist romantic crime comedy sounds like a TV situation comedy, but the film far exceeds expectations.Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Mathew Perry) is a dentist in Canada trapped in a horrible marriage. Although Oz is an honest and upright individual, he shared a practice with his father-in-law, who was convicted of embezzlement before the film begins, leaving Oz saddled with debt and living with his unloving rapacious wife and mother-in-law.Oz was originally from Chicago. He gets a new next door neighbor, Jimmy Jones (Bruce Willis). The dentist recognizes the neighbor is really Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a hit man who ratted on a Chicago mobster, whose gang wants to kill him. The dentist's unloving wife, Sophie (deliciously played by Rosanna Arquette), is secretly trying to have her husband killed for his life insurance.Jill St. Claire (beautiful and talented Amanda Peete in a great major supporting role) is the dentists vivacious assistant, who turns out to be a Jimmy "The Tulip" groupie. She also pleasantly displays her other talents in a nude scene.A comic "tangled web" is woven as Sophie tries to cash in on the vendetta and Oz tries very credibly to prevent anyone from being killed.Both lead actors, Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, have played similar parts in the past. Willis continues to perform at his standard serio-comic excellence, and the rest of the cast play their parts a little tongue in cheek. But Perry appropriately plays the Oz character straight and believable, somewhat like the straight man in a comic duo.The various twists in the plot are fun and the ending is very satisfying. I rated it only 8 because, while I saw no flaws, I felt it should be a couple of points lower than such comedies as "Pulp Fiction" and "Bullets Over Broadway."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out great, and then turns excellent. Set in Canada, a young dentist and his wife get the awakening of their life when a former mobster moves in next to them, Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski. So the dentist (Perry), with advice from his wife, goes to Chicago to tell the mafia where Jimmy (Willis) is staying.When he returns to Canada, he is confronted by Tudeski, and finds out his wife has left him. With Perry and Willis also star Michael Clarke Duncan in a much better role than "The Green Mile (1999)" and Kevin Pollak from "Grumpy Old Men (1993)" fame.In the film, Pollak plays the guy who wants to kill Willis' character, with the help of Perry's character of course. In the end, most of them wind up dead, somehow or another. But it is really a funny movie, and should be most enjoyed with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Perry hasn't been a leading actor to bank a good movie on. That's why The Whole Nine Yards was a great surprise, since Perry fits well into his role, and the movie isn't yet another Friends-style copy either. The plot gets quite twisty, but through it all it is propelled by the well-defined characters' motivations. The stage is set justifiably for the actors that make the best work in the movie, Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet and Michael Clarke Duncan besides Perry. It is a comedy, yes, but very subtle, and keeping with the realistic even when the characters, or Perry's Oseransky, mostly, find themselves in absurd situations, and the plot keeps turning until the end, when it reaches a classic 50's-like tone. Also, the film's beautiful women, Hensridge and Peet, simply deserve praise, their allure is irresistible. This is all around a very good movie where all the elements have been brought together much better than the setup suggested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruse Willis as the hit man "Jimmy Tulips" and Matthew Perry as the hapless dentist "Oz" are funny in this movie. I was charmed by the dental assistant Jill, played by Amanda Peet and Jimmy's wife Sophie, played by Rosanna Arquette. Michael Clarke Duncan's character, "Frankie Figs" was powerful. This is an entertaining movie with some funny skits, but it isn't really for all audiences, primarily because most of the characters in the movie are "hit men" and trying to kill each other. The fact that a policeman actually was killed during the m?lée of hit men killing each other is something that I wish had not been in the story - but to be fair, I've watched the movie twice and the first time I watched it (probably in 2000), I didn't think anything about the policeman being killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is an action star unlike any other, ever since Die Hard hit theaters back in 1988. He is deserving of all the fame, even if a movie has a horrible script he would make the movie worth watching. This movie is successful for more reasons than just Bruce. Matthew Perry also does a great job, in his first big role. Perry got his fame from the t.v show friends playing Chandler. I enjoyed the show and watched it every Thursday, so it great to see him playing a similar character.Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a mob hit-man-turned-informant, ratted on the mob and put his life in jeopardy. Oz is a Montréal dentist, paying off debts so he can divorce his wife: the dislike is mutual. Well, there goes the neighborhood - in a pine box. When hit man Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski moves into a comfy suburb, everyone's suddenly in danger of pushing up daisies. And it's not all Jimmy's doing, either. Jonathan Lynn directs this manic comedy about life, love and plenty of ammo.A great and fun movie that keeps you entertained to the end. If you like Capper films like Oceans Eleven and The Italion Job, this is a good choice. Enjoy! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were several points in this movie that could have been better --mostly dialog. Cynthia's and Janni's dialog in their opening scene, for example. And Amanda Peete is not the most accomplished actress. However, Amanda had some excellent moments, and I loved her enthusiasm. Michael Clarke Duncan was terrific. And this was one of Bruce Willis's better movies. Many have complained about Rosanna Arquette -- her performance was a bit over-the-top, but in the main I enjoyed it, especially in the police station. And Matthew Perry was very good too. And the running jokes about his marriage and his beeper were funny. I wasn't happy with the plot twist that made it imperative for Jimmy to kill Cynthia rather than divorce her -- quite illogical. However, what gave this movie an 8 is Natasha Henstridge -- flat-out one of the most gorgeous women on film. I've seen her in other projects and have been impressed, but in this movie I felt like Oz -- dumbstruck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards is pure movie candy. It's fun to watch, but by the end, you don't get much out of it. It's a funny movie starring Matthew Perry of Friends fame as a nervous nelly of a dentist, Oz Oseransky, living in Montreal suburb to a wife who really has no use for him (Rosanna Arquette), so little use that she tries to have him killed. The Oseransky's lives are changed when the house next door to them is bought by a mobster from the US, Jimmy The Tulip as he was known, played by Bruce Willis. The contrast between the hyperactive Oz and the cold, over the top Jimmy the Tulip is where this film is funniest. There are certain plot moments that sustains the movie, something to do with Jimmy's former wife Cynthia (the always fantastic looking Natasha Henstridge) who falls in love with Oz, and a humorously strange relationship that develops between Jimmy and Oz's dental hygienist Jill (Amanda Peet) who has an unusual interest in the world of mafia hit men. Michael Clark Duncan plays Jimmy's bodyguard, and the physical contrast between him and Matthew Perry makes for some of the funniest scenes in this light farce. Nothing in this movie is too heavy, it's very funny in some places. The Whole Nine Yards is not a bad way to spend a whole afternoon.</fullReview>

The actors are wonderful. Even the music in this movie is great. Matthew Perry is incredible at physical comedy. There are traces of his Chandler character in this one, but it makes you love him even more. You will fall in love with Natasha Henstridge.

		<shortDescription>Another anti-Die Hard role for Bruce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1988, Bruce Willis, star of TV's "Moonlighting", scored a box office smash with the hit action film "Die Hard". Thanks to the success of "Die Hard" and it's sequels, Bruce became type cast as John McClane, the foul mouthed, underdog every guy cop who always comes out on top if just barely. Pretty much everything Bruce has done since then has been about being the anti-Die Hard character, or making fun of his image as an action hero.And so it is here. Bruce plays a mellow/laid back/easy going retired hit man living next door to a flighty dentist in an unhappy marriage, played by Matthew Perry. Perry falls for Bruce's ex-wife, and Bruce's friend Amanda Peet, an aspiring contract killer herself, falls for Bruce. After a while it boils down to trying to find a way to reason with Bruce to not kill his ex-wife for money.It's not brilliant cinema making at work, but it's funny because the cast knows it's all ridiculous and Bruce himself is funny as this laid back every-guy who just happens to be a retired hit man. The sequel, sadly, turned Bruce into a whiny neurotic, which just isn't any fun.</fullReview>

Also, I was really stuck by how BAD Natasha Henstridge is in this. No sparks as Perry's romantic interest and, actually, not much emotion period. She should stick to Species type roles. Amanda Peet seems to be contractually bound to bare herself in every film she makes and I for one am grateful for that but it doesn't save this turkey. (3 of 10)</fullReview>

And during the movie i thought, that dentist-guy is totally overacting and kinda stupid. Well, years later i started watching Friends once in a while and i got used to "Chandler" ;)Then for no reason i watched this one again and well, i liked it this time. Opinions can change sometimes ;) I definetly recommend this one to comedy/crime fans. It´s worth watching at least twice!People are right who keeps saying Perry played Chandler but will he really never play another roles? I don´t think so and i hope not. Well think of Robin Williams? He started his career in a sitcom (?) named Mork from Ork, and did a lot of comedies. But he also played (and won the Oscar then!) serious roles. So, never say never.In this film the two Willis/Perry had a great chemistry; no wonder they became friends after this. I´m really looking forward the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to enjoy this movie, you have to take a very light view of rampant double-cross and senseless murder. Yet it has a number of funny bits, mostly thanks to Matthew Perry and director Jonathan Lynn. Perry plays a baffled dentist innocently caught up with rival mobs and competing hit men. Bruce Willis, one of the latter, is OK just doing his usual stolid tough-guy shtick. Perry is adept at pratfalls and amusing terror. It's actually his movie. His and the director's. Lynn does some very clever and funny things, and he knows it's not necessary to put wit in screaming headlines. He gives us Perry's night of passion (with Willis' wife) as only an opening kiss and ? the next morning ? a scene of overturned lamps and a picture askew on the wall. The script (Mitchell Kapner), however, is childish. When the bodies of two murdered gangsters are to be burned in a gasoline-soaked car, the inevitable reference is made to `dental records.' Well, Perry's a dentist. His effort to pull the teeth of a dead man and plug in substitutes is a total failure as entertainment. Near the end, a guy we've come to like is shot and killed for no plot reason whatever. It not only isn't necessary, it's a sickening jolt. The audience deserves better ? here and through 90% of the movie. 3 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

The affair with the mobster's wife sub plot made no sense, and neither did any other character, for that matter. The film really goes down in flames in the last half hour when the mobsters and Matthew Perry's dental assistant (don't ask) go on a killing spree.Skip this garbage and find another film worth your while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you think Matthew Perry falling over is comic genius? Do you convulse with laughter when you see someone have a nervous twitch? If you said yes to both those questions then The Whole Nine Yards is the movie for you! Unfortunately the film is not the smart, intriguing comedy that the previews set it up as. The film does have two high points, namely Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan who do a commendable job portraying contract-killers. Unfortunately the rest of the cast does not bring the same charisma to the movie and Matthew Perry in particular is extremely disappointing in the lead role. The Whole Nine Yards tries to be too many things: comedy, mystery, romance and action. Instead of being a quality film in one of those genres it tries to hard to combine the four and winds up faltering. If you went into this movie and didn't know what it was about, there's a good chance you could enjoy parts of it, but if you expect an intelligent comedy you will be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed at the glowing endorsements this film has garnered here on the IMDB. It is, quite simply, not a good movie. The characters are extremely thin, though some of them manage to impress (like the dental assistant). The script is a disaster. I'd lay odds that if you read the script, you'd find very few jokes. It's as if the writer was just writing down whatever came to mind and thought "When Matthew Perry says it, it'll be funny." Friends is not the best sitcom on TV, but it has much better writing than this movie.None of the acting was impressive at all. Bruce Willis was nicely understated, but he can't be said to have accomplished much, because he had so little to work with. The plot was contrived, the romance angle was laughable!! Not funny, but pathetic. The couples meet, have sex, fall in love, and get married in the space of, what, couple days at the most. Extremely poor, in my opinion.It's a cute little movie to watch on video with your girlfriend on a rainy night. But do not shell out hard money for this dreck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Whole nine yards is a fantastic comedy that goes the whole nine yards. I thought that was a good joke too. It's a clever comedy from director Jonathan Lynn(Who did the fantastic comedy My Cousin Vinney). I didn't quite think this was as good as My Cousin Vinney, but it was still a genius comedy. Bruce Willis is actually very funny as a mobster. But, as we've seen in previous films, Bruce Willis can do anything. The Whole nine yards has tons of fantastic performances by Matthew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan, and an actress who I will never forget. Amanda Peet. Amanda Peet is a great actress and is really funny in tons of her films. I liked The Whole nine yards because it's one of those comedies that you may not see that much of. Something different that just blows your mind. It blew mine. The best performances in the film are from Bruce Willis and Amanda Peet. Though I forgot about Rosanna Arquette, who plays Oz's(Matthew Perry) wife. Who has a French Canadian accent going on. The Whole nine yards is a hilarious and genius film that I will never forget.The Plot: Oz is a dentist living in Suberbia living with his wife who he hates. One day, he realizes that a mobster named Jimmy The Tulip has arrived next door and is moving in. It turns out that a lot of people want him dead. So his wife forces him to go down to Chicago to find the people that want him dead, this way she can give him a divorce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There ARE a few laughs here and there, and Matt Perry TRIES to squeeze some comedic juice out of this, but it's hard going.The characters are all either too cool, along the lines of the characters in another terrible film "Get Shorty", or they are over the top phony, as in the police inspectors in this movie. Those two guys act like they are in an amateur youtube movie.Willis falls into the former category. He is so cool in this film I think he is 1/2 asleep. If you could phone in a physical performance, he'd have done so. You could have propped him on on a stool, the same stool, and just moved the backgrounds around. In fact, they may have done that.It's nice seeing Henstridge in here, but her efforts are wasted as well. I will agree with other posters that Arquette and her lousy accent are just irritating. But for me, the worst offender, by far, is Amanda Peet, in her wannabe hit girl character.I have seen her in other films and she didn't strike me this way. But in this film, her mugging, her posturing and her yapping is so distracting I really, really hoped that she would get shot in this film. (It wouldn't be surprising, this is the kind of film where characters are always aiming a gun at someone and then at the last moment turning to shoot someone else--an overused trick in bad cinema that needs to stop).I haven't seen someone show so much teeth since Denise Richards' bizarre non-stop smilefest in "Starship Troopers". "Ha ha ha, I love how you shot that guy, and killing the other guy was pure art!" Ha ha ha, more teeth and more goofy posturing.Pollock is totally wasted. Here's a guy who can do practically anything and is reduced to babbling and, I think, confusing Ws with Vs or something--nevermind, not important and I couldn't really get it anyway.If you like black comedy mob pictures that aren't funny, don't have engaging characters, action limited to shooting a few characters at close range, the lead character trying to bring in a little slapstick, and a bizarre "happy ending", here's the film for you. For the rest of us, try "Married to the Mob" or "Wise Guys".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair movie but why on earth is there a sequel to this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards is a silly little comedy that is too morbid and just goes too far even for a Bruce Willis movie. In this movie Bruce Willis plays a hitman named Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski. He is in Canada on the witness relocation program. His wife and others notice that he is a familiar face as he was once in jail. His neighbor is Nicholas Ozeransky who is just nervous about the whole situation.This movie is just too unbelievable. The humor is very dark there really is no point to the movie and overall just can't decide what kind of comedy it wants to be. Willis is also just a bad comedian. He has no timing and he belongs in action films where he really doesn't have to have any kind of timing and he can just look tough for two hours and rake in the bucks. Kevin Pollak is good in a supporting part and I hate to admit it but Matthew Perry actually does a good job. Michael Clarke Duncan is pretty decent as well but the problem with this movie is that it is so uneven. It sometimes has slapstick comedy, sometimes very dark humor sometimes it relies on Bruce Willis to be funny and that shows a movie being very desperate. With that said this is a fair movie to watch a good movie to waste an hour and a half on. SPOILER the only problem is the black guy dies yet again. Sad isn't it? I recently got word they are making a sequel to this, why? The first movie didn't do that well and was badly reviewed. Why they would make a sequel to such a silly and forgettable film I do not know. But hey that's Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is film-making by numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a supreme example of the lazy, unimaginative film-making that has given Hollywood a bad name over the last twenty years. Matthew Perry (he of Friends fame) is Oz, a dentist with a horrible wife (Rosanna Arquette, with a 'comedy' French accent). His world is turned upside down when Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a famous hitman, moves in next door. You see what I mean? It's creaky already. Throw in some tedious plot about gangsters killing each other and the truly unlikely idea of Natasha Henstridge falling for Perry and what emerges is an over-long sub-Sopranos crime comedy-thriller with no thrills and no discernible jokes.The problem is with Perry, really. He is rightly praised for his role in Friends, where he is both charming and genuinely funny. Unfortunately, this film uses all the least funny and least charming aspects of Chandler, namely, his slapstick shtick and gormless loser routines. As a stinging wit, he is very good - here, he is forced to play the straight man to Willis's grinning hitman and it just doesn't work. This is isn't just a bad film, but an unforgivable waste of talent and promise as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I intially came to post here I was overwhelmed by the number of glowing reviews this film recieved. Did I miss something? Is there truly some comedic magic which I failed to recognize in this picture? To make a fair determination let me first count the factors I am sure that I did observe and weigh these in the balance before passing final judgement. First off I'll list the detracting qualities: Contrived slapstick(Perry's manic energy in most places just doesn't feel real), cartoonish TV sitcom acting job from the protagonist,the worst attempt at a foreign accent on screen since "Robin Hood"(Arquette), and finally to be kind I'll omit several more and leave this as the final negative- the most unlikely romantic pairing seen since "Heavy"(Perry and Henstridge). Now I'll weigh these against the positives: um, well I honestly can't come up with any. So the verdict is in, quality still doesn't have one bit to do with the success of movies in the United States.

		<fullReview>Time is 2000. Bruce Willis fresh off 'the Fifth Element'. An on-form Matthew Perry fresh off 'Friends'. This is a crime-comedy with all the goods from either world, and it's done *just right*. The plot is good, and the film's got that typical contorted type story at the middle of it linking many different characters, but still absolutely coherent and compelling. Perry really is very funny in this one, and it's about to be one crazy ride for this prude of a dentist when an ex- big time conman is his neighbor and he finds out who he is and somehow finds himself involved. This is a crazy ride, with lots of great fun and action, good laughs, a good atmosphere between tight tension and comedy relief, the supporting cast is great, and the plots within the plots are strong enough to make this a fairly layered piece of genre-hybrid cinema. Just all in all, an excellent comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny and entertaining mob-comedy.Montreal, Canada. A down-on-his luck dentist, "Oz" Oseransky (played by Matthew Perry), discovers that his new neighbour is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, former mob contract killer turned Police informant. The mob has put on price on the head of Tudeski (Bruce Willis). Egged on my his loathsome wife Oz sets off to Chicago to let the mob know where Tudeski is and, with a bit of luck, claim part of the reward...A movie which makes full use of Matthew Perry's prodigious comedic talents, especially for physical comedy. While Bruce Willis is solid in his role, Perry makes the movie. Very funny, and very Chandleresque. Plot is decent too, though is really just a vehicle for the comedy. Can be silly at times though, but generally doesn't get too out of hand or wander too far from the main focus. Good support from Amanda Peet (especially), Natasha Henstridge, Michael Clarke Duncan and Kevin Pollak. Roseanna Arquette is very irritating as Oz's wife, but maybe that was the idea...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Goes So Much As 1 Yard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards (2000): Dir: Jonathan Lynn / Cast: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet: Caper comedy about the trouble we sometimes find ourselves in and the emotional endurance to figure out a solution. Matthew Perry plays a dentist who hates his marriage. Bruce Willis plays a criminal who moves in next door and refuses the witness protection program. Perry is blackmailed by his wife to expose him and reap profit. Clever concept littered with clichés. The ending uplifts criminals with humour evolving around murder. Director Jonathan Lynn previously made Sgt. Bilko but here his directing is more conventional. Willis plays Jimmy the Tulip as the ominous new neighbour who is way ahead in the con game. Perry as the depressed dentist is miserable until he becomes stranded within danger and lust. Michael Clarke Duncan plays Willis's right hand man who at first is seen as an enemy. The handling of the character in the conclusion is too conventional. Natasha Henstridge is less than effective as Willis's ex-wife. Her romance with Perry is more predictable formula than anything. Amanda Peet steals every scene she is in as Perry's dental assistant who desires to meet Jimmy. Theme regards the curious lifestyles of those living around us. It never goes the whole nine yards but the ground it does cover is a hoot at best. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

His wife convinces him to go to Chicago and inform the mob boss who wants Jimmy dead.Bruce Willis as a hit-man? Yeah, it seems plausible given his tough guy roles. Matthew Perry as a luckless loser? Yep, makes even more sense (he definitely appeared in a series of odd romances). Together, they make a pretty good combination.While much of this is fairly predictable, it should be. This is not a deep, philosophical film about killing, but a light-hearted jaunt about contract murder and falsifying dental records. Should that be fun? Maybe not, but it is.</fullReview>

His new assistant Jill St. Claire (Amanda Peet) tells him to divorce her. Then notorious mob hit-man Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door. He immediately recognizes Jimmy is in danger of a contract kill from Chicago mob boss Janni Pytor Gogolak (Kevin Pollak). Sophie pushes Oz to cash in on the contract and he goes back to Chicago to appease her but not intending to contact Janni. She immediately tells Jimmy to double cross Oz. Oz is confronted by hit-man 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan) who brings him to Janni. Oz falls for femme fatale Cynthia Tudeski (Natasha Henstridge). She tells him that Janni's father Lazlo hid $10M with her before being sent to prison. It can only be accessed with three signatures from her, Janni, and Jimmy. Or else it can be accessed with their death certificates. Janni sends Frankie with Oz back to Montreal to track down and kill Jimmy. Only there are even more double crosses.My biggest problem with this is director Jonathan Lynn. He doesn't show enough comedic skills in this. There are some good potential but it looks like a second rate movie. This should be so much funnier. It's simply not well filmed. There is also the $10M jackpot. It's way too convoluted and simply a device to give the characters a reason to do what they do. It's backwards writing. Mostly, it's awkward.The good part is all the good actors around. Most of them are doing their best. Natasha Henstridge is a little stiff. Kevin Pollak isn't as funny as he needs to be. Matthew Perry is working hard and has good chemistry with Bruce Willis. The boys are good with Amanda Peet. Perry has less chemistry with Natasha Henstridge. There are a few laughs. I just wish it has a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quaint black comedy about a dentist and a hit man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the term 'Black Comedy' best describes this film because it does not necessarily fall into the category of art-house, nor do I believe that it falls into the category of independent, though I would certainly not consider it your typical Hollywood film (an though it is set in Canada I believe it is basically an American films). The story is about a dentist named Oz who is married to a wife that makes one wonder if he is being punished for a crime that he committed in another life and is stuck paying off her father's debt that he inherited after her father committed suicide.Then a former hit-man who ratted out a Chicago mob boss moves in next door and she sees a double opportunity. First she could rat him out to the Chicago mob and collect on a finder's fee, and secondly (if that doesn't work out) she can hire him to kill Oz so she can collect on his life insurance. The problem is that she has already been trying to do this, and the last assassin she hired ended up liking Oz and could not bring herself around to killing him. As for Oz, while he is in Chicago he ends up meeting the hit-man's wife and falling in love with her, only to discover that the hit-man does not believe in divorce.This is a great movie that will have you in absolute stitches the first time you see it (and maybe the second time as well) however the problem is that it relies too much upon the many twists and turns and in the end, once you know what is going to happen, it ceases to be all that wonderful anymore. Unfortunately this film simply does not have the staying power that some of the other black comedies that I own have, and in fact it seems to have pretty much fallen to the wayside. In a way it is not like Pulp Fiction or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, that have a cult following, but rather one of those films that you can say, oh, I remember that, and then move on to something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Funny Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards is a much better comedy than I anticipated and one that produces enough jokes to produce stitches in your stomach. This is also an effective crime film and mixed with the comedy, it makes for a pleasing film for adults to enjoy. What I find funny here is how this film seems to have everyone as a victim of being whacked. Not only does this have pretty funny one-liners, there is an ample amount of physical comedy such as when Matt Perry keeps on running into doors or Michael Clarke Duncan himself.Jonathan Lynn's film is about a dentist named Oz who lives unhappily with his wife. When a contracted killer moves in next door, Oz's wife wants to hire Jimmy to kill him, but he refuses. Oz, meanwhile, is in Chicago so he will be able to rat out Jimmy to his former boss setting the stage for some rather hilarious consequences.The acting is very good. Bruce Willis doesn't usually do comedies, but when he does it's gold. Willis has enough wit and charm to lead a comedy and like he proved in his Die Hard films, he does know how to be funny when time is called for. On the other side of the spectrum, Matthew Perry known for his role in Friends, does what he did well in that show and that is to be funny. Despite him being funny, he would probably do what anyone would do if a hit man moved in next door. Also, Amanda Peet delivers a career-performance as Jill who just cracks me up in nearly every scene.Overall, this is a hilarious film that has a unusual mix of comedy, mafia, and action. For every bullet, there is enough comedy to last a fortnight. I heard good things about this film, but I didn't know this film would be this funny. A pairing of Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry is worth the while. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis is so funny, not in this movie, but just in general. Matthew Perry holds his own and is in no way disappointing. Kevin Pollack is comical and dialed in. Natasha Henstridge is worth all the risk. I cannot get enough of Roseanna Arquette's character. Amanda Peet hands down gives the best performance, she really has nice tits. Michael Clarke Duncan provides a strong supporting presence. Harland Williams is well-cast and adds his bit of funny to the movie. The Whole Nine Yards is silly and entertaining the whole way through.

		<fullReview>Well, this is one of those hard movies to rate. Even thought we have an innovative direction with an ironic and original story, sometimes we have bad conversations, allied with bad performances and an implausible plot. Matthew Perry acts in this movie exactly like he does in "Friends", which shows he's not able to perform much differently than that. Bruce Willis does his job professionally, but the absurd plot ruins his character. You know, EVERYBODY in this movie seems to be a potential killer, and they talk about that very calmly. People who want to kill others usually aren't that peaceful. My other complaint is that we have too few funny scenes; after 40 minutes of length we don't know if this is a comedy or just a random and pointless film. I must confess I turned it off before completing the first hour, due to the great tedious it lured me into. It's not my fault as a viewer that it is simply boring and nothing ever happens; maybe with a more plausible story this would've worked better. Bad movie anyways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very confused by Bruce Willis in this movie. I was kind of expecting him to play a lunatic serial killer, like in The Jackal, since he was an assassin again, but he was very tame this time around. The movie's general theme is comedy after all, Matthew Perry's strong point, but definitely not Willis's. Willis is most at home in an action-drama role. However, Amanda Peet was clearly the film's strongest contender. She really brightens up the mood whenever she's on screen. Although, I half expected Willis to just to get bored and discard her like he would have in The Jackal, he is a hit-man after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing to know about this film is it is a MOB Comedy which means if you are looking for something on a Disney Level, this is not the place. That said, this is a great film, and everybody except Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry) 'Oz' is a very naive Montreal Dentist, is not what they seem to be. Spoilers 'Oz' is unaware that is evil wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), is trying to kill him, and even hires a hit woman in training Jill St Clair (Amanda Peet), to do so. Jill is a great character (My personal favorite), she would have killed him, except his next door neighbor is mob hit-man Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), and she wants to become his prodigy, and thus takes 'Oz' side, and lets him know what is happening. After he finds out the truth about Sophie "Oz" falls in love with Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and it goes without saying that he is playing a dangerous game there (Falling for the wife of a mob hit man). He is also targeted by another gangster, Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan (Who died far too young)), and his associates. The entire film is about 'Oz' trying to survive various attempts on his life, and basically oblivious about the dangerous game he is playing, and the sort of characters he is dealing with. But its his decency that gets him through (Except when he frames Sophie for murder (She had it coming)). At the end of the film, there is a scene where Cynthia learns all 'Oz' really wants is to marry her, he does not care about money or anything else. As he said: "I want to marry you more than anyone wanted to marry anyone in history." In addition, Jimmy ends up falling in love with Cynthia and they will end up becoming married as well. What makes it work is this is a film with characters you like (And hate), beautiful women, a different setting than usual (Montreal), lots of laughs, lots of action, lots of twists and turns, and an intelligent script. For fans of mob films, Willis, Perry, and especially Peet (Who steals the film) it should be a must see.</fullReview>

The plot is imaginative with a lot of surprises and funny moments. Another good point is having Montréal as location because it's a refreshing change and as french is spoken there, the cast tries it as well.

So even as hilarity is erupting you still are conscious of a sense of menace that makes the goofiness somehow even goofier.Roseanna Arquette also deserves kudos as Perry's wife. She does a an excellent job of portraying someone you really do not like and really would not want to be married to.I originally saw this in the theater at full price and felt I got my money's worth. So pretty confident if you rent this you will be reasonably happy with your investment.</fullReview>

Henstridge is pretty but cold as Willis's wife while Peet is sexy and funny as an aspiring hit woman. Sporting a European accent, Arquette is amusing as Perry's nagging wife.

Yes, she is a beautiful girl, but the channel I watched the movie on didn't show the completely nude scenes, anyway, so all I can judge is the character she played and not my own fantasies.The giddiness when meeting Tudeski for the first time, the arched eyebrows when asking Cynthia "you do?" when Cynthia says she loves Oz, the flip of her wrist when she summons the bank man back into his cubicle, the leg lock around Tudeski at the dock...how could anyone not like this girl? She seems so real and so happy with herself. I fell for the character she created, but I couldn't win in a fight with Tudeski for her affections.Great job, Ms. Peet. You nailed the magic on that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that really plays to the strengths of all the performers involved.We all know that Bruce Willis can play this sort of role with his eyes closed. Although he's killed 14 people we still like Jimmy and that is because only Willis can bring that little twinkle in the eye that makes us like Jimmy throughout the film.Matthew Perry can play a bumbling sarcastic role perfectly so there isn't anything in this film that troubles him. He gets laughs easily just by walking into things and with the raise of an eyebrow.Amanda Peet and Natasha Henstridge have both made careers out of playing the seductress or the honey trap and so are really just playing to type in this film.Overall apart from a clever twist on an old format all the cast are playing to their strengths and thankfully when they come together it makes for a fairly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sharp Entertaining Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is difficult to determine is whether it's Matthew Perry, from FRIENDS (1994-2004) or Mitchell Kapner, the writer of the movie that makes the comedy mesh so well, from the physical gags that seem to be pretty lame but are artfully presented on screen so that they are fresh and really funny. This is a predictable comedy, mystery, crime thriller that still is able to shake and twist its premise into something interesting and sufficiently new that it makes the movie entertaining, hilarious, and decently above the average comedy movie. Natasha Henstridge from SPECIES (1995) has the elegance and style to carry off her serious character while the rest of the supporting cast along with Bruce Willis add that sure and charismatic charm of a solid romantic comedy. While this movie doesn't shake the roof off, present a classic, new bold award-winning combination, it is layered enough with a captivating plot with a dash of substance (the test of love) and performances that it makes for a really nice experience, in other words, a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most enjoyable bit of nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting for years to watch the caper movie "The Whole Nine Yards" (2000), I finally got the chance and was very amused by the film, in spite of the many complications that could exist only in a screenwriter's fevered imagination, not in real life.That, I think, may be one reason the film was made. It makes no sense; NONE... and yet, director Jonathan Lynn -- who also helmed one of the best comedies of the 1990s, "My Cousin Vinny" -- somehow made this amoral, farcical exercise in tough yucks memorable and funny.One reason this merry melange works is suggested in Roger Ebert's review. Ebert, the dean of American film critics, wrote:"We suspect that the actors are barely suppressing giggles. This is the kind of standard material everyone could do in lockstep, but you sense inner smiles, and you suspect the actors are enjoying themselves."Consider the basic plot. Nick Oseransky -- known affectionately as Oz and played by Matthew Perry -- is a straight-arrow dentist, living in a Montreal suburb with his insufferable French-Canadian wife Sophie (Roseanne Arquette), who not-so-secretly wants her husband dead. Oz, saddled with a bad marriage and huge debts, doesn't need any more stress in his life. So, naturally, here comes more trouble -- in the presence of a professional hit-man, Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis), who moves in next door.The plot snowballs from there, with Oz going to Chicago (at Sophie's insistence) to rat out Tudeski to his former mob acquaintances (for a "finder's fee"), while at the same time his faithless wife is alerting the mob to whack Oz, so she can collect on his life insurance. Meanwhile, Oz' dental assistant, a beauty named Jill (Amanda Peet), salivates at the thought of meeting a real hit man, for she is attracted to their exciting lifestyle and may want to become a professional hit (wo)man herself someday. She meets Jimmy and tells him of the ongoing double-cross, and he takes her in as his assistant.Meanwhile, in Chicago, Oz meets not only the mob boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), but also Jimmy's estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), a tall beauty who is being held hostage by the Gogolak gang. For no discernible reason other than to keep the plot moving, Oz falls head over heels in love with the statuesque Cynthia. One of the film's funniest lines comes when Oz and Cynthia prepare to go to bed together.She says: "Be gentle, will you? I haven't made love in five years."His response: "Neither have I. (pause.) I've been married."In a thriller/comedy/farce like this, you can expect dozens of interlocking plot strands and several comic pratfalls... and that's just what you get.In an inspired moment, Jimmy fends off a gang of hoods out to get him by stationing a very naked Jill at the front window. As the gunmen stop and drool at this sudden distraction, Jimmy opens fire, killing all but one of them. Jill then coolly dispatches the last guy, who's still transfixed by the vision of her gorgeous body.After the carnage, Jimmy calmly says to Jill: "Okay, you can get dressed now."If you think I've given you all the spoilers in this lethal farce, disabuse yourself of that notion immediately. I've just skimmed the surface. There are many other comical moments, especially those involving Oz' faithless wife Sophie and the very large hit man Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is the size of an oak tree but, in the end, doesn't know where to pledge his allegiance. You'll have to see it to find out.And, although "The Whole Nine Yards" involves a lot of homicide, some of it justifiable and some not, it treats the whole killing spree like a big joke. The subject is dead serious, of course. But the cast isn't taking it seriously, they are having a ball with this material. So will you.Comments to: daneldorado93@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Perry) is having a miserable life. He's living with his wife Sophie (Arquette), who hates him, and his mother-in-law who may even hate him more. His working as a dentist, but have to pay off a loan after his embezzling father-in-law, who then committed suicide. His unpleasant and boring life take a turn when he recognizes that the new neighbor moving in is the hit-man Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis). The Tulip is sought after by the Chichago mafia boss Janni Gogolak (Pollak) and Oz is sent to Chicago by his wife to collect a "finders fee". In Chicago, things get even more complicated. He learns that both Janni and Jimmy is after some money, put away in a bank account. To access the money Janni, Jimmy and Cynthia (Henstridge), Jimmy's wife (that he does not love anymore), must all be present, or a valid death certificate be presented. Oz however, quickly fall in love with Cynthia, and goes back to Montreal to help Janni, and his hit-man Frankie Figueroa (Duncan) to set up the hit on Janni. Oz also learns that Frankie is in league with Jimmy, setting his own boss up, and that Oz's wife Sophie is trying to hire her own hit-man to kill him (and collect his life insurance) which leads to his assistant Jill (Peet). So, Oz just have to play both ends of a mafia hit, save his new love Cynthia and survive his wife attempts on his life. Plus, he doesn't know if Jimmy will let him live afterward either...This is a great action comedy with emphasis on comedy. An imaginative plot with great feeling and finesse to create funny situations and details. Also the acting and casting is great. Willis and Perry are superb in their roles as Jimmy and Oz. Peet, Duncan and Henstridge are giving very nice performances in supporting roles. No dull moments and the imaginative plot is entertaining to follow and see how poor Oz is trying to cope with his new complicated life.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you heard right. This has to be one of the funniest movies ever. This movie is when I fell in love with Amanda Peet (no, I'm not a stalker). She did a wonderful job. I haven't missed any movies of her since then, and I rented some of the movies she had been in before. I saw this movie because of Bruce Willis (my favorite actor) and Matthew Perry. Although they helped make this movie what it is, Amanda played just as an important role. Kevin Pollack even did an excellent job. I still find myself saying "Ansver Dat" when the phone rings. I've been getting excited about the premiere of The Whole Ten Yards. I just planned a trip to LA to try and get a glimpse of the actors/actresses. Can't wait for the sequel to come out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER There are a number of good things about this movie, but it's not the writing, performances or anything else. First, it is a movie shot in Canada that is actually set in Canada. Second, it employed a number of up-and-coming Canadian actors who should be better known, Harland Williams in particular. I don't know who taught Rosanna Arquette the French Canadian accent, but either she was taught by someone who can't teach or doesn't know the accent, or she just couldn't do it properly. It has to be the single worst Quebecois accent in the history of motion pictures. Otherwise, the movie's not much better than a typical American sitcom. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry played these roles better on Friends. The ending is pretty predictable, but, as a saving grace, Amanda Peet gets naked.</fullReview>

Perry is a wimpy, miserably married dentist living in the Canadian suburbs who learns his new neighbor is a notorious hit-man (Willis). Farcical dark comedy/gangster drama doesn't work in which it shifts tone too often and offers too much silliness along with slapstick. Willis and Perry are intermittently funny more so than the material that lets them down. Followed by sequel, THE WHOLE TEN YARDS. Running Time: 98 minutes and rated R for brief language, violence, brief sexuality, and nudity. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis in an attempt at a dark comedy just doesn't work too well. He seems very awkward and most of the cast seems out of place. Despite that the movie isn't too bad. There are some funny moments but there is nothing really fall down funny about the film. I guess if you have nothing better to do and there is nothing on television go ahead and watch this movie. But believe me do not pay to see it. The movie is about Jimmy Tuleski, a former hit man that is now out of jail and moves into suburban Canada. His neighbor played by Matthew Perry gets a little paranoid that he is living next to a hit man. Kevin Pollak and Michael Clarke Duncan are also in the movie and they do all right. SPOILER: But Michael Clarke Duncan's character dies, it seems like the black guy dies in a lot of films.Anyways this is only a fair film. They are going to make a sequel to it; I don't think that one will do too well. The first one wasn't exactly Casablanca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time I had watched this film, I wasn't big into Willis or Perry, in fact I purchased the DVD because it was on sale and it was recommended as a `good laugh.' I had no idea that it would be as entertaining as it was. Jonathan Lynn had put together a wonderful cast, Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Amanda Peet, Natasha Henstridge, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clark-Duncan, and Kevin Pollak. It seemed the chemistry between Perry and Willis was glorified on film. Lynn managed to combine these characters, a `loser' we always seem to love, and a hit man we also always seem to love, into a great film where we want both "good" guys to become triumphant in the end.However few films have two stars of such opposite nature that blend so well. The rest of the cast had such uniqueness about them; finding out Peet is an out of work assassin herself, Pollak being a rather dumb-founded leader of a Hungarian mob from Chicago. I found it all worked together magnificently. Also I thoroughly enjoyed the music weaved into the some of the scenes in the restaurant and at Niagara Falls. You probably wont treat this film as an almost religious experience like you probably think I did, but it is defiantly a good laugh. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Howard Hawks I really enjoyed this movie. It's been a long time since I saw a comedy for the last time which was made for an audience which already left high school. There are a lot of teenager comedies around and some of them are even quite good (like American Pie I + II). But this film is for those who left their teenage years behind and know what it means to be on the job and to be married (Cynthia: "I haven't made love in five years." -- Oz: "Neither have I. I've been married.").It's an intelligent Comedy. Good story, great acting and real "Hawks'ish" Dialogues. And the characters are "Hawks' Comedies alike".If you are at least 30 years old and still love to laugh, this film is a "must" for you. If you are younger, you will still have a great time watching this movie. An who knows? Maybe you can learn something valuable for life ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing that keeps coming up when I have friends or colleagues or other film fanatics comment on The Whole Nine Yards is that this movie was either A) Great or B) a dud from the start.Matthew Perry gives another great performance but in a type-cast roll once again as a Neurotic that compares with Chandler Bing (Friends), or Alex Whitman (Fools Rush In) in scope and depth. In this case, the character of Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky is a struggling dentist that is in debt due to his former and now expired partner (and father-in-law) as well as his wife and mother-in-law.Bruce Willis plays, as he is billed, a charismatic hitman in Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski. Jimmy T's out of jail and in hiding, to an extent. He's refused to be in the Witness Protection Program and has gone on his own to the Montreal Suburbs to start a new life.Only his old one gets in the way.Light-Hearted and yet dark in scope, "The Whole Nine Yards" is a mixed bag in how viewers feel about the movie. I find the film entertaining and enjoy most of what I see with a few flaws but it's still a more-than-enjoyable flick. Others find the film boring and dull and a dud as a comedy. It's up to you to decide how far you enjoy this film and it's sense of humor. Are you willing to go the "Whole Nine Yards"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Whole Nine Yards: 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Lynn, who directed Clue, also directed The Whole Nine Yards; you can see some hints of his madcap and over-the-top directing in both movies.Matthew Perry plays Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky, a dentist who can't seem to make much money. That could be because he has to pay off his father-in-law's debt, and his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), makes sure that he pays it (his father-in-law and he worked together). Sophie sounds a lot like Yvette from Clue. Oz is unhappily married, and wants to divorce Sophie ASAP. After meeting Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), Sophie thinks of a way to get out of debt.Jimmy was a contract killer who just spent five years in prison. So Sophie makes Oz go to Chicago and find the son of a mob boss that Jimmy killed to rat Jimmy out so that he can get money for a finder's fee. And that's just the first reel.The movie feels like a drama where the actors don't think that they're funny, but they are. As director Lynn said on the commentary on the DVD, "You could make it a drama and not take out any words." But, it's a comedy, and Perry adds some physical humor to the otherwise "wordy" humor.Willis plays great in these type of roles-the comedic bad guys, the part where he can be funny but is also in a serious role. I liked him in this role; and so did he.My favorite character was Jill St. Clair, played by Amanda Peet. She was good as Oz's secretary who falls in love with Jimmy. It's obvious she wasn't that comfortable with her nude scene, but she managed to get through it, and I hope she's as good in the sequel.Michael Clarke Duncan played Frankie Figs, someone who supposedly works for Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the son I mentioned earlier. He came on to work right after he finished with The Green Mile, and his roles couldn't be any more different. He shows his "big-ness" in here too, and it's worth seeing TWNY just to see Perry run into him.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was it wasn't always funny. I thought that the plot had a few too many twists and turns for a comedy, but it could be a new "style". But, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind paying attention in movies, because if you don't pay attention, you'll get lost.My rating: 6/10Rated R for nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a perfect Crime/Comedy in so many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the basics, let's get to the particulars.Matthew Perry's best work outside of FRIENDS. Three To Tango is a very close 2nd. Not only is he perfect for this movie, but he does everything perfectly in it. His body language, physical comedy, and general acting abilities are at it's peak as far as I'm concerned.Bruce Willis was easily the best man for the job. He has an incredible way of being extremely intimidating and can go on a killing spree in movies for no reason, yet we still want him to live (doesn't matter if he's good or bad). Am I the only one who didn't want him to die in The Jackal? He's the second funniest guy in this movie and hitman persona comes through in fine style.Although Michael Clark Duncan was perfect as the bodyguard/hitman of Yanni's, we still wanted him to live, right? Like Bruce Willis, he can go around killing good/bad people, but we'd still bring him over for to see Mom, right? He played his smaller role very well and he should be proud of his work (even though he didn't get too many lines).Funniest Whole Nine Yards moment: Oz sees Jimmy T and he tries to flee, but gets stopped by Figgs. He then falls over a nearby lamp and "wets" himself. A MUST BUY MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spoof of film noir that's good noir at the same time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of "hard boiled" crime movies like The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, etc. (If Bogie's in it, it's going to be at least OK in my book. :) The Whole Nine Yards is a spoof of the genre. It's got mobsters involved in a convoluted plot to kill each other to walk away with a fortune, star-crossed lovers who really just want to be together and make it out of a bad situation alive. But everything is twisted around as if the script made a trip to the Twilight Zone first. The thing is... TW9Y is actually a pretty good, faithful to the genre film noir. The main character (Matthew Perry) is a hapless *dentist* who's evil wife wants him dead. The fact that he's a dentist ends up making a difference, getting him out of an otherwise intractable situation. The femme fatale (Natasha Hentsridge) really isn't, though she looks that way. Jill (Amanda Peet) is a perky receptionist, who happens to have a "thing" for, of all things, contract killers. Bruce Willis is, as usual, excellent. Kevin Pollack's role as gang boss Janni Gogalac is just priceless. You can almost see him busting up in the scene when he gives his monologue to Perry's character with the nearly incomprehensible accent. "Wermin" indeed. I hope the cast really had a good time making this movie (since they didn't really make any money :). Setting the movie in Montreal was brilliant, lending an interesting, a little bit exotic tinge to the whole thing that enhances the "slightly off" nature of the movie. Canada's close to the USA but as anyone who's been there can tell you, it's NOT the USA. On the DVD, the director notes that this was done for reasons of economy (Montreal is MUCH cheaper than Miami, which was the first choice) but ended up really affecting the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and Amanda Peet is simply drop dead gorgeous. Perry is a Canadian dentist with a witch for a wife, Arquette. By apparent coincidence his new next door neighbor, Willis, is an American "hit man" seeking a new identity.Well the hit man's mobster still owes Bruce some money and his estranged wife is still in Chicago too. So the dentist is forced into a plot to get Bruce's money back and do away with his wife too. His dental assistant, Peet, gets involved too and the fun begins.No overacting or bumbling. Just an entertaining light comedy with attractive stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only rented this movie because Bruce Willis and Mathew Perry were in it and I've always liked them. But the movie was just so empty. Nothing. No energy. No climax, no comedy, NOTHING. I forced myself to laugh at some times, because it was sooooooo unbelievably dull. There are some funny moments, but not many, and the really good thing about the movie was Amanda Peet, who was unbelievably gorgeous even in the trailer. Not even Chandler could save this one. If you like the leading actors don't see this movie. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason why I think this film is somewhat similar to "Three to Tango" is because Friends-actor Matthew Perry is in both films; presenting us with the exact same character twice. Although both his performances are very good, it's quite obvious how little difference there is between one another. Personally, I think that's all he's capable of. In this film he plays the part of Oz; a very nervous dentist who doesn't stand up for himself until the moment he falls in love with Natasha Henstridge.But the same goes for Bruce Willis. The character he gets to play in this comedy is very similar to any cool character he's done before. Nevertheless, it's still very entertaining to watch him play the tough, self-confident macho again. Especially in a comedy such as this one here where he makes fun of his own stereotypical "Die hard" and "The fifth element"-characters. And guess what? It's funny all the way.As for Natasha Henstridge: I think this is her first decent performance. Michael Clarke Duncan isn't bad as well, but his acting may seem rather stiff at times. Kevin Pollak is better and funnier than I expected and Amanda Peet plays the part of the very refreshing (dentist and criminal) assistant.The script of the film is both very funny and original and it stays that way throughout the entire film. Highly recommended if you want to have a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This fits into that category of well-executed comedies that doesn't cheat the viewer out of a couple of hours. A relatively preposterous premise is made into a funny movie by not taking itself very seriously. Every actor seems to have been given complete freedom to create whatever character he or she wants. It had some genuinely funny moments provided by Matthew Perry, who seems to be smart enough to know what movies fit his relatively limited range (not a bad trick considering the inability of his fellow "Friends" castmates to do the same), and Bruce Willis, who is solid as the killer turned next-door neighbor. And Amanda Peet is absolutely perfect as a wannabe killer/receptionist. She steals the show. There is enough violence to make this a black comedy, and it tends to weigh down the lighter side of the movie, but it is still well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere along the line, Hollywood decided that contract killers were funny. Between this and Grosse Points Blank, they may just be right.I'm one of 7 or 8 people in the US who have never seen "Friends," so Matthew Perry's performance as an average Joe dentist suddenly thrust into the company of assorted cold-blooded murderers came as a delightful surprise.The story is flawlessly plotted, with pretty much everybody turning out to be either a killer or somebody who wants to hire one. It's obvious from the tone of the movie that there'll be a happy ending, but how it could possibly come about is revealed through an intricate series of plot twists.Okay, so there are a few onscreen killings (hey, it's a movie about hit men!), but the exploding blood packs are thankfully absent. There's also some language and nudity (which explains the R rating), but it's fairly tame by current standards.True love triumphs in the end, however. Hollywood might be questioned about the subject matter, but they've always known how to make a date movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first off, the movie starts off with a nice peaceful, and classic mood. The peaceful comedy is nice, specially to start off a movie. Then the sequence of events is not quite typical, but in a way also very classic. First off the new neighbor is a villain and a friend at the same time.The plot is very complex due to the fact that each character has two sides. Yet, it is quite easy to figure out what will eventually happen, but there is absolutely no way to know exactly how or in which order this will happen. This takes away the stress of too much puzzling around, but still doesn't give it away.All around this is a great movie, which due to its comedic aspect, can be watched many times, and still have an interesting plot, and the viewer in some way, is anxious to see the series of events to take place.</fullReview>

I thought that Jill (Amanda Peet) looked absolutely beautiful in the clothing she wore right after having been in the nude. The one thing that scared me about this movie was some of the violence -- Especially the fight between Frankie (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Oz (Matthew Perry) when Oz first got to his hotel room. I was kind of surprised when I discovered that Frankie was sitting in Oz's hotel room waiting for him. To me, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) looked absolutely beautiful in everything she wore -- Especially the dress she wore when she first showed up in the film. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that there was two person I totally despised, and, those people were Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) and her mother (Carmen Ferland). This was because they made fun of Oz. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this perfectly executed smash hit that goes all the way to all you Bruce Willis or Matthew Perry fans who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's not important how many people I killed. What's important is how I get along with the ones who are still alive." (Tulip)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS - My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely a very dark comedy, because a few people get shot and killed, and there is lots of frank talk of murder for hire, but we laughed all the way through. It definitely is not to be taken seriously. Bruce Willis stars, and his brother was the producer. However, they hit the mark!!It is really Oz's (Matthew Perry) story, his quest to find true love. He is a dentist married to the shrew from hell, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, with a comedic French accent). His former partner, Sophie's father, had embezzled and gambled away lots of money, then killed himself. So most of Oz's earnings are going to pay back that debt. Meanwhile Sophie is secretly trying to get him whacked to collect the insurance money, and Oz simply cannot afford to divorce her.Enter Jimmy the Tulip (Bruce Willis, 45), a hit man just out of 5 years in prison, moving in next door and with the name "Jimmy Johnson". But Oz recognizes the tulip tatoo on his arm, and realizes who his neighbor is. He tells Sophie, and she convinces Oz to travel to Chicago to "inform" on Jimmy to the mob boss there. In his hotel room he finds Frankie Figs (very large Michael Clark Duncan of Green Mile fame), a mob hit man who in the evolvement of the story is actually friendly to Jimmy. Later we find out Sophie told Jimmy that Oz was headed to Chicago to rat him out, and Jimmy sent Figs to "escort" him. :-)Among the gangsters, Oz met Cindy (Natasha Henstridge, 26 tall, beautiful blonde) who is Jimmy's wife, and Oz immediately falls in love with her. But, Jimmy's plan is to whack both the mob boss and Cindy, because there is $10Million waiting for them, but all three have to be there, or bring death certs for the missing person or two. Jimmy doesn't care anything about his wife, and wants the $10Million all for himself.So, back in Montreal, Oz is telling his dental assistant, Jill (Amanda Peet, big, toothy smile, 28) that Jimmy is his next door neighbor, and Jill is all excited because she is a "fan" of his, she wants to be a "hit man" also. At Jimmy's, they begin to "talk shop" while Oz listens incredously, and Jill explains that she is still "a virgin' (in hits), and was actually hired by Sophie to whack Oz, but couldn't do it because she got to like him.Things get sticky, the Chicago mod guys get to Montreal, Jill appears in the doorway nude to distract the mob, Jimmmy and Jill whack all the bad guys, including a cop who is posing as a hit man to catch Sophie, Oz bargains with Jimmy to save his and Cindy's lives, uses his dentistry to alter the teeth so when they burn his body in Oz's car the cop actually is identified as the dead Jimmy. So Jimmy becomes a free man, Cindy's husband is "dead" so she can marry Oz, after he divorces Sophie who was thrown in jail after they recovered the tape of her conversation with the now dead cop. The only "survivor" of the three is Cindy, she goes to the bank with the two death certs, gets the money wired to an out of the country bank, except $1Million for Cindy and Oz who can only claim the money after they are legally wed, sort of a wedding present from Jimmy the Tulip. And, of course, Jimmy and Jill end up together, "soul mates."The script and acting, including the comedic timing, are excellent. As a film in total I don't rate it very high, "7" of 10, because there are lots of much better films around. However, if you like this kind of entertainment, this one is hard to beat for amusement, plot twists, and laughs. Very well done, Willis and Willis!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tries to be a lot. It tries to be a serious tongue-in-cheek comedy with characters alternating between serious and over-the-top. It attempts to mix thriller with Three Stooges. It takes Matthew Perry and makes him clueless, but the next minute it makes him Clouseau. It brings to mind many different films, from Analyze This to Airplane, but not reaching the heights of any. One mob character (Kevin Pollack) says (nearly) all his V's as W's and all his W's as V's. My 16-year old thinks this is hilarious; it is why he wanted me to see the film, which is now a favorite of his. "Wermin" sends him to the floor. Okay... Of course, he also likes the bare breasts in the window.The film succeeds in small bits, fails in long stretches. Bruce Willis is fine as the neighbor with a past who may be a loose cannon. Rosanna Arquette has been dinged heavily by other reviewers here, but her histrionics fit fine in this mishmash. She is like the scheming couple in Steve Martin's All of Me; the overacting passion is by design. If you're in a giddy mood and don't want to see a good film and don't have a preconception about Perry, it's an okay waste of an evening.7/10 or just a bit lower, 6.9. B- or C+. Just above 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Thumb pointed directly sideways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being part of the over 40 crowd, I have never had the opportunity to watch "Friends". Being a Bruce Willis fan, I had to watch "The Whole Nine Yards." Watching this at the theatre, I absolutely could not get into the character played by Matthew Perry...Matthew who? At first glance I thought he overacted, attempting a Jerry Lewis type role, that he did not fit in. His mannerisms, body movements, and stereotypes were all so exaggerated.****SPOILER AHEAD**** Additionally, I had difficulty reconciling the brutal murder of a police officer which was depicted as overkill by Bruce Willis, with a comedy. This senseless killing was funny???The other killings were part and parcel of the mob scene. If anything, they deserved their fate. "It's business!"Therefore, I left the movie somewhat confused. What kind of movie was this? Maybe a "dark" comedy? God forbid, some high school students see this movie. It sure is a proponent of how easy, funny, and entertaining killing is. BAD, BAD example. Freddie Krueger is a better example than this. At least Freddie. and others like him, are evil. Bruce Willis is good. Very confusing for the immature mind.Months later a relative gave me this movie on VHS. Additionally, my younger wife had me start watching "Friends". I watched TWNY again and again and enjoyed it. I understood Matthew Perry, because he acted the same as he does on TV. Thus, I had no problem with his acting. That's the way he is, and his character became somewhat believable.It started to grow on me as a "cute" movie. I still cringe at the overkill scene of the police officer though.In conclusion, I have no idea what to rate this movie, as it does not fit into ANY category. If it is on a movie channel, or if someone has a copy to loan you, then watch and enjoy. DO NOT pay any money to see this. I would not recommend it to anyone. This movie simply is...a time filler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards is a very well structured film. It has a lot of twists that you can never guess . But the comedy is lame and predictable, although I have to admit there are a small few slightly funny parts.  The acting from Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis is superficial as if the movie isn't worth the hassle and the rest of the character's acting is rather bad. The screenplay is kind of boring and needs a lot more funnier and original jokes. However the actual movie is very good and the twists and the double crossings at the end is fantastic which makes you glad you saw the film. But what makes me really attack The Whole Nine Yards is the murders that go on. It is as if killing people isn't important or evil. The directors actually glamourise contract killing. I know this is all supposed to be fun but what the film portrays is something that is deadly serious.</fullReview>

Not rocket science, not a Woody Allen or Albert Brooks comedy, not going to win any awards, but a really light, funny movie with a cute premise and a few sly twists. If you have 2 hours, you could do a lot worse. Great cast, with Natasha Henstridge looking awfully fine and some gratuitous long and luscious shots with Amanda Peet's perky li'l breasts front and center. Julia Roberts she ain't, despite her and her entire management team's best efforts, and Willis seems like he would rather be playing golf some of the time, but other than Roseanna Arquette giving the worst faux-French Canadian accent I have EVER seen, a fun time is had by all, including the viewer.</fullReview>

The, Whole Nine Yards has Matthew Perry as a goofy dentist who discovers his new neighbor (Bruce Willis) is a former mobster who's gone straight, but to only later discover that his wife (Rosanna Arquette) ordered a hit to be performed by the mobsters that Willis once worked for also to make the plot interesting and twisting Perry falls in love with the wife of Willis (Natasha Henstridge) and learns that his beautiful office assistant (Amanda Peet) finally gets her wish of becoming a mobster comes true and in the end after both Willis and Perry get the problems whacked out the happy ending of Perry and Henstridge together forever and the mob man and woman Willis and Peet together forever is cherished. Michael Clarke Duncan is great in a supporting role of a mobster but mainly the performance of Willis which once again proves his great depth as an actor and combined with the funny moments from Matthew Perry and the attractive performances from Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet is what makes this unusual but entertaining mob movie worth watching.</fullReview>

He labelled it "The Whole Nine Yards", so people would think it's a FOOTBALL movie and confuse it with Oliver Stone's awful Any Given Sunday, which NOBODY wanted to see and with very good reason. So the V.P. of Stupid went with his clever catchy title, "The Whole Nine Yards", a somewhat common expression, particularly around World War Two, (lots of vets still alive, right?) and fan after fan passed on this at themultiplex and the video store because they didn't want that awful football movie.Can I have that schmuck's job? Is this too much to ask?P.S. Some of you geniouses out there may want to tell me what Whole Nine Yards really means. Spare me, I know. I'm gonna guess that you same geniouses were really offended by the use of comedic accents in the film. They worked. They were funny. French Canadians and Chicago Hungarians will survive.

		<shortDescription>You'll Hate Yourself in the Morning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed all the way through "The Whole Nine Yards," then hated myself the next morning when I realized what an amoral a film it is.To cite a few examples: One of the main characters commits several murders-including his best friend and a law enforcement officer--yet winds up going free and collecting $9 million to boot. Another character is arrested for a murder she didn't commit. Still another character sleeps with another man's wife, commits fraud and winds up $1 million richer.If you see the film you'll delight in wonderful performances by Bruce Willis (the most relaxed he's appeared on screen), Matthew Perry (finally-a movie that captures his wit and physical comedy talents), Michael Clarke Duncan and especially Amanda Peet in a star-making role as a killing-for-hire-wannabe. You'll note the easy relationship among the characters-they actually appear to like each other in real life. (They probably do: Duncan appeared with Willis in "Armageddon," and we're told that Bruce was the reason Duncan got his Academy-nominated role in "The Green Mile." Perry had a cameo in Willis' "Disney's The Kid"). And you'll appreciate the plot twists and director Jonathan Lynn's brisk direction.You'll just hate yourself in the morning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave up on this after an hour, having not laughed or cracked a smile once. I am still in shock at how truly poor this movie was. Chandler in Friends is a great comic character, because the writing is good. Chandler the Dentist in this movie is not funny, just painful, because the writing is bad. The straw that broke the camel's back was when Perry was given his Friends catchphrase "Oh! My! God!". Oh my God indeed. As for Bruce Willis, surely he can't be that hard up for work, unless he just fancied a role he could do in his sleep, because that was the impression he gave with his performance. And Rosanna Arquette's accent - what the ~@*&amp;!?!I have nothing redeeming to say about this movie. It is simply not funny. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underrated comedy.... but this may count for most movies in this genre... No wonder with the comedies released lately... There is a rare highlight now and then, and certainly this is one of these occasions. A fairly good cast, with Willis as the really cool guy, and a fairly good story that in itself guarantees for a lot of laughs. The way the whole plot develops, as well as the way the actors in this movie enjoyed themselves and played their roles, make this movie more than just the 'fairly good' comedy it normally would have been, and thus a nice and relaxed way to spend some time to watch it. Just enjoy...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another film that can't balance drama with humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Like MY BLUE HEAVEN, another film comes along to examine the hilarity that happens when a mobster moves in next door. Unlike the aforementioned, this one tries to toss in some drama and intrigue. It all comes off as believable, as finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.The talent involved is immense, and it has some good moments. Mafia comedies haven't been too hot lately (MAFIA! or THE GODSON-1998...WATCH THESE AT YOUR OWN PERIL), and this one is way above the norm. Yet, it throws too much on the plate to keep in balance. Matthew Perry's character becomes irritating after awhile, and he simply doesn't come across an earnest dupe. Bruce Willis, Natasha Henstridge and Michael Clarke Duncan are in firm control of their characters, and despite the script, give good performances.While the WHOLE NINE YARDS attempts farce, the lack of support from the script undermines its efforts. The overall effect was tepid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy similar to "Three to Tango".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why I say this is because Friends-actor (Chandler Bing) Matthew Perry is in both films presenting us with the same character twice. Although both his performances are very good, it's quite obvious how little difference there is between one another. Come to think of it: so far he hasn't done anything else but Chandler Bing-performances. Personally, I think that's all he's capable of. In this film he plays the part of Oz; a very nervous dentist who doesn't stand up for himself up to the moment he falls in love with Natasha Henstridge. But the same goes for Bruce Willis. His 'cool' performance in this film is very similar to the ones in the "Die hard"-series and "The fifth element". What he does here isn't bad at all (in fact it's quite good), but it's a straight copy of any cool character he's done before. As for Natasha Henstridge: this is her first decent performance. Michael Clarke Duncan isn't bad too, but his acting is rather stiff at times. Kevin Pollak is better than I expected and Amanda Peet plays the part of the very refreshing (dentist and criminal) assistant.The storyline is good with a few twists in it, but still easy to understand. Matthew Perry's excellent performance makes this film even funnier than it already is. And even Bruce Willis is surprisingly amusing at times. Definitely one of the better films this year. Highly recommended if you want to have a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to good effect this time. He stars as Oz, a dentist living in a quiet area of Canada, with his bitchy wife (Rosanna Arquette, who puts on a strange French accent). One day he sees some moving vans next door, and a familiar-looking man is giving orders. When Oz approaches him, it turns out to be hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). From that point on, Oz gets tangled in strange goings-on. He goes to Chicago to tell people of Jimmy's whereabouts, but it doesn't go very well. He meets Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge, erasing all memory of Species), the estranged wife of Jimmy, whom he falls in love with, Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan, surprisingly poor after his superb turn in The Green Mile)and Claire (Amanda Peet) along the way. Some funny moments take place, but overall some of the acting disappoints and the script isn't of Shakesperian level. It's not horrendous, but with the talent on board, it could be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some parts of THE WHOLE NINE YARDS are very good, but some parts are so bad they made be cringe. Bruce Willis and Mathew Perry make a good comic team- Willis is underacting here and it's very effective and Perry is overacting but it is just as effective. Unfortunatly the support they get is just plain bad. Being from Canada, I can tell you that French Canadians do not talk anything like Rosanna Arquette. Her pathetic accent is an insult. And what exactly was Kevin Pollack doing? Natacha Henstrige is nothing more then an mindless object of desire in this film- there is nothing behind her character. The only supporting player who does a good job is Amanda Peet- she has many great scenes. Overall, the film was okay- nothing more or less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the short version: Absolutely incredible!Now, a few details. Frightened Matthew Perry, frightening Michael Duncan and charming Bruce Willis - all at their best. Definitely top comedy of the year, and probably top of all times.Poor, unhappily married dentist (Perry) lives in Quebec, which he hates, because they put mayonnaise to hamburgers. One day there appears a new neighbor - Jimmy "The Tulip" - just released from prison top hit man of the world. After that action starts moving really fast. Hungarian mafia wars, everybody's killing each other and right in the middle - the dentist with suicidal tendencies.Believe it or not, but the plot is actually good. It might suit a non-comedy film. The whole thing is about humor, though. Incredibly natural and charming jokes are of the highest quality. And fragile Perry put aside of huge Duncan is simply an unmissable view. Adding to all that, apprentice killer - Amanda Peet - with a delightful smile and huge amounts of spare energy.This movie is the second, next to There's Something About Mary, top comedy of all times. Various types of humor, reasonable story, and great portion of some amazing acting are the reasons why nobody can miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I hate friends, but I have to hand it to Matthew Perry. This guy is too much. Very talented comedic actor. Rosanna Arquette really pulled off a good role too. Basically, I couldn't find anything about this movie I didn't like. I could only give it an 8 though. A comedy has to be a real classic for me to give it more than an 8. Natasha what's her name was not a good choice for Perry's love interest, but she's so fine, who cares. I suppose if they didn't have her, it would have been too jokey. The story line was actually put together well for a goof ball movie. Switching the teeth was a great twist. It wasn't as good as "there's something about mary", but good enough that I've seen it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that if this movie had been an interactive venture, where technological revolutions allowed characters to jump off the screen and interact with the audience, I would choose to be first of all, tortured by the limp and weak willed dentist played by Mathew Perry, and then assassinated by the hitman, played, with incredible deftness by Bruce Willis, rather than watch the film.What a complete cacophony of cinematic self indulgence. The "story" is simpler than the idiot characters in the film. Man in miserable marriage happens to learn that next door neighbour is a hitman with a beautiful wife. There's the obligatory 10 million dollars involved, lots of so-called "treachery and betrayal" (nothing out of place in your average group of friends), and absolutely pointless nudity of the "Carry On Doctor" variety (not that the bare chest of Amanda Peet is anything to complain about, it was just about the only redeeming feature of the film).As for Mathew Perry, well, there's no doubt about it, he has comedy exuding from his pores, and there are times in the movie, when in a slapstick rage, he performs some hilariously comic moments. But not enough, and not sufficiently weaved into the plot. Nice try Mathew. There's also a small role by Michael Clark Duncan, fresh from his brilliant performance in the Green Mile as a fellow hitman. Unfortunately there was nothing substantial in this for him to flex his considerable acting abilities, but rather a chance to play the nice but clearly capable cold-blooded killer with muscles. In all, it looked like a collection of actors, who, whilst waiting for the scripts of the film they were really working on to comeback from the printers, decided to have a few laughs and left the camera rolling. Give this one a miss and catch Mathew Perry doing his 'thing' on Friends.</fullReview>

Here he plays Chandler Bing under the name of Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky. He is also a dentist here, which he isn't on "Friends", but he can't fool me! I can spot Chandler a mile away, and there he was, only several feet from me. The same sarcasm, the occasional stutterring ("W-why? Why? Why?"), and the legendary "Oh My God" were all there pointing and Mr. Bing. The only difference between here and there is that he doesn't crack jokes. Well, you wouldn't either, if you were in his position. If you love him on "Friends", see this movie for an extra two hours of Chandler, with different friends.And of course, there was Bruce Willis, charmingly funny as he always is ("Die Hard", "Hudson Hawk"), absolutely born for the part.Bottom line: It's worth a movie ticket, it's worth the rental, and it's definitely worth two hours of watching it on TV!</fullReview>

Bruce Willis was also in a good role as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, the ruthless Hungarian Mafia hitman. Oz is a really funny character with a knack for trouble following him. The movie starts out with Oz finding out that Jimmy "The Tulip" has moved in next door. Oz is scared out of his mind and wants to move away, but his "charming" wife Sophie has something else planned for him. Sophie tells Oz to go to Yanni Gogolack in Chicago, a Hungarian mobster with a score to settle with Jimmy, and rat out Jimmy's whereabouts to Yanni. Of course, everything goes awry and the plot twists and turns in a hundred directions, until the rather predictable, yet decent ending. The movie has some really funny parts and a well-moving plot, as well as likeable characters. Go see it for a light-hearted evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy The Whole Nine Yards as much as I thought I would. Apart from some highly enjoyable and hilarious parts of the movie, and some good acting, the film didn't really go anywhere. It is a shame that such a good cast and such a good idea actually produced a film that could of been 15-20% funnier and 100% better.I recommend The Whole Nine Yards to any Matthew Perry fans, but apart from that, this flick isn't all that good.Rating: 6</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, enjoyable comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Granted, that's not saying much, there haven't been too many great comedies of late, but The Whole Nine Yards is a very enjoyable movie. The characters are well developed and the plot has enough unexpected little twists to keep you interested. Bruce Willis is good as Jimmy, and Matthew Perry is especially hilarious as "Oz." Amanda Peet also does a good job as Jill, the contract killer in training.Now, this isn't exactly an extremely deep movie that's really thought provoking, and there are some aspects of the plot that I find a bit unbelievable (some stuff involving Jimmy's wife...I won't spoil it). But, it's not a serious movie so there's really no need to expect it to be too realistic. The Whole Nine Yards is simply a funny movie that you'll definitely enjoy if you're in the mood for something light-hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Positive Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this film to be quite bland but I must say that I became surprised by it's qualities. The script is sharp and the humour is surprisingly intelligent with some great punchlines as well as some hilarious moments provided by the great cast. I usually hate hysterical characters but Matthew Perry shows that he is a reliable leading actor playing the extremely nervous Oz. Bruce Willis, who is always great, may perhaps not deliver the best performance of his career but he is nevertheless a fully credible lead. But this film belongs to it's supporting actresses. Rosanna Arquette is overacting a bit but she still delivers a memorable portrait of Sophie, Perry's bitchy wife from hell with the most horrible accent imaginable. But the real gems of this film is Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet who both deliver great performances. Peet's performance has Oscar-potential. Not only is she really good but the Academy usually like offbeat supporting roles. Catherine Keener in Being John Malkovich is good example. Amanda Peet's performance has also been critically adored which is also a good sign. Said shortly, The Whole Nine Yards is a really good (if not tremendous) movie with some minor flaws. For example, reliable actors like Michael Duncan Clarke and Kevin Pollak are both far from as good as they could have been. Still, this movie has enough assets to be worth watching at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Laugh Riot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is why we have movies, to see something like this. The Whole Nine Yards is about a dentist(Matthew Perry) who hates his job and can't stand his wife(Rosanna Arquette). But when a former Chicago hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski(Bruce Willis) moves in next door, his life becomes a lot more interesting. The cast is very large it includes the three I mentioned before, Michael Clarke Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet,and Kevin Pollak. Matthew Perry is the key to this film. He can do some much. He's goofy comedy, sick comedy, stupid comedy, and physical comedy all mixed up into one person. If he plays it right he could be a sophisticated Jim Carrey. Bruce does the Bruce tough guy and is very funny. Michael Clarke Ducan is very cool and Amanda Peet is a great supporting cast member. She's beautiful, funny and deadly all at the same time. This is a mob comedy so there is some action for action fans. There have been bad mob comedies(Mickey Blue Eyes, Mafia!, Gun Shy) and there are great mob comedies(Grosse Pointe Blank, Analyze This). This is one of the great mob comedies. The Whole Nine Yards is one of the funniest films of the year and a must see for everyone. It's laugh out loud funny and will keep you rolling in your seat.</fullReview>

It is very weak, the directing could of been improved and the acting was terrible.

With such hit actors like Michael Clarke Duncan, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette and Matthew Perry, you'd think nothing could go wrong.

		<fullReview>This film is not ALL bad; it's just mostly bad. As when doing "number 2", it can be satisfying at times. Those times are all due to the work of supporting-cast members Michael Clarke Duncan and Amanda Peet. The rest of the film is mostly mindless (and humourless) tripe mixed with crass "product placement" - so much so that while I can't recall a single quip from this so-called comedy, I do remember the name of the mouthwash used in the film, and the name of the beer-flavoured beverage that some of the actors were drinking at the end of the movie! Even though Matthew Perry has a couple of good moments of physical comedy, he mostly comes across as a younger version of Charles Grodin - not a complement. As for Bruce Willis, he doesn't even bother acting; he just plays Bruce Willis - also not a complement. If you want to see this movie, try to catch it at a reduced-price showing. That way you won't feel that you've been totally ripped off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MILD SPOILERI don't believe this film deserves either the high praise or damnation it's getting from IMDB users here. It works well for what it is: an entertaining, frothy film, not out to deliver any sort of message or grand theme but just to deliver laughs. Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis do journeyman work here, but the real joy here is in the supporting roles, especially Amanda Peet's twisted receptionist-cum-hitwoman and Michael Clarke Duncan, proving that he's going to be a screen presence for some time to come.Aside from the resolution of Duncan's character, which seems oddly harsh and out-of-place, the movie will flow over you as smoothly as a vanilla milk shake, with as much meaning or impact. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. If you want deep meaning in your comedy, wait for the next Woody Allen movie.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes violence fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Hollywood has always got to turn to Mobsters, hitmen and bitchy wives when it needs a quick, entertaining film. It works, I was entertained, but this was no great thing, it was just another movie that demonstrates how Hollywood is forever looking for more and more ways to distance itself from real life for film entertainment .You can read between the lines with these tired old clichés easier than you can tell that there will always be an instant film about hitmen, crazy people with guns and cheap sex from Hollywood. You have to ask, isn't this theme getting a tad predictable now. But I would say the plot was rather complicated and that always seems to do a movie good, but let's not forget to see it for what it is. Another cheap clichéd flick, which is dropping any conscience Hollwyood might have for the value of human life faster than the time it took for thm to reckon there'd be a Matrix 2. If every hitman character that was ever invented by Hollywood descended on Tinseltown, the place ould be wiped out. This tries to make violence fun, because we're not there and are safe in our cinematic seats but the values portrayed by this film are real. While i enjoyed the Matthew Perry comedy I thought this whole effort was rather lame, and didn't have anything new to offer an older and wiser audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good film, I have to say. But it's strange why people say it's a comedy. It is funny, of course, but nearly all the jokes were not even related to the plot. They are mostly people-tripped-over kind of joke. Otherwise the movie is fine. Matthew Perry's role is a bit like Chandler on Friend's, and he's just as cute. Amanda Peet is also good , and she has the most interesting character I think.Basically the story is great. It sees into the heart of the hit man-which he happens to have one. And it's weird how a person could murder people but thinks it's a sin to have a divorce. But it has a happy ending, so that didn't bother me too much.</fullReview>

He gets into hilarious situations and made everybody in the theater laugh very very hard. Bruce Willis is also great! Second, there is an amazing script. Plot turns which nobody would guess and a funny story with dialogue that is just so incredibly funny! This is a movie that I enjoyed very much (especially Matthew Perry's performance).

Thank whoever for Mr Wapner and Mr Lynn for bringing this to the screen.'The Whole Nine Yards' was a light yet fun film who made being a hitman more like a viable career option than an immoral murderous activity. The plot was easy to follow and Willis proved he could make fun of his hard-man roles. Matthew Perry also shows a flair for slapstick and plays comedy well away from the awful froth that is 'Friends'.A nice waste of a couple of hours.

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The laughs don't come immediately, but when they do, prepare for an aching gut. Matthew Perry is great as the successful yet hard-luck dentist and Bruce Willis is awesome as The Tulip. The best acting in the movie, however, is that of Amanda Peet. She's gorgeous and incredibly funny as the dental assistant/hitwoman wannabe. The only complaints I have are Kevin Pollack's "accent" (I use the term very loosely- was it supposed to be that bad?), and the underutilization of Rosanna Arquette. She's a solid actress and deserves more screen time. Still, once this one hits the video stores, RUN (DO NOT WALK) to get it. Your time and money will be very well spent.</fullReview>

The other two women were beautiful and (especially Perry´s love- interest) not much more. And the chemistry between Willis and Perry worked out much better than the one between women and men.Of course this isn´t really important... but I noticed, that the boys of my group liked the film much more than the girls.

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been expecting this film for quite a while, having heard and read positive reviews about it(Ebert, IMDB,...). In Belgium however, this film was receive less enthusiastic by the critics. Nevertheless, I really wanted to see it and yesterday, in a sneak preview in Leuven, I finally could. And...to my own surprise, I really disliked it, whereas the rest of the people in the theater seemed pretty positive about it. Why was it so disappointing then? Well, I won't waste any time telling the plot. You'll find it elsewhere on these pages. The film has certainly some twists, but this is also one of the biggest problems: you've probably seen it all before.(and better done!) But the major flaw of this film was, in my opinion the bad directing and some uninspired acting. Jonathan Lynn is certainly no great comedy director. He's proved that already with GREEDY, MY COUSIN VINNY, SGT. BILKO, ...: these films range from "pretty bad" to "just OK", but none of them shows signs of great timing or remarkable comic moments. This film doesn't either. I can recall having laughed only once in the whole 96 min. Not only is this a problem of directing, the script doesn't help much either. Go see ANALYZE THIS(which was great!), THE FRESHMAN and some other mob and crime parodies and tell me what's the difference with the "jokes" in this film, except for the fact that they worked better in those other movies. The script by Mitchell Kapner is so uninspired and predictable and borrows so much from other movies that it gets painful after a while.The actors can't be really blamed for these shortcomings. Bruce Willis is pretty good in his role as "hit man with a heart"(see: his character in THE JACKAL). However, he doesn't have many comic moments. This was done much better by Robert De Niro in the aforementioned ANALYZE THIS. The real disappointment here however is Matthew Perry. He's another FRIENDS-actor that's excellent in that sitcom, but, like all his other FRIENDS-colleagues, still hasn't made a really good film.(Courteney Cox is good in SCREAM, but that's not really HER film) Note that Lisa Kudrow(another FRIENDS-member)played in ANALYZE THIS(!), in which she was the only person that wasn't funny! Perry gets very little to do in this film, but plays his character in such a monotonous in such a monotonous way that, after a while, he only succeeds in being irritating rather than being funny.The others show us no comic talents either: Rosanna Arquette(with some sort of French accent?)irritates too, Amanda Peet gets her best moments in the nude scenes(!), which however seem totally out of place and even Kevin Pollack has an bad part as the mob-boss-son(is that an Hungarian accent?). Michael Clarke Duncan(the giant from THE GREEN MILE) gives a reasonable performance, but has to watch out for type-casting. Only Natasha Henstridge(best known from the awful SPECIES-films)is satisfying in the only serious role of the film. Could it have something to do with the fact that she gets nothing "funny" to say?All in all, this film is disappointing as a comedy. However, it is gentle and good-natured(despite some mild violence) and I guess that it could work too, for people that haven't seen many other parodies on the crime genre. But the jokes are too familiar and the timing is too bad to make this film actually funny. And, let's admit it: Willis is no De Niro and Perry is no Crystal either. But I think that even those two couldn't have saved this film. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I've spend a great hour and half in the Theater tonight.I went to see The Whole Nine Yards with the basic idea of watching a fun comedy with two actors I love Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis. And Two drop dead gorgeous actresses Amanda Peet and Natascha Henstridge. But it happened to be more than an EZ watching comedy. It has a plot ! (not like Usual Suspect or even 6th Sense but still) I've never had to look at my watch or either look out of the screen. But there is one thing really annoying it's the French-like accent that Rosanna Arquette has in the movie, it's overloaded to be realistic. However you should go this movie and spend a really good funny time With Willis and Perry. And even if you don't like the movie and get bored you can still look at the wonderful charming smile of Miss Peet. (and.. more =)))) I hope you'll enjoy the movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 5 minutes of this movie encapsulated the entire persona of Matthew Perry's character in a way that I didn't know whether to pity or despise him. I actually laughed at his misery and simply couldn't believe how any individual could remain in this self-destructive environment. For this reason, it was slightly difficult to completely immerse myself in this fantasy experience (I believe that I'm a repressed hitman trying to get out.)Certain details of the movie which I believe warrant mention: R Arquette and K Pollacks' accents - Absolutely horrible...was this intended for comedy relief or are they really that bad? The last few movies I've seen R Arquette in would point to the latter. N Henstridge - In general the most emotionless and boring character of ANY movie. Beautiful yes, but lacking in any audience rapport. A Peet - I just fell in love with this woman. Sexy, kinda goofy, softie at heart. Had to start watching "Jack and Jill" on television to see more of her. B Willis and M C Duncan - Very good partnership. Didn't know which way they were going the entire movie. Kept me on my toes and the ending was actually interesting enough to forgive the solution. Canada?? - I still haven't figured out the reason for setting this up North. Did nothing to enhance the plot other than the chance to showcase the two canadian detectives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was my favorite movie that I've ever seen! The laughs just keep coming, I've seen it 3 times and each time I pick up something new that's funny. Everything from odd almost un-noticeable sound effects added to the hilarity. This movie was excellent. The character Yanni Gogolack had to have been one of the funniest I've seen ( my fadder, vimmy, wormen) all lines from the eyebrow massaging leader of the Gogolack gang. Matthew Perry's character Oz Oseransky was funny at how he was so nervous of Jimmy the Tulip and pretty much every mafia man. Just mentioning the name Harland Williams makes you want to see it, although not a large part, it doesn't mean that it's not as funny as the others. Every little bit in this movie was funny, from the cop pulling out his gun to the popping noises in the background. See this movie! See it 3 times!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, this movie turned out exactly as I predicted - a few good laughs here and there, but all in all, a very predictable and somewhat boring picture. Matthew Perry goes from being a nervous psycho one second to Mr. Cool Guy with a Surefire Plan the next. Bruce Willis as a flower-loving benevolent killer - has this guy ever played a villain? There're two gorgeous women to occupy your time, but when one of them is shown topless, it's hard not to see this as being just plain gratuitous. I don't want to give away the situation, but there were much less dangerous ways to distract someone. I could go on, but I will just conclude by mentioning the ridiculous ending - anybody who's not even familiar with dentistry will have to laugh their gut off if you think it all the way through. This is a "wait for the video" if there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was. I didn't think Matthew Perry was very good in Friends and I didn't much care for his style of comedy. But he does a great job in this film. I cast away all my doubts after the scene in the car at the beginning. You'll know what I mean if you haven't seen it yet.The movie abounds with black humor based on contract killing. This movie is similar to Gun Shy, a rather overlooked film, which had me laughing harder, but the plot fell apart toward the end. This movie keeps a steady plot and the constant question in your mind over who's going to backstab who.If kids can grasp the concept of what a hitman is (and the mob..ehmm I mean the organization), this is a funny movie to take them to. There is a bit of murder (you'd expect), but nothing gory.Recommendation- see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am from Argentina and I had the chance to watch "The whole nine yards" during a vacation at the United States. The film has not been released yet here in Argentina but I had read about the new Bruce Willis' hit after the blockbuster "The sixth sense". That made me go for it. I must say that the movie did not disappoint me. I laugh a lot although English is not my mother language. Here, we see the movies subtitled. The comedy is a black comedy as we use to say. Although murdering and killing is the key to take the whole nine yards, the plot is funny and the story is entertaining. Let's talk about the stars. Bruce Willis is perfect for his role and his character. Matthew Perry does the same as in the TV series "Friends" but is a little more naive. Michael Clarke Duncan shows why he is an Oscar nominee for "The green mile". The two beauties of this comedy, Natasha Henstridge and Amanda Peet, give good acting; and the third one, Rosanna Arquette, does her best to show his French accent while hiding her English. Finally, I'd say that I truly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

The story is impossible, but the truly bothering part of this movie is Matthew Perry's lack of ablilty to remember where his hands were for each shot. One second they are in his lap and the next camera angle, they are on his hips, and it happens throughout the entire film. This isn't something that I even notice, and I am a HUGE fan of FRIENDS and his part played on FRIENDS (which, in this movie, they should have just called him Chandler). The continuity department fails us, but worse of Perry fails us with his "Chandler falls down again and again" performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Describing this movie in one word is quite simple: hilarious. "Nine Yards" is the funniest movie I think I've seen in the last year at least. The physical humour of Matthew Perry (even when you could see it coming) combined with the verbal humour of Bruce Willis combine to make the movie great. But like all things, there are drawbacks. One is the French accent put on by Rosanna Arquette (she sounds more like a cross between Latina and British rather than Quebecois), and the second is the tendency to make the Canadian police officers look like goofs that don't know how to do their job. Canuck cops are not the simpletons they are constantly made out to be in American films. Still a great movie worth the box office price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining farce; fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt as gratified after seeing this as after a good Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan movie -- a fun way to spend a couple hours. But it follows a quite different recipe and uses different ingredients than the usual TH/MR formula. This is an engaging farce, not much pretense that this is life as it really is any more than cartoons are (say then "Peanuts" is), and with many of its characters deliberately broadly drawn -- or overdrawn-- in their roles or accents. I thought the casting and ensemble acting was good. Matthew Perry's love interest has a Lauren Bacall look and the whole movie had a somewhat tongue in cheek gangster movie air about it. The movie telegraphs its ending -- this is a comedy, right?, so we know all will end well and how else will they do it except the obvious? -- but then, gratifyingly, the movie gives us something much better than the obvious. The movie's not great, but certainly a worthwhile treat. And Amanda Peet, as the dental assistant, certainly contributes a lot to that; I can't imagine anyone else bringing or giving more to the part. Her face is delightfully expressive. Willis's hit-man character, which he somewhat underplays to good effect, reminds me of the similar truth in the old Vermont farm maxim about livestock, "if you're going to eat it, don't name it."There are some murders, violence, nudity, and sex -- but none that struck me as gratuitous; all fit and were necessary parts of the plot. We don't feel too sorry when the bad guys lose and we're happy for the good guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went into this movie not expecting a lot from it. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's not a cerebral comedy by any stretch of the imagination, but good in a slapstick kind of way. Reminded me of a modern version of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel &amp; Hardy, or the Three Stooges: a guy completely in over his head, completely out of his league. There were some good site gags that many people may not have noticed about this movie, like the fact that this guy is driving a Toyota Corolla, and not something fancy. Some people have noted that Rosanna Arquette as Matthew Perry's bitchy french Canadian wife had a horrible accent, and badly acted, but I think that was deliberate, it just added to the slapstick. I also found it amusing that they didn't try to hide the fact that they were in Montreal, and not try to pass it off as New York or some other American city, because it was important to some of the gags about Canadian vs. American tastes. A lot of so-called American movies are filmed in Canada these days, and they always try to pass off our cities as some American city rather than as themselves: good touch. And watch the Keystone Cops they were hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geesh, lighten up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that I had a thoroughly good time watching this movie. The characters that were supposed to be likable were and the ones that were supposed to be despicable were too. I know a lot of people will say that the plot was thin or the script was weak, but IT"S A COMEDY and it does a great job of being just that.Amanda Peet steals the show in nearly every scene that she is in. The "Jack and Jill" star somehow manages to be beautiful and wacky and intelligent all at the same time. Bruce Willis continues to show that he can act in any genre, although I still think that this edgy comedy style (remember Moonlighting) is his best. Matthew Perry has an impeccable sense of comic timing and physical comedy. Here he shows that he is the "Friends" male most likely to break from the pack. Natasha Henstridge gives the most impressive performance that I have seen from her so far and, by the way, she is stone cold gorgeous.Overall, this was the most enjoyable comedy I have seen this year. I loved the little twists and the romantic story was cute. It is certainly not the most important film of the new millennium, but it's not trying to be. It's trying to make you laugh and for me it succeeded just about every time. As I've said before, when you're watching a comedy like this, try to lighten up and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

The man is so huge and no matter how many times I see him I still am amazed at his size. But I'm becoming a fan because he's a really good actor. In 9 Yards, Duncan plays Frankie Figs. A great character who you like immediately, even though to the hero Oz, played by Matthew Perry, this guy is the enemy.Perry for his part was quite funny, though he only stepped a little outside of his Chandler persona.Overall, this was an enjoyable film. Don't spend a lot of time thinking about the intricacies to the plot. There aren't any. Just accept what's going on and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>recommend (though barely)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of performances that still bug me about Bruce Willis' new film, The Whole Nine Yards. There's enough good material here to recommend it, but let's dispense with the bad first: Rosanna Arquette and Kevin Pollack have certainly done better work; in fact, this is the worst I've ever seen them. The problem lies more in bad casting than the performances themselves. If you're wrong for the part, you're wrong for the part.Our main character, `Oz' Oseransky (Matthew Perry), a dentist has inherited the gambling debt of his wife's ex-husband. His mother-in-law and wife Sophie (played with bad French accent by Rosanna Arquette), share mutual hate for Oz. Never explained is why he married her in the first place. She is entitled to none of his money unless he dies, but he's too good hearted a person to consider she would want to have him bumped off.Enter Jimmy `the Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis, perfectly cast in his best comedy role in years), who moves next door to Oz. He's not there to kill anyone, but to hide out of country (the film is set in Montreal) from the mob boss he used to kill people for, Janni (Kevin Pollack, accent unknown). Jimmy's just finished a five year prison sentence after ratting out several members of the gang, including the Janni's father, hence, putting Janni in charge of North Chicago's biggest crime family. Oz grew up in Chicago (go figure), so he knows all about The Tulip's career. He foolishly shares what he knows with Sophie, who wastes no time in convincing Oz to go to Chicago to find out if there's a price on Jimmy's head.This is only the beginning of this convoluted plot, which rolls together Oz, Jimmy, and Sophie with Janni's current triggerman Frankie Figs (Michael Clarke Duncan), Oz's demented office assistant Jill (Amanda Peet), and Jimmy's beautiful, estranged wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge). There are a few unexpected surprises in a plot where few people are what they seem.What holds this all together are the performances of Willis and Perry, a risky pairing that turned out well. Perry takes physical comedy to a level we haven't seen since Jim Carrey's heyday. Willis' timing is perfect. He gives this role, that of a good-natured psychopath, exactly what it needs. He was built for comedy and should do more of it (even though we'd all like to forget Hudson Hawk).David Franco's photography gives the film a noir look, using filters and dampened lighting in most shots. The look was chosen, I would guess, because this is a parody of the mystery/thriller genre. Director Jonathan Lynn (My Cousin Vinny), knowing how sophisticated movie audiences have become, does his best to make the story interesting to look at. He also understands well how to frame a shot that's designed for laughs.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Perry is going to have to live with a curse. That curse is that whenever you see him, you think of "Chandler Bing". The moment I knew that this was a good movie was when I no longer saw him as Chandler but as Oz.This movie is not a laugh a minute. But it is without a doubt a giggle a minute with a few fall down laughs. It is cute and funny and somehow makes hitmen lovable. The cast is well put together even though Kevin Pollack's little speech impediment is a tad annoying. Yet the cast meshes regardless. And if you don't cheer when OZ gets the girl (I will not reveal which one) you might have lost some mirth in your heart. Maybe this movie will help bring it back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this one not expecting much, but I left pretty satisfied. This movie was more of Matthew Perry than it was Bruce Willis. The fact that it was done in Canada and they said it was Canada made it good, but it wasn't an issue. The 3 characters that stood out in this one were Perry, Pollack with a really hilarious accent, and Amanda Peet who played the secretary. Although she looked naive her part made me laugh just as much as the other 2 that I enjoyed. I think at this rate Perry will be the only person from Friends that will be successful in this business. Overall not bad, and good to go catch on a friday night or on a day where u are just bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we went to see this film I was sure (and wrong) that it was a novice writer/director. It's amazingly bad, with many mistakes of a such a first timer. The plot, is too long, for the film, so it rushes ridiculously through key parts, and is leaden in other meaningless areas. Terrible acting (except Willis &amp; Peet) ridiculous dialogue (everything from laughable film noir quips, to arnie-like one liners). God, I can't describe how cheap the film looks. Did they shoot this in a weekend? It's terrible, except for two scenes with Willis, and Peet. Not even worth renting on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B+ Movie, A-List Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>B+ Movie, A-List CastPros: Excellent Physical Comedy, Funny Most of the Time...Cons: Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Pollack detract from movie.I went to see this movie because Bruce Willis was so great in "The Sixth Sense." He's pulled off action and dramatic roles with great flair before, so I wondered if he could make me laugh on purpose, rather than unintentionally, as he did when he played Korben Dallas in "The Fifth Element."The movie is directed rather handily by Jonathan Lynn, known mostly for early 90s comedy hits such as "Three Men and a Little Lady" (Ted Danson, Tom Selleck), and "Greedy" (Michael J. Fox, Kirk Douglas). Again he does an admirable job with essentially the same kind of a film, your basic fish out of water movie that pairs two or more established male leads, one from TV, one from film.Matthew Perry is likable here, in certainly his best role outside of TVs Friends. Here he plays hen-pecked "Oz" Oseranksy, a Montreal dentist that is threatened by a turn of events after Mafia rubout artist Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis) moves in next door. Perry is so good with the physical comedy, that at times I almost thought he was in an entirely different movie. Then again, for a few scenes, and in broad strokes, you might have thought he was playing an alien.Willis comes across here much as he did in Moonlighting -- a wiseguy with the occassional good quip that appears to be losing his edge -- only this time he's a semi-retired hitman with trouble looking for him. So, aside from the hitman part, Willis is essentially playing himself. That's okay, you can still like him!While "The Whole Nine Yards" pretty much capitalizes on everything it has going for it, it falls flat a few times. "The Whole Nine Yards" desperately wants to be a cross between "Get Shorty" (plot within a plot) and "Grosse Point Blank" (amiable hitman makes good), but some of the gags are trite, and the dialogue doesn't always come off right.For example, I was mostly just annoyed by characters that talked funny... such as Rossana Arquette's Quebec Housewife Sophie Oseransky, and Kevin Pollack's Chi-Town Gangster Yanni. Talking funny and being funny are not the same thing, and I was mostly appalled that the great Arquette (Baby It's You, New York Stories, Pulp Fiction) has been reduce to playing cheap characters that are the butt of the joke in every scene, just for inconsequential laughs.On a happier note, Natasha Henstridge is more three-dimensional in her characterization here, as Jimmy Tudeski's soon to be ex-wife-on-the-outs, than I have ever seen her. And I can't say enough good things about the totally hilarious Amanda Peet (Jill)! Ms. Peet is certainly an up-and-comer, and I can't wait to see her in the movies "Body Shots" &amp; "Takedown" which haven't been released yet.If you want to see another movie like this one, I'd have to compare it to movies like "So, I Married An Axe-Murderer", "The Cable Guy", "Addicted to Love", "Election" or "Very Bad Things", four other GREAT fish out of water comedies, and one BAD ONE from the 1990s. "The Whole Nine Yards" is, for the most part, almost a first down in every scene, but the movie tries too hard to make you laugh sometimes, and at topics that aren't very laughable, such as murder and death.So basically, to sum up, except for six or seven scenes where the ball metaphorically falls just a few inches short of the chain, you should get a kick out of this film. It's a noble "Hail Mary Pass" of a comedy that is fumbled only in the End Zone.Bang for the Buck: Worth full-price to see it on the big screenMovie Mood: Funny MovieRecommends to friends?

		<fullReview>Advertised as a funny story about a hitman, The Whole Nine Yards is a romantic comedy with some spice and action (which was so glaringly lacking in "You've Got Mail"). Bruce Willis is superb, Matthew Perry is good, and Duncan is as big and imposing as always. Females in the movie are beautiful, and Henstridge's beauty is simply stunning. I was envious every time Perry would kiss her :) This is a very good "date" movie. Not recommended to those offended by brief nudity, some profanity and "matter-of-fact" homicides. Recommended to everyone who wants to be amused and to see great actors doing a great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad. This movie could have been better and funnier. There were some hilarious scenes but not enough. Basically all the laughs came from Matthew Perry. Also the movie did not have too much of a plot. There was a story to it but it could have had more. What kept this movie alive was its solid cast with Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan, Natasha Hensridge and Rosanna Arquette. This was a good improvement for Bruce Willis since THE SIXTH SENSE (*1/2). I would recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of any of the cast members, especially Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry and to others I would recommend waiting for video. For me, the movie was good but it could have been better. **1/2[2 1/2 OUT OF 4]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an interesting movie to watch. It was kind of like watching a two hour sitcom but with a motion picture feel to it. There was an honest genuine feel to the humor and some of the best physical comedy I've seen in years but I'm still trying to figure out what the title of the movie has to do with it. Whole Nine Yards is a dark comedy about mob double crosses and the search for marital bliss. Mathew Perry plays the character of "Oz" Oseransky, a dentist in the quiet suburbs of Montreal, Canada. He is stuck in an unhappy marriage with a wife that wants nothing to do with him except to give her money and pay off her father's debt. His life takes an interesting turn when a new neighbor moves in next door. He goes out to welcome his new neighbor and can't quite figure out why the man looks so familiar. It slowly dawns on him that the man, Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), is a contract killer for a Chicago mob gang. Rumor has it that the Chicago mob is looking for Jimmy and Oz's wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), sees an opportunity to reap financial gains by convincing Oz to go to Chicago to tell the Mafia where Jimmy is. While in Chicago, Oz manages to fall in love with the wrong woman and it dramatically complicates his life. The story takes several wild turns after this point and leaves the audience guessing the ending. There were many things I liked about this movie and a few things I didn't so which would you like to hear first? I'll start with the good things. The storyline is actually smartly written. As I alluded to earlier, the story takes several unexpected turns keeping the audience guessing although I'm sure, you can generally guess what the ending is going to be like. Bruce Willis is excellent as Jimmy Tudeski. Normally when you think of Bruce Willis, you think of action movies like the Die Hard series or Armageddon but he has stepped out of his action hero role for odd ball type movies like Death Becomes Her or Sixth Sense. Whole Nine Yards is another of these odd ball type movies and he does a wonderful job. Mathew Perry has tried to make the transition from TV star to movie star and has been in a few movies over the last couple years but this is by far his best performance. He has always had very good comedic timing but in this movie he got to show his physical comedy skills which impressed me more than anything. He played the paranoid "hit" victim very well and his chemistry with Willis was amazingly humorous. Michael Duncan also gets a chance to show his comedic skills and does a good job. The one thing I really didn't like about this movie was Rosanna Arquette as Oz's wife, Sophie. She has never really been one of the more elite actors in the industry and she does nothing to raise her stock in this movie. I realize that her character was to be played a little over the top but her French accent is just plain terrible. At times, it sounded a little like a mix between a French and Asian accent. I found myself rather distracted trying to figure out what she was saying whenever she spoke. At other times I felt that she took her character a little bit too far over the top. The story itself did suffer from some incomplete plot telling. There were certain elements of the plot that were blatantly ignored and it tends to leave the audience wondering. There was one thing about Mathew Perry's performance that I did notice. For any of you who watch him on the TV sitcom series "Friends", you may have noticed his TV character of Chandler Bing slipping out into Oz everyone in a while. I guess that is to be expected considering his character of Oz is somewhat similar to his TV character. Overall, I enjoyed myself. If you can ignore a bad French accent, this would be an excellent matinee to go to. You will definitely be entertained.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Whole Nine Yards prepared to be lightly amused by a little movie. But it was much better than I expected. The physical humor is funny, but it's the dialog that really sets this movie apart. Many of the lines are subtilely funny - they sneak up on you. You're laughing at them during the movie and you are laughing at them again after the movie.Bruce Willis displays his versatility with a performance that brought back memories of Moonlighting, Matthew Perry is also good. Natasha Henstridge is very good as the tough (but not so tough) wife of Bruce Willis. (I had never seen her in anything before, she is BEAUTIFUL) But, it is Amanda Peet that steals the show as the quirky dental assistant. You don't realize how quirky until later on. She is outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>competent, often subtle comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a little slow at the beginning, but, once the plot's set up, The Whole Nine Yards is a pretty funny film, though it does lose some stream near the end, too. Of course, it helps that the film is well cast, at least in the cases of Willis, Perry, Duncan, and Peet (luckily, they're the four characters with the most screen time) - Pollak and Arquette seem disinterested in their characters and deliver poor accents.Expect most of the film's laughs to stem from the conversations between Willis, Perry, and Peet as most of the physical humor is pretty ordinary genre fare. Incidentally, a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle (an aspect of the film I like), so be aware. Also, there's some good quotables here. Granted, you probably won't want to watch this movie more than once, but there's enough jokes here to make it worth a viewing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Bruce Willis fan ever since he made the Die Hard series. I knew right away I was going to enjoy "The Whole Nine Yards" because it really showcased Willis' versatility for every genre of film.Other than Willis, I was delighted to see Michael Clarke Duncan and Amanda Peet perform exceedingly well. Duncan is a rising star in Hollywood and everyone should be taking notes to cast him in more parts. Peet stole Willis' thunder in this film because she really made me laugh. Her jokes were well timed and didn't make it seem like she had to become someone else to pull it off.The only drawback I found with this film was the performance by Matthew Perry because I believe that anyone could have pulled it off better than him; he was just there because the casting director needed to fill screen space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my two favorite movies of the year 2000 so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie so far of the year 2000, along with SCREAM 3 or just a little better. I have always liked Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, and I also quite like Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. And of course, I love a good comedy. So I was pretty excited to see THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It did not live up to my expectations?it soared past them.A resident of Canada, Oz Osercansky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist who is living with a wife (Rosanna Arquette) who he hates and she hates him, but they don't get a divorce for money reasons. When a hit man named Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door, Oz finds out his wife is trying to find hit men that will kill him. Jimmy, who takes a liking to Oz, doesn't agree to kill Oz, but seeks Oz's help in getting Jimmy's wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and his enemy, Yanni (Kevin Pollak), together so he can kill them. Oz, along with another hit man named Frankie Figs (Michael Duncan) finds himself unwittingly helping, but he starts to fall in love with Cynthia and won't let her die.My plot description sounds quite bad, but the movie is very good and funny. The collection of actors in this movie are superb. Bruce Willis is good as the loveable murderer. Matthew Perry does a great comedic job as usual. Michael Duncan fit the part of the really big and scary hit man pretty well too. The adorable Amanda Peet was really good too as the hit-woman wannabe.I saw ANALYZE THIS a few days before I saw this, and I thought this one blew it away. The actors are better, the characters are cooler, the jokes are funnier (I was laughing out loud on many occasions) and the mixture of crime and comedy is pulled off a lot better in this movie, which is strange because there is more crime in this one than in ANALYZE THIS. Both the comedy and the crime are pulled off terrifically. Go see this movie now, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun two hours spent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards was something I saw as either a hit or miss. I preferably like to see just about anything with Bruce Willis, some are a huge hit (The Sixth Sense, Die Hard) while some are a huge miss (Striking Distance). This turned out to play a lot different than I expected. I was happy to walk out of the theatre liking it a lot, but it wasn't Bruce Willis that stole the show.The two that will stick in your mind after viewing this film are Matthew Perry and Amanda Peet. Michael Clark Duncan and Bruce Willis (also not to forget Kevin Polluck in a small role) do a great job but every scene that Matthew Perry and Amanda Peet are in they steel the show. Both are very different, Matthew Perry is the more goofy sense of humor played with perfection while Amanda Peet just does so much with her character from being a complete bimbo to being incredibly charming. You just have to see her role played to understand how great her performance is, especially with some of those dumb little smiles she makes.The story is relatively simple and complex at the same time. A hit man moves next door, neighbor wants other hit men to hit him - while his wife wants to hire the hit man next door or just about any hit man to kill her husband - while the hit man next door has a friend hit man to keep an eye all of them. See what I mean? There's a lot going on but it's just a film where you are more happy to just lay back and watch the fun instead of taking note. There are just so many scenes in the film that everyone will find funny that it will require a few extra viewings to pick up on everything.To explain the film in a sentence - think of Grosse Pointe Blank without John Cusack (meaning not nearly as fast with jokes) filled to the top with different styles of humor while combining it with a little bit of action. It's a film entirely about it's cast, if someone else played Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, or Amanda Peet it would not nearly be the same. This won't be the best comedy you've seen in a long time, nor will it be the best of the year, but it'll make you leave it with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a funny movie. Funnier than what it should have been. It seemed like for the most part the comic timing was slightly off, yet the jokes played very well. It even kind of helped an off-beat movie to be off-beat. I laughed. The whole movie was kind of the same-old same-old but it worked. The whole thing was designed from a technical standpoint to make you feel slightly off about it. But everything works, and you laugh. I won't repeat the plot, if you don't know it, watch the trailer.Bruce Willis, and Matthew Perry play off each other well. But the addition of Michael Clarke Duncan, who was wonderful in this film, Natasha Henstridge, and Rosanna Arquette all worked better than the main leads. If you look at this movie as an off-the-center comedy it all blends perfectly. If you look at this as a completely commercialized comedy, which it is, it won't work. It is what it is not. Either way, this movie should be checked out by everybody who likes mildly-dark comedies. Those who like their comedies blacker than black will not care for this one as it isn't that dark (see Love Stinks, or Very Bad Things instead). The weird parts of this film are just overall feelings. The movie would possess a PG-13 rating if it did not have full frontal nudity, which is played out hilariously. It isn't even explicit or seem too gratuitous. It seemed natural to be naked. That is what should happen with nudity. It should be PG-13 because of its complete lack of foul language (although that never bothers me, see South Park) and its violence is completely tamed down, almost to the point of old B&amp;W films. Nudity is not an evil thing (MPAA take note) if it is not treated badly. But see this movie and judge for yourselves. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mob stuff is tough, and this movie succeeds, sort of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Whole Nine Yards" seems to be Warner Bros. Studio's attempt to replicate last year's sleeper success, "Analyze This". A mob comedy coming out at the same time as Harold Ramis' spiky goodfella sendup did last year, Jonathan Lynn's picture goes for a little more of a "Pulp Fiction"-y vibe of wisecracking, too-cool-for-the-room hitmen. Still, the film takes its story a little too seriously, and, lacking the earlier film's knowingly satirical take on mob cliches, is not as successful.The film stars Matthew Perry as a Montreal dentist who finds out that his new next door neighbor is hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), who's hiding out from his former Chicago associates. Perry's loathsome wife sends him to Chicago to rat out Jimmy the Tulip, and a complicated double-crossing plot ensues, involving weird Hungarian gangsters, Jimmy's sexy wife, and an eager would-be hitwoman ready to learn from the master.A film like this, which mixes comedy and violent crime, is a difficult balancing act. It's tough to pull off violent scenes in a comedy without eliminating the lightness. Jonathan Lynn, a director whose previous work I have admired a great deal, is not entirely successful at this. His violent scenes are just violent, and don't really add anything to the picture besides an R rating (though a gratuitous nude scene does the bulk of that work).Mitchell Kapner's screenplay also commits the rather interesting feat of not being self-aware enough. People these days know more about the way the movie mob operates than about the real mob, and a mob satire usually plays better when dealing with these kinds of cliches. "Analyze This" understood that, including a couple of scenes that sent up "The Godfather" and other films. Kapner, however, seems to be approaching his material from too straight an angle, and if he would have been able to bounce through it with a more cockeyed approach, he might have had a real mob comedy, and not a mob film with some slapstick and jokes thrown in.Still, the actors do what they can with the film, and manage to pull off some very entertaining moments. Bruce Willis' performance is easy, not lazy; he remains one of the most charming of superstars, and the most fun to watch on film. Matthew Perry does some nicely bumbling physical shtick, but it seems that his character gets into the whole hitman world with a little too much comfort. If he's a fish out of water, he must be one of those walking catfish. Giving him a character to deal with who wasn't some kind of criminal would have been a step in the right direction.Michael Clarke Duncan, just nominated for his first Oscar for "The Green Mile", is very entertaining as an associate of Willis', showing a surprisingly light gift for comedy. Rosanna Arquette is suitably loathsome as Perry's wife (man, with this character coming in the same year as "South Park", I'm starting to think Canada should file an anti-defamation suit against Hollywood), and Amanda Peet has some good moments as Perry's dental assistant. Natasha Henstridge seems to have no gift at all for comedy, but her bright smile and megawatt eyes makes up for that. Kevin Pollak, sadly, seems to be giving a bad performance in a straight mob movie rather than appearing in a comedy. Someone should have told him to turn up the heat under that accent and get a little crazy.Overall, "The Whole Nine Yards" provokes more smiles than laughs. It's likable enough, and it picks up steam as the plot starts to come together. Still, this is a rental. Just don't rent it with "Analyze This", though. It would be like comparing apples and slightly overripe apples.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great comedy. There was good chemistry between the principals. I thought the A/V editing was outstanding. Great cuts in sync with the sound effects. It makes the ticket well worthy of the experience. From the moment you meet "Yimmy", you know he's the heavy. Throw me a Miller! Perry as `OZ' does a great nervous straight man stick and has you laughing all the time. He's good at being clueless until he occasionally nails the moment. Rosanna plays a great part as a detestable spouse. Natasha makes "Cynthia's" words believable! She helps the scenes slide together like heels on wet grass. She's better with windows than "Oz" is with sliding glass doors! She has great eye contact and expressions. What a flirt! Michael works great off the leads as `Frankie'. Just watching him do his entry gig on "Oz" makes you laugh 'till your sides hurt. Kevin Pollak as "Yanni" has you if fear... that he'll say something you'll actually understand. Mel Brooks would get a hoot out of this dialogue. You'll enjoy this comedy. It's worth every minute. Better brush your teeth before you watch it, You'll feel better! Oh, and don't look for Kevin McCallister in this movie. I thought he had the TV on in one scene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards: Ever wonder why the suicide rate among dentists is so high? I'm convinced it's because they spend all day rooting around in people's mouths. Now imagine that you are Nick "Oz" Oseransky: in addition to being a mouth spelunker you are trapped in a loveless marriage with a chain-smoking-money-sucking-leech-of-a-wife, you have a live-in mother-in law who you're convinced knows Satan on a personal basis and you're struggling to pay off debts left by your good for nothing ex-partner and father-in-law. Just when Oz thinks he's hit rock bottom, he gets a new neighbour, but not just any neighbour: this guy happens to be an infamous contract killer who ratted out his former employers and just got out of prison. And he wants to be friends. It would be enough to make anyone jump in front of a busThis is a dark, slapstick romantic comedy that falls somewhere in between "Prizzi's Honor" and "Analyze This" with a bit of "Say Anything" thrown in for good luck. Matthew Perry is hilarious as Oz, the stressed out bumbling schmuck who finds himself in an impossible situation. Perry's physical comedy continues to improve with every picture and this is his best big screen performance to date. It was also refreshing to see Bruce Willis return to the wise cracking tough guy character that he does so well (especially after the disastrous "The Story of Us"). The supporting cast also does a great job - Kevin Pollack is amusing as the verbally dyslexic Hungarian gangster and Amy Peet glows as the quirky dental assistant. It would be interesting to see how the audience perceived Michael Duncan - here a ruthless killer- when they saw the second half of the special double feature -"The Green Mile".My sole complaint would have to be Rosanne Arquette's character. Don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against scheming evil women, but her Quebecois accent was positively dreadful. I don't know if this was meant for comic effect, but every time she started to talk they couldn't end the scene quick enough for me.That quibble aside, this is a well-acted funny movie with some interesting twists and worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected the movie to have the off-beat humor that Bruce Willis showed in "Blind Date". It did, he did, but Matthew Perry was hilarious - well worth seeing just for his performance. Amanda Peet was also a nice surprise. She was almost stealing scenes from Mr. Perry. I had a little trouble getting by a few of the accents that some characters obviously took out of the closet for this film. When you know the actors well enough, its distracting to wonder whether its working or not. I think its because I expect them to forget to use it at any given point. Aside from that, the characters were good throughout, right down to the two detectives investigating the crime. There were a few uneven spots with the dialog, but it was much tighter and more consistent than a recent gangster and his newfound buddy flick, "Analyze This". There are some movies that we like to see over again to pick up the subtleties, and everything else that we missed when we were laughing. This is one of them.</fullReview>

Some very Likeable characters and some you were glad to see get their "what goes around comes around" desserts.Quirky characters, especially Sophie &amp; Yanni. It was obvious that no one cared or intended for them to have real accents. The fact that they tried to be French/Hungarian speaking English was funny. Not bloopers or bad efforts. Who cares in this movie. We were hoping for out-takes or bloopers at the end. They must of had a ball making this movie.The story is great. Jimmy the Tulip was intimidating and yet likeable in spite of his warped sense of morals and honor. Jill was a hoot as Dental assistant with a Secret desire for a new career. You figure it out!All in all a great, funny, entertaining, plot twister of an exciting movie. Worth seeing for a bunch of laughs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Crime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed the farce that was in the films of Jonathan Lynn. From NUNS ON THE RUN, MY COUSIN VINNY, SGT. BILKO, TRIAL &amp; ERROR, and even GREEDY. Lynn is a director that brings back the golden age of slapstick to big screen, along with some witty dialogue. So one would think that I enjoyed his newest film, WHOLE NINE YARDS, think again. But I don't know who to blame for liking this film? It's not the actors or actresses, they all do their best for the material that they are given. It's not Lynn, his comedic timing is good and keeps the film going. I guess on this film I would have to blame the writer, for not giving the viewer funny material. WHOLE NINE YARDS takes place in Quebec, where a Chicago native dentist named Nick "Oz" Oseransky, is having a horrible life. His overbearing and annoying wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), doesn't love him anymore and the feelings are the same for Nick. It isn't until a mysterous neighbor moves in, that changes Nick's life. Nick's new neighbor is "Jimmy the Tulip" (Bruce Willis) a notorious hit man for Chicago gangster Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak). Jimmy is in hiding from Yanni since he testified against him in court. Nick's wife sees this as the perfect opportunity to have the couple get out of their debt by revealing to Yanni, Jimmy's whereabouts. When Nick talks to Yanni, there's another hitman that wants to kill Jimmy (Michael Duncan Clarke), and Jimmy's beautiful wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) also wants Jimmy dead. The only person that Nick can trust is his assistant in the dental profession, Jill (Amanda Peet), or can he trust her? WHOLE NINE YARDS does at time work, and at other times fails. Bruce Willis is pretty good as the calm and cool hitman, while Perry is at times funny, and at other times very annoying as the louse who keeps bumping into things and panics. Rosanna Arquette has a tedious accent (I don't know why?) and there isn't much screen time of her. While Natash Henstridge is good as the beautiful hit man's wife who falls for the kooky dentist. The two people that I thought stood out were Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. Duncan fresh from the success of THE GREEN MILE proves that he can be a funny man as well as a serious man. I enjoyed his performance as the gigantic Frankie. And Amanda Peet is also good as the sort of ditzy Jill who is smarter than she looks. And if you're a Amanda Peet fan, you really should see this film! There are also some good surprises here and there in the plot twists. I don't want to reveal what happens, since it does make up for the flaws of the movie. Overall, I do give WHOLE NINE YARDS credit for trying. It is a funny movie that does it's best to keep the laughs coming. But at times the jokes, like Matthew Perry, fall flat on it's face. Not a really bad film, just see it if you have nothing better to do. *** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly well done suburban crime caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My movie tastes tend to revolve more around violent horror movies and long forgotten cult gems; but I always enjoy a well done entertainment romp, even if it is completely mainstream and I've got to say that after catching this film for no other reason than that there was nothing else on the telly, I'm actually glad there wasn't anything else to watch. On paper, this film really sounds like a recipe for disaster; we've got Bruce Willis playing a hit-man with a heart, a trio of under-worked Hollywood actresses and one of the less popular members of the cast of Friends in a silly comedy directed by the same man who brought us 'Sgt. Bilko'...but thankfully, the movie is more than the sum of it's parts and despite more than a few problems; comes together as a fine whole. The plot follows a struggling dentist with a bitch wife, who gets a new neighbour in the form of Jimmy 'The Tulip' Tudeski; a man wanted by several members of society's seedy underbelly. This propels the hapless dentist into a compromising situation when his wife decides that it would be a good idea to shop the hit-man to the relevant people for a 'finder's fee'! Despite a few plotting errors, Jonathon Lynn manages to keep the laughs coming and while a lot of the film revolves around ideas that have been seen before; many of these are put to use in clever ways, the funniest of which being the meeting between our hit-man and a young lady named Jill. The film works better as a comedy than as a thriller, but Lynn doesn't forget his story and the plot features a number of unexpected twists and turns that manage to somehow keep the audience wanting more while making them laugh at the same time. The cast list is strong, with Bruce Willis doing well in a comedic role and getting good feedback from the surprisingly funny Mathew Perry. Having not seen a lot Friends, I can't say how similar his character here is; but he plays the rat in a cage role well. The support cast includes a number of faces including Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollack and the state trooper from Dumb and Dumber. Only Natasha Henstridge looks like a spare wheel in her rather undemanding role. The Whole Nine Yards was given a needless sequel four years later, and while this film isn't good enough to make me want to go out of my way to catch that; it's certainly good enough for a single viewing.</fullReview>

All the characters are great, and the story is excellent, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. I was really surprised by how funny Matt Perry was, even though he did overdo it at times, and it had quite a few cool twists and turns as well!, plus I was really surprised by the cool ending, I knew Oz was going to stay alive, but that's not the way I thought it was going to happen. All the characters were very likable, however Rosanna Arquette and her accent seriously got on my nerves!. I was laughing quite a bit throughout this film, and I thought it was well made and written as well, plus Perry and Henstridge had very good chemistry together. I am looking forward to the sequel, even though I heard it was really bad, and I must say I was quite surprised on how good this movie was, plus Matthew Perry added some great slapstick humor in my opinion. This is a clever mobster Comedy that's very funny, with fun performances all around and a really cool ending!, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great. Jonathan Lynn does a great job here, with solid camera work and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Actingis wonderful!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious was damn cool, had great chemistry with Perry and Peet, had his usual wonderful charisma, had some cool lines, seemed to be enjoying himself, had an unpredictable character, as he was just perfect for this part!. (Willis Rules!!!!!!!).Matthew Perry is surprisingly funny here, he had me cracking up a lot, and only at times did he over do it, he had a likable charm, and had good chemistry with Henstridge and Willis. Rosanna Arquette annoyed the crap out of me here, especially with her god awful accent, granted she played her role well, but i was begging for her to get waxed. Michael Clarke Duncan does what he has to do very well, he had presence, and had a cool character i liked him. Natasha Henstridge is stunningly gorgeous, and did excellent with what she had to do, and also had good chemistry with Perry!, she is also very sexy. Amanda Peet is very cute and was funny, she was energetic and quite likable!,the scenes with her and Willis were great. Kevin Pollak is OK here, but his accent was terrible and he didn't have much to do. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a lame comedy about a hit-man (Bruce Willis) who buddy-buddies with his next-door neighbor, a dentist (Chandler), to predictable results. It has a few brief inspired moments, but they're far apart and even then don't deliver all they should. It borrows its style from "There's Something About Mary" (and at least it's got an R-rating) but isn't as funny.The acting is OK. Willis is basically on cruise control doing his typical steely-blue-eyes glare while Perry is the put-upon Gen X loser who says the words "like" and "umm" a lot and talks like the cast of "Clueless." He's basically Chandler again, only there's no Joey to bounce the jokes off of. The script must have gone like this: BRUCE WILLIS stares a lot.BRUCE WILLIS: Hi, I'm a hit-man let's be friends.MATTHEW PERRY: Could I BE any more uncomfortable and put-upon? BRUCE WILLIS stares at Matthew Perry some more.The End.I guess it made a bit of a splash when it came out because a sequel was released a couple years later - fortunately it flopped and we won't have to endure "The Whole Eleven Yards and Six Inches" any time soon.2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies don't get more Canadian than this... when they're American.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always nice to see Hollywood giving us Canadians a break now and then. The truth being said, the typical American Hollywood stereotype writer always picks on the average Canadian in many unfunny puns found in some films and TV shows. However with this one, I believe Matt Perry had his fair share of contribution to the screenplay.The Whole Nine Yards is a well written (Mitchell Kapner), well directed (Jonathan Lynn) film that takes place in Montreal, Québec. And if you didn't know that they're in Canada, I suggest you stop reading this review right now. Matthew Perry plays a poor, struggling dentist named Nick (nicknamed Oz) who has a tempering wife (Rosanna Arquette) who treats him horribly. He doesn't have the choice to divorce or he'll be even more broke due to paying off her father's debt. Then a new neighbour moves in next door and Oz discovers that he is Jimmy "The Tulip" Teduski (Bruce Willis), a famous hit-man who has killed seventeen people and just got out of prison as he's paid his debt to society. While Oz acts natural of his discovery, Jimmy seems to be threatening him. Jimmy then hits on Oz's wife and his wife tells him to go to Chicago to tell the mob about Jimmy's escape. Little does Nick know that he is being set up. The mob boss he meets up with is named Janni Pytor Gogolak (Kevin Pollack) and he is teamed up with Jimmy's wife, Cynthia Teduski (Natasha Henstridge) who Oz falls in love with instantly. Michael Clarke Duncan plays one of Jimmy's fellow hit men named Frankie Figs as at this part of the film, he has to baby-sit Oz until they meet up with Jimmy back in Canada. Oz's dental assistant (Amanda Peet) eventually gets caught in the revolving fish net known as the world of contract killing (Believe me, Collateral kept it simple). Meanwhile, Oz's wife hires her own hit-man to kill him who is later revealed as someone more important... watch the film yourself. Tag you're it.The film has many trivial points that would impress anyone from Canada or here in Ottawa. For one, as a die-hard-core Ottawa Senators fan, I only noticed Matthew Perry's shirt instantly; the one when he is mowing his lawn and its sports the Senators logo on it. This impresses. Also, Natasha Henstridge is Canadian along with one or two other actors with smaller roles. And how can we forget Perry in all this? Along with Dan Aykroyd, Paul Anka, Tom Green, and Alanis Morrisette, Matthew Perry probably falls as one of the most successful famous people to spring out of good 'ole Ottawa. Matthew Perry is even more impressive during NHL playoff season when he advertises for tickets here in Ottawa on TV and on radio and comes to most of the games. It's people as true as him that really care about where they're from.Overall, The Whole Nine Yards is a perfect Comedy with action and crime. From Molotov Cocktails to nude chicks with guns, this film satisfies the crime fans. Trust me it's "crime world" enough. Many slapstick jokes are here and there (it's more of a barrage of non-stop humor) as Kapner comically directs the film. However, the quality of quantity rule applies here, as sometimes the film may seem not funny enough yet you still laugh enough. The ending is a perfect twist you wouldn't expect however you don't know when the film is exactly going to end. The acting is top-notch from an ensemble of great actors, especially noted by Perry. There's nothing better than putting tons of jazz music to ease the many moods of this film.With 2000 as an unstable year, The Whole Nine Yards is one of the year's best. It's five years later and I still don't understand the title. I've still yet to see the sequel, The Whole Ten Yards however I don't understand how the hell they put Kevin Pollack in there again due to his result in this one. When the movie hits $6.99 at Blockbuster, I'll pick it up (should be at that price by now)."Life's a comedy. It's all in the execution." This is by all means not an overstatement.My Rating: 8/10 Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The whole nine yards' is a pretty funny film, don't get me wrong but like any other comedy, it still has its flaws. First glance at the cast you think ' oh yes, this'll be a winner!' Bruce Willis is perhaps not an expert in the comedy genre but then you see Mattew Perry there and you might think that it may actually be quite good because there's someone there to back up Willis. Both actors provide good acting in their roles and are well supported by some others such as Perry's characters wife. The thing I found with 'The whole nine yards' was that when it was funny, it was hilarious and when it wasn't any where near what it should be doing (making me laugh) it was terrible. I think this should have been a more 'escapism' comedy genre like 'Rat Race' which was a free for all, out and out farce and was great but with an actor like Willis, there has to be some sort of half decent plot involved and that is one involving hit men. If you haven't turned your brain off expecting laughs all along the way, there is actually a half clever plot involving an assassination but chances are, you'll find it very confusing on first viewing at least. I'd say rent this or wait for it to come onto the TV because it isn't the sort of film that I'd expect MANY people to enjoy several times.</fullReview>

Here again we have the tale of an Average Joe/ Everyman type, who, through a set of quirky and bizarre circumstances, finds himself, totally against his own will and better judgment, knee-deep in mob-centered activities.The film's chief strength, beyond the uniqueness of its French Canadian setting, rests in the cleverly convoluted plot writer Mitchell Kapner and director Jonathan Lynn have concocted centered around a Montreal dentist named Oz whose life takes a decidedly dramatic turn when a hit-man-turned-informer known as Jimmy `The Tulip' Tedeski moves in next door. This happenstance sets in motion an amazing roller coaster ride for Oz as he becomes enmeshed in internecine squabbles between assorted gangster hit men, marital entanglements involving himself and Jimmy's beautiful wife and burgeoning true love.Unfortunately, the weakness of the film also rests in its screenplay whose humor is often too broad, too self-conscious and too reliant on conventional double takes - particularly on the part of the understandably befuddled and flabbergasted Oz - to be truly funny. There is no denying the fact that the film does generate an impressive amount of raucous energy ? but without the wit necessary to bring out the subtle nuances of the material, the movie ends up tiring us out long before the midpoint of its 100-minute long running time.The acting, too, seems rather uneven. As Oz, Matthew Perry tries hard to nail down the part, but he simply lacks the charisma necessary to pull off a role of this magnitude. He ends up delivering a one-note performance consisting mainly of non-stop dithering. And how long ago was it that Rosanna Arquette once seemed to be a fine actress? As in most of her recent performances, she simply relies on superficial mannerisms to build her character ? that of Oz's utterly amoral (and unconvincingly French-accented) wife whose villainy must be a crucial element in the film's overall credibility. She seems to be playacting rather than truly exploring the subtle depths of her character. Even comedy requires an edge and this Arquette will not (or perhaps cannot) provide.On the positive side, Amanda Peel provides spunk and energy as a neophyte `hit woman' who literally salivates at the thought of meeting her `hero,' the world-renowned Jimmy `The Tulip.' Which brings us to the real quality element of `The Whole Nine Yards' - Bruce Willis' first-rate interpretation of the killer-next-door. In a performance of sustained multi-leveled complexity, Willis provides the perfect combination of sly devilishness, steely-eyed seriousness and understated affability essential to making Jimmy a truly likeable comic villain. Willis really seems to be having the time of his life in this role. Unfortunately, thanks to an overall lack of originality in the film's conception and a script that seems less humorous than it might have been, the same cannot be said for the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, you wanna talk about one horrible movie. This is it. If you want to waste 8 dollars for a night of no fun, waste it on this. This is possible Willis' worst movie to date. I hated it, it was so incredibly bad that I wanted to walk out. The lame comedy got so old, and tired so fast. Perry's jumpy Jim Carrey-wannabe attitude made me sick. I can't say anything positive about this movie. And the fact that they brought nudity into the movie made it even worse. You can't bring something into a movie that doesn't belong in that movie. And, you can't mix crime, romance, and comedy in one. It doesn't work. The love story was also pathetic. The fact that Perry and Henstridge fell in love within the first 10 minutes of meeting eachother was stupid, especially that they actually felt it. This movie was a HUGE waste of time for me. Pollak and Willis, two very good actors, should have never acted in this horrible display of a movie. I give it 2 stars(just because they set a car on fire, thats the only positive thing, heh).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. It had great potential, considering the cast and the director. But I feel its biggest downfall was the script, which I think tried to combine the comic elements and thriller/suspense stuff way too much. The dark side was too dark to match the laughs. This film couldn't decide what it wanted to be -- funny or tense/scary, and by the end I had nearly forgotten about any of the plot twists. I felt this was too contrived. Nice acting, but otherwise a huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with zero expectations, but I walked out grateful that I gave it a chance. It had interesting camera work, good characterizations, and just some genuinely funny moments. What really made the movie for me though was Amanda Peet. Her goofy but lovable dental assistant-wannabe-hit woman was great, but it was her beauty that really impressed me. She is just pretty in that gawky, girl next door sort of way and I like it, so much so that I'm pondering actually watching Jack and Jill on the WB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is agonizingly dull stuff. But what else do we expect from Lynn, whose career has been almost all about character-based comedies? He'd used all of his best ideas well before this.For this to work, you need an actor who can stake out a stance, and hold his ground. Woody ("Sleeper")and Chevy ("Fletch")can handle these parts...parts that require playing in that space between the movie and the audience. Scratch out Perry - he just doesn't have the arsenal. The bright spot, of course, is Willis, who DOES know how to mark off and patrol his territory when playing it strictly 'within the movie'. His timing is always on the money. This is far beneath him, though - he could have done this in his sleep. But at least he had Peet to give him sustenance - she seems to be a capable understudy.</fullReview>

In fact, the movie makes me wanna puke, the characters, the plot, the way it´s built up- it´s all very fake(and sweet). Definite candidate for the leader of the top 100 most fake movies ever. I´m a big Mathew fan but even that won´t make me watch it again. And comedy, please, only just some very lame jokes(actually to think of the movie as a comedy is a big comedy of its own).Basically it´s one of those movies you spend an hour and a half watching and later discover yourself thinking that you could have spent the time much, much more productively, that is if you don´t fall asleep in the mean time:)I think I´ve seen enough Jonathan Lynn movies for a decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now what is anyone's motivation here? Can someone help me figure it out? Gangster Michael Clarke Duncan betrays his co-workers and his organization for his long term friend and colleague, Bruce Willis. He stands by Bruce when everyone else is against him, he puts everything he has on the line to help him, and he proves that he's willing to kill and die, without a second thought, for him.Annoying dentist Matthew Perry, on the other hand, knows Willis for one day and is already willing to sell him out to the people who want to kill him. He has sex with Bruce's wife, which of course is considered an immediate death penalty offense to anyone in that world. He also proves, beyond a doubt that, if a minimal amount of pressure is applied, he'd be willing to tell all he knows to anyone who would listen. Whether it would be the FBI, other gangsters or a jury of his peers, if they intimidate him, Matthew will doubtlessly betray Bruce.So, of the long term true and loyal friend and fellow contract killer, or the whiny dentist who he just met and who immediately proves himself to be a multi-level rat, which one do you think Bruce Willis shoots, in order to save the other? This film is worthwhile for Roseanne Arquette's over the top, barely recognizable performance. I didn't even realize she was in the movie until the closing credits, and then I had to think for a minute before I figured out which character she played. Amanda Peet as the topless, gun wielding hit-woman wanna be also shouldn't be missed. However, you might wish that Kevin Pollack had gone to dental school, instead of taking up acting and torturing us with that grating, excruciating pseudo-lisp. Could a character like this ever actually rise to a position of power in a criminal organization? Wouldn't the other wiseguys laugh hysterically, or lose their lunches, the first time he opened his mouth, and eventually whack him just to shut him up?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like this hardly ever matter. They don't question the medium, or even try to do something mildly new in game they try to play. They come from a serial production industry, damaged in some way that every new product comes a little bit more colourless and flawed than the previous one. This one has still some colour and it still is mildly fun to watch, but it already sounds worn out.The two elements that make it work are a relatively engaging plot, and Bruce Willis, who makes the thing move on.-the script is based around an idea of characters who are clueless about what's happening beyond their reduced control. We, spectators, also don't know much about what's going on, and part of the comedy exists in us finding out twists and unknown facts of the plot. I've seen recently a close construction, with a higher refinement, in the Coens' 'burn after reading'; still, it's not very clever overall, it picks a theme which is very dear to me, a kind of detective story applied to comedy, but it doesn't go beyond the limitations of a simple fun empty game; -Bruce Willis is the second element. He is really great, an actor who makes the transition between the skills what the masses will appreciate in a 'star' and the material that builds great actors. He is always exploring new paths, he is not a genius, but he really has skills, and a good range. He has a natural comedy talent, and to my taste, he is much more effective than his peer Perry, who is much more mechanical and predictable (probably the effects of excessive exposure to television).My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there really isn't that much to say about this movie. It's very enjoyable and has plenty of jokes. Bruce Willis really does a great job as hit-man Jimmy The Tulip, Matthew Perry does his usual funny shtick, and Amanda Peet gets topless, which isn't unusual but always nice.Director Jonathan Lynn, whose 1985 adaptation of Clue is a hilarious underrated comic masterpiece, delivers a fine mob comedy here which you should definitely check out if you're a fan of either of the two main stars, comedies in general, or more precisely other mafia-type funnies such as the Analyze This series or Hugh Grant's Mickey Blue Eyes.I hear the sequel isn't that good. Maybe that's true, won't stop me from watching it though, but you can't really go wrong with this movie which is pretty much a guaranteed good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>all hell breaks lose when a dentist (Perry) realizes that his new neighbor is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), an underworld figure. The movie is somewhat effective in telling its story, basically rides on the performances of Perry who is not bad here, has his moments, and Willis who does a decent enough job. The screenplay is just average, but satisfactory, while everything from the music, cinematography and overall editing and direction is just pretty standard. This is one of those "okay" movies, not bad to pass time by, but your not missing anything too important if you skip this one. IMDb Rating: 6.6. MY Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing gangster comedy, not very funny at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gangster comedy came out in 2000, but I never heard of it until six years later, when I had the opportunity to see it on TV. I took this opportunity, though it wouldn't have been a great loss if I hadn't, as it was a pretty underwhelming experience. (I would probably still know nothing about this film to this day if I didn't know about it coming on TV.) This summer will mark two years since I first saw the film, and I have given it another try. Sometimes, films can improve with a second viewing, but for me, that was not the case with "The Whole Nine Yards", so I highly doubt I will ever be watching it a third time.Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky is an American dentist who currently lives in Montréal, Québec, Canada with his French-Canadian wife, Sophie. Sadly, Sophie is one horrible, self-centred, freeloading woman who makes Oz's life miserable, and he cannot divorce her until he finishes paying off his debts! Things only get worse for the poor dentist when Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, a hit-man from Chicago, moves in next door! The mob now want Tudeski dead for ratting them out, so he is now taking refuge in Montréal, under a new name, Jimmy Jones, but Oz soon figures out who he really is! When Sophie learns about Jimmy and why he's here, she has a new plan, for her own personal gain, of course! She sends Oz to Chicago to tell the mob where to find Jimmy, and he goes after she threatens to make his life even more miserable if he doesn't! After he leaves, Sophie tells Jimmy about why he has gone to Chicago behind his back, as she can make even more money if her husband is killed! Since this movie is a comedy, I was obviously hoping for some good laughs, which I didn't get. The second time I watched it, some parts definitely sparked a smile, and a VERY rare snicker, but none of these scenes are too memorable. When the gags aren't mediocre, they're usually lame, like when Oz throws up. The Sophie character is supposed to be funny, and so is the conflict between the couple, but both are actually pretty annoying, and I felt a little uncomfortable during the scenes involving her. Since it's a mob film, one would also hope for a decent amount of suspense, and there is a bit of that here, but not enough. More than one thing makes the story awkward, including the marriage. Either Sophie hid her true personality very well before they got married, or Oz was just really stupid, and I think a conversation at one point in the film suggests the latter! With all these problems, "The Whole Nine Yards" was a disappointment coming out the year after "Analyze This", a superior gangster comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dentist discovers a notorious hit-man who testified against the mob has moved in next door to him in "The Whole Nine Yards," a 2000 comedy starring Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Roseanna Arquette, Michael Clark Duncan and Natasha Henstridge. Perry is Oz, an unhappily married dentist, whose slutty, greedy wife (Arquette) decides they can grab some money if Oz goes to Chicago and turns Jimmy "The Tulip" Tadeski (Willis) into the men who want him. Reluctantly, Oz goes. As the story continues, everybody is out to kill everybody else, Oz's wife has approached Jimmy to kill Oz, and, failing that, has found someone else to kill him; Oz's pretty dental assistant (Peet) turns out to be more than she appears; and Oz has fallen in love with Jimmy's wife, who is still in Chicago.This is a funny movie with a couple of slapsticky-laugh out loud moments provided by Perry, who is very good as a man entering an insane world that he doesn't know if he can ever escape. Willis is Willis, playing his role as a real cool guy who rarely gives away what he's thinking.The story lags a little bit - it's a good premise that with some script tightening could have been absolutely hilarious. As it is, it's fine entertainment and a great rental.</fullReview>

Most of the comments below focus on lousy acting, particularly a poor French-Canadian accent by Rosanna Arquette. I find these responses harsh because I doubt if anyone could bring life into this script. It is a comedy almost on a subliminal level and too many scenes are played straight as an arrow. There are some love interests to help distract the fact there isn't much to laugh at, and they didn't work for the most part either. Some of those scenes contained very cliched lines, I felt bad the actors had to say them! On the good side, it was a treat to see a movie set in Montreal and Amanda Peet is marvelous to look at.

		<fullReview>Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky is a dentist who used to practice with his father-in-law in Chicago before the father-in-law got in trouble gambling. After the father-in-law's death, Oz was still responsible for the man's gambling debts, so as much as he wants to divorce his wife, he can't. Oz and his wife have moved to Montreal (she is French-Canadian), and their new neighbor turns out to be Jimmy the Tulip, who was a Chicago hit man. This presents Oz with an opportunity: he can have his wife killed. Oz's wife, however, wants her husband to return to Chicago to take advantage of the fact that there is a contract out on Jimmy's life (her reasons, of course, are different than we are initially led to believe). Oz does not intend to follow through, but to please his wife he makes it look as if he is going to do business with Janni Gogolak. Unfortunately, Janni's goons get to Oz and put the pressure on him to go along with them. An added complication: Jimmy's wife (who Jimmy wants dead, since divorce to him is a sin) falls for Oz. From here, things get very confusing. The simplest way to say it is that at some point in the movie, every major character except Oz wants at least one other major character dead, and most of them want more than one dead but appear to keep changing their minds about which one (or ones). In other words, no one is to be trusted, and those who appear to be on one person's side may not be five minutes later. The results are hilarious, and quite violent. This movie has lots of good acting performances, but the standout actor is Michael Clarke Duncan, as Frankie, one of Janni's goons. He goes from thoroughly evil to humorously evil to teddy bear and back, and gives us a very likeable character. All the major actors from Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis on down gave us worthwhile performances, and it's hard to single out anyone else. Amanda Peet, as Oz's receptionist, certainly made a wonderful effort. She seemed so nice but kept changing her personality, though somehow she was always likeable. Rosanna Arquette's French accent was a distraction for me, but she was deliciously evil.In addition to the violence and the low morals of most characters, there were some sexual scenes. How much nudity there was I'm not certain because what I saw was edited, but in one funny scene Peet's nakedness is a distraction allowing certain people to be killed or at least temporarily put out of action.The music was quite good, much of it real, traditional jazz. I especially liked the music used for one scene in Oz's office near the end.I had a good time.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Clarke Duncan, Amanda Peet, and Kevin Pollack are all great here. The humor is well-crafted and very funny.There is action, violence, sexual situations (Amanda Peet...mmm) and of course, loads of humor. I was in stitches. The film is really funny all by itself, and did not really need a sequel (films like this usually don't have sequels) but I still cannot wait to see THE WHOLE TEN YARDS now that I have seen this. The plot is constantly twisting, and it is more of a funnier version of WILD THINGS. This is a cross between a gangster movie and a comedy. Very well done...4/5.</fullReview>

It's a lousy story full of unconvincing characters. Amanda Peet is quite charming though, and her smile (and breasts) pulls this one up to 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standardized and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being of a depressingly standardized form of American comedy, "The Whole Nine Yards" offers very few new laughs and is painfully predictable. The story is a pretty good one to start with, but is flattened quite effectively by a dull dialogue, stereotypic characters (bar one) and an awfully miscast Rosanna Arquette. Kevin Pollack as the gangster boss Gogolak is also a great mistake - not in the least intimidating and when introduced, a real bore to watch. The only refreshing detail is the completely unexpected character development that Amanda Peet performs, which raises the grade a bit and provides the only lasting impression once the credits roll. On the whole, its a slightly less than average movie that could have been a lot more with a bit more imaginative writing.</fullReview>

This movie was clearly written by a committee of producers. I knew it would be formulaic and silly, but it falls short of the mark for even a housebound snow-day movie. Yeesh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great ensemble acting (with the exception of Roseanna Arquette), standout performances by Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis, as well as an Oscar-caliber performance by Amanda Peet highlight this expertly written, extremely funny black comedy. This one had me guessing until almost the last frame. A warning to those easily offended. This movie has some pretty graphic killing, very strong language and extensive above the waist nudity by Amanda Peet. In fact, Amanda Peet deserves special recognition for her absolute lack of embarrassment during her nude scenes. I haven't seen such an unselfconscious display since Matilda May in LIFEFORCE. Nevertheless, it is to Peet's great credit that she transcends being a collection of luscious body parts and creates a truly memorable character. I just can't get over how engaging Amanda Peet and Bruce Willis were, considering the amorality of their characters. SOME LIKE IT HOT wasn't appreciated at the time of its release, either. It wasn't nominated for any Academy Awards. Now it isconsidered by the AFI to be the best comedy ever made. I hope a similar fate awaits THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. This movie ROCKS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterically funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Whole Nine Yards is one of those rare occurrences - a comedy tackling a somewhat darker subject (hitmen, in this case) and still managing to actually be funny. And it is unbelievably funny.Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist living in Montreal with his wife and her mother, both of whom are after nothing more than money. So when Jimmy the Tulip (Bruce Willis), a hitman hiding out from a Chicago gang whose leader he killed shows up next door, Sophie Oseransky (Rosanna Arquette) suggests that her husband go to Chicago, rat Jimmy out, and see if he can collect a finder's fee. But she really wants him dead, so as she as he leaves, she pays a visit to Jimmy and tells him the whole story. Fortunately, Jimmy has a plan too - he's going to let Oz rat him out, and lay in wait for the gang to come after him. However, the whole thing gets significantly more tangled along the way.The Whole Nine Yards is incredibly funny from start to finish, with a great neurotic performance from Matthew Perry (even if it's identical to all his others) and terrific comedic/straight performances from Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan. The plot even works well.I give The Whole Nine Yards three and a half stars. It's a terrific comedy, and a great role for Bruce Willis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is what some may think when seeing the commercials and they are right, man this one was original. The story never was anywhere near to predictability, on the contrary, it was totally unpredictable. The comic scenes were from OK to good and the acting was great.Bruce Willis is of course the main man here and he does his job good, you never quite know what The Tulip is up to. Matthew Perry of course brings his clumsy comic stuff into the movie with bit of slapstick and he does it like in Friends. Then we have Amanda Peet, who is pretty funny also, especially when the goofy laugh comes up when she is meeting the Tulip. A big surprise for me was Natasha Henstidge who was good also. She has really come a long way from the alien sexmachine in Species, over the love interest of van Damme in Maximum Risk back to the sexmachine in the cheap bad and soooooo bad sequel Species 2. Then I thought, well that career is over, but here she is, alongside one of the best paid and most famous actors of this time Mr. Willis (although they don't have a scene together). Well there are only two left now and that is the big dude and Rosanna Arquette. The latter one was extremely annoying, pathetic and stupid (as intended to be (GOOD JOB) and the first one was just a sidekick kind of guy who also did a good job.All in all, good acting, good story, good to OK jokes well it's undeniable and unavoidable:8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low brow, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some comedies have universal appeal. This isn't one of them. That is not to say it isn't funny and entertaining, because it is. However, it takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy it. There are two facets to the humor. The first is the physical comedy of Matthew Perry, which is mostly pratfall humor. I enjoy such slapstick if it doesn't go overboard (like when he bangs his head on the steering wheel; the first time was funny the second time was overkill) but mostly Perry stays on the funny side of fatuous.The second facet was situational comedy where everyone was put in peculiar situations and forced to make decisions about how to behave. This was the stronger element of the film and though the dialogue was often weak, the situations were droll and often produced hysterical results.The directing by Jonathan Lynn was straightforward, giving Perry wide latitude on shaping his character and much of the comedy. From what I understand, Perry was improvising about half the time, which clearly gave the film a comedic boost.The acting was generally good. Bruce Willis plays the straight man as a contract killer with a sense of humor. Willis is always understated in his comedy roles, which was perfect considering Perry's antics. Mostly Bruce just looked tough and smirked a lot. Matthew Perry was full of energy and spontaneity. He tended to go overboard at times, but he produced a lot of great sight gags and frenetic humor, which more than compensated for his excesses. Michael Clarke Duncan once again makes a tough guy affable. I always enjoy his work. Natasha Henstridge took her role far too seriously, playing it more like a gangland drama than the comedy it was. Amanda Peet's main purpose in this film was to take her top off and create a distraction. In that regard, she succeeded nicely. Rounding out the cast was Rosanna Arquette, whose French accent was terrible, but she was amusingly nasty in the villain role.Overall, this was a good comedy for people who enjoy inane low brow humor. I am one of those people so I gave it a 7/10. However, for those looking for a snappy plot and intelligent dialogue, this film will probably disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Comedy About Contract Killers (so far) This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whole Nine Yards is the story of a nebbishy dentist (Matthew Perry) whose new next door neighbor is a hitman-turned-informant (Bruce Willis). This was a very funny movie once it got going. The first half hour was somewhat slow and I think that Kevin Pollak's entire character was very half baked and dumb. The ensemble is excellent especially Michael Clarke Duncan having a great time as another mob hitman. Jonathan Lynn's comedies have never really struck me as hilarious, I was not a big fan of either Greedy or My Cousin Vinny, but he has made a winner here. Although I am a huge fan of Matthew Perry's Friends role, I found him a tad grating at times here, but still very funny. Bruce Willis underplays nicely but the star of the show is Amanda Peet. The lively, funny newcomer throws herself into a scene-stealing role, hell a MOVIE-STEALING role. She is bright funny, likable and talented. This is a very funny movie and it outpaces the underworld comedies of last year Mickey Blue Eyes and Analyze This. It is a must for Bruce Willis or Matthew Perry devotees as well.</fullReview>

The one thing that scared me about this movie was some of the violence, especially the fight between Frankie (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Oz (Matthew Perry) when Oz first got to his hotel room. I was kind of surprised when I discovered that Frankie was sitting in Oz's hotel room waiting for him. To me, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) looked very beautiful in everything she wore, especially the dress she wore when she first showed up in the film.

Back when this movie was released, the mafia theme was hotter than ever for movies and television shows thanks to the success of the HBO show THE "The Sopranos". Several movies about or involving the mob were released, none of which were extraordinarily good. However, out of all the mob themed movies that came out during that time, this is the best one. While THE WHOLE NINE YARDS isn't exactly a perfect comedy by any standards, it has some funny moments and the cast are good in their respective roles. Highlights include the scenes with Harland Williams.</fullReview>

Obviously Michael Clarke Duncan, perfect in ARMAGEDDON (opposite Bruce Willis) and excellent in THE GREEN MILE (a part that Bruce Willis recommended him for) must have signed on to this p.o.s (the editors won't let me spell it out but you get it) out of some sort of obligation to the Willis family. And, oh yes, any film that relies on Mathew Perry running into glass doors for laughs should have a contract put on it before the film gets released on the public. And if this is the kind of product that we can see from Hollywood jobs going to Canada, then the book business will be reaching new heights very, VERY soon.</fullReview>

Even if I did, there's still the sight of Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry - the latter's considerably better on "Friends" than he is here, although this is still better than "Almost Heroes"; the former can be funny, but not here (nor on "Friends," his guest appearance Emmy notwithstanding - he was better on "Moonlighting").Natasha Henstridge is okay, but Michael Clarke Duncan does better in his second movie alongside Bruno - and it's impossible for longterm Rosanna Arquette fans like myself to see her in this movie without wincing in embarrassment (OK, it's a comedy, but she's playing a caricature regardless - and that accent...oh dear. Maybe she didn't care much for the role either). "The Whole Nine Yards" does have one redeeming feature; Amanda Peet's funny, adorable performance as Jill (interesting name, given "Jack &amp; Jill"), Perry's receptionist with assassin aspirations. There isn't much movie to steal, but she runs with it. (And as they say in America - and it must be said - she's hot.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whole Nine Yards registers a personal foul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Perry plays a dentist who finds that his new next-door neighbor is Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). What to do, what to do. Henpecked by his sexy, meanspirited wife (Rosanna Arquette), Oz (Perry) travels from his Canadian home to Chicago to find out if there's a finder's fee for The Tulip, who's on the lam from some ornery mobsters (led by a ineffectual Kevin Pollak). And it's there where he runs into Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). And you can kind of see where it all goes from here.Oh sure, they try to make the plot complicated, but if you have the IQ of a gnat (as well as the attention span), chances are you'll be correctly predicting scenes well before they arrive. The plot is essentially contrived to the max, with carbon-copy characters that are buoyed only by the actors' performances. It's a comedy, to be sure, but it's simply not a very good one. This isn't a non-stop laughter kind of movie - it does have its good lines, but they're about as frequent as an on-key Rosanne rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.Perry is amazingly miscast as Oz the Dentist; he's bland, uninspiring, and practically melts into the background. For a dentist whose first scene has him showing off his dazzling smile, he hardly ever smiles the whole rest of the movie! (And yes, this IS a comedy!). By contrast, Willis effectively underplays his role as the itinerant mobster. Unlike Stallone, Schwarzenegger, et al, Willis is perfectly willing to shed his tough-guy-as-hero image to play other roles. He takes on supporting roles, he takes on self-deprecating roles, and he does it all with style and verve. Willis can even get his point across while hardly raising his voice above a whisper - try THAT, Stallone (see Over the Top)!Now, if you're a guy, you'll be happy to know there are plenty of hot women in here, and one even gets partially naked. And the men all have guns and talk tough - except for Oz, of course. (It's kind of like Mickey Blue Eyes, except without the effortless wit of Hugh Grant.)Despite the billing, it's Willis' show all the way. He's not a nice guy - he's a KILLER! - but despite his foibles, he's still the man in charge. Perry, on the other hand, is a weenie, but he can't even play one effectively. I found him to be boring and rather annoying. (Note to Matthew - GET A NEW AGENT! You need to be in ensemble movies; you're definitely not the leading man type.) So the biggest virtue of this movie is the performance of Willis - if you're a fan of his work, you'll enjoy his playful sendup of his own tough-guy characters.</fullReview>

I bothered to watch it because I always think that the humour of Perry is so-so, worth trying even if it's average. He may be an one-trick pony (in terms of comic style and acting) but he has potential to be funny. Sadly this film is almost totally without laughs, giggles or even jokes that are amusing. The plot is OK if you leave it at the tagline idea of `hitman lives next door'. However developed to go anywhere it becomes awful and tiresome, after yet another `twist' I started to flag and I got the impression that, with an extra 20 minutes, the script would have had everybody trying to kill everyone body else for no good reasons (oh, hang on ? it did).The dark tone doesn't work either. At first I thought it didn't work because it was tasteless to make a comedy with such killing in it ? then I remembered Grosse Point Blank (for example), which had a similar theme but used the tone well. Here the marriage of dumb, crowd pleasing slapstick, and hitmen, doesn't work at all. The material isn't well enough written and isn't good enough to work ? how can you easily marry pratfalls with blacker humour? Here, you can't.The film's solution to the weak material seems to be to throw well known faces at it in the hope that some of them add weight and value to the film. Perry tries hard but his usual sarcastic `Chandler' shtick has been given a slapstick element that doesn't suit him ? the result is that he can't manage to carry even one good joke. Willis looks comfortable but he is let down by the material. On the whole his delivery is good but he simply doesn't have any good lines to do. Throwing faces such as Duncan, Pollack, Arquette, Peet and Henstridge at the film distracted me from how little I was laughing but, after a while, I only noticed how poorly used the majority of these were.Overall I wanted to enjoy this film and was in the mood to do so, however, after the first hour went by without a laugh to speak of, I realised that this was quite a lacklustre comedy. It had a real good professional gloss on it to try and give it shine, and plenty of stars to fill the void, but ultimately the material simply isn't very good. I'd like to think the sequel will recognise this and really work on the gags, sadly I suspect it will simply retread what has gone before.</fullReview>
