		<shortDescription>bland sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Originality,' is, almost by definition, a one-time thing. In 1997, the original `Men in Black' struck a nerve with movie audiences by showing that even a big budget blockbuster, heavily loaded down with state-of-the-art, computer-generated special effects, could still manage to seem light on its feet. The makers of that film pulled off this feat of gravitational legerdemain by coming up with a concept and a script overflowing with creativity, wit, imagination and a cachet of `hipness' to go along with its tone of anarchic playfulness.Well, five years have passed and we now have `Men in Black II' to confirm what most of us suspected all along: that works that rely on `uniqueness' as their prime selling point are rarely ever able to duplicate their success a second time around. Five years can be a lifetime in pop culture and what seemed `cool' one summer can appear decidedly `old hat' the next. Without that aura of cutting edge newness that defined the original, `Men in Black II' seems like just another loud, over-the-top summertime blockbuster.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back playing Jay and Kay, agents for the government's top secret organization whose job it is to monitor the activities of the thousands of aliens who have secretly infiltrated earth's societies and to help protect the planet from any possible threat from interstellar space. Smith and Jones still appear to be quite comfortable in their roles and they are aided by Lara Flynn Boyle, as Serleena, the baddest alien this side of Darth Vader, and Rip Torn, delightful as Zed, the slightly cracked head of the Men in Black agency.Although the special effects in this film are, as one would expect in this day and age, astonishing and virtually seamless, the same can definitely NOT be said for the film's screenplay. The story moves along at a fairly fast clip, but it rarely makes us laugh. In fact, the script comes across as undisciplined nonsense, lacking both logic and coherence. Unlike in the earlier film, we get the sense that literally everything here has been placed at the service of the special effects. There's an awful lot of running and bouncing around but rarely to any point or purpose. Indeed, we end up feeling at the end somehow more exhausted and drained than exhilarated and euphoric. It would appear that director Barry Sonnenfeld thought that if he could just keep the thing MOVING we wouldn't notice that he had nothing new to offer in this retread. It doesn't work. In fact, if `Men in Black II' shows us anything, it is that just because something MOVES doesn't mean that it can't bore us at the same time. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hasty 'grab-as-much-money-as-you-can' job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that I normally like movies with Tommy Lee Jones and / or Will Smith in them. They certainly don't belong to the enormous group of average and unnoticeable actors, but have some kind of style and presence that I really can appreciate. But I'm afraid that's about the best thing I can say about them right now, because what they did in this movie was nothing but a hasty 'grab-as-much-money-as-you-can' job and I really don't like to see that."Men in Black II" starts four years later from where the first one ended. Kay has given up life as an agent and has returned to civilian life, working in a postal office, while Jay has continued to work for the 'Men in Black'. While investigating what seems to be a routine crime, Jay uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by Serleena, an evil Kylothian monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. With their headquarters under siege and time running out, Jay must convince Kay, who no longer remembers anything of his time with the MIB, to rejoin the agency so they can save the Earth from being destroyed completely.I admit that some of the special effects were nice to watch, but even that didn't always convince me. Some of the aliens were small masterpieces, others however seemed like a hasty job, unfinished by the people of the computer graphics department. The only possible explanation for that might be that they wanted to save enough money so the profit rate would be even larger. And the computer animations weren't the only one to suffer from that problem. The script writers didn't come up with any new things either. All they did was to repeat what worked in the first movie. It even seems like they didn't have the time to come up with a new and decent plot.And yet not everything was that bad. The humor for instance worked, not always perfectly but it worked. Jokes like "It came with a black dude, but it kept being pulled over" when they talk about the automatic pilot in the Mercedes were funny. I even liked that dog singing on the front seat of the car, but overall it just wasn't enough to save the entire movie. No, if you are looking for a spectacular new movie that is full of great acting, a great story and some excellent computer animations, than you'll be very disappointed by this one. It just seems like they threw it together in a couple of weeks and that's why I can only give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge step down from the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are almost inherently inferior to their original films. The reason that a sequel is ever made is because the original film was a huge success and therefore people want to see more, but at the same time have developed high expectations from the original film, expectations which are rarely if ever completely fulfilled. In my opinion, every sequel has a right not to live up to the original that it followed, but Men In Black II abuses the privilege almost as much as Austin Powers has already done twice so far. Roger Ebert makes an interesting comment in his review of Men In Black II, stating that the original was so enormously successful because it was unexpected and we had not seen anything like it, while the second one is a rehash of the original, and now we HAVE seen something like it. The expected result is that, like the two Austin Powers sequels, what we have here is little more than an extension of the same jokes that we saw in the original film.The entire cast has come back, of course, since this is guaranteed to be a hugely popular film (although at the same time guaranteed to be an artistic failure), and we also see a few more introductions to the cast of actors and artists with flailing careers like Lara Flynn Boyle and even Michael Jackson, who embarrasses himself in the film by playing the part of someone desperately trying to secure himself a position as one of the Men In Black (`I can be Agent M! Pleeeeeeeeeease???'). Naturally, everything that got a laugh in the original film is milked to death here, although not entirely without effect. I thought it was really funny when K blows off Jeebs' head (feeding off of one of the more amusing scenes from the original during J's introduction to the aliens amongst whom he lives), and J asks him how he knew that Jeebs' head would grow back if his memory had not been restored, and K replies, `It grows back?' Not very creative, but certainly amusing.The movie has its strong points, I am not saying that it was a stone-faced bore, but the problem is that it completely feeds off of whatever was successful about the original film. There is virtually nothing creative presented in this film, it is much talkier and drier than the original and doesn't seem to have a personality of its own. MIB followed an alien disguised as a redneck named Edgar as he tries to get his hands on a galaxy that is small enough to fit on a cat's collar. In the second film, we not only have a charm on a bracelet that is the most sought-after item in the film, but we also catch a couple of overly brief glances at some tiny populations of life forms that are able to fit into an airport locker but are still not able to secure themselves a larger part in this film, which chooses instead to entertain us with a talking dog. How's that again? Why is it that there were so many interesting creatures in the original film but this one gives us a quick glimpse of some fascinating creatures but then tries to distract us with the talking (and sometimes singing) antics of a tiny dog, which had just the right size role in the original film?Things like this and the fact that the movie had nothing new to add to the Men In Black story bring the quality of MIIB way down, leaving it to tag along behind its predecessor like an annoying little sister. We already know there is going to be a Men In Black III (hey, if they made a second sequel after the ridiculous Austin Powers 2?), so we can only hope that the producers and director will take a little more time in deciding how to entertain us and what kinds of life forms to focus on, because this was entirely overlooked in this sequel. Even the enormously sexy Boyle was not comfortable on her role and therefore unconvincing as an alien villain in disguise (indeed, it was more convincing that the writers were so unconfident in their script that they felt the need to gloss it over with a sexy villain than it was that she was a threat to the MIB), and Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones had little to nothing to work with in their roles. There is still something left to be salvaged in the Men In Black story. Like the story for Hollow Man, there are nearly endless possibilities, but they were unfortunately largely ignored in this film. At least it's all uphill from here?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most forced, joyless comedy ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one rule when making a successful sequel. That is, that the sequel has has to be head and shoulders above its predecessor to be considered good at all. It has to be fresh. The key to making a good comedy is to make the humor seem effortless enough so that the audience can enjoy it without having to be told what is funny (this is why laugh-tracks on sitcoms are the worst idea ever). The key to creating a good plot is to give it time to develop, and to let the audience enjoy its twists and turns, whether they be good or bad.&lt;Warning: Possible spoilers ahead&gt;Sadly, Men in Black II accomplishes none of these. Aliens come to earth, threaten to destroy it, yada yada yada, MIB has to figure out what's going on before the earth is destroyed, yada yada yada, big guns, alien explodes at the end, just in the nick of time, after being hit by the big guns. Which of the movies am I describing? Both of them. Far from being fresh, this sequel is exactly the same as the original.As for the humor... there was humor? Simply put, this movie had its moments. Unfortunately, they were few and far between, and, in any case, significantly less interesting than the continual clashing of personalities in the first movie. This was due to the simple fact that in MIB II, Agents Jay and Kay acted identically.As for the plot, throughout the film, the characters were supposed to be hunting down clues to the location of the light. Instead of getting the feeling that I was watching the characters unlock a mystery, I get the feeling that I'm watching a bratty teenager and his crotchety uncle following a scavenger hunt to... who cares. The film never conveys a sense of importance to the audience about what they are looking for, or why this thing is so important. Not only that, but this wafer thin plot is crumpled into an 88 minute timeframe, leaving, well, a mess.Maybe the problem is that everybody involved was so determined to make a good movie, that every idea from the past five years ended up getting forced into one movie. Or, everybody involved in the movie was so determined to get a big fat payday, that they didn't care about how crappy their movie turned out. There. That one sounds more reasonable.I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. Not the worst movie ever, but definitely not worth my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Weak Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As funny as the original MIB was, the sequel proves that the same old thing can get very old and very tired very quickly. I mean, how often can you really find it funny to watch an alien grow its head back after having it shot off? This was a cute gag in the original (and I think we only saw it happen once if I remember correctly.) In this one, it happens over and over again. HEY! AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY! That's the basic problem with this movie. It doesn't seem to have a lot to differentiate it from the first one, with the result that it's just not that interesting.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents "Jay" and "Kay" respectively, and here was one element of the story that might have made this a fun adventure if it had been developed. "Kay" is retired as this movie opens, and he's been "neuralized" - his memory of having been an MIB agent has been wiped clean. If the story had focussed more on "Kay" and his attempts at re-integrating into the MIB agency, I think this might have been a very funny movie. But "Kay's" re-integration just seems to happen far too easily, and for the most part the focus of the movie is on Smith's "Jay." The problem with that is that I just feel Jones is better suited to the whole MIB persona, and I felt Smith quickly became tiresome without Jones balancing him more fully. (And Frank the dog - another of Jay's "partners" - just didn't cut it. I really wanted that dog to get eaten by the big worm or something. A very irritating character, in my opinion.)My advice: stick with the original.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First time they were making fun, now they're making money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved "Men in black". I really, really, really loved it. It was definitely one of the wittiest, craziest and the most successful movies of the late 90's. Movie history had never seen such an incredibly silly, senseless and irresistible scifi action comedy before it. Every minute of "Men in black" was marvelous fun. I would almost have to call it a masterpiece, in its own genre that is. Therefore I was looking forward for the sequel and when the wait of five years finally ended the theater called me. Unfortunately I didn't get exactly what I was after. When someone tells you a really hilarious joke you naturally laugh at it. When someone tells you precisely the same joke again it's no longer that funny. This was the case. "Men in black II" just seemed like it's a remake of the first flick. There was nothing new, nothing fresh, and Tommy Lee Jones acted just like he's simply tired and fed up with his character and he's in only because of the huge paycheck. Even the script was somewhat confusing. Of course this movie was very watchable and it was filled with wonderful moments and fabulous ideas here and there but altogether it wasn't so good anymore. Still, go to theaters and by all means watch "Men in black II" if you liked the first one. Maybe you'll like this one too. All I can say is, if the sequel is ten times worse but still ok, then how good can the original possibly be...? Think of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same, but just as fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Not as wildly enjoyable as the first, but makes a terrific sequel. Summer movie sequels are usually the victims of the "sequelness". Most sequels to big blockbuster hits tend to simply repeat the success of the first film, and simply recycle the formula of its predecessor. MEN IN BLACK II (or simply MIIB) is no exception. It practically repeats the formula of the first film: Aliens are out again, J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back as partners to fight against it and the whole lot. The formula is copied, but the same cannot be said about the rest of the film. There are new rabbits in this same bag of tricks. Although most innovations are of special effects, MIIB provides some new fun moments in a somewhat formula approach.Like said, MIIB returns Smith and Jones as the dynamic duo out to stop an alien, a creature called the Kylothian, who takes the form of a lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), who, guess what? Trying to take over the world. of course. This is nothing new in comparison. It's mostly just a retread of the previous film. But few of these "been there, done that" sequels are fun in a different way. This one is, and it's actually surprisingly entertaining. The new script by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro contains a number of effective puns which elevates the humor from other formula sequels.Of course, there are new and colorful special effects from mostly the same crew of the original film. The effects by effects house Industrial Light &amp; Magic and make-up artist Rick Baker are still outlandish and imaginative. They still give us a host of aliens and creatures that we can feast our eyes upon. Not much imagination went to the storyline and characters, but a lot was certainly invested upon the effects and visuals. Kudos for director Barry Sonnenfeld, production designer Bo Welch and much of the special effects crew for providing a colorful atmosphere that bursts with liveliness in an otherwise formulaic episode of summer sequel season. It's the same old thing, but with new fun.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Planet. New Scum.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''Men in Black II'' is not fantastic as the first movie, but it is a good and entertaining movie to be watched anyway.It is so funny to see Michael Jackson as one of the aliens from MIB! (I mean, let's be honest, the guy doesn't even need a make up to look like one!)One of the things I need to complain about this movie, is the fact that we don't have the same good explanations as the first one. A lot of errors are present, like the lack of story about Laura's life explaining why she is the light of Zartha, if she is K's daughter with Lauranna or not,as well as Johnny Knoxville's character just disappearing without reason.It has been five years since Agent K returned to the comforts of a civilian life working as a mail man. Agent J, for the other hand, continues to work for the Men in Black, but he never has success finding a good partner to stay with him: all of them hated the life of being an agent and were neuralized. Serleena, an evil Kylothian alien, disguises herself as a Victoria Secrets' model while planning to find the Light of Zartha, that will put the galaxy in danger once again. Now J will need the help of agent K once again to save the planet, specially because he is the only one who knows where the Light of Zartha is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sequel About Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black II (2002)* 1/2 (out of 4) Boring and bland sequel has Earth coming under attack from a dangerous alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) so Agent Jay (Will Smith) must bring Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) out of retirement. I really wasn't sure what to expect out of this sequel but the very, very, very last thing I did expect was something boring. I must admit that I was really shocked to see how bland and downright bad this movie was as sadly it's yet another example of a sequel to a good movie being about nothing more than money. The original film was smart, clever and funny in regards to the subject matter but this sequel just lacks any sort of originality and it's really nothing more than a copy of the original. What's so sad is that there could have been so many good and interesting story ideas but sadly we're just given a copy of the first film and we even get many of the same jokes. It's funny to think that the jokes worked so well the first time but here they're just annoying and unfunny. I think the majority of the blame has to go towards the screenplay, which is just a mess. It's never funny, never makes too much sense and sadly it's clear that very little went into it. The performances outside of Tommy Lee Jones really aren't all that memorable either. Lara Flynn Boyle has no problems looking sexy but her character is bland. Rip Torn isn't given much to do and the same is true for Johnny Knoxville and Rosario Dawson. The incredibly bad love story with Dawson is just an embarrassment. MEN IN BLACK II even features some very poor CGI effects and in the end this is just a rather worthless movie that isn't worth the trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men in Black 2 is a disappointing sequel, still has some good parts though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Men in Black is a great movie, still funny and entertaining after all these years. Men in Black 2 was a disappointment back then, and it's still significantly weaker than the first one. Let's start with the positives, I like the villain, Serleena, sure, she's no giant bug in an Edgar-suit and is way more serious and just not funny, but safe to say, she is a whole lot sexier, and I liked her sort of vine-like, worm form. Johnny Knoxville is also a villain here, a two-headed moron henchman, he's actually pretty good, but he's hardly in it, and he just disappears completely at one point, with no explanation given, he's just gone, seems the director forgot all about him. The movie tries a lot of stuff, has numerous aliens and situations, and much of it, like the creatures in the locker, doesn't work at all. The worms are back, and I hate them, they are obnoxious, loud and unfunny, but, they are nowhere near as annoying a Frank, sorry, I can't stand this character, he was only in the first movie for a few, brief minutes, here, he's J's new partner for way longer than I would've wanted, he talks and talks and talks, and nothing of what he says is even marginally funny. But of course K returns, and the chemistry feels a little off, Smith and Jones are still good, but something felt a little strange, I think the script or inspired ad-libbing just wasn't there when they made the movie. The special effects are pretty good, although a few moments have jarring mistakes, like Jeff breaking out from the ground and knocks J to the side, then the next shot, he's completely gone. Rosario Dawson is no Linda Fiorentino, she's just there, nothing funny to do, she definitely is significant to the plot, but I didn't care about her character. David Cross is very funny and gets the most laughs in his brief appearance, Patrick Warburton is fun as well and the subway sequence is excellent. I wish the final battle was, you know, exciting or awesome, but it isn't. Men in Black 2 is not a good sequel, it has some entertaining parts, but the movie is a disappointment, I hope the third movie will rekindle the franchise and be worthy of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really impressed by the first MIB movie with its good story and the terrific special effects to carry it. This movie is no exception. Everything that made the first movie great is back, plus they delve deeper into things they should have done in the first movie. The Pug for one and the inter-workings of the MIB to name two. Will shines in his role, Tommy knocks me out with his dead pan delivery and together they blow me away, but the best thing is from giving the Pug more screen time. His singing is the funniest thing since ever. Tony Shalhoub and Rip Torn also highlight the movie; without them, there is no movie. Rosario Dawson highlights the movie as an innocent ingenue very well too. Lara Flynn-Boyle does nasty very well; I had a dirty little smirk when she said she could rule the world with the right size of mammaries (being an alien as she was and using some computer graphics would have made for an even more interesting scene ala The Benny Hill Show). The plot is great with its expectations and then twist to the end. Definitely a worth-see !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men In Black II Welcome back Mr. Jones Mr. Smith we missed you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black ended with Agent Jay mind wiping Agent Kay so that he can live a happy life or so we think. Men In Black II opens up with Jay chasing down an alien that lives in the NYC subway system and is a threat to the city. Jay has in time become one of their best agents but he has a habit of mind wiping his partners because they don't want to be MIB agents anymore so he's kind of tainted in that respect. During all of this an alien named Serleena arrives on Earth Serleena is played to the hilt by Laura Flynn Boyle and she hams it up nicely her sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville could use a little bit of work but he does OK. Serleena arrives and takes over MIB HQ it seems she's looking for a object of great power that KAy hid long ago under the protection of a guardian. Jay Escapes and he realizes MIB's only chance is to bring Kay back to the fold restore his memories and defeat Serleena. When Tommy Lee Jones makes his appearance the movie picks up considerably and it's very nicely understood that while Smith is the maniacal energy and the comedic relief Tommy Lee Jone simply is the heart of Men In Black while Rip Torn as Zed is the Soul. Without these three actors Men In BLack would not be as good there is something about the dynamic here that the three bring to the table. My only complaint as with the first was that it was too short Sonnifeld is a gifted directer and Knows how to make great movies with the MIB series he really should think about lengthen the running time so the movie does not feel as rushed and we can enjoy it as it unfolds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than the first, Men in Black II is what all blockbuster movies should be: full of talent, full of substance, full of fun and full of effects.Talent. Look at that list of actors. The talent is there. Johnny Knoxville CAN act, people! He's not just that guy from Jackass! And Danny Elfman for the score? Music plays a very important role in any movie. Elfman plays his part beautifully and his timing is always spot on.Substance. This is a love story, on several levels. Some would all this a buddy comedy, but it's really a love story. A buddy love story to use the term coined by Blake Snyder in his book Saving the Cat. It's about J and K and and their trials and tribulations of their relationship as partners.Fun. There is fun even in dramas, the sarcastic kind of fun, but still fun, and in this comedy, there is never a moment that isn't fun in some way. That's just how Barry Sonnenfeld rolls. If it's not the delivery of a line, it's what you see and Sonnenfeld is really good and keeping a lot of humor in the background. (I think it's so you have to watch his movies more than once ;)...)Effects. It's Men in Black 2! Everything MiB had and more, the sequel's effects are kicked up more than a few notches. There are more aliens, bigger guns, crazier creatures and all the marbles in the universe are still being thrown together to bring the audience a bigger better show.This movie gets a ten from me. It deserves a ten. It was masterfully written and performed. Read that book by Blake Snyder, then watch this movie a few times and you'll see that this is one of the greats.And I am a movie snob.SIDENOTE: Really good special features on the 2-Disc set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first went into the movie theater thinking this was going to be a let down movie, because usually sequals to excellent movies are. But my opinion turned around when they started the movie. It had excellent gags and the chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith was ten times better then the first one. The evil villian in the movie was more villianous compared to Edgar the Bug in the first movie. The special effects were amazing. This sequel should become a example on how a blockbuster movie can return in a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On one of the coolest looking sequels ever, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones find themselves back in action as secret agents J and K, protecting the Earth from the scum of the Universe. Just like part 1, the theme song ("Black Suits Coming") makes you move your feet, the effects are top notch (the miniature galaxy inside the locker, the subway-eating worm, the post office workers etc.), and the general feel just make you smile. Sure, its nothing too deep or too inventive as the first one ? but it's a solid, entertaining sequel with magnificent eye-candy nonetheless and a hell of a time at theaters (first) and on DVD (later). "Let me see you nod your heads (black suits coming)"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very very refreshing action comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write review about this movie because some one make bad impression about this movie telling "it is bad sequel of 1st".It is not true at all.1st thing MIB II is action-comedy movie it is not serious action movie.It is movie for those who want to chill or refresh for 1 hour watching a light hearted action-comedy movie and i give guarantee about this movie that it truly refresh you.Great visual effects,great story,great direction &amp; great sense of humor.When i personally feel bad then i watch this movie and after watching this movie i feel energetic &amp; light,a smile flows in my face.And now 2nd those who gives rating this movie compare to 1st i want to tell them there is not any thing permanent in this word .One day this whole world destroy.So instead of finding bug in this movie they should enjoy movie because movies are made for entertainment.Ist part is a great ,2nd part is also great.I personally love MIB II very much.I have no memory how many times i watched this movie.So guys forget review ,rating or critics all crap thing,just watch this movie and enjoy a great sci-fi action-comedy movie ever build.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a sequel is hard to do. But, with Men in Black 2 I think they did very well. With the first Men in Black, most of it is telling Will Smith "J" about the aliens and what the men in black do which is funny and unexpected. In MIB 2 I like the story line and how they brought "K" back. I think the critics need to laugh and realize what they are watching a movie that is not real but, funny and you can go in all different directions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II is a science fiction movie about the conspiracy theory of the men in black. The conspiracy theorist believe that these Men in black go around and take care of Americas most secret problems. In men in black II Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return for the sequel of Men in Black. Like in the first movie they also confront aliens again for a second and far worst problem. Men in Black II is a great movie for three outstanding reasons the pace, the action and of course the acting.The pace for Men in Black II is very quick for an hour and twenty eight minute movie. From start to finish you will never catch your self checking your watch to see how much time is left in this movie. When the pace of the movie starts to slow, to build story, you still aren't caught in boring monologue for what seems like hours. The director does a great job of jumping seamlessly from a serious moment to a more comical moment. A lot of the excitement of the action is created because of the fantastic job done by the director with the pace.Thanks to the pace of the movie the action becomes more exciting. The action in this movie is just fantastic. We have all seen the movies that the action is way to far over the top, with destruction of whole cities and even whole countries. Well this movie has very believable action. The fight sciences between the men in black and the aliens is marvelous you never get bored with long elaborately choreographed fights. Now the icing on the cake, the acting. The acting in this movie is bar none. With big names like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones how could the acting be bad. Will Smith has featured in great films like Focus, Independence day, I am Legend and I Robot. Will Smith is a proved actor who is at it again in this movie. Will Smiths costar is no slouch either Tommy Lee Jones has also stared in his own hand full of great movies like No Country for Old Men and Space Cowboys. So as you can see this movie has a very star studded cast.The question is would I recommend this movie? Yes I would definitely recommend this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone because of the great pace the movie has that creates great action scene and even helps great actors seem like even better actors. If you have not seen this movie I recommend you stop what you are doing right now and go watch it you will get a laugh and you will learn of a whole new world of secrets kept hidden by the men in black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rushed, under-written, patronizing cash-in, "Men in Black II" is an ugly, hasty continuation with almost none of the first film's creativity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels. Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they will take an original and build off of its foundation, expanding the story and further developing the characters. Sometimes they will take us to new places, and explore new themes. Show us a world beyond the confines of the original. Prove to us that they are necessary to tell an on-going story with the characters we loved so much in the first film. Sometimes they are worth it.Yeah, and sometimes, they are lazy. Sometimes they're astonishingly under-written and over-reliant on clichés and other cheap storytelling tactics. Sometimes they feel soulless and patronizing to the audience. Sometimes they show themselves to be the unneeded cash-in's that they sometimes are.I think you can tell which of those two categories this sequel falls into. (Hint, it sure ain't the first!)"Men in Black II" is one of the more disappointing follow-ups to an outstanding original film that I've ever seen. While the creative team of Barry Sonnenfeld directing with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones starring returns, that lightning-in-a-bottle tragically isn't able to be re-captured here. Instead, we are treated to 89 minutes of contrived nonsense and an endless parade of references to the original film, in a sequel that truly feels written by committee in a studio-executive's office in order to be as unoffensive and broad as possible.Smith returns as Agent J. While investigating an alien murder in New York City, J comes to realize that the perpetrator in this case (plant- creature Serleena, portrayed by Lara Flynn Boyle in an over-sexualized performance) has ties to his former partner, "Agent K." (Tommy Lee Jones) J is forced to bring K out of retirement and undo the process that wiped his memories, before they re- team to scour the city searching for clues to stop Serleena's dastardly plans.On paper that may not sound too bad, but in execution, it's pretty dreadful.The acting is far more mixed in this film. Smith is decent as J, but he feels very flat and forced in comparison to the original film. Like his heart isn't quite in it. The same goes for Jones, who barely seems to be putting effort in. Lara Flynn Boyle is very underwhelming as our villain, and the fact that she's always over-sexualized (introduced to us in a scene that includes a closeup of her rear-end as she walks around in high heels and lingerie) does make the entire film feel sort of misogynistic. Supporting roles by Rosario Dawson, Rip Torn and Johnny Knoxville are generally decent, but the lack of development does harm everyone.The direction is also a lot more sedated this time around. Sonnenfeld doesn't seem to be having as much fun behind the camera, and the script by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro (and probably a team of uncredited ghost-writers and script-doctors to dumb it down for the studio) is far too safe in terms of keeping the development limited and the storytelling far too over-easy to grasp. This is far too simplistic a film for it's own good- it's just J and K driving around, stopping at a location for an action set-piece and a 30 second vignette to further the story... repeated over and over again.There's also a far bigger reliant on effects this time around, it seems, which hurts the film quite a bit. Although I will admit that the visual effects and creature design by Rick Baker are well-done.And the big problem is the lack of development for any characters, and the fact that the film over-simplifies and regresses many of them. Agent J is made into an oafish jerk by the script (we find out he's been neauralyzing MIB agents at random, and he seems very closed and cold to his colleagues) and K's back-story and return is very poorly thrown together. He's just sort of a nasty grumpy guy in this film, and the duo's back-and-forth feels more contrived and mean-spirited. New characters are given no development beyond one-dimensional character quirks, so you don't care about anyone.There really isn't too much else to say about this film. It's far from the worst sequel I've seen, but it's still a radically disappointing follow up to the excellent original. The only silver linings here are the fact that it was able to re-introduce Agent K (though poorly) and the fact that the third film, released 10 years later, was actually pretty darned good and made up for this severe misstep.As it stands, "Men in Black II" gets and underwhelming 4 out of 10. If you're a fan of the first film, sure... give it a shot. But don't expect much of anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few minutes into MIIB, as Will Smith is riding a giant alien worm called Geoff through the New York subway, my 8-year-old son announced 'That looks so obviously fake'. I couldn't really argue: the CGI effects were extremely shoddy.That's probably because MIIB is essentially a money-making exercise, a rushed mess with a half-arsed script full of lame jokes, cruddy performances (Johnny Knoxville is seriously irritating), and some of the most unsubtle product placement imaginable. It seems as though no-one could give a damn about the standard of film-making, just so long as a profit was made at the box-office and everyone involved received a big fat paycheck.It really is no wonder MIIIB has only just been made, a whole decade after this debacle saw the light of day: they were leaving it long enough for people to forget just how embarrassingly bad this second film really was before going ahead with a third.</fullReview>

(rosario dawson, the adventures of pluto nash) who is the special thing they are looking for, send her in space.this one is awesome. i loved the first one and i think this surpasses this one by a ton. i hope they don't make a third though cuz than it would just be bad. go see it. you wont regret it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II may have benefited from the "Batman" franchise in that it doesn't try to juggle too many new elements. L (Linda Florentio in MIB I) doesn't appear here which is sad, given the development of the character in the MIB Animated Series, but probably also fortunate as screen time is devoted to enriching Jay and Kay, the new villian---Lara Flynn Boyle, wonderfully funny as the Victoria Secret's model look-alike alien (favorite scene--her chomping down on a huge burger that any working model would consider a meal for a week)---and adding TWO love interests (the gorgeous Rosario Dawson being the one we see, alas, not frequently enough). Frank and the worms steal scene after scene and Rip Torn's Zed gets a great mano-a-non-mano scene with Boyle's alien. The scripts fun, the direction keeps things moving and Tommy Lee Jones again anchors the whole with his earnest, deadpan delivery. And, oh, yeah, Will Smith's good, too (though, he is allowed too much time to do physical schtick towards the end that undercuts the maturation of his character as witnessed prior to Jones' return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seemed that the film relied on gags from the first film instead of going for new, more original jokes (the noisy cricket, "last suit" line, among others). Even the new jokes seemed that they were meant to be the jokes of the moment, just way too many pop culture references. In 5 years, will anyone get these jokes? Probably, but they won't be nearly as funny as they are now. Overall, MiB2 seems just like a sequel for the sake of making more money. The scantily clad villian, pop culture jokes, and fairly unoriginal plot all add up to one thing: godd for the short term but no long term lasting power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a great fan of the 1st movie, I was really looking forward to this movie. My biggest complaints:there was too much advertising, too many "behind-the-scenes", too many trailers showing way too many of the oh so few funny scenes of the movie. I think I knew the entire plot and saw every funny scene before I even hit the cinema .I was so disappointed as I sat there and couldn't laugh to the same quirky comments that had flashing across my tv screen for the last 2 months. The special effects were awesome as always but the plot was so lacking that it nothing could make up for it. The love story was quaint but every saw the ending a mile before it happened. I love Will Smith but this movie can only rate above Wild Wild West in his repertoire. Next time: skip the specials, skip the million trailers - people will come because they love the actors and the fx. Maybe I'll be there too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>B- Will Smith, Johnny Knoxville, Tommy Lee Jones, Rosario Dawson, and even Michael Jackson (ha-ha-ha?) were up to par here. It took a second viewing for me to really appreciate the film, but it really is a straight comedy spliced of course with sci-fi. The "worm guys" are probably the best characters in the whole movie, being so outspoken and well portrayed. The story is a brisk one, but it delivers nicely in my opinion. Perhaps many felt the empty feeling when the movie was over was that the story moves along way too quickly, and I suppose it could've been longer, but it does just fine.The action sequences are generally well done and each has their own bit of quirky comedy, which leads me to the alien designs which once again will definitely aspire a second look or two. One can really get a tone for the film by Danny Elfman's score, considering there is no real emotional strong point in the music; one can technically expect the same from the movie. While the sequel may lack some of the scares and better told mystery, it's still a enjoyable laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels, or the cinematic spawn of Hollywood blockbusters, constitute an entire film genre of their own. The best reunite the entire original cast and crew. Think of the "Lethal Weapon" epics. All the chief characters return in the best sequels. Remember "The Adams Family," "Beverly Hills Cop 2," or "Smokey and the Bandit 2?" Not only do the best sequels raise the emotional stakes, but also they feature an antagonist twice as savvy as the original foe. Look at the James Bond movies, the "Indiana Jones," "Evil Dead," and "Rambo" trilogies. The best sequels take you beyond the original. Consider the "Star Trek" series or the "Back To The Future" trilogy. The worst sequels recycle the original material without imagination. Remember "Beneath the Planet of the Apes," "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure," or "Crocodile Dundee 2?" The worse sequels jettison main characters for lame excuses. Chris Tucker's absence in "Next Friday" is intolerable! The "Rocky" movies killed off secondary characters in each sequel. The worst sequels cannot recapture the spontaneity of the original. Recall "Weekend at Bernie's 2?" The worst sequels usually contain only half of sure-fire elements that sparked the original. Remember "Ghostbusters 2," "Smokey and the Bandit 3," "Beverly Hills Cop 3," "Crocodile Dundee 3," and "Exorcist 2?"The new sequel to "Men In Black" (1997), the numerically specific "Men In Black 2," brings back Will Smith as Agent J, Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K, and their "MiB" boss Zed (Rip Torn of "Freddy Got Fingered") as well as several Dr. Seuss-style extraterrestrial wiseacre worms. The 'Elle' character that Linda Fiorentino played, the morgue attendant who teamed up with Agent J at fadeout, has gone back to the morgue. Agent J has become a "Dirty Harry" of sorts and has a hard time keeping a partner. The predictable follow-the-numbers, up-against-a- deadline, end-of-the-planet screenplay by Robert Gordon of "Galaxy Quest" and Barry Fanaro of "Kingpin" lacks the wit, whimsy, and the wonder of the original "Men In Black." The "X-Files" meets "Dragnet" quality of "Men In Black" doesn't seem as funny as it did five years ago.When the alien villainous Serleena crashes her UFO in Central Park, she takes the shape of a sexy Victoria Secret's model (Laura Flynn Boyle) and threatens the planet with destruction unless she acquires the legendary 'Light of Zartha.' Think of the Medusa with snakes for hair and you've got a good idea what Serleena resembles. Desperately, Zed dispatches J to reactivate K. As Kevin Brown, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has been stacking mail for the U.S. Post Office, since Agent J "neuralized" him in the original. The superb comic chemistry between silly-minded Agent J and sour-pussed Agent K qualifies as the best reason to watch this okay but anemic opus. Director Barry Sonnefeld, who helmed the original "Men In Black," lets nothing --especially storyline--interfere with either the wacky action or his outlandish computer-generated bugs and worms. At 88 trim minutes, "Men In Black 2" knows to quit while it is ahead.</fullReview>

In the story Serleena have ate Scary (Michael Bailey Smith) and had steel his clothes and if Serleena had find the light then it would be the end of the world.

		<shortDescription>truly terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really amazed at how badly this sucked. It was 3/4 an attempt at a Mel Brooks-style parody of the original, and 1/4 an earnest sequel; it was impossible to take the result seriously within its own parameters because you were constantly hearing Sonnenberg screaming at you through the shots "this is a stupid ridiculous piece of nothing which I'm just doing for the dough." You would think that an actor like Tommy Lee Jones wouldn't put up with it; he shoulda just walked off the set. Will Smith apparently thought that his banter would save the film, but he was wrong.The worst kind of sequel: a massive repeat of the original, only much much dumber, without even a decent recreation of the original tone or sense of reality. Successful sequels heighten or deepen the themes of the original - give us Men in Black mythology; give us a new conflict, perhaps a mole within the agency; give us a trip to another planet; give us a more fully developed alien character, instead of aliens-as-one-liners. Edit out the schtick which doesn't serve the plot and isn't funny and which just takes you out of the movie and reminds you that the director thinks it's all just a stupid joke.There was not a single decent moment in the whole stupid thing.This terrible terrible movie isn't even worth the time it took to tell you how stupid it was - but there's an obligation to try to get you the viewing public to save your precious few dollars... you'd get more enjoyment out of burning your money then spending 88 minutes watching this.They should have named this Men in Bleccch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've already seen "Men In Black" and "The 5th Element" then you certainly don't need to see this. They just blended these two movies into a crap smoothie. Absolutely no originality, no flavor, no reason to see this movie unless it's free and you are bedridden. Otherwise, go for a walk and save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good sequel, better than I expected it to be but the first movie is still better than this one. I was disappointed about a few things including the time length. This movie takes place five years after the first movie. Agent J has to bring back Agent K because only K knows about the mysterious "Light" object." They have to prevent the evil Serleena from stealing this object. Some of their allies include the famous worms and the singing Frank the pug. The cast did a great job with their parts. I liked Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the Men in Black dudes. Lara Flynn Boyle did a pretty good job as the wicked Seleena. I also have to give heads up to Johnny Knoxville as he proves that he can act. The music by Danny Elfman is great and appropriate for this movie. The movie has some comedy too. It was nice to crack up here or there. I was displeased at the time length. This movie was way too short for a movie in a genre such as Sci-Fi. Overall, this is a great sequel and I recommend this. I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uninspired film-making at its worst. A completely pointless sequel (or rather scene by scene remake) of the fun original.Watching the film, its painfully evident that none of the people involved seemed to have any fun. The script is a retread of the first film, only weaker. Do the audience really want to see the same story again? Last time the villain was a bug, this time it's a plant.The actors seem very bored (Rosario Dawson is the first person I've seen who can be described as a macguffin - she's got absolutely nothing to do in the entire film), the exception being Will Smith (reduced to doing slapstick) who appears to be so desperate to be having a good time that he overacts in the absurd.The editing sucks. and the effects look real cheap, its hard to believe that this film was made five years after the first one. Rick Baker's make-up work is brilliant from time to time, but still not as impressive as in the original.Moreover, there are other things that help sink the film: All of a sudden, almost everyone seems to be an alien. There are some huge plot (if there is such a thing) holes - like what happened to Knoxville in the last third of the film. There is also an air of racism throughout the film. I can't exactly say why, but it's a feeling I couldn't get rid of.There is one scene in the film that perfectly sums up the whole movie - Jones and Smith being flushed down a huge toilet (yes, it's that bad)...

		<fullReview>When I was 14, I watched a British film called 'Leon the Pig Farmer', a truly awful movie that left me with a strong desire to hurt people, especially those responsible for such tripe. For 7 years, this was top of my 'Worst Ever' list, and I doubted it would ever lose that dubious honour. Then, on a rainy night in Budapest, I went to the cinema with two beautiful girls to watch 'MIB II', and ladies and gentlemen, WE HAVE A NEW WINNER! Without doubt, this was the most terrible thing I have ever seen - and I saw Kathy Bates naked in 'About Schmidt'. I don't say this lightly, as I am definitely a glass-is-half-full kinda guy, always looking for the redeeming feature, but 'MIB II' has none. Anyone who was involved in the making of this movie should be ashamed, as I cannot stress highly enough how dire it is. I am just glad that I paid Hungarian prices to see it &amp; not the extortionate British ones. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually made me sad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, watching this movie did indeed make me sad. Though not because of anything plot-related in this stinking garbage bag of a movie : while the original MIB was camp and entertainingly silly, this movie was so abysmally bad that I was actually depressed after watching it, primarily due to the contemplation that I actually spent money on it. I have seen some stinker sequels in my time, ones that even bypass this movie on the Shame-o-meter, but this one certainly ranks high on the awful level. First off, let's start with Will Smith and how he appears throughout the whole movie like he couldn't even care less about reprising this role. It's like being led by a tour guide through a skull-numbingly boring museum exhibit, with Agent J walking us through the motions of just getting through the movie and getting the experience over with. Tommy Lee Jones shows up, and the producers actually expect us to find some form of amusement or lighthearted surprise that the tables have turned and Smith is now the alien-expert. Whoopie. None of the characters have any appeal whatsoever, none of the alien ideas are innovative or interesting, and experienced actors Smith and Jones look like they'd rather be having reconstructive dental surgery than be in this bomb. The plot is a mish-mash of last-second ideas with a lot of sudden "Oh, by the way, this is happening now"'s thrown in, all the while leaving us to scratch our heads or wonder if there was some advance reading we should have done before seeing it. And why the director thought it would be a good idea to focus on the alien sub-characters from the last movie so deeply I have no idea : JarJar proved that less is better, so the worms and the dog could have given us the same courtesy. Lastly, I know many people think it's funny for some odd and inexplicable reason, but I can only tolerate so much defamation against African-Americans before getting sick, even if it's coming from Will Smith himself : why does Hollywood think it's acceptable to make anti-black jokes? Does Mr. Smith really think it's a good idea to promote the stereotype that blacks are criminals or car thieves? Is he such a desperate sellout? As you can see, I have many, many reasons to feel sad after watching this pathetic film, and if you see it you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I get started on MIB2 let me just say that I liked the first Men in Black movie (***/****) because it was fun and Smith and Jones had good chemistry together. Men in Black 2 is a perfect example of Hollywood's greed. A movie made not to tell a worthwhile story or at least an entertaining one but for the sole reason of putting money in the pockets of everyone involved.I was annoyed enough after being bombarded with so many commercials (ads for the movie, ads for the soundtrack, cross promotional ads with Burger King, Sprint and even Head and Shoulders!) that seemed to play during every commercial break around the time that the movie was released but when I actually got off my lazy butt and saw the movie I was downright p***ed off. I would have been ok with the mass advertising if the movie actually delivered on what it promised but it didn't even come close.The story for MIB2 is tremendously stupid and pointless, it's a balls-less stale rehash of the first movie. The argument from the defender's of this junk is that it's not about the story but it is about entertaining us and making us laugh, the thing is the movie does neither unless you consider asinging dog to be funny which I certainly don't. The action scenes (if you want to call them that) are so dull and been there done that that I found myself begging for them to just be over so I didn't have to suffer anymore.Others flaws included a major character played by Johnny Knoxville pretty much disappears without any explanation of what happened to him and a character who was killed in the first while working at a morgue (played by David Cross) is back without any explanation as a guy who owns a video store (which are both just careless filmmaking which is quite sad considering that this was made by the man who gave us Get Shorty). Oh and let's not forget the blatant product placements in the movie, they actually had a Sprint and a Burger King inside their MIB headquarters! I wonder how a secret agency could remain so secret while acquiring such franchises.The short list of plusses in this movie are even though they seem to have mailed in their performances in this one the chemistry between Smith and Jones was still there and there was a locker bit that was kind of funny.It comes as no suprise to me that this movie had the big first weekend but then dropped and dropped and ended up grossing 50 million less than the original despite all the ads, never underestimate the power of word of mouth. Men in Black 2 is a giant piece of s*** that never should have been made.My Rating: 1/2*/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(My vote: 1 out of 10) I was looking at the votes for this film, and there were 380 that voted 10 out of 10! Incredible! I then went back to see if I could re-cast my 1 out of 10 vote, and apparently I can. So either (a) kids are re-casting their 10's or (b) people associated with the film are re-casting their 10's or (c) there are a lot of gullible movie-goers, or (d) all of the above.I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 not because it was THAT awful, but because of how insulted I felt after watching it. For THIS it took five years to make?! I LOVED the original so much, that even if they had made a halfway decent sequel I would have been fine with it. But this bomb is patronizing, money-guzzling and worst of all, a bore. In some scenes in the original, Tommy Lee Jones comes across as so laid-back he's cool. In this one, he's so laid-back he seems DEAD! Will Smith's smirks wear thin immediately. Barry Sonnenfeld seems to be having fun, but at our expense. He's the guy behind the two Addams Family movies, remember? 'Addams Family Values' was a sequel that advanced the characters and plot, and still had fun. What's the deal with the special effects here? They're good, but not state-of-the-art, as they should have been. Serleena's effects were annoyingly bad.This movie takes forever to get going, and when it does, it feels like more of the same, just regurgitated.When I'm done here, I'm going to go put a review down for the original, which I've seen many times, and will give an 8 out of 10 to. It's a shame that at 88 minutes (!), Men in Black II seems too long. And I can't BELIEVE this movie made around $200 million in the U.S.! Hollywood, Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Sonnenfeld are laughing all the way to the bank. We poor suckers...</fullReview>

Essentially this is a kid's movie. But MIB tries to be more. And it fails terribly. I don't understand how any adult mind can be entertained by this stuff. The plot is utterly ridiculous. I would explain in greater detail why it is ridiculous, but I fell asleep during the middle. It saddens me to know that millions of ADULTS will be truly entertained by this movie. The only way to possibly enjoy this movie is to have the mind of a seven year old. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't. See something that will stimulate you.

		<fullReview>It is imperative to state the damage that corporate films like MiB 2 are doing to the value of the American movie. Remember when product placement used to be slightly subtle? Remember when even horrible sequels were trying to be original? (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is the Godfather pt. II compared to Goldmember and Men in Black 2!) Those days are gone. Buried. More and more frequently films are turning out to be manipulative commercials where characters are liscened out to hold products and recite lines like the scientist in Independence Day, smashed against the observation glass of Area 51 with a hypersensitive tentacle wrapped firmly around his throat. Plots are recycled, characters change or are completley done away with, and performances are only there to introduce the next sight gag.Thus is the case with Men in Black 2. Are you really suprised? Did you really expect it to be a good movie? In corporate bedfellow Barry Sonnenfeld's bleak, muddled and watered down remake of first film we are invited to laugh because the other idiots in the theatre are forcing themselves to. It's sad, how much forced laughter can be heard in the theaters these days. Exclamations rather than true displays of emotion, the forced choked laugh is becoming as commonplace as popcorn and projection at Cineplex.In Men in Black 2, the entire production is shoddy and cheap. It dosen't feel like a movie. It feels weak, it feels greedy, it feels insencire and rude. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones don't care if the movie is good or not, they can get off on the fact that the first film was something we had never seen before. At first I thought maybe the story had to be rushed but I am starting to understand that scripts like this one aren't rushed, there is simply no effort put into writing them. The storyline is the vehicle for Will Smith and an increasing number of strange, distant, unfunny sight gags that perplex and disturb rather than bring on belly laughs. Everything about the film sucks, and it sucks so bad that it makes me wonder if there is any saving cinema. All we see is sequels. All we are treated to is unsubtle and desperate product placement and all we can expect is more of the same unless we STOP SEEING THESE MOVIES. IF THESE FILMS MAKE MILLIONS, THEY WILL KEEP MAKING THEM! I implore moviegoers, don't bother with this film. It's a remake of the first movie, it offers nothing original and it is cheap, jumbled and nonscensical just like Austin Powers: Goldmember. I can almost guarantee that Road to Perdition, a film so far from a comedy it hasn't even learned the word, will make you laugh harder than Men in Black 2 will.Do not waste your money on this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better and Worse Than the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black II is one of the truly unique films in that it is both better and worse than the original. I admire the risks taken to make this movie more interesting but at the same time it bombs in some of its overly cute lines and plot-ploys. I laughed heartedly in spots, more than I have in a while, but that other times, I could only shake my head at how dumb and flat some of the one-line moments were. One fascinating directing, script technique that is rarely seen in a comedy is the use of silence, the prolonged pause and the use of facial expressions, and the moment to carry the scene. This approach usually worked in this movie, which I think is saying a lot because it is extremely difficult to pull off successfully most of the time and it takes good acting and directing to do it. There was more tender moments in this movie than the original - better serious, moments. Both actors were great in their acting, acting in the difficult parts where body and facial expression counted more than dialogue. There were times that Wil Smith never completed his lines, but with great success. I would have to say overall, Men In Black II wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining, interesting, took risks, and broke new comedic ground in bringing back real comedy and one-liners that sometimes died, but just as well, were brilliant. A great worthwhile attempt. A must for home video or should I say DVD now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can You Say "Third Rate Cash In"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad but true fact that the majority of sequels are made not to continue any stories, but to cash in on the success of the original. With a film as popular as the original "Men in Black", a sequel of some sort was guaranteed, the only question would be when, and whether it would be any good. Five years later, it's come, and it's terrible."Men in Black II"'s biggest problem is its profound lack of originality. With the exception of a new villain, everything else is the same. There are no new major agent characters, and the explanation for this phenomenon being so is lame. The majority of the jokes are either directly ripped off from the first film or "spin-offs" or "reversals" of those jokes that aren't only incredibly stale, but not even slightly funny. Since no new aliens other than the villains are added, and there is little of the Men in Black headquarters expanded on, there isn't even the wonder of new dazzling summer blockbuster special effects or fun alien characters provided by the first film. The film's just so bland and boring, offering nothing that can't be found (for much cheaper) in an episode of "Men in Black - the cartoon series". When a cartoon shown before the feature and the intro to the film, a mock low-budget cheesy film, are more entertaining than the rest of the film, that's usually a bad sign.Even the actors in "Men in Black II" must have realized this, because they put no effort into their characters. An opportunity for romance between Will Smith's J and a witness to an alien attack lacks both chemistry and screen time. A hinted at reversed dynamic between J and Tommy Lee Jones' K, which (unlike the rest of the rehashed plot details) is somewhat interesting, is totally scrapped, leaving us with the exact same relationship as in the first film. In an unsurprising event, "Jackass"' Johnny Knoxville shows in a lackluster co-starring villain role that not only are his 15 minutes long up, but that nobody even cares who he is if he's not trying to kill himself. Were it not for Lara Flynn Boyle's Serleena, there'd be no laughs or interesting moments in the movie at all."Men in Black II" is just sad. The first movie wasn't great, but had parts that were enjoyable. This is just a disappointing waste of time and money, which in due time will no doubt influence another, equally disappointing and uninspired "Men in Black III".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an insult to moviegoers. It wastes your time, money, and brain cells on some cheap laughs and a severely unentertaining plot.I, personally, am a big fan of Men in Black. Which is, of course, the reason I went to see the second. My rating is based upon these opinions: [1] The acting was as best that could be done with a script like that. [2] The story was long, blasé, and felt programmed. [3] The characters, new and old, were as full of stuffing as Laura Flynn Boyle's brassiere.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones' agents should receive a good tongue-lashing for letting them act in this "movie". I am sure that if Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones had read the script before signing on, they would have not participated in this joke of a sequel. They probably thought that since MIB was such a success, surely the writers would come up with a great sequel and make them more money! Jodie Foster had good intuition when ducking out Hannibal, the so-so follow-up to Silence of the Lambs; too bad these actors didn't do the same with their sequel.Needless to say, I was more than disappointed. This distasteful fad of constant sequels and prequels going around in Hollywood is obnoxious and unnecessary. They are outnumbering and overpowering the originals popping up occasionally, which are doomed to be played down by the press. These excuses for motion pictures are getting increasingly abundant, and are injuring our vision between good movie and bad movie. I just hope that award shows' sight is a bit clearer.My rating: 2 out of 10 (Not a one only because of the determined acting and very few chuckles it got out of me.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete abomination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, the original "Men in Black" was a lighthearted, entertaining vehicle smoothly carried by the repartee between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. This debacle, however, bears little resemblance to the 1997 crowdpleaser.Let me begin by assuring you that liking the first movie by no means guarantees that you will enjoy MIB 2. That was certainly not the case for me. The pacing was terrible, the plot pathetic, and the jokes are set up in a haphazard, rushed manner, giving the impression that the director was handed a script containing too many jokes, and of a poor quality!, and attempted to cram them all into an 82 minute running time. The original was fresh, and the actors seemed to be having fun, but here Tommy Lee Jones looks depressed, not as part of his character, but as if he is aware of the terrible quality of the production and is merely waiting until he can go home for the day. Will Smith tries his best, but laden with an asinine script and poor direction, he cannot help failing. As other users have commented, the plot is nonsensical and painful. I understand that the plot is secondary in films like this, and in fact am a fairly major Jackie Chan fan, so I honestly would not have minded if everything else had fallen into place. What's more, whereas the original film's humor was almost entirely clean, the sequel finds it necessary to riddle the script with tasteless sex jokes. I'm not a prude, and I did not object to the risque "humor" because it was vulgar, but because it was truly boring.This movie's greatest sin, though, is that it exemplifies all that is wrong with filmmaking today: it is a big budget, overly slick, ultimately cynical and heartless film that plays to the lowest common denominator and laughs all the way to the bank. I'm not knocking populist entertainment, but this piece of filth insults the intelligence and makes one yearn for filmmaking lacking in polish but teeming with heart and wit. Only people willing to pay the admission price to see the trailer for "The Two Towers" (which was infinitely better than MIB 2), have a valid reason to see this dreck. My rating: 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the sequel of course to the hit movie "Men In Black". I gave this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it a five). This movie is short. I mean really, really short. There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the short got more laughs than the movie I think). I went to this movie knowing how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater. There was no time for character development or much story development. In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes. The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat. For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle. Then there is the pug dog. I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones. It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all. Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused. So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored. If they ever make a part three, please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jay and Kay are back to save the world again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years on from the events in 'Men in Black' Agent Jay is an experienced agent who is no longer shocked by the assorted aliens that have made the world their home and Agent Kay is working in a post office totally oblivious to his past life. That is about to change though; Serleena, a shapeshifting alien who has taken the appearance of an underwear model, has arrived on Earth looking for Light of Zartha? of course if she were to get it would be disastrous for Earth. The only agent who knows anything about the Light of Zartha is Kay so Jay must bring him back to MiB so he can be deneuralised, unfortunately Serleena and her associate head there too and manage to take over the facility; Kay will have to go somewhere else to get his memory back. That done he and Kay set about finding the Light and thwarting Serleena's plans.This sequel isn't as good as the original but it still has plenty of laughs as well as some exciting moments. The plot is essentially the same; an alien arrives on Earth to find an object and Jay and Kay must prevent it from finding it and this causing the destruction of Earth. Having the alien disguise itself as an underwear model was funny and Lara Flynn Boyle was suitably sexy in the role; she did however lack the creepiness of 'The Bug' that featured in the original film. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are as good as before as Kay and Jay and it was rather fun to see their roles somewhat reversed. Rosario Dawson was good but somewhat underused as Jay's love interest, and witness to an alien event. Some of the best laughs weren't provided by human characters but by 'Frank the Pug' and the wormlike aliens. For the most part the special effects are pretty good however at times they definitely show their age. Overall this is fun enough; it might not be as good as the first but I'm sure most people who enjoyed that film will also like this? and if you don't it is less than ninety minutes long so you won't waste much time watching it.</fullReview>

Everything that made the first movie great is back, plus they delve deeper into things they should have done in the first movie. The Pug for one and the inter-workings of the MIB to name two. Will shines in his role, Tommy knocks me out with his dead pan delivery and together they blow me away, but the best thing is from giving the Pug more screen time. His singing is the funniest thing since ever. Tony Shalhoub and Rip Torn also highlight the movie; without them, there is no movie. Rosario Dawson highlights the movie as an innocent ingenue very well too. Lara Flynn-Boyle does nasty very well; I had a dirty little smirk when she said she could rule the world with the right size of mammies (being an alien as she was and using some computer graphics would have made for an even more interesting scene Ala The Benny Hill Show). The plot is great with its expectations and then twist to the end. Definitely a worth-see !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Er, where do I begin... probably best to start with the first 'Men in Black' film. It starred Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as two shady government agents who track down and keep an eye on all alien life forms coming and going from our fair green planet. That basically sums up the sequel, too. Not just the plot, but pretty much the entire film.In the first film, an alien with bad intentions crash lands on Earth (happens in Part II as well), the alien takes on human form (check), the alien wants a mythical device to make them all powerful (applicable to both films), if said alien gets their hands on said device then the Earth will be destroyed (yup, MIB2 has that one, too).The first film was awesome. It was funny, charming and basically fun for all the family. The chemistry between wise-crackin' Will Smith and poe-faced Tommy Lee Jones carried it through perfectly. In fact, it's the two leads who make the sequel worth watching. If it wasn't for their on-screen performances, it really wouldn't be worth the effort.It's 'Men in Black by the numbers.' The jokes are good, the performances are good, so if you can excuse the fact that the writers have pretty much taken the script from the first film and churned it out as a sequel, then you should like this outing enough to sit through it. Plus it's short, if that's a bonus. Perhaps the real drawback is that the CGI hasn't held up that well over the years. Almost every (alien-related) scene was done on computers and now you can see the green-screen behind the actors as they do their best to act against nothing.It's another Men in Black film. If you liked the first one and don't care about lazy writing (or perhaps you want to call it 'sticking to what the writers know sells?') then you should like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and Diluted Sequel with Some Cool Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The SFX and also the Makeup by Rick Baker are the Highlights in this Disappointing Sequel to a Surprising Mega-Hit Original. The first Men in Black (1997) captured the Imagination of the Public and the Fascination with X-Files Conspiracies and Space Visitors.The Fact is that Flying Saucer Enthusiast have received No Quarter from the Mainstream Media and have been Mercilessly Ridiculed beginning in the Early 1950's. That Ostracizing is at the Heart of the Comic and the Movies.The Men in Black Movies are based on the Malibu Comics. The Malibu Comic is based on "Real Life" Stories that have been around since the Mid-Fifties in Ufology."MIB II" seems as though it is Running on a Warp-Drive that is so Depleted it is having a Serious Spasmosis. Repeating and Regurgitating Ideas and Jokes Ad Nauseum. While it all Looks Great and is Bright and Colorful, it has a Numbing and Familiar Feel.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are put it Front of all the Glitzy Mayhem and Labor Their Parts until, like the rest of the Film, it just becomes Uninspired, Unfunny, and the whole project is left Hanging by Wires and Bobbing about from Scene to Scene. Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks" (1996) Succeeded in what this one is Trying to Do and Almost Fails, but Not Quite.There is Enough here to Enjoy in a Prefabricated kind of Product Placing Picture and some of the Homages to Ufology and Conspiracy Theories are Welcomed. Peter Graves Satirical TV Show is an Example as is the Video Store Setting.Overall, Recommended for Fans of the First Film who can Tolerate the Sequel being More of the Same but Not as Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty decent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years after the original Oscar-winning "Men in Black", the story continues and the two main protagonists are played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones with Barry Sonnenfeld reprising his position as director. The main antagonist is played by Lara Flynn Boyle this time, a mean tentacle lady, while the good girl is portrayed by Rosario Dawson. About Flynn Boyle, she is fine for the most part, even not as great and memorable as D'Onofrio in the first one. Rosario Dawson felt really forgettable to me. She is basically a non-character for the entire film until the great revelation in the end. But it's really more the fault how the character was written and not Dawson's acting.I have a bit of a problem with the fact that they brought back Lee Jones' character here as a co-lead as it puts a bit of a question mark behind the ending and major parts of the first film in terms of his retirement being the right thing. Still I like him as an actor and that's why I am not too mad about it. "Men in Black 2" had some strong parts and some not so strong. Despite the scenario of the world possibly ending, it is still mostly a comedy with lots of science-fiction and fantasy impact, but never really a dramatic film. Thumbs up here as science fiction comedy is really a challenge and nothing we see that often. About the main antagonist, I found it a bit ridiculous that she could easily gain control over the agency, but still fails in killing the girl and the two agents. So is she really powerful or not?Anyway, as a whole this was a pretty decent watch. I think this film got a lot of unjust criticism because of the mere fact that it is a sequel. It does not feel as new and fresh again, but had this been the first film actually in a slightly altered version involving TLJ's character, then people would have appreciated it more I think. Even without an Oscar win or nomination, I enjoyed the watch. It is also never dragging and it was a good decision to keep it considerably under 90 minutes, actually only 80 if you don't count the credits. Well done for the most part and I will probably also watch the third at some point. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's kind of a let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black was great. It's humor was incredibly clever and it was really fun. The second one on the other hand just kind of failed to deliver. It wasn't horrible or anything, it was just kind of a disappointing sequel. Luckily 10 years later Men in Black 3 redeemed the series, and all was forgiven. Men in Black 2 still had clever jokes, they just weren't as common as the first. Well let's look at the plot. A Kylothian named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) has come to Earth to look for the Light of Zartha and stir up trouble. Agent J (Will Smith) needs help to stop Serleena, due to his habit of memory erasing his partners when they don't meet his standards. The only man capable of J's partnership is the now retired Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). J has to go find K, restore his memory, and stop Serleena. This story should have been more humorous than it was. And don't get me wrong, it had funny moments, many of which were cleverly done. But the first film does it better than this one. If you're curious to see a follow up, then check it out. But if you want a clever comedy, the first and third films just do it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hollywood's worst sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember enjoying - to a degree - the first MEN IN BLACK when I saw it in cinemas back in 1997 when it came out. I never bothered with this sequel, having grown tired of Will Smith's brash persona, but when I saw it advertised on TV I thought I'd check it out. Better late than never, right? Well, no, as it happens. This is an awful sequel in every aspect made with zero intellect and a greedy eye on the purses of movie-goers. It stands as one of Hollywood's worst sequels EVER, jettisoning the first film's originality and fresh feel to offer a storyline that simply copies that of the original movie except with more CGI effects.The first thing noticeable when you watch this film in 2015 is that the CGI effects are AWFUL. Worse even than you'd expect to see in a typical Asylum film. There's barely a single scene without some alien effect or other, and none of them are good, while a lot of them are excruciating. The action scenes that mix in wirework with CGI are the worst of the worst.Otherwise, the film goes through the motions. Smith and Jones are on autopilot and none of their jokes are particularly funny. Lara Flynn Boyle's hammy villain is embarrassing, and the less said about fresh-faced Rosario Dawson, the better (hint: she was much better in SIN CITY). About the only things I liked in this film were the pug - although I'd have liked it better if it hadn't talked - and the Michael Jackson cameo. Everything else is just appalling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie, we return to the world of MIB to follow a crisis where, business as usual, the Earth can be destroyed by aliens who are very angry with us. In the first line of defense is Agent Jay (Will Smith), that we saw in the first movie. Now he is a senior officer with much experience in his work, however, he will need the help of his former partner, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) who is retired and whom the memory has been erased. Its a sequel to the first film, made a few years later and keeping the same actors and director. The script, this time, its signed by Robert Gordon.Like many sequels, this one failed to keep the original movie level. If the first film was a comedy that worked well, this one barely works as comedy, focusing too much on a kind of "re-reading" and "rewriting" of situational and contextual jokes that we saw in the first film. So, who saw the first may not find funny the second one. It's like eating every day the same dinner: sickens and loses joke. Not much to talk about the interpretations of two protagonists: both kept well their characters and, if the film didn't please someone, probably the fault was not theirs but the one who wrote the dialogs and jokes. What saves the film from being a total and complete failure are the massive special effects (they always sell) and the romantic sub-plot associated with Kay's past, who gives some dramatic depth to the story.When we watch the release of a sequel there are always two possible justifications. First: critics loved the first film and this has resulted in awards and notoriety; second: the audience loved the first film and this has resulted in a commercial success, a blockbuster. Personally, I think this sequel was launched with only one objective: to profit at the expenses of those who liked the first film. Its the cinema industry making money as best she knows. It's pity.</fullReview>

It just throws the whole chemistry of the movie off. It still has the MIB style. Once TLJ returns, it recovers somewhat, but the scavenger hunt plot just rambles on. There's really only two things we watch this for; the weird and fun style, and the chemistry between the two leads. The weird stuff is there. For some reason, the chemistry never gets back to the fun that was the first movie. It has to be Agent Kay who just isn't himself for much of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Sequel with a New Villainess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K. It's not the original. Like "Ghostbusters II", you either love it or hate it because it's so different. It jumps right in there with very little explanation of the previous movie's setup or plot. Tommy Lee Jones has gone back to New England and, after being "neuralized", remembers nothing of his previous existence as MIB Agent "K". He is the Postmaster at the local post office and acts like a big, dopey boy scout. He is surrounded by aliens to protect him at work and doesn't even know it. There are all disguised as humans. Agent "J" (Will Smith) must bring him back to fight the evil shape-shifting Kylothian monster who is searching for the powerful "Light of Zartha" left hidden on Earth. Like in the "5th Element" movie, it ends up being a beautiful girl, (Rosario Dawson) and not an object. Once again, the goal is "to conquer the universe", and she kills anyone who gets in her way, just like "Edgar" the bug in the first MIB movie. Laura Flynn Boyle is great as "Serlenna" the hideous plant-octopus creature with giant tentacles. She disguises herself as a "Victoria's Secret" model, of all things! As expected, plenty of carnage and sci-fi violence. Great CGI effects.A fairly good sequel and much funnier than I remember it being. (In this movie, we find out that Oprah is an alien.-Big deal.) It is way too short at only 82 minutes without titles. It leaves me wanting to see more, as The MIB characters are so much fun to watch, in action. Ya gotta love those "alien worms" with that cheesy Mexican accent and "Frank" the excitable talking Pug dog! Look for make-up genius Rick Baker in a brief walk-on as a MIB passport agent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the first film is comparable to 'Ghostbusters' in its likable ability to juggle laughs, character chemistry and visual effects then this machine-tooled sequel is the perfect companion to 'Ghostbusters II' in the way it ruthlessly exploits all the best bits of its predecessor without any of the heart and soul. It's cinematic Polyfilla, existing only to plug a gap in the summer schedule, plodding through the motions with none of the freshness of the original. The plot's the same, most of the jokes are the same, Will Smith is annoying and, to be honest, no one really seems to be trying. It feels like an obligation, and perhaps that's why the third instalment took so long to emerge and was utterly awful when it finally did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Best, it's Just a Lame Sequel to an Awesome Summer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK II is more than a major disappointment. It's a source of never-ending resentment from me. I loved the first film. The studio had no excuse not to bust out with a proper sequel that built upon the awesomeness started in the first movie and expand the universe further. MEN IN BLACK II came out a full five years after the first movie; it was plenty of time to develop a script that would do the franchise justice and keep the audience excited for further adventures with the MiB. But they didn't. MEN IN BLACK II is a blatant cash-grab and would go on to kill the franchise until it was dug out from it's grave for a third film in 2012. As you might remember, the first film ended with Agent K retiring from the agency to return to his normal life with Agent J starting his new life with the MiB. Within a few years, J has risen to become the most respected, hard-working agent with the organization and he has a reputation for growing tired of his partners, neuralyzing them, and sending them home to their normal lives. When a intergalactic threat returns to Earth after decades to continue a search for a powerful?.something?called the Light of Zartha, Zed directs J to the only agent with knowledge of the Light and the evil alien that continues to hunt it down: K or, as he's now known, Kevin Brown. J must re-recruit the organization's best agent and return his memories if he hopes to stop the alien threat before?I'm not sure really. It's never made all that clear.Right, so from the very start we hit a major problem with MEN IN BLACK II: a lazy script. Or maybe the script wasn't lazy and the filmmakers dropped the ball. Regardless whose fault, we never quite know what exactly is going on in this movie. What exactly is the Light of Zartha? Why is it so important? What will Serleena, the movie's lame villain, do with it and how will it help her do whatever it is she wants to do? What danger does the Light of Zartha present to Earth and why? We never get any solid answers to any of this, just vague threats for which we're supposed to fear consequences that we never really learn. With the first movie, it was cut and dry: Edgar the interstellar cockroach wanted to steal the galaxy on Orion's belt for his own evil purposes and Earth was threatened when the galaxy's true owners arrive and demand we hand it over before they blow up the planet. There's no sense of tension if there's no determinable threat. This is exactly why I had completely lost interest in the movie before it even reached the final act.Upon watching MEN IN BLACK II, it was easy to see the thought processes going through the minds of director Barry Sonnenfeld and writers Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro. The first movie was a hit so why not extract the more memorable elements from it and cram it down the audience's throat for 90 minutes. How else can you explain Frank the Pug's over the entire movie? He was a funny little scene in the first movie and now he's joined the MiB, partnered up with Agent J, and singing Ba-Ha Men because?wait for it?he's a dog. Get it?! On that same note, the "worm guys" who were good for a laugh when introducing Agent J to aliens on Earth in the first movie are now back with quadruple the screen time. You see the problem? A lot of MEN IN BLACK II is just a rehashing of the some of the best moments of the original. The whole recruitment angle, while a little fresher with the tables turned and J reintroducing the world of the MiB to K, is just a throwback to the first film. Jack Jeebs, Tony Shalhoub's shady intergalactic arms dealer, returns for some more gags and?you guessed it?more screen time. It's all just more of the same with a more confusing plot.Now that the most aggravating parts of the movie are out of the way, I wish someone could explain to me that a sequel that was released five years after the original?a sequel that was released the same year as SPIDER-MAN with its amazing visuals?has effects on par with the cheesiest cable sci-fi movie. One of the coolest aspects of the first MEN IN BLACK was the perfect mix of practical creature effects and CG. The second installment amps up the CG effects without worrying about how bad they look. There's a scene in the beginning of the movie with Agent J confronting a giant alien worm in the subway tunnels. At some point he is holding on to the worm's back for dear life while careening down the tunnel, and it looks horrible. It was some blatant blue/green screen work that didn't come close to working. Serleena was even worse. In her "human" form, she's a hot Lara Flynn Boyle. In her alien form, she's a mess of vines or tentacles or something and it just doesn't work. Same with Johnny Knoxville's second head. Knoxville is already a weak presence in the movie as Serleena's henchman but a horribly unconvincing second head compounds the lameness.The rest of the movie is just the filmmakers doing their best to appeal to the lowest common denominator: an alien with a scrotum on his chin called, unsurprisingly, a Ballchinian, a toilet gag with Agents J and K being "flushed" out of MiB HQ, and both K and Zed getting moments to shine with crappy wirework and groan-inducing kung-fu. As a movie, MEN IN BLACK II is just lame. As a sequel to one of my beloved summer blockbusters, MEN IN BLACK II is nearly an insult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five years ago, ultra-secret agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) stopped the Earth from being destroyed by the actions of an alien "bug". However, K's memory was erased shortly after, so J's been working alone. After "neuralyzing" his latest partner, J is ordered by MIB chief Zed to investigate the landing of a tiny ship in Central Park. Discovering an evil alien named Serleena has arrived to find "the light of Zartha", Zed tells J to bring K back into the fold...but MIB headquarters is invaded before they can return. K's memory is eventually restored, but another event is revealed: the Light of Zartha will self-destruct unless it leaves the planet by midnight! The performances were pretty good all-around, though making the villain a wannabe lingerie-model was completely unnecessary. There's also a reference to aliens called "ballchinians", who have testicle-like appendages on their chins. Another creature's face resembles a pile of dog manure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffers from the law of Diminishing Returns, but a pretty decent movie nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way maybe I should have not been so hasty in giving Men in Black III such a high score because after watching the previous two I must admit that it really wasn't as good as the earlier movies and in reality suffers from the curse of the sequel, or more accurately, the law of diminishing returns (as it applies to movies that is). This film was funny, and I did enjoy it, but in reality it was nowhere near as good as the first one. However, since this movie was released 8 years after the first (and the third released 10 years after this one) it sort of gives audiences a reprieve so that when they see the next installment, unless they have seen the earlier movies shortly before they see the later one, then it is difficult to make a comparison.As we know from the last one, Agent K has retired and Agent J is now onto his second partner (the girl decided that she didn't like hunting aliens, so she returned to the morgue) and he realises that being a MiB is not all that he expected, so J wipes his mind and sends him on his way. However it turns out that something from K's past has returned, taken over MiB headquarters, and J must now bring K back into the MiB so that they might have a chance at stopping this new evil.I really liked the intro to this movie which had a corny 1950's conspiracy clip along with the really bad effects. There is a reason why they show this clip at the beginning as not only does to serve as a intro to the main action of the movie, but it also plays an important role later on.You may remember that at the end of the first movie, K's memory was wiped so J must find a way of getting it back, and when he does he discovers that the memory they require was also wiped meaning that getting that back is a lot more difficult, however fortunately K had left clues for him to follow, and some of those clues are hilarious (such as the race of aliens that live in a locker in Grand Central Station). Also I must mention that the end of this movie was similar to the end of the first movie where our existence is put into perspective (though they did not do that at the end of the Third movie). I also really liked the world that is encased in a sphere of water. All in all not as funny as the first movie, but much funnier than the third.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So almost everything about the MIB is explored in the first movie. And now what do they decide to do, add more absurdity for the sequel. Nothing about this sequel is memorable despite the bigger budget and better special effects. There is nothing special about this movie and is easily forgetful. This movie is just plain lazy and by throwing in a bunch of more aliens and absurdity they thought it would lead to a better movie. The previous MIB movie was absurd but it didn't go all that overboard with it but this does and not in a good way either. Now I like Tommy Lee Jones in this franchise but it would have been nice if Linda Fiorentino from the first movie played some part in this movie. But she is just mentioned and that is about it. It would have been nice to see a female sidekick at work or something. But replaced by a talking dog. The acting is also corny and so is the whole movie. If you want to see the MIB and other characters acting obnoxious and unprofessional with more aliens and better special effects that doesn't really go anywhere memorable or interesting this might be for you. Another words it's a pretty disappointing sci-fi sequel. Also the acting is very corny and 4.2/10</fullReview>

Top MiB agent J needs to seek out his old, memory warped partner K, now a small town post office employee, and restore his memory to find the light before Serleena gets to it.I honestly don't understand the hate geared toward this movie.

Even with originality in doubt, the movie contains many memorable characters, set pieces, and situational laughs that helps it stand out from the 2000 blockbuster. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones once again ease into the lead roles, while the previous film's small part characters Frank the pug and the Worms enjoy extended roles with mixed results. Lara Flynn Boyle's plastic sexiness looks pretty alien in itself, making the role of the alien morphing bad gal Serleena a good match although it's a shame that Famke Janssen dropped out of the part.A short run time of under ninety minutes really affected the characterization and screen time of supporting characters like Rosario Dawson and Johnny Knoxville, who literally disappeared from the movie after carrying out a mission near the end. Movie had more of the same laughs from the first, although many jokes didn't land for me at all. The whole plot of removing "the light" from the earth was never explained completely leaving the end reveal to give more questions rather than answers. Rick Baker did another phenomenal job designing aliens and creating an otherworldly earth, while the film is highlighted by scenes of K's post MiB life, and spot on imitations of corny 1960's science fiction programs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But A Runner-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first Men in Black, the audience was introduced to new concepts of how life can take on different forms. That people are not always human beings. So either this sequel is trying to still convince us that this idea remains the same or the screenwriters thought that no one remembered what happened five years ago when the first film came out. That's the disappointing part, however, the good part is that most of original elements are kept the same with some different features.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back as the Men in Black, well at least they both are when half of the film is over. That's right, what could've been a great follow up movie from start to finish, ended up being an OK sequel. The story revolves around that Smith needs information from Jones, the problem is that Jones' memory was wiped from the first one. So did the producers of this film think reviving Jones' memory was a new idea? If that was the case, they never should've erased Jones' memory in the first place. There's no logic behind the thinking here.What really makes the first half of the film really silly is how Jones is portrayed. The first Men in Black (1997) was great because Jones came off as a callous, unforgiving mentor and it was funny to see Smith try and figure out what was going on. Now the roles are switched, Smith knows what he's talking about while Jones is lost amongst the clouds. I'll admit there were some funny parts but there weren't enough. In a way, this film could've played as the first one (if the other had never been released). Some of the scenes even resemble previous ones too well. Plus some key things that made the first one funny were left out. For example, the "Noisy Cricket" Smith used, made him fly backward. In this film Jones uses it (more than once) and he doesn't go flying anywhere. Alright, who forget to keep things the same here?What did work in this film are the special effects, the dialog, the music and the last half of this film in general. Since the budget was ramped up on this sequel much of the special effects look even better than of the first one. The creatures are more interesting to look at too. My favorite alien is Jeff the subway worm. Nothing can get scarier than that, especially if you're unfamiliar with Men in Black! The dialog is kept the same as the first one, which is great. Smith still has all the cool funny sayings while Jones has all the intellectual funny lines. Even Zed has a few comedic moments unlike the first one.Finally, just like the last soundtrack, Danny Elfman composed the music for this film. I'm glad not everything had changed. It still has its science fiction feeling to it. As for the last half of the movie, its just great to watch because things go back to how they REALLY used to be from the first film. For the most part, keeping the formula the same in films is a good thing. There are exceptions to the rule but this finally catches up with itself in the last half. That's when this sequel truly looks good. Its story is uninspired for the first half of its running time but once it passes that mark, things go back to the way they originally were. Hardcore fans will enjoy it but to expect something really entertaining for regular audiences will be setting a standard that is too high for this sequel to reach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory.If you have read my review of the original, I did love it. It was a parody of parodies, with fast-moving humor and memorable scenes, cast, and characters. With a sequel, I admittedly had some sort of expectation. The sequel, for one, is directed by the same director of the first. By this, we can expect some of the same and of course how he wanted the sequel to be. Secondly, we have the same cast. Obviously, we can have the same formula with the humor and laughs just as the original. As I sat down to watch, I kept asking myself WHY did they chose to do this? WHY is this happening? And lastly, WHY did the director chose the battle the original? The only answer could be he lost it. The humor is kind of the same of the original: mildly vulgar, mildly presented. The problem with the sequel is that it tries to hard to make us feel like the first did. Of course, we have the same flaws as the first, but seems like the director wanted to double the amount and make ourselves *ASK* ourselves why? The acting was a little dumbed down, and surprisingly Tommy Lee Jones did a horrible job. Will Smith presented a better performance than him but maybe it was a bad day. Everything else is sort of like a throwback to the original, but sadly it's projected way worse. We have a few funny cameos, but none of them redeem the bad things. We have a few funny jokes, but most of them are forced. We have some cool scenes, but mostly they are all dumbed down. So let me put it this way: if you took the original, sort of took all the bad scenes, then sliced this one in half, and filled the sliced half with the bad scenes, you have Men in Black II. I didn't hate, but I didn't like it. I don't recommend, and the film deserves the 5 rating. Instead of watching this, take all the bad things out of the first, then re-watch that. It'll be a much better experience. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time after the second MIB movie was in the movies, I read more than six comments that reacted negatively to MIB II. When I saw MIB II the first time, I was not as impressed. Now it seems that I like MIB II more and I see it more often. I love both movies. In many ways the second flick was better. Y'all are always saying more bang for the buck, well, I thought MIB II had it. In many ways the movie was serious. The earth was about to be destroyed, and that's an old plot line, I realized. But the movie was funny almost all the way through. There was romance, some drama, action, thrills, everything you would desire from a good sci-fi. Agent J is there with his normal urban humor you might expect from his buddy in Bad Boys, but still prevailing as the smart agent policing the Earth for criminal aliens. Serleena is a handful. The key plot in MIB II is the light of Zartha. Serleena in her zest and evil kills the pizza guy, but the rapist, well, he gets what he deserves I think. Serleena has a varied appetite.Frank the pug(a dog) gets a starring role in this installment of Men In Black. Seems pretty smart, but cannot sing Gloria Gaynor very well. But it's funny. He finds himself a prisoner in the MIB headquarters.There are a lot more special effects here, more alien characters. A lot of them turn up at Jeeb's Joint, where Agent K has gone with Agent J. Agent K is using Jeeb's deneuralyzer, powered by an Evinrude outboard motor. Later, J and K run into Newton and his girlfriend at their video store, and the story thickens.A lot of fun, this movie is. The key is not to take any of it seriously, and yes, TLJ has probably made better movies, movies a lot older than this. But this one's fun, especially the 10,000 foot long worm..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate it when a movie's sequel tries to stay with the original first movie's feel but fails to do so. I mean, in a nutshell the movie is just another alien trying to take over the world, and the MIB have to get a former member's memories back to his MIB days so that they can save the world. There WAS a lot of humor that made me laugh, but other than that, and as usual the unnecessary sexual content, I really didn't see the point of the movie. The special effects were great, but it still lacked a good story. The first one introduced the MIB and showed them on many adventures. The second one just involved one alien trying to take over the planet, nothing new and exciting unfortunately.Rated 6/10, 2/10 for lack of creative story, 2/10 for sexual content, and 2/10 for swearing.</fullReview>

The gags are also very funny indeed. The talking dog is particularly hilarious. Of course this is a sci-fi comedy, one of the best made till then but no more than that I mean the story is banal despite the attempt of introducing a sentimental sub-plot there which is fairly attractive anyway. But the action is really fascinating and can delight you during the whole view. A special mention also to the extraterrestrial animated characters which are very well conceived in terms of originality and inventiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has much of what made the original so good, but it is a little weak in comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Men in Black" turned out to be a very successful blockbuster, so it was no surprise when it spawned a sequel. It took five years, but fans finally got to see "Men in Black II" in 2002. However, like many other movie sequels, this one turned out to be a disappointment to many fans of the original, and certainly didn't do as well. I first saw this sequel nearly four years ago, very early in 2006. I wasn't that impressed, and could only remember little bits from that viewing. After revisiting the original 1997 sci-fi action comedy last month, which I still found impressive, I decided I would watch this one again, which I did last night. I think my second viewing was a lot like my first, meaning that it was a mixed blessing.Agent J is still working for the Men in Black five years later, while Agent K has retreated to civilian life, with his memories from his years as an MIB agent all gone. J has been unable to keep a consistent partner for his work since K's retirement, constantly dismissing his partners from the agency due to their incompetence. The planet's latest extraterrestrial threat is the return of an evil shapeshifting Kylothian named Serleena, an old foe of the MIB! She has come to Earth searching for the powerful Light of Zartha, and has taken the form of a lingerie model! The only one who can stop her is K, so J must bring back the ex-agent (who now works at a post office and is known as Kevin Brown), as the entire planet is depending on him! As J attempts to restore K's memory, Serleena takes over MIB headquarters and releases the alien prisoners! The visuals in "Men in Black II" are just as good as those of its predecessor, once again with all the sets, special effects, and gadgetry. Also, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still show their charisma as the co-stars. Unfortunately, these positives are not enough for this sequel to match the 1997 original. I laughed lightly at times, so there's some pretty good humour in the movie, but some parts are just too juvenile. The alien with his scrotum on his chin instead of his groin is a good example of this. The part with the little world inside a locker is also supposed to be funny, but it's not (or at least not usually), and it really seems misplaced in this flick. So, the humour definitely isn't as good here as it is in the original "Men in Black", and doesn't really work for the most part. There's suspense in this film, but not as much as there is in its predecessor, though this probably isn't as big a problem as the lack of laughs. The writers probably could have focused a bit more and maybe could have come up with more surprises.Because of this movie's redeeming qualities, I would say it's slightly above average, but ONLY slightly. I don't think it's as bad as some "MIB" fans think it is, but can understand why it's significantly less popular than the 1997 summer blockbuster. Even if most sequels are inferior to their predecessors, and this one couldn't have been an exception, it still could have been better than it turned out to be. (Mind you, it also could have turned out far worse.) If you've enjoyed 1997's "Men in Black", you could find some entertainment value in this sequel, but I don't suggest you expect anything too breathtaking. It's been seven years since the release of "Men in Black II", but it appears a third installment is coming. Maybe they will work out some of the problems featured in this second installment, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short and Forgettable Cash-in Sequel ** / *****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Men in Black Movie which came out in 1997, was a fun, Thrill ride of action, Comedy and FX, with great leads in Will Smith &amp; Tommy Lee Jones.Fast Forward 5 years Later and we have the sequel - Men in Black 2, which I was looking forward to seeing having enjoyed the first, Well I gotta be honest I was hugely disappointed not only was this Short.... Way Short with Film &amp; Credits coming in at UNDER 90 minutes, The Story was weak and by-the-numbers and Nobody's heart was in it - Smith &amp; Jones were going through the motions and acted as If they couldn't be bothered and were in it purely for contractual reasons, The SFX while great after a while were tiresome and seemed to be overdone to a huge amount to cover the inadequacies in the plot - The Comedy was forced and where was Linda Fiorentino who took over Jones' role at the End of the first? She was nowhere to be seen &amp; and as far as I recall no reason was given for her absence - although I know Fiorentino was a notoriously difficult actress to work with and she hasn't made a motion picture for many years, but a reference to her character would have been nice. Co-Stars which included Rosario Dawson, Johnny Knoxville, Lara Flynn Boyle &amp; Rip Torn, were abysmal and close to embarrassing.It was a huge hit of course - though not as big as it's predecessor, but quite frankly it didn't deserve to be a hit, It's just another example of Hollywood treating Cinema-goers as Mindless Idiots who'll watch anything with oodles of Effects, regardless of the quality of the script.From as far back as 2005 there's been talk of a second sequel, Personally I think This shameless Cash-in Sequel Is quite enough thank you very much**/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, some things were fixed here. The filmmakers understood the huge wholes of the first one. Despite that one was celebrated (right now it's more highly rated in IMDb than this one).Among other things, what improved here was the attachment we feel to the alien world. There are more situations that makes us mildly care for what the mib are after. The aliens enter the action, and sometimes that's funny, the talking dog has moments, and so do the worms.Also, the partnership Smith-Jones is much more effective here. That's because here they create the gags together, whereas in the first one the production relied totally on Will Smith to deliver it while Tommy Lee was in the back to state how Smith is funny even in the world of the film.But above all, one thing takes this one to other dimension: Lara Flynn Boyle's character, efficiently supported by her. That's bringing sex to the equation. The first one depicted a totally undeveloped and uninteresting bad guy (the one performed by d'Onofrio). Here that totally supporting part is really supporting, and made by Knoxville two-headed character. The center is occupied by Boyle, and her presence affects everything, she spreads roots as the ones her character master. She was a good cast, and makes it mildly work; she has screen presence and knows how to pose to make it work.Is this enough for a film to be good? Has the word 'entertainment' narrowed in the cinema industry that it's possible for the mentors of projects like this to get away with it? Think that despite being 'classics' today, films like 'City Lights' were actually entertainment upon their release. No film could match that one in its specific corner, but see how attitudes towards cinematic creation changed? My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls flat among sequels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Men In Black" was truly a one-of-a-kind entertainment filled with laughter, thrills and science fiction references all over the place. Just like many blockbuster films, a sequel must take place.Why? After K (Tommy Lee Jones) is retired and away from the M.I.B. headquarters, J (Will Smith) has taken over K's position where he's nothing but a rebel without a cause. In the original movie, Will Smith was just like many of his other characters who didn't know what the hell was going on until he knew and stood up to the plate to take action. Here he's a wild cannon knowing most of New York along with having partners that leave him when they screw-up.The new villain in town is played by Lara Flynn Boyle an alien, like Edgar from the original, that takes the shape and form of those they contact. In the original the alien ripped Edgar's body apart only to take the skin where Lara's character is like the T-1000 from T2 where all she has to do is look at the object and transform into it.After a witness (Rosario Dawson) sees her boss inflated like a balloon by an alien, it's up to J to protect her and reinforce Tommy Lee Jones's character into action.There were a couple of chuckles, but there wasn't enough scenes I could remember that I cared for nor care about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old routine, the trailer says - but with one crucial difference...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... it just wasn't funny this time! It replicates the quality of both the effects and the procedural hallmarks that we know, and does it well enough I suppose, but there were virtually NO laughs. The witty writing of the first has been totally usurped, and there's a sea of lowest common denominator, kiddie-orientated blandness in its place.It shows that they were struggling for energetic material when the main difference in the sequel is the reversal of status, here making Jones the novice to Smith's old hand. Now, call me over-expectant if you'd like, but I was anticipating a little more innovation; sadly the audience are handed precious little they can get worked up over. Almost every detail contributes to a flat and uninspired slog. It's heavily dispiriting when you recall that the original had such freshness and vigour about it. The producers were that desperate for some liveliness that they were anxious to put a Will Smith ad-lib into the trailer. If the script had been up to snuff in the first place, then maybe he wouldn't have found it so necessary to think on his feet for the sake of a laugh. Asking the stars to bail the entire movie out by using only their own talents is a risky strategy that shouldn't have been necessary. It ends up being too big of a requirement to carry through successfully, despite the gifted personalities that were present on-set.If the idea of a pug singing "I will survive" makes you wanna wet yourself, have a ball by all means... Me? I'll just be watching the original again, thanks...</fullReview>

Marking this sequel at 5* is generous, since it probably should be no better than half the rating of the original, probably a bit lower.</fullReview>

All the characters are great, and the story while very similar to the original is still pretty cool, plus Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are simply amazing in this!. The effects by Rick Baker are really cool, and I thought Will Smith carried the film just fine until he found Tommy again!, plus it also has plenty of laughs in it too, especially when Frank (The Dog), is singing out the window. The finale is very good, and I personally felt Rosario Dawson made a great addition to the cast!, plus I feel that critics and movie fans alike are way too harsh on this film in my opinion. It's quite well made, and while it doesn't come close to matching the original, it's still pretty damn good for a sequel!, plus it paves way for another possible sequel. At 80 to 88 minutes, it's a great breezy time waster, and the ending was really cool!, plus all the characters were very likable. This is not as good as the 1st Men In Black, but still a very entertaining and underrated sequel, Tommy Lee and Will Smith had wonderful chemistry once again, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Barry Sonnenfeld does a very good! job here with great camera work cool angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Will Smith is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is hilarious, had wonderful chemistry with Tommy Lee once again, had some really funny lines, kicked that ass, and did the same things that made him so funny in the 1st! (Will Rules!!!). Tommy Lee Jones is also amazing as always, and is amazing here, while we don't see him until after 30 minutes in to the movie, he hadn't lost his touch, and played the straight man once again, and like Smith did the same thing that made him so good in the 1st!. (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Rip Torn is great as Zed once again i really liked him, he was funny. Lara Flynn Boyle is decent here, and looked great, however i didn't find her all that menacing. Johnny Knoxville is OK here, I am a huge fan of this guy, however, he just wasn't all that funny, and didn't have that much to do, and disappeared in the 3rd Act he still rocks though! (Knoxville Rules!!). Rosario Dawson is very pretty and did what she had to do extremely well i really liked her. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm... what to make of this... Well, I loved MIB - I even remember paying good money to watch it a second time around in a hotel room in Belgium. Reading some of the comments about this MIB2 on IMDb it seems a lot of people were bombarded with promotional material when this came out, but bizarrely ( I do live in the 21st century ) this completely passed me by and the first I knew about MIB2 was in the local supermarket on the remaindered shelves.And there we have the difference - with my expectations set at zero I loved this film. Rosario Dawson looks a babe, Will is Will and plays with a post-post-modern self deprecating irony only as he can. It reminded me a bit of gremlins 2 whereby much of the humour is taking a wry look at the first film - not surprised to see they both have Spielberg on the production.The film is thrown together - e.g. strange duplication of stock footage in seen setting outside the diner, and, is it just me, but there is something up with the sound clarity making it hard to follow, the CGI leaves me cold in jaded 2005, but whatever other reviewers say, the plot does hang together and has some nice touches. Maybe a film sank by the weight of expectation? If I was involved in its production I would have been a bit taken aback by the savagery of the criticism.</fullReview>

She's a hoot to watch.I didn't really like the time subplot, as things tended to feel a little forced.Still, it's worth your time.The opening is great as well, with lots of big laughs and a great cameo by Peter Graves (one of my favorites).I'm hoping for a Men in Black 3!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movie which compels you to watch the sequel because you have liked the first one. And come out of the cinema, feeling cheated.The plot is wafer-thin and predictable. The soul is absconding from the word go. Even the star-cast lack conviction. The action, humour and CGI which formed the integral part of the MIB seems force-fit in the sequel.Wonder if Spielberg was purposefully omitted in the brain-storming sessions of the sequel.Clearly evident that owing to the stupendous success of the MIB, the studio decided to en-cash by a sequel MIB - II. Stay away if you don't wish to spoil the taste of the former.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen one Will Smith movie you've basically seen them all. With the exception of "Six Degrees of Separation" he plays a character with the exact same attitude in each one. The only film he did that I ever deemed worthy enough to buy was "Enemy of the State". Other than that it's just the same crap different day. It was a bad idea for me to rent this as I didn't really like the first one and even though it's been awhile I still remember it to have been much better than this. Actually they used a lot of ideas over again and I can't figure out why they felt the strong urgency to make an uncalled for sequel. Tommy Lee Jones did the best acting out of everyone but he was only in it for the last half and even he wasn't anything special. I will say however that Lara Flynn Boyle had a knockout body in this! She was always considered hot but breast augmentation really worked well for her. I hear now she became anorexic though and that's a shame because she should've stuck to what she did here. It'd be unwise to critique Johnny Knoxville's performance since I don't think he's really considered an actor. The only rendition he ever did that was good enough to be thought of as acceptable was in "Walking Tall". Finally Rip Torn was underused as well. Therefore I can't recommend this except to fans of the original that are dying for more.Final Shuttle:Movies: Would've been a waste of money.DVD Purchase: I'm not that crazy yet.Rental: I didn't think it was worth it!</fullReview>

The first Men in Black was good and actually made me interested into it and waiting for its sequel but when I watched it I just got bored. It was as same as the first film and all the new characters were bad and there costumes were stupid. The acting wasn't good either and the dialouge was horrific. Will Smith as usual is there to come and save the day like all the rest of his movies, blah blah blah blah blah. I thought the film had some funny parts by Tommy Lee Jones mainly, but it still just got me unintersted in it. That was itHedeen's outlook: 5/10 *+ D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Men in Black II' loses the novelty Smith and Jones had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in Black II (2002) Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Lara Flynn Boyle, Rosario Dawson, Rip Torn, Johnny Knoxville, Tony Shalhoub, Patrick Warburton, Tim Blaney, D: Barry Sonnenfeld.Remember it was Jones' last time as a MIB agent when all of his memory was `neutralized' (at the end of the first film), but Smith returns with a new mission to seek The Light of Zartha-a powerful doodad wanted by an evil alien (Boyle) disguised in Victoria Secret lingerie. When it requires Jones' help, it'll be hard familiarizing him and getting him `dressed' in black again.'Men in Black II' doesn't feel as much as a sequel as it does a revisit. It revisits to the original film by not adding much else. Rosario Dawson, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville are used to no effect, but the dog is funny. This is so unnecessary and unnecessarily confusing, but still stocks some clever ideas of the original, like the engaging star duo, but even they aren't given much to do here. The movie mercifully doesn't prolong its revisit. Look for Sonnenfeld as the neutralized father.Running Time: 88 minutes and rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and some provocative humor.**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a "bad" movie in my opinion - however it's not as edgy as the original. A point criticized by many is that the movie is "just another shape-shifting alien threatening the entire earth scenario" - but that's what MIB stories are SUPPOSED to be about.Would it be a James Bond movie if 007 wasn't out trying to "save the world from another evil power-hungry megalomaniac"?Poor Agent J - at least 007 gets the girl.It's an entertaining movie, worth watching, but they weren't bucking for an Oscar here. Personally, I wouldn't mind if they DID make the "MIB" movies into a long-running series like they did with the James Bond flicks. Sure, you know that the good guys are just going to save the world from some nasty evil alien - but I'd be willing to pay six bucks to see how they do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very original in comparison to "Men in Black", yet a fun film with some terrific jokes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK II (2002)THE GOOD:--Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith again have great chemistry and make for a terrific team. I liked the humour in the situation being swapped - Jones is clueless, Smith is the expert. This makes for a number of very cool jokes (old and busted - new hotness).--Frank, the talking dog, really stole the show. He was a hoot and a half. I loved him wearing the MIB seat, and the hysterical sing-along to "Who Let the Dogs Out?"--The best jokes in the movie are the ones that are intelligent and not just humorous one-liners. For instance, the post office sequence I found to be very clever and also absolutely HILARIOUS. The final scene in the movie was very impressive, funny and had a bit of philosophy mixed in there too!--"Men in Black II" shows us a little more about actually being a man in black, other than you are an ultra-cool kick-ass alien fighter. In some very effective scenes we get to see the loneliness that comes with this job, and consequences and prices are always a subject I'm open to. Very cool?one of the strengths in the film other than some terrific jokes.THE BAD:--The slapstick, clichéd jokes brought down the quality of the movie sufficiently. I didn't really like those chain-smoking, martini-loving warm aliens; their jokes were just TOO obvious for my liking.--The villain of the film, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, is very stupid. I just don't really like Flynn Boyle as an actress; I found her very boring in the role. She just didn't sell me on being funny, memorable or threatening. Perhaps part of the problem with her not holding up as much of a threat is because all she does practically is stay in a building for the majority of the movie. She doesn't have any interesting or important characters to interact with therefore she can't say or do anything thrilling making her one of the most dull villains of 2002.--There were too many plot holes in this film. I would like an explanation as to how the baddies always get fired down, shot, burnt, but then a scene later they appear right as rain and ready to kick ass? Also, what the hell happened to Johnny Knoxville's rather entertaining character? He could've made it, because one head was trying to resuscitate the other head but he didn't get much of a send off, he just never came back. And what the hell happened to Linda Fiorentino's character from "Men in Black"?--The final scenes of the film speed by with not much imagination, a lacking atmosphere and a very dull wrap up in general to the storyline of the film.--Too much repetition from "Men in Black". The upside down car thing was used again, and the storyline doesn't bring much new plot-wise. What about a "Women in Black" story or perhaps a "Spacemen in Black"?RATING:7/10 - Lacking the intrigue factor of the first film, "Men in Black II" still holds up as a fun comedy with a leisurely pace and some great humour.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Alien: Resurrection (6/10) Babe (9/10) Bad Boys (7/10) Mars Attacks! (5/10) Men in Black (7/10)</fullReview>

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is one powerful, funny duo, but in this film, they played some really tasteless, boring, dry characters. The duo magic that was present on the first part is now gone. Combined this with one terrible, poor storyline and you got one recipe for a "Sequel Disaster".To all producers, writers involve, please let's just leave this great films alone.

Instead they just did the same things over again and it worked. Everyone, including me, went and saw it.

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't terrible it just was'nt a patch on the original the plot was very flimsy and just used really as a subplot between the minutes after minutes of CGI Special effects. Smith and Jones looked bored and embarrassed to star in tbis lame and silly sequel. I had high expectations for this movie because i really liked the first movie. I was really disappointed as were most of my friends, because the director wrongly has forfeited a good story, script, charecterization and funny lines in favour of an endless stream of effects which might please under 10's but not a film fan as myself. It was also fatr too short at less than 90 mins although halfway through you'll get bored and switch off before the end anyway.If you liked the first movie you'll feel ripped off as it's a virual remake - the story does'nt move along at all apart from missing Linda Fiorentino.If you haven't seen the first movie you won't have a clue what's going on through much of the movie - so watch the first one to begin with and forget about this one altogether.Either way the only people sattifised with this movie are the ones who didn't seen the first one &amp; and therefore didn't waste they're money on this truly abysmal sequel.I've read that they're thinking about doing a third men in black - my advice: save your careers and forget about it.My rating 6/10 this sequel 9/10 The first movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's sequel time again! I finally got around to watching this recently and I have to say I think I've found the perfect way to enjoy any movie. First, you have to listen to all the negative reviews of the film, then go and see it. You'll be expecting something so dire that the reality will be a pleasant surprise, nay, even enjoyable. Such was the case with MIB2.That said, though, this has to be one of the most blatant "let's redo the first movie" sequels that I've ever seen. Let's recap...In the first movie the MIB have to recover the "galaxy on Orion's belt" or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a morgue worker who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car flying.In this sequel the MIB have to recover the "light of Zartha" or the Earth will be destroyed. The love interest comes in the form of a waitress who falls for Will Smith. There's a big-ass alien monster that the MIB have a showdown with at the end. There's a scene with the MIB's car flying.You begin to get the idea? This isn't so much of a sequel as a blatant remake. The Italian Job remake is more different from its original than MIB2 is from its predecessor.Having got that out of the way, the film still manages to amuse, though there are moments where it does make you groan rather than laugh, the jokes being so predictable. But still, it has its moments. Frank the Pug is one of them. There's also more screen time for Tony Shalhoub's "Jeebs" character this time around, though there are only so many times you can see his head explode and grow back before it gets stale.Tommy Lee Jones seems to be totally bored this time around. One wonders if he was dragged kicking and screaming back to the set due to contractual obligations. His usual deadpan delivery really did look as if he wished he were dead. Overall though, nothing spectacular. I have to say that I'm finding it increasingly difficult to feel any sympathy with Hollywood studios over movie piracy when they churn out such blatant money-spinners as this.Never mind. Let's just hope there isn't a MIB 3!</fullReview>

It's actually good he was in it, otherwise this movie would have been unbearable (But it's very close).The main problem with this movie is the fighting sequences are all from the first one, which I never found exciting. What's the point of wasting $100 million to make a movie that has the same plot as the first? Obviously, so at the end of the weekend, everyone can get a huge paycheck.

The characters were developed in the first "Men in Black". You want to know who these guys in the black suits are? What makes them tick? Rent the first one. This sequel plopped off the Hollywood Conveyor belt and landed faster than a Burger King cheeseburger, (plugged in the movie and in this comment. Yummy!). They wrote the script over a long weekend and had the movie in the can by the following Friday. So an Intergalactic underwear model arrives from outer space to take on the MIB. She wants something they have. The MIB protest and run afoul of many different aliens. Big aliens. Small aliens. Worm aliens. Lots of aliens.This movie has "rush job" painted all over it. There was no tension. There was no drama. There was barely any comedy. Tommy Lee Jones elevated his stoic routine to walking dead level. Will Smith wasn't acting much livelier. However, "MIIB" moves so fast you'll barely have time to register how simpleminded it is. It was not made to offend, aggravate or stimulate. It's just a simple sequel.

		<fullReview>There is a fine line between good and bad movies, and usually if a movie is good enough I tend to call it a film. When it comes to movies and Cinema in general, I tend to be rather generous in giving scores to movies. Only if something is truly terrible will I give it extremly low points, but usually there are one or two redeeming qualities. (E.G. my Battlefield Earth review). That is not this case with this "movie." Why is it called even a "movie"? I don't know. Why does this even have more then one star at IMDb? Beats me. One word describs this film: appalling. Where is the script? Did they hire monkeys to make up these jokes? Wait.. what jokes? They aren't even funny. As for the acting, it barely makes it past bad, but it isn't bad. It's the only thing that saves this one, the fact that they kinda tried. Everything else is revolting. Barry Sonefield seems to have his mind on making money rather then making something worth $9. Note Steven Speilberg produced this one too... The chemisty between Agent K and Agent J really falls apart when they meet. Oh and the special effects are decent as well. The ending of this "movie" is supposed to be sad, and I cried. Happy tears, that it was OVER! This is the epitomy of cinematic hell. Don't even try to stop watching it, before you move it'll be over.

		<fullReview>Men In Black was a well-made and hilarious comedy that truly deserved its blockbuster status. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith had great chemistry on screen and the duo provided numerous laughs. Due to the movie´s huge success a sequel was guaranteed and last year MIIB came out. I didn´t see it in a theatre since I believed the reviews I read were correct. I decided to wait until the movie comes out on DVD and I´m glad I did because MIIB is quite disappointing, considering all the talent involved.The best thing about MIIB is naturally the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are one of those great buddy pairs of cinema. Both Jones and Smith are talented actors with great comic timing. The reason why MIIB fails is its script. It does have its share of laughs, but you can´t help but feel a bit cheated after watching this movie. The only reason why this movie was made was money, the studio simply wanted to cash in. Since this is movie business it´s okay, but for God´s sake, they should written a lot better screenplay! MIIB has a very short running time which reveals the fact that the writers didn´t have that many good ideas to work with.MIIB is a typical disposable item from Hollywood and a good example of sequels meant purely to cash in. Entertaining? Mildly. Memorable? Far from that. Worth renting? Judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long-awaited sequel. Never had I heard so much bad word-of-mouth about a film even before it was released. I was very disappointed in Men In Black II. I somewhat enjoyed the first film. Will Smith seems to play the same smart-aleck character in every film he does. In this one, he is cutting people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut-up. Being rude and insulting to white people in this film really turned me off. Bad writing. I didn't feel there was enough screen time for Tommy Lee Jones. Is there a plot in this film? Interesting was the cameo appearance of singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson. Perhaps Michael Jackson would have been better than Will Smith (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ [1978]). The outtakes were of just more of Will Smith wasting more valuable time just to be silly and get attention. The Blooper reel shows how unprofessional Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much of a consummate actor he is. Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right back into character when the director needs it. The sequel just might have killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all. Will Smith and Special Effects does not always work for a film. Men In Black means "black suit" not "ethnic". I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black without Will Smith. I liked the alternate ending where Will Smith was put in the egg pod. Perhaps that is where they should have cut and ended the film right there. Watch Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we find out, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has had his memory wiped to accomodate his return to civilian life. But when an alien menace (Lara Flynn Boyle) comes looking for some sort of light thingie, Agent J (Will Smith) must find Agent K, the only one who knows where it is, to help save the planet. But when a civilian (Rosario Dawson) becomes involved, Agent J may end up letting personal feelings get involved with his work, something Agent K already let happen, with bad results.This is an alright film if you judge it by the beauty of it's simplicity. Films like this, when analyzed at a peice of art, just don't measure up, but that's really not their aim. However, this isn't a good as the first one. It seems more like a TV movie than a real feature film.Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Knoxville should never have been cast. I have a feeling they got the parts for ther "image", but Uma Thurman and John Leguizamo (sp?) would have been better in those parts.Smith and Jones were still great in their scenes together, and I loved seeing much of the original supporting cast back; Tony Shalhoub, Rip Torn, and David Cross all rocked the house. Fiorentino and D'Onofrio were gone, but their characters couldn't have been worked back into the plot anyway. An alright film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some people that this sequel repeats the same formula that made that Men In Black 1 were successful, it seems that it is not very original, but this movie has given the public what wanted: but of the same, more Men In Black, only with the variant that this movie has more action, more special effects, more characters... in summary it takes the same thing that Men In Black 1 but more enlarged in the whole aspects. The main characters change papers in this second movie, in the first agent K is the expert and agent J the beginner, but in second film it is on the contrary the agent J has to return the memory to the agent K and to put it a day on the new mission of the MIB but J sometimes acts as a beginner. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are impeccable again in their roles but Will Smith has won mainly in comic protagonism this time thanks to Frank the dog, I have liked a lot that gives him more protagonism. It is a pain that Linda Fiorentino didn't repeat as agent MIB but it is compensated with the election of Lara Flynn Boyle like bad girl and Rosario Dawson like the "sentimental" partner of J, Lara has made a good work but of Rosario Dawson has been a little more irregular. I didn't like at all to see Johnny Knoxville like the typical fool bad boy, but it went good see again (repeating papers) Rip Torn and the histrionic Tony Shalhoub.  Perhaps the position of the script of this movie is not as original as that of the previous one but this it is able to entertain and to make laugh more even than the first movie of the Men In Black. Lastly, to say that the special effects have improved enough, mainly that of the worm of the meter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is it so much worse than the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never hated sequels as much as other people. While they do have a tendency to be much worse than the originals, it doesn't mean there isn't a use for them. Some can be quite enjoyable. This movie is not one of those examples. The gags are either holdovers from the original or are so ill-concieved that they are almost painful to watch. The opening sequence starts promising, with the purposefully shoddy remake of the landing of the princess. Sadly, the movie recedes from that start to the viewer being relieved it has ended. And as much as hate the acting of Linda Fiorentino, I enjoyed her character much more than Rosario Dawson's. Also Vincent D'Onofrio's Bug was pure comic genius in his physicality. Lara Flynn Boyle's villian is entirely lifeless. Will and Tommy just walk through their characterizations, where in the original they had fun defining their characters and presenting them for the viewer. I honestly hope Sonnefeld is done with this series. Then again a third movie couldn't be as bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MIB by numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Funnily enough MIBII wasn't the crap-o-rama I was expecting. It sure isn't going to win any oscars, but it isn't as bad as its made out to be.There are a few decent gags in here. A few made me laugh out loud. They were usually the more understated ones as the big, obvious ones were a big lame (the michael jackson bit was a arse clenchingly unfunny).The plot concerns some bad alien looking for something that was supposed to do something, which the MIB were supposed to have got rid of but never did. Ho hum. And the only way to do it is to rescue the 'buddy' formula that worked so well in the first film and ditch Linda Fiorentino as J's partner. In the most hideous way. We sit there wondering what happened to her for like 20 odd minutes and all we get is 'you cant keep neuralizing your partners, J' 'She wanted to go back to the morgue'. A single line. Poor woman.Speaking of poor women, J's new love interest, who may or may not be K's daughter, he doesn't seem to really give a crap, is in the film for a grand total of about 2 minutes. And she is the pivotal plot device.Anyway, K makes a return at about the 40 odd minute mark which gives him about another 40 mins to get his thang back. This means TLJ's glowering and scowling like he just sniffed a turd for about 35 mins, before he mellows at the ending. He just does nothing. He spends 20 minutes claiming he isn't an MIB and then another 20 being boring. He seems to substitute deadpan for morose (acting like you do when you are a kid and forced to visit your gran) losing all the spark he and Will Smith had in the original. Speaking of Will Smith his character goes from Ultimate bad ass MIB agent to Ultimate Jackass MIB agent when K shows up, just to get the 'rookie' thing going. Which is anoying.All the ingredients are there from the original, but just don't click. There are too many plot holes, too much contradiction and not enough characterisation. Its like how George Lucas has forgotten what made star wars so good, Sonnenfield seems to have stuck to the blueprint but gone wrong somehow. Maybe it would have been better if he wasn't so fervent about his magic '90 minute mark' for films. If we had an extra 15 odd minutes it could have been so much different. Maybe he would have had time for a decent ending...Actually, reading back, I enjoyed this less than I thought I did. How strange.</fullReview>

Will Smith was trying too hard to be funny and Tommy Lee Jones was just going through the motions to act. He was definitely missing something in his performance I thought. I must admit I was struggling to sit there for the entire film because the overall plot was repetitious from the first one.

		<fullReview>I was supposed to see another movie when I caught this inferior replica of "Men in Black". It was sold out, the weather was terrible, and it would take us 45 minutes to get back to our hotel room. We decided to see MIB2 and sneak into the other movie afterwards. This is the exact same movie as the first one, less the light-hearted wit. This is the definitive sell-out sequel. The writers either were too worried that deviating from the first movie's plot and dialogue would turn audiences away, or they were too lazy to come up with something new. This would play well for someone who hasn't seen the first MIB, but as a sequel it is awful. To top it off, the movie that I wanted to see was was sold out for the next showing. They even had attendants checking stubs. What a terrible day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this because I was in desperate need of something mindless, silly, and (hopefully) funny. I knew it would be mindless, and I hoped it would be silly. What a pleasant surprise that it was also funny.As a sequel, MIB 2 was inspired. After all, no one was going to laugh at the set up again. More of the same would be--ell, more of the same. So what makes it a good sequel is the humor--particularly the great sense of the timing on the jokes. This is true comic writing and comic cinematic direction.The autopilot, for example, is a perfect, wordless joke--brilliantly conceived and executed. And the train station locker is another, off-the-wall concept--unexpected and unusual.Another directorial success is in not having Jones exactly reprise his character. His interpretation of the disgruntled, skeptical, and authoritarian postmaster is both dead-pan and inspired--timing, again. K is both crabbier and more in control than he was before his nebulizaiton, even though he has to cope with being 5 years behind on the MIB technology.He is still sad and wistful about his role in the universe; and moreover, things have happened to him in his 5 years off the force, things that they tell on his personality. Kudos to Jones and Sonnenfeld for sketching in these changes.There are also some nice one liners. I won't repeat them, because then you won't find them funny. But check out J's response to the dog's advice on romance. Pure wit, crude and simple.To top it off, this movie is short enough not to wear out its welcome, and is not extended with interminable shoot-em-ups and car chases.</fullReview>

But after a brisk dodge from watching it at Christmas, my buddy unceremoniously picked it up for the weekend, along with 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS, because his fiancee could watch these type of movies with us. Oh joy. But thankfully, MIB II was tolerable, recycling 90% of what we already liked from the first movie, taking that "extra" step, being more of this and more of that and offering little more. In short, it is just a regular sequel.The world is in mortal danger again and Agent J is sent to retrieve his old partner, K, since he can save it ... of course.The best part of the movie is the locker in the train station, hands down. I woke up and laughed then. Everything else is mere eye candy or mild musings. If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy the second. Not as bad as Hades but hey, if anything can keep the kids occupied ... otherwise I would recommend anything else.</fullReview>

It's good to see that MIIB is a proper sequel and not just one commissioned by a studio because the first one made a lot of money. Definately one to rent or buy on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Men in Black again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite. What's the problem with this film? Well, let's go back to the first MiB film; we had a very original angle for a sci-fi comedy, nobody sitting down in the theatre for MiB had any idea what they were in for. Yeah, a movie about a secret organization who goes after aliens--given. The fact that every breath the film takes is to make a wisecrack at some political figure, celebrity or sci-fi concept, that came as a pleasant surprise. MiB exceeded many people's expectations because no person, place, or thing was safe from MiB's smart ass commentary. Now we have MiB 2. Now we have expectation carrying over from the first film--we go from scene to scene, character to character imagining all the funny stuff they can throw at us for a post office, a two headed alien, a talking dog, etc . . . and we get *a* joke with each, then the film moves on. The humor the commentary on sci-fi and 'important people' is tame in comparison to the first. A lot of the scenes are funnier in the trailer because the trailer happens to catch the punch line and spares us the other 15 minutes where we expect to be overwhelmed with the satire. Not here. So what happened? Did the writers run out of things to make fun of with the whole MiB concept? Is there, in fact, just as much satire as the first but our expectations are higher this time around? Who knows--I'm not about to watch both back to back to find out. Either way, going into a sequel you have to recreate what made the first successful (which the filmmakers semi-accomplished) and expand it into new territory to keep it from being just a retread (which the makers did not do.)MiB 2 cannot escape the shadow of its predecessor, and it doesn't even try. It sits comfortably in the same premise, characters, jokes as the first one and as a result loses its effectiveness . . . because the first one had an edge--it had an original angle. No one quite knew what MiB's target in satire was, and it was in fact, everything.Jones and Smith reprise their roles very effectively; it would have been nice to see Agent L return, alas, did not happen. The writing doesn't seem up to par with the first nor does the direction. Elfman returns with an effective score. Overall, the film is pretty good so long as you don't start expecting too much or hold it up against its predecessor. Go figure. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Men in Black" isn't one of my absolute favorite movies, but it's okay. The best things about it are the sci-fi jokes and the most inventive looking alien characters since we left the Mos Eisley Cantina. Well, "MIB 2" is one of those sequels that takes what worked in the first movie and goes with it. Unfortunately, that means we end up with exactly the same movie over again.No, really; the EXACT same movie over again. Right down to the plot being about an evil alien (who, again, transforms into the first human form it lays eyes -or whatever- on) searching for a glowy thing that the universe depends on.Is it worth watching? Well, kids will still like it, I guess. And people who were waiting on the edge of their seats for the next "Men in Black" movie (as opposed to, say, parts two and three of "the Matrix"). As for the rest of us, all we get is a scene with Michael Jackson and some penguins that I guess is supposed to be funny but ends up being profoundly terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an example of how the rating system is totally messed up. MIB II seems quite appropriate for kids. It is mostly silly, rather than genuinely scary. The special effects are a lot of fun. There is some violence but is cartoonish in nature. The plot is pretty simple. Why is it PG-13? Because a lady appears in her underwear at one point? Pretty arbitrary. Star Wars on the other hand has non-stop violence and is genuinely scary. It is only rated PG. But, as a mother, I'd much rather have my kids (9 &amp; 12) watch this one than watch Star Wars. MIB II is much lighter, more kid friendly, and less violent.Why does Tommy Lee Jones get top billing on this movie? Will Smith is clearly the lead and a great one at that. I really enjoyed watching him. He acts well and has an enchanting, light-hearted charisma; plus he's awfully cute. Tommy Lee Jones is very stony-faced and not at all accessible.I loved the CG characters. They were wonderfully creative and entertaining.</fullReview>

Breathlessly directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written with pleasing goofiness by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro, it goes about its business professionally and smoothly, essentially reprising the first film plot (aliens looking for a missing bauble while Earth is in jeopardy) but wisely expanding the roles of that film's best supporting characters (Frank the Pug--who earns the majority of laughs--and the lazy salamanders). The actors are clearly having fun--they know they've hit paydirt--and once again Smith proves to be a good sport by being the fall guy. A fast and fun time.</fullReview>

Out of the small craft comes a creature that takes the form of a lingerie model. This creature's name was Serleena, and she has come to earth to seek the Light of Zartha. She had been searching for it for 25 years. She get's help from a dim-witted two-headed alien Scrad/Charlie. They tell Serleena that the one who knows where the light is the owner of Ben's Pizza, so they go there and interrogate Ben, who denies everything so they kill him. His assistant, Laura, witnesses it all.Agent Jay is still with the Men in Black. He and his new partner, T, meet Jeff, a big alien worm who lives in the subway tunnels and nearly devours a subway car. Luckily, Jay stopped him and neuralyzed the scared people. T faltered at his post so Jay neuralyzed him as well and sent him off on a new life. Jay soon get's a new partner, Frank the Pug, an incessant talking pug dog. Jay and Frank investigate the space craft landing, as well as interrogate Laura. Jay takes a liking to her so he doesn't neuralyze her. Jay soon learns about Serleena and what she's looking for. Zed tells him that Kay knew all about the Light of Zartha and what he knew could save earth. Unfortunately as we all remember, Jay wiped out Kay's memory in the last adventure, so Jay seeks out Kay at a post office in New Jersey. Kay, now called Kevin Brown, of course doesn't recognize Jay or believe him when he tells him about the Men in Black. Not even when he reveals all the post office employees as aliens. But Kevin finally agrees to come with Jay to MIB headquarters and get his memory back, but right then, Serleena infiltrated MIB headquarters and took everyone hostage. She had to stop Kay before he could stop her.Kay get's his memory back courtesy of Jeebs' deneuralyzer Kay immediately retakes his position as the leader, but unfortunately, he had neuralyzed the Light of Zartha information from himself but he did leave himself clues so he and Jay search all around, leaving Laura with the alien MIB worms. Kay finally recollects the entire back story to the Light. They had to get Laura back, but she had been kidnapped, so Kay, Jay and the worms grab an arsenal of weaponry from Kay's old house and head back to MIB headquarters. Serleena had freed some nasty alien prisoners who try to stop Kay and Jay, but they act quickly and save Laura, next they zoom to the top of the Chrysler building. Once there, Kay reveals that Laura is in fact the Light! She is the daughter of the Lauranna, ambassador of the Zarthans. So Kay and Jay grab their weapons, vaporize Serleena and Laura takes her rightful place amongst the stars and once again, the world is safe, thanks to the Men in Black!What can I say about Men in Black II? Well, it wasn't as good as the first. And even in this movie, Zed and Kay still don't treat Jay with any respect. I thought Jay did a terrific job on his own. There isn't as much to this movie as there was the first one; Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith return as Agents K and J. Rip Torn and Tony Shalhoub reprise their roles as well. That's Patrick Warburton as Agent T. Barry Sonnenfeld directed. Can we expect a Men in Black III? Probably, but let's hope not. Also, this movie sparked a popularity booster for the pug dog, like 101 Dalmatian did for the Dalmatian! My mother just loves Frank the Pug! I do too. He was cute. I like pugs myself, but anyway, in conclusion, if you liked the first one, check out Men in Black II, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed and uninvolving plot disrupts Smith and Jones' chemistry in "MIB" sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel that was five years in the making again stars Will Smith as Agent J, who, after losing his new partner, Agent T (Patrick Warburton), looks up Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), now working at a post office with no remembrance of his alien-fighting past. On the lam is a pizza deliveryman-eating seductress disguised as a Victoria's Secret model (Lara Flynn Boyle), plus her two-headed cohort (Johnny Knoxville). It's believed that the cosmic beauty possibly has a checkered past involving K and J's new crush, Laura (Rosario Dawson). Due to its short running time (a lean 88 minutes), "MIB II" is uninvolving and badly rushed. There's no time for essentials such as character development because it was apparently more important to have Frank the Pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) upstage nearly the entire cast, though he does provide some of the film's few laughs courtesy of a humorous rendition of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive." But aside from that, there is none of the spontaneous humor from the first film, such as Smith's hilarious entry-exam scene. Director Barry Sonnenfeld once again makes a cameo appearance, as does Michael Jackson (yes, the Michael Jackson) in a pointless bit part. Smith hams up his role by bouncing around the screen like a kid in need of Ritalin. He and Jones, as usual, have great chemistry on screen and complement each other well, which is quite possibly the only saving grace of an otherwise average flick.

		<fullReview>I am very dissapointed in this film, I watched it at the cinema a few days ago and the only time I laughed was when the dog was singing in the car, the rest was boring and I couldn't wait for it to finish!!! I think that it's not a film worth watching...if you want a laugh, just download the trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like hundreds of films this one has followed them in that the sequel is not as good as the first one! Fair enough it was funny and i laughed but it lacked tension. There were many parts in which i was falling asleep. I would recommend u go and see it just to say that u have seen it. this is my view on the film but i do tend to have a specific taste in music!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith and Jones are back...but not as funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The success of the first MIB gave the sequal a huge standard to live up to. One would think that with the returning cast, it would put up equal if not better numbers at the box office than it's original. Well...it hasn't put up the numbers...and for obvious reasons. Smith and Jones are back together as agents J and K. However, while the two kept the laughs coming in the first MIB, they can't help a poor script and a weak supporting cast. The only thing that truely returns to form in this sequal is the special effects, which at certain points in the movie, out-do the effects of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still don't understand why I didn't like the first one. It surely wasn't bad, but.. I guess, in 97 I've just been expecting something more clever to come, although now I don't see any reason why should it actually have happened.Well, the things have changed and even the Star Wars are not the same. You agree with me, don't You? Nothing's the same. So.. getting stuck with the old stereotypes really won't make You feel Your ticket payed off. Pity, but true. You don't expect movies to be made today the way they were made in 60s, likewise the movies of 70s or 80s.So.. my expectations really were not high for this one. Funny, but I liked it. I guess, I just wasn't expecting anything more than they were ready to give me. And so, I had some fun watching Will Smith, the Dog, some new aliens and even (!) romance. What's even more funny, I guess I'll be waiting for the 3rd one.So long.</fullReview>

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones dont have very good chemistry and neither one of them were funny. Lara Flynn Boyle was very sexy but her character was just stupid, she was a crappy bad guy. Some of the aliens in this movie were pretty cool. Frank the Pug is back and he is hilarious, the funniest character in the whole movie. Overall, has some funny moments but other than that it just isnt a good sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was clever, engaging, inventive and most of all funny. This had a great responsability of keeping the reputation of the blockbusting first movie, and many years passed until they found out a good script to do it. The result is something which verges on deception. You love it and hate it in equal amounts: although the running time helps to create the illusion that you actually want more, what happens here is the usual Hollywood sequel with its usual and more regular flaw: the feeling that we are seeing something rushed to happen. But my greatest challenge as a viewer was getting over the dull comic timings, which sometimes had everyone in the theater completely quiet. So you see, this is not the fascinating fest that was the first movie, but anyway there are some funny things about the MIB gadgetry and you will laugh with that dog and many other moments in the movie. But of course, the flaws are there, and that subliminal love story is unconvincing, and a near-flop. But I guess that's what happens with some sequels...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was going to be better than the first film. But I was wrong! It's dreadful. The same plot only reversed, because Agent J makes former Agent K into the same Agent he used. Absolutely pointless! I'd rather see the original back on the silver screen than this rubbish! I would give only 1 star for the film, which isn't at all original.Another star for proving that Johnny Knoxville is not just a hilarious stunt man, but a good actor that is sadly over-shadowed by the main roles. And one more for the only thing good, and original, in this film was Wacko's, Michael Jackson, cameo, were he plays Agent M who seems to be trapped with some penguins.

		<shortDescription>Black is back? So is my indifference.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>: I was relatively indifferent to the original `Men in Black'. It was entertaining but I didn't feel it deserved a sequel (although the fact it got one was unsurprising). The preview ads for this sequel had me worse - the highlights they had picked were all unfunny, causing my lips to form a wry of derision rather than a smile. Fortunately the movie was not too bad.. But it was not good either.We're a few years on from the original. Will Smith, Agent J, is the top agent in the Men in Black (MIB) organisation. He has yet to find a partner to match the legendary Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who has retired as a postmaster, unaware of his previous history (having been mind-wiped by a Plot Device). Suddenly earth faces a threat and look - we need Agent K! Cue hijinks as J tries to bring K back into the force, find out K's knowledge relating to the threat and defeat the Big Evil (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). Which is an excuse to run around from action/gag to gag/action. Whatever.It's clear that the actors are having fun here. Jones must be relishing an escape from his normal serious roles and he gets to do the whole `blunt faced' comedic delivery, which he does well. Smith is also a more than capable actor, playing, as he does, Will Smith via The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Boyle is. well she's pretty I guess. All the other actors? They're playing one-dimensional characters who occasionally try to manifest depth via a few heartfelt conversations. Ultimately Smith and Jones (hmmm) are a good pairing, bouncing off well another. They might not have great chemistry but they work surprisingly well and I have little problems with them.It's the actual rest of the movie that somehow doesn't quite make it. The plot's not deep enough to make the movie worthy of being science fiction, but the comedy isn't funny enough to allow this to be a decent comedy. There're some funny set pieces - such as the locker scene and some of Smith's one-liners but other gags feel forced (the singing dog? Please - far too contrived to be funny. And it was shown in all the trailers. A thousand times.). Yes Smith and Jones work well but they're not given much in the way of material to bounce against. It's by no means awful but I feel there's a lot of untapped potential and that a half written script was considered sufficient to get by on. Oh and the SFX are very poor at times and I, for one, am distracted from the movie when the characters are clearly being chased by a bunch of digital animations.`Men in Black II' does not convince me that black is back, or that we should bother thinking so. It contributes nothing but does never really annoy, solely due to the easy way in which Smith and Jones cruise through the picture. Wait for the video release if you fancy something brainless. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black was original, amusing and fun. Men in Black II could not be original so it relied on in jokes and set pieces - fair enough. It works to a certain extent, but why pay so little attention to the characters? Will Smith's characterisation seemed to revolve around the fact that he liked eating pie. However the team obviously concentrated on the aliens and they are both original, and in their female human form, completely stunning. It's just a shame the script was so intent on rushing from start to finish. If they make a MIBIII lets hope they pay the script writers as much as the special effects guy, oh and ditch the talking dog!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all of the promotion for MIB 2, I thought that it would be reasonable to see the movie. Most of the sequels which is made is not in any way better than the first, and this is no special case. The first movie about the "Men in black", was really great, it was fun, with a great story and lots of great action, but though the sequel has lots of great comedy, the story is weak.I think that the main reason that MIB 2 didn´t hold up to my expectations, is that it was too short, 1.5 hours is not enough for everything that was in the movie. If they would have made the movie about half an hour longer, it would have been easier to watch, the speed in the movie is too fast.But MIB 2 is not all bad, as mentioned earlier it has lots of great comedy. Many trailers for films in the genre "comedy" show most of the fun stuff, but not in this trailer, the trailer is really just a preview of some of the jokes. MIB 2 is really funny, which lifts the entire movie.MIB 2 was enjoyable for the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good sequal to the blockbuster from '97.Possitive: The movie starts 5 years later in time. It's also 5 years later in real time. That makes it more realistic. everything has improved; the policy's, the knowledge of Agent J and the new Mercedes. Agent J became the new number one agent of MIB. He took the place of K and made some differences in the methods. More hillarious nuralizer-story and even MORE partners :) Frank the pug became a worse non-stop-talking-who-thinks-that-it-can-sing dog. The jokes become better and the action was better organized than in the first MIB-movie. Good performance: Johnny "jackass" KnoxvilleNegative: Lara Flynn Boyle... She is a fine looking lady but she misses some charisma, everytime i saw her i thought of Famke Janssen. I know... Famke is From the Netherlands, but she has it all to made the bad women character more evil. It's a shame that she had some domestic problems otherwise this movie was (almost) perfect (there's no such thing as a perfect movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Planet. New Scum. Same Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evil alien Serleena has arrived on Earth seeking the light of Zartha. Only one agent can stop her, K. But he has been neuralised so it is up to his former partner J to get him back &amp; together they can save the world!In 1997 Men In Black blasted onto cinema screens from out of nowhere. It was a great summer movie reminiscent of Ghostbusters but bringing its own fresh, fun feel. The pairing of Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Will Smith was inspired &amp; they are together again in MIB II.As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. That seems to have been foremost in the minds of all involved with this ok if decidedly average sequel. This movie will have an all too familiar feel to fans of the original. Yes a sequel should retain all the good things that made the original a hit but must also add some new ideas of its own. On this front MIB II is lacking. The plot is almost identical to the first film - evil alien in human form arrives on Earth seeking mysterious artifact &amp; two MIB agents must not only stop the alien but find out what exactly the artifact is, all within a tight time limit of course!Much of this film feels like it was written after market research. What did fans like about the first film? Well lets just put all that in this one! Characters such as Frank the pugdog, the worm guys &amp; Jeebs all make a return here to varying degrees of success. Frank is good but the other old characters just seem like that, lets have some new ones! Once J &amp; K are reunited the film gets better, they are as good as ever &amp; you can forgive the lazy plot whenever they are on screen. The banter between the two is as good as before with a slightly different dynamic to start with. The rest of the cast are nothing more than ok, Lara Flynn Boyle pretty much miscast as a not very threatening or nasty alien.Apart from Tommy Lee &amp; Will this film is saved by a couple of good little action set pieces &amp; also one or two really funny gags such as one locker joke at Grand Central Station. But a film that is supposed to be a comedy should have much more than one or two comedic highlights! FX were also a highlight of the original MIB &amp; its a bit of a mixed bag. The CGI looks a bit rushed but Rick Bakers imaginative &amp; skilled work is again first rate.In conclusion this is ok. . . for a sequel. There have been many good ones like Empire Strikes Back, or sequels which have taken the original concept &amp; advanced it, adding a new dimension such as Aliens or T2. MIB II, whilst not a terrible film is far from brilliant. It is the rehashed plot which lets it down, especially considering the 5 year gap between the movies. Fans will enjoy it for some funny scenes &amp; the return of the Will Smith/Tommy Lee Jones double act but will leave the cinema slightly underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who let *this* dog out?"Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry, this could be a case for Mulder and Scully"... er, well, no, not really. The Man-and-Woman in Black would be falling about at the inanity of it all. Just what is this film about? It's not entertainment, that's for sure. Seems like it's just a simple-minded exercising of the power of modern computer graphics. And cynical money-making. "Men in Black did really well." "Yeah, and I've got this great new software." "Ok then, looks like we got ourselves another train full of gravy!"The first fifteen minutes give it away, really. There's barely an original thought on show; instead we get images and ideas ripped off from Lexx, Buffy, Mission: Impossible, The X-Files, Doctor Who, Buffy again, ... and those were the just ones I noticed - not being a great sci-fi or action movie buff, who knows what others I missed?The acting (if I dare call it that) seems to have been inspired by watching too many cardboard cut-outs standing outside small shops advertising this week's special offer. To call it two-dimensional would be an insult to Flatlanders. Will Smith coasts through apparently thinking "Hey, you saw me in Men in Black and you liked what you saw; just try to remember the good times we had back then"; Tommy Lee Jones seems to have decided that simply looking confused most of the time will do; Rosario Dawson pouts beautifully but with her physiognomy that really isn't a struggle. Various hangers-on come on strong like cast-offs from Star Trek - hey guys, just because you're in a stupid costume and we can't see your face (or in one unfortunate case we can see your face twice) doesn't mean you can get away with simply lumbering from A to B and lunging wildly when you get there. Rip Torn obviously said something unpleasant to someone in the make-up department, for why else would he be half-submerged behind that ridiculous face-fungus? Finally (in the humanoid department) Lara Flynn Boyle as the naughty alien chasing its particular Holy Grail and blowing up/slicing in two/eating anyone in its way is neither nasty, cunning or funny enough.As for the non-humanoids... hey, a talking dog, with att-i-tuuuude, now *that's* a sure-fire winner. Hmmm, how can I put this? *Oh* *no* *it's* *not!* This one's not clever, it's not original, it's not funny. Especially when it serves absolutely no plot purpose whatsoever. The same goes for those stupid wormy things. Whatever happened to respect for the audience's intelligence?Normally I rate films out of 10 but this one doesn't deserve the extra neuron-firing. Alas, if the viewing I went to is anything to go by, it's going to make more than enough money to lure the producers into making a third installment. May I plead with the aliens already living their undercover lives on our humble planet: please, take over Hollywood before it's too late!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the first one until it came out on DVD and I wish I had waited again this time. This is quite an entertaining film but I would not class it as a comedy, when I saw it in the theatre there were only 2 people laughing out loud (it was filled to capacity) and I think I only chuckled a couple of times. The only funny gags were shown in the trailer, and the talking dog is over used. The first film is slightly better than this one, but I didn't realize that was a comedy until someone told me (I'd class it as very light hearted adventure). The action is not very exciting, apart from the section with Jeffrey, the rest is pretty mild. I was never bored, or wanted to walk out, this is all I can say in favour of this film. Will and Tommy play their roles very well but they are let down by a poor script that feels like a re-write of the first film. Wait for this to come out on video/DVD and then hire it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Men in Black" when it came out in 1997 because it was a story I had never seen before: a quick simple story about a secret government agency who protects earth from dangerous extraterrestrials.I don't think "Men in Black II" was such a good idea. Yeah, OK, they got a few millions more in their pocket, but the story was better as a stand-alone. Now they are a pair of so-so movies.In MIB-2 Will Smith takes the role of the pro and Tommy Lee Jones the role of the rookie during the first half of the story. Neither did a good job. I thought that Tommy Lee Jones was gonna be the reason worth to see the movie, but I was wrong. He's just not the type of actor who plays second to a Will Smith.As in the first movie, the visual effects are awful but the music is superb. This sequel is more of a comedy than the first one, you get a good laugh.As one film critic said on the radio "When the best part of a movie is a talking dog, there's something wrong going with it".</fullReview>

He seemed to 'just not be in the film anymore' he didn't get caught/killed/knocked out etc, etc. One minute he was in it as an evil henchman, and then we didn't see him again.Secondly, how did J and K know where to fly the Merc to? They had said earlier on that they had to find the launch site by a certain time, and then they seemed to go straight there without showing any signs of investigating it.Anyway, the larger roles for Frank and the Worm Guys was welcome and the above questions didn't spoil my enjoyment of a fairly average Saturday night out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many jokes, too little fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to say I really loved Men in Black. I loved the concept of the movie, the special effects where pretty good, it was funny and both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones kicked ass. It was downright entertaining.So I expected something similar. In that I wasn't disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that it's _too_ similar. Everything that made the previous movie a good one is back but unfortunately that doesn't necessarily make this incarnation as good as the previous one. The dude in the pawn shop is back (although in a different role), the noisy cricket and the space-car. All things from the previous movie, plus a couple of new ones (why does there always have to be a new partner in a sequel, I mean seriously, a kid would have been worse but the dog kinda didn't do it for me either) were cranked in less than 90 minutes of movie which results in a story which is confusing despite the fact it would fit on the backside of your movie ticket.There are a lot of different movies that _do_ rock. Go see Signs for REAL Sci-fi, Eight-legged freaks for REAL monsters (that splatter nicer as well) and 51st state for a hero that REALLY talks trash.</fullReview>

I loved Lara Flynn Boyle... but Rosario Dawson (again) was just there for decoration. She looks like she is out of place and she stares most of the time. Will and Tommy are amazing.

		<shortDescription>Cheap sequel for a 97M$ budget film. [might be a spoiler]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is one of the cheapest sequel I've seen in many years.I guess I was really disappointed since I'd really like the first movie. In a nutshell, nothing new. Same old agents, same old gadgets, same old plot.Will Smith tends to overacting and this time he's at the edge of caricature.As for the aliens. Many, too many Aliens has been created here. Most of them are totally ridiculous. From the bright Yellow and Red Chickenish alien to the huge wtfisthat sort of tentacle thingy which takes half of the agency all by itself.About the plot. One mean Alien kills everyone in his(her) way in order to get something from earth back. Does it ring a bell ? Well for me it's the same plot as the first one. Except this time it's not some bug in Edgar Suit but the Hot Lara Flynn Boyle.And the end of the movie, Oh my god ! foreseeable as it can be. The thing is, it is so lame I kept saying to myself that they could not come with something that cheap. And guess what they did it.So the best advice I can give you is to wait for this movie to be on TV and to watch it if you don't have anything more exciting to do (you would have more fun doing your laundry) </fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the brilliant MIB a sequel should have been a no brainer, they even managed to get the original cast, director and writers back so how they came up with this loud messy is anyones guess. Lets start with the plot, ITS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE. A alien menace crash lands on Earth looking for a super powerful weapon, MIB are also looking for it and if they don't get it off the planet blah blah blah... It doesn't even make sense most of the time and any decent ideas are wasted. It wouldn't be so bad if the script was packed full of funny jokes but you've already seen everything remotely funny in the trailer and the rest are ripped off from the first movie. The biggest let down here is the Smith and Jones partnership, Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's thinking of how to spend the money he was paid and Will Smith has fallen back on his Fresh Prince days. The chemistry and dead pan humor is AWOL and been replaced by school playground jokes and product placement (Burger King please go away), go and rent the original its much better. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was almost as good as the first! I had read the book before seeing the second one in the movie theater, and let me tell you this, the book had much more Swearing than the movie.:::Spoiler::::I saw Frank the dog in the first one, and now in the second one, and I wished he would had stayed with Agent Jay, or I wished Agent Jay was not soo hard on him. I do not get the ending, where Agent Kay opens up the door, and they are in a big locker themselves. I mean, it was not in the first one! It was very very good though. I saw it after seeing "Signs" and it was a good movie to cool down on, to get your mind off those scary parts in Signs. In the Book, at the end, Jay had to decide if he wanted to be in Men In Black, or be with Laura, and he decided "we are who we are" and they just used the flashy thing on Laura. In the Movie however, it was that Laura was daughter of the Princess of a planet that needed the light of Zartha, and she flew off in the space ship, off to her home planet, but she did not know that, nor did she remember.In the end of the book, also they showed what happened to the two headed guy, that Agent Kay said that there was probably a place for them in the Post Office (where Agent Kay Worked before Agent Jay got him back into the Men In Black) So, if you see the movie, it is good to read the book too.Anyway, in the end of the both, book, and movie, Agent Jay had a broken Heart. You knew though, as soon as you saw Laura, that Agent Jay liked her, even though many times he said no. the movie was very cool, and a must see movie if you like Men In Black (one). Tommy Lee Jones, and Will Smith are perfect together as Partners, and the Acting is perfect. Lots of the people in the first one were in the second. They had Zed, The PawnShop guy, and even the guy in the first one that got slimed up to the roof, he played the video tape owner.A 10 Out of 10, A Must see for Men In Black lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film for my younger brother's 18th birthday - his choice not mine. I am a fan of the first film. The partnership of young-blood Will Smith (Jay) and veteran Tommy Lee Jones (Kay) was a surprising success and the special effects were fantastic. Sadly, Barry Sonnenfeld has been unable to recapture the magic that made MIB1 such as success.The Smith/Jones partnership that had been such a success in the first film simply wasn't rekindled. As some have already said, Smith has returned to his Fresh Prince roots and has become, in my opinion, irritating and childish! Tommy Lee Jones, an otherwise fine actor, was obviously drawn by dollar signs, as his poor performance demonstrates (although his performance is by far the more memorable of the two). Rip Torn (Zed) is the cast's only remaining asset and the new faces in the film are pretty poor. Vincent D'Onofrio's villain is replaced with yet another 'bug-in-human form', Serleena, this time played by the nonentity Lara Flynn Boyle. Her character is completely wooden and nowhere near as effective as D'Onofrio. She is partnered up with a crappy two-headed counterpart, called Scrad, who, as usual, is a complete idiot. Scrad was also the subject of a bizarre casting decision, as Sonnenfeld opted for MTV's Jackass-star, Johnny Knoxville. Knoxville doesn't perform too badly but there is nothing in the least bit compelling about his character.The lifeless Rosario Dawson comes in as Smith's new love-interest and he falls in love with her within seconds of meeting her. There is absolutely no chemistry between them, unlike there was between Smith and Linda Fiorentino in MIB1. Add to this a surprisingly poor performance from Tony Shalhoub (reprising his Jeebs role) and a nauseating nerd character (David Cross) and you're left with nothing to keep you interested. This situation is compounded by the mandatory array of stupid alien characters (worst of all was the one with testicles on his face), those annoying worms, and Frank the Pug, who begins to grit within ten minutes. The only useful addition was that of Tee, played by Patrick Warburton, but he is dispensed with in the first fifteen minutes (perhaps Smith feeling deservedly threatened). It was Warburton who made me laugh and after he disappeared I sat stony-faced through the rest. Smith just made me cringe.I was prepared for this film to be crap. Sequels always are. However, MIB2 manages to retain the essence of the first film but it doesn't recapture the pace and I think most people will prefer the original. The story is just a recycled version of the original, with all the style and wit removed, and the script is absolutely dire! Anything memorable or original about this film you will have already seen in the trailer. No doubt this francise will just be hammered into the ground until the studios are absolutely positive that it's no longer profitable. Like the Austin Power's films, MIB3 will doubtlessly be the death-knell for the Men in Black but, like the Aliens films, they'll probably make a fourth anyway.Stick with the original.3/10.</fullReview>

The talking dog though was just irritating after a few minutes.If you liked the original, you will love this, if you didn't then the film is entertaining, but lacks the spark of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two great actors in one disappointing sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set five years (why is it always five?) after the first Men In Black, Agent J (Will Smith) has now been working in New York helping to keep the aliens under control. He is also getting through partners at lighting speed. However, he soon gets a chance to work with an old partner again in the form of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Unfortunately, he is now working as a postal worker who has no memory that he was once working for the highly secretive organization known as the Men In Black. It is down to J to get K back to the MIB HQ and to get his memory back as he is the only person who has the key to save the Earth from the new alien threat.It is common belief that if a formula works to repeat that formula. Trouble is, when it has been done once it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to work as well the second time round. This seems to be the case for MIB II. There are some familiar faces from the first film who have much more deserved screen time. Remember the pawn shop owner who had his head blown off, or how about the worms and Frank the Pug. Only trouble is there is nothing really new about the film in the fact it is just basically a repeat of the first with a few extensions on things that we've already seen.Men In Black II is a disappointing shame as it wastes two superb actors in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith who look plain bored and just want to get it out of the way. On a more technical note, the film is superb with some great special effects on display which keeps you watching to see what those wonderful boys at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light + Magic) are going to come up with next.To finish off on a brighter note, the film does have its' funny moments and will put a smile on your face with the Frank the Pug stealing the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly enjoyable sequel boasting good action sequences, often dazzling special effects, some pleasingly funny moments and good-natured performances from the two leads. In a nutshell, a tentacled alien has returned to earth to capture some wonderful light unadvisedly kept here during a previous visit. This light will, if I understood the "plot" correctly, make her all-powerful - or something like that - and only Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) can stop her. Unfortunately, K has been neuralised into an overly efficient postmaster whom Agent J (Will Smith) must de-neuralise back into an MIB! Confused? Who cares! This is all, almost unashamedly, just a vehicle for Smith, Jones and the very latest CGI. A few of the jokes do fall a bit flat with the - not always as sharp as it should have been - script occasionally leaving the lead with the most screen time (Smith) just to flounder. Beyond this, Frank the dog, the megalomaniacal pop star cameo and the "worm guys" really weren't as funny as the filmmakers seem to have imagined they'd be and we could have done without the "joke" which implies a forty year old conspiracy theorist (told off by Agent J for still living with Mom) responds by doing her in with a shovel! At its best, however, MIIB is often ingenious (the clues K must uncover and follow to fully remember where the light is; what goes on in K's locker, how to neuralise the entire city, and so on) and generally entertaining. Overall, this is a decent summer blockbuster which should appeal to fans and non-fans alike (though haters of Will Smith should steer well clear) but will perhaps be enjoyed best of all by those who, like myself, haven't seen the original film since its cinema release some five years ago. Danny Elfman's terrific score was another point in this film's favour!</fullReview>

I don't know about you, but Lara Flynn Boyle is very sexy, but she isn't as good of a villain as Vincent D'Onforio. The movie, if you don't know what its about yet, is about an evil alien who wants something that only K know where it is. Big problem, K was neuralized. So it is up to J to find K, deneuralize him, and save the world from the scum of the universe...again. The movie, with a whole lot more effort could've been the summer's funniest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels are never good movies. And MIB 2 is not the exception. When the producer/writer/director cares only about money, and how to make more of them, it can never end up good. After the huge commercial success of the first part, i expected a sequel. But how can you make a good movie, when the most important part is missing, originality? And how can you make a good movie, when the only goal is to get as many people in theaters as possible?MIB2 is just 90 mins of exageration. More aliens, more bugs, better special effects. Still the movie fails to deliver what fans expected. The gags are so much worse than on the first part, the plot is simply childish, and all you're left with after you leave the theater is the strange feeling in your mouth, that you have watched something weird. A movie with huge investments, talented actors, that is far inferior to most low-budget movies out there. Because, after all, movies are not all about special effects, but about story, plot, characters, actors etc. And MIB 2 suffers in all these categories.Doesn't deserve more than 4 out of 10.And i don't know why, but i have a feeling: MIB3 will be worse than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why spoil a good film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men in black2 is a another example of the narrow mind thinking from Hollywoods big boss.The first film, it was GREAT. Lots of gags, action pack, not too much special effect to spoil the film but enough to keep the audience happy.So, surprise surprise, the bigfish in hollywood decided that if the first film is a success, let throw money money in and make a sequal. One problem though..... the MEN IN BLACK II is terrible!!!!!What's wrong,with it you may ask? well firstly the trailer for the film is suppose to tempt the audience to go and see the film, NOT to show all the gags of the film. Quite frankly, all you need is to see the trailer and you have almost seen the film. Why do we need to pay ?5 to go to see the film again? Also there are too many out of the world special effect that kinda spoil the film. For example, the sence where "Z" was talking to the baddy, and all the sudden, he become the next jackie chan doing moves that can only appear in the matrix..... WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM????? Also as always, some part of the film don't make sense. Lets name 2 of them.... First of them, in the first film, i thought "k" had asked Jake Jeeves (the stolen watch dealer) to leave the planet or he will shoot him. So why is he still selling watch, put himelf on the intenet? Another one is the when "K" and "J" need some weapon, they went back to "K" old house? Since "K" had left the services and was not expected to come back, why would the weapons still there? shouldn't the MIB had collect it back??All in all, a film that you may want to go to see onl;y if you had nothing else to do.............Sorry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think too many people forget the first MIB had the advantage of "coming in under the radar," as Barry Sonnenfeld said. It was original, unexpected and deservedly a hit. It is, of course, impossible to repeat that originality. Obviously expectations were way too high for some, yet there is a lot of originality going on and a lot of good ideas. The premise of bringing K back is not contrived, and it also allows for some back-story, and that's always a good thing in a sequel. The story is strong with a good twist at the end I didn't see coming. The jokes come thick and fast and I completely disagree that they're all in the trailers.The weak points were Lara Flynn Boyle, who was given the part at the last minute so may not have had enough time to prepare, and Johnny Knoxville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing you have to consider when seeing a "Men in Black" movie is that it will just be a "Ghostbusters" with aliens. Nothing more and nothing less. However, "Men in Black 2" is much more improved compared to director Barry Sonnenfeld's previous big-budget special effects effort "Wild Wild West," which also starred Will Smith.I can't say that I'm a fan of the first "Men in Black" movie, the same goes for the second installment. What the audience sees in the second movie is basically the exact same thing seen in the first. Thus, this sequel is even less impressive. If you've been watching the trailers on television, what you see is what you get.In "MIB2," Jay (Will Smith) is trying to get Kevin Brown,(Otherwise known as Kay, played by Tommy Lee Jones)--who now works at the post office--to join the Men in Black once again to stop the evil alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle)--whose shape shifts from a small plant-like alien to a Victoria's Secret model from a magazine--who needs something known as "The Light" before the she destroys the earth. How original.People who thought that the second film would continue where the first film left off, you'll be disappointed. There is no evidence whatsoever that those events ever happened. What we get instead is a remake of the first movie. Therefore you get the sense that you've been there, done that. Unless there is a prequel set sometime in the middle of these two movies, maybe there is still hope for the franchise.Will Smith returns with his funny one-liners, while Tommy Lee Jones prefers to give us his dry humor. Fortunately, since "MIB2" takes place in the present, it's not as awkward to have the modern slang come from Will Smith's pie hole, as it was in "Wild Wild West." I suppose I should be thankful for that. But what about the rest of the movie?People claim that a sequel is supposed to bigger, better, and more elaborate than their predecessors, but it seems that almost all sequels only succeed in the technical aspects, such as the special effects. "MIB2" contains lots of special effects. Some of them are spectacular, while others leave a lot to be desired. For example, there's a worm that lives in the New York Subway tunnel being ridden by Will Smith's character. While this worm is trying to devour a subway, Jay is trying to calm the creature down. Unfortunately, the sequence is too revealing. Sure, it's a creative idea, but revealing effects make the movie less desirable.Some directors don't understand that special effects are tools used to tell a story, not to impress us. I admit that I do enjoy seeing eye candy, it shows how creative some people could be. But there's a time to show it and a time not to show it. Personally, I'd rather see a movie with mediocre effects but a decent story, rather than one taking so much advantage of state-of-the-art technology that they forgot to tell the story. If you do the latter then you end up with things like "The Matrix."Overall, "MIB2" is a big improvement over Sonnenfeld's last sci-fi action comedy, but is that enough? If we ever do see a "Men in Black 3," I'd really like for it to either be a prequel (though that would probably mean no Kay), or for it to start where the previous film left off. There's nothing I hate more than a sequel that opens to a story that has nothing to do with the first movie, which was wide open for a sequel.</fullReview>

And what was the purpose for Micheal Jacksons cameo? No one in the audience laughed, so if it was meant to be funny it didn't work.

All in all if you're a favor of either of the 2 actors or just would like to waste time I'd recommend the movie. But to everyone else that wants to see an original movie my recommendation would be to stay home and rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIB II is a reasonable sequel to its imaginative predecessor. However, like its antecedent, any immediacy generated by the entertaining plot and colorful characters is once again spoiled by the seemingly ubiquitous act of product placement. As with recent hits Minority Report, The Panic Room and Spiderman, the film-makers have compromised their integrity and creativity to add in lucrative shots of cars, consoles, burgers and underwear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original MIB was fresh, funny, and exceptionally original. This lazy follow-up to the 1997 blockbuster tries so hard to repeat the feel of the first film that the creators seem to have thrown all originality out the window. Part one was full of surprises in each scene, and the chemistry between Jones and Smith was electric. Now it feels like all of the same jokes once more and the two leads sleepwalk for the entirety of the 80 or so minutes run time. Maybe they feel that they've done it all before? The villains are totally forgettable, and the talking pug Frank (while entertaining for a scene in MIB1) wears thin after a few moments of screen time. Elfman's fun score is merely rehashed and uninspired. The only truly amusing scene had to be the cameo with Barry Sonnenfeld himself (which I won't spoil).MIB2 isn't a terrible film, but is not a good one either. This is all so unfortunate, as the premise of the MIB has so much potential for a long running franchise. Assuming that a MIB3 is in the future, hopefully the screenwriters will dream up something original and fresh once more. In the meantime, if you're looking for a good Sci-Fi comedy pick up the original or the excellent Galaxy Quest.</fullReview>

Since then, the CIA /FBI have failed to spot the Al Qu'aida terrorists flying planes into the Twin Towers and the world consequently seems a sadder, less innocent place.And so the whole premise for MIB2 has gone - the fact that the US had smart invincible agents to spot any world problems and solve them effortlessly. Our comfort blanket has been removed. The rest of the film is - yawn - special effects.We've moved on. We've got real. The world has changed and we don't laugh so easily at stuff like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected...Not Saying Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black II (MIB2) was definitely much better than I expected for a sequel to the hilarious original MIB. But it was still a disappointment. Tommy Lee Jones looks as though he lost his personality, and Will Smith spends half of his on-screen time on the verge of crawling under a rock. The supporting cast gets worse with Johnny Knoxville rounding it out as the lowest of the low: a horribly unfunny two-headed alien (two heads is even worse TRUST ME).The plot is very reminiscent of the original which would be good, if it made sense. Will Smith "neuralyzes" each of his partners for no apparent reason and Tommy Lee Jones hid "clues" for himself to solve the ending "puzzle." It doesn't take a genius to solve this formula: FAILURE.The creature effects are original. So original in fact that they outshine the dismal acting performances of our leads. The special effects are lacking in every way and they hit rock bottom with the "flashy light show" at the end.Speaking of the end: it couldn't have come sooner. 2/10</fullReview>

The ONLY laugh our theater got was when the chair my husband was sitting in broke and he fell on the floor. All the "cute" characters were utterly annoying (Frank the dog first and foremost) and the plot was muddy and confusing. I have never been so disappointed after leaving a theater. The really annoying thing is that the first one was very entertaining. I know that sequels normally lack a little of the first, but come on! It was like this movie was written by a second grade class. Not good. Not good at all. Please do not see this movie in the theater. Think about passing it up on the rental shelf as well.

		<fullReview>Most reviewers argue that Men in Black II is dumb cash-in standard issue sequel with no story, no script and with blatant product placement to boot.They're right about the product placement and the cash-in part, but this movie is certainly not dumb as such. MIIB goes nowhere near the rock bottom lowest common denominator level of the stereotypical Hollywood comedy that does great in the US but the rest of the world hates it (Waterboy, Caddyshack, Scary Movie to name but a few).The problem with MIIB is not that it's dumb, because it simply isn't. It's not throwing Arnold-type one liners at you; it's not built on toilet humor (if you want a 'rectal' Sci-fi comedy check out the Head &amp; Shoulders commercial "Evolution"); it's not pulling _only_ cheap laughs out of the audience. It's not an intellectual masterpiece, rest assured. But it's street smart.The problem with MIIB is not the story. Yes, it's a complete blueprint of MIB, like any other derivatory bad-guy-gets-it-at-the-end action comedy. But then again you really didn't expect the Marshmallow man to win in Ghostbusters did you.The REAL problem with MIIB is a total lack of HEART, and consequently of TIMING. Nobody cared about this movie. Nobody burned for this movie. This movie was nobody's baby. MIIB is like the fastest guitar solo in the world played by a robot: Everything is in perfect pitch and therefore utterly devoid of emotion. As a result, nothing works as intended. The timing makes no sense at all. People in the theater aren't laughing - but they're not rolling their eyes either, they just sit there completely blank, with a slight touch of confusion. They get the jokes alright, but they're delivered in a context that never allows for a joke to be absorbed, because of what happened immediately before it, or what happens immediately after it. It's as if the entire film is a patchwork of jokes randomly thrown in, like there was an isolated staff of joke writers who just delivered funny dialog, a separate team working on the storyline, and then it was all boiled down into some software that generated the script based on an algorithm with no bare bones timing parameters like "punchline" and "cue".Take Sam Raimi's Spiderman - it's just as predictable and derivatory as anything else in this category, but Raimi _loves_ Spiderman, and probably sits up all night playing with his action figures, and his childish fascination with Spidey makes all the difference, because we can all feel it.I get a George Lucas vibe out of MIIB. It looks great but there's no traces of humanity anywhere. Oh wait, somebody must have liked Frank the dog, because his timing was good for the lion's share of his screen time. And surprise - people laughed.I'm not going to watch MIIB again. I didn't walk out of the theatre hating it or feeling ripped off, I just walked out feeling absolutely nothing. None of the people I went with had anything to say, everyone just shrugged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going on the assumption here that you saw the first MIB (if you didn't, stop reading this now and rent it - it's a fairly good movie). Remember when Agent K was looking in on his wife, with that wistful smile, then stopped when Agent J caught him and came up with the ham-handed "Well, you know, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all." Remember the reply? "Try it." I know what he felt. That's why I was happy (along with many fans of the movie) to see the picture of a smiling Agent K reunited with his wife at the end of the first movie.Well, when they wrote this movie, they must have forgotten about all that, because this movie has about as much emotion as a Kleenex tissue paper. They try reversing the roles this time around, giving Agent J someone to be in love with, but it doesn't work. It's forced on us (after all, if he zaps her like he's supposed to, goodbye movie), and thus I didn't care what happened.Don't get me wrong - this movie still has some funny stuff, including a funny role for Johnny Knoxville (okay, yes, I'm a fan, big deal!), but I'm just glad I was able to get the matinee showing so I wouldn't have to waste any more money seeing this movie than I had to. And at 81 minutes long (not including the end credits), you better not bother going to the bathroom during the middle of the movie - you might wind up missing half the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Even Close To The First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an old expression that the sequel is never better than the original. The expression has proven correct when it comes to many movies except for maybe the Godfather, First Blood, and Austin Powers, all movies which had sequels that were as good if not better than the original (in my own opinion).This sequel, unfortunately, is no exception to the expression. This movie was not the movie the first one was. In fact, it had a weaker plot. Granted the movie had a smarter and more dangerous villian (Lara Flynn Boyle) than in the original, but it did not have the plot to suffice nor the great supporting characters that the first movie had.For one, the Men In Black in the first movie were men who took alien fighting seriously as opposed to Will Smith with his laid back approach to it all. IN this movie, Will Smith plays the straight man, despite some tasteless side jokes, and it just doesn't work for him. He plays more of the character that Tommy Lee Jones did in the first one. It was meant to be a twist of comic irony, but it just doesn't cut it. The rest of the Men In Black in this movie seem pretty stupid. If I were the head of this organization, I would have zapped that red lazer in their eyes the first chance I got! Not even Rip Torn seems to be the same head of the agency he was in the first movie. He seemed to be even stupider that the rest of the MIB wannabes.There were a few funny parts, don't get me wrong. But the movie was made sloppily and didn't live up to the first movie not only with the lack of humor but with the idea of the Men In Black being the rigid, top secret agency with Will Smith as the exception to that rule. In this, the plot was turned upside down and made into a movie even shorter that Lilo And Stitch. Although there was a part that did explain the absence of Linda Fiorentino, this movie seems like it was written by someone who hadn't even seen the first movie. Overall it deserves 4 out of 10 stars in my book. That's all I have to say about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all,I will not write too much except to say that I thought the story was sadly lacking in MIB 2. I did enjoy the first one due to its originality but the sequel just felt tacked on and rushed in an effort to steal our hard earned movie dollars.Mixing slapstick with the occasional violent moment also doesn't work to well with me. I won't mention particular scenes in case you haven't seen the movie yet but I found this film disappointing.The funniest scenes seem to come from the dog disguised alien - even Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones seem to be acting on autopilot most of the time.The villain didn't do much for me either - completely unconvincing - Lara Flynn Boyle should probably stick with 'The Practice'. The climax seemed to happen very quickly and I got the feeling perhaps the studio was running out of money or wanted to get it released quickly.Umm - one word sums up this sequel...Unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was about as uninventive as a sequel could possibly be. Unbelieveably stale jokes, boring special effects, and a completely uninteresting plot to boot. Will Smith practically slept through this movie, showing little spark or interest in the dialogue that he was speaking--but really, who could blame him? Hopefully, he will not continue to agree to take on such drivel, as someone like Eddie Murphy seems to do, time and time again--and look where his career has gone. Lara Flynn-Boyle looked like her usual frighteningly skinny self, while trying to portray some catty dominatrix-type of alien. I love Johnny Knoxville, and his performance couldn't have been more uncomfortably worthless. And poor Tommy Lee Jones, who looked like he was being held a hostage through the production process. Someone rescue him! And the plot, I won't even try to explain, because I don't want to give it away for those of you who still want to go see this movie (and I don't want the other half of you to fall asleep in front of your computer screens). But basically, MIB are on the all-exciting race against time to beat the aliens; MIB MUST FIND THE HIDDEN THING ON EARTH BEFORE THE ALIENS DO AND KEEP THE PLANET FROM EXPLODING!!! There, I just made the movie about as exciting as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends in the Cam and I went to see this with my son (who has fallen in love with this movie). Besides laughing at pie (inside Cam joke) comments, we laughed almost the whole time the movie was on the screen. It moved quickly, giving you little time to breath, as the plot progressed. MIIB isn't Shakepeare, Castaway, or Forrest Gump. It's meant for taking your gal/guy to in the middle of summer, and relaxing for approx. 2 hours or so. I am a Star Wars fan, Trekker, and I liked Batman. MIIB isn't the world's best movie ever. It's not the worst either (there are several that I WOULD classify as that, did someone mention a movie based on Power Rangers or Barney!??). It entertained me. I won't go into details on the plot. Enough other folks have spoiled it enough. I will say though that this movie is considered to be a few years after the first. That DOES make a difference in Jay. In 5 years, any employee improves their skills (and becomes top agent!). Patrick's role as T had me laughing, but then I also liked his role in _The_Emperor's_New_Grove_ . Frank stole the show for me, though! My son sang along with him with "...Dogs...". It was worth the price tag to entertain us without us having to drive to the amusement park (the food concessions were another story!), and I plan to watch it when it reaches the $1 theater in the next two months. I also plan to re-see Spiderman and Epie II there as well. If you are uncertain if it's worth watching, check your own local for the reduced rate theaters and catch it there. It's an acquired taste, but I loved it!(and we're buying ALL the BK toys now, lol!)I give it 6 1/2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who laughed only intermittently during the first movie, no one was more surprised than me when I found myself enjoying MIB2 the entire way through. The first movie never quite seems to find a consistent comedic tone, lurching from slapstick (pinballing through HQ) to darker stuff (the Edgar-suit and any number of casual killings) and back again. In separate movies these bits might be funny; placed side-by-side the transition is jarring, and they tend to cancel each other out.MIB2 finds a much better balance, deploying its humor with a steadier hand. And as a sequel, it works. The villains I didn't find particularly memorable, but they get things moving. Jokes and plot developments that refer back to the first movie aren't simply recycled, they're grinningly sent up (with the exception of the final visual joke, which adds nothing new to its predecessor). New laughs are in plentiful supply. The backwards-clues part of the story is neatly done, and the big twist nicely executed. Best of all, Jones and Smith, despite the changed dynamic between their characters, somehow top even their incredible chemistry from the first movie. That alone is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THEY'RE BACK!!! Agent J, Agent K and those pesky aliens we loved so much in the original have returned to challenge, amuse and most of all take more of your money. The original was fresh, exciting and funny. The sequel isn't so fresh but 2 out of 3 isn't too bad.Will Smith (J) is cool, self-assured and is the lead MIB agent now that Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) has been neuralized. Had they done that to us, we may have enjoyed it more. Speaking of whom, Mr. Jones sleepwalks through most of this sequel even though he was de-neuralized midway through film. Perhaps as a postal worker, but the affect doesn't sell well as an agent of MIB.Patrick Warburton (Agent T) plays the inept partner to a ?T' and does nothing to distinguish himself goes Thank goodness his role is only a cameo. Tony Shaloub is engaging as the pawnbroker, believable as a computer geek and gets his head blown away several times. Once the gag has been played, it should be over. Lara Flynn Boyle better watch out . She plays a very familiar role here as her well known part in `The Practice.' She'll be type cast if she doesn't get out of the lawyerly parts. Agent J's love interest Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson who we all loved in `Sidewalks of New York') plays a very smart character and one can easily fall for her. She'll be back. And watch for a sequence in the film that seems to be taken right out the climax of the original. It warns us that MIB II is just a smaller version of the original.Men in Black II is a sequel so what should we expect? Although this film breaks no new ground, it is funny. The gags are the same yet I heard myself laughing out loud at the dog and the worms and the digs at real celebs like Martha Stewart and Michael Jackson.. Since this is just more of the same ask yourself, did you like the original? Yeah? Well, you'll probably like it this time. And if you don't, at least it's short.</fullReview>

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both solid in this film, and it keeps you laughing much of the time. The film contains a video store scene that is one of the funniest I've seen in quite a while.

Who wouldn't love going to work each day at the MIB headquarters? Rick Baker's special effects make-up is amazing enough to convince me that aliens actually do exist. He should clear some space on his mantle for yet another Academy Award.On the surface, this film is perfect. It's a classic. So, what is my problem with the film? Well, if you examine both the original MIB and this flick closely, you will discover that they are pretty much identical.It appears that the producers for MIB II took some white out and went to town with the script for the original film. They just took the same situations from the first one and switched the characters around. Will Smith's Agent J is now the burnt out veteran Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K was in the original, while Jones has now assumed the role of the astonished rookie. This is not character growth. This is laziness on the part the screenwriter. The locales are similar. The villain has changed, but has the same modus operadi and objective of the first MIB's evil doer. The beginning, the middle, the climax, and the end of MIB II are also astonishingly similar to its predecessor.I can just imagine the conversation that the people behind this blockbuster had before it was green-lit. It probably went something like this . ..Executive #1: "O.K. people, MIB made all of us richer than Paul McCartney. Where do we go from here?"Executive #1's assistant: "Well, you could try something new and original."Executive #1: "Go get me some coffee and then clean out your cubicle. You're fired."Executive #2: "Ding! Ding! I have an idea! Let's make MIB II!"Executive #1: "Brilliant! Who can we get to write the screenplay?"Executive #3: "How about Shane Black? He wrote `Lethal Weapon 1 and 2'."Executive #2: "No can do. He pretty much retired after writing `The Long Kiss Goodnight.' Now he spends most of his time on a bed of money, surrounded by a lot of beautiful women."Executive #3: "How about Ehren Kruger?"Executive #2: "Nope. I have him writing an update of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' for today's generation. We're going for a PG-13 rating."Executive #1: "Wait! I think my assistant has the script of the original MIB saved on her computer in Microsoft Word format! We can just switch the names around and we'll have an entirely new movie! The audience won't care!"Executive #2: "Score! After the money rolls in, I'll finally be able to buy France!"Executive #3: "Um, didn't you just fire your assistant?"Executive #1: "Hmm, you're right. I'll talk to my ten-year-old son. He should be able to churn out a script for us by Monday."We caused this, people! If we keep forking over our hard-earned cash to view more of the same, the studios will never give us anything fresh and original. I love these characters and I wish to see their adventures continue. All I ask is that the screenwriters of the inevitable MIB III come up with something new. Perhaps J and K can travel to another world in defense of Earth. Maybe the film can open with the MIB's attempting take back control of our planet after a devastating full-scale alien invasion. I don't know. Just give me something, anything, other than the same old ideas.Otherwise, I will probably just sell out, again, and pay $10.00 bucks to see same film, only with a Roman numeral three at the end of the title. Oh, the shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIB2 makes for a really good summer diversion, but like many sequels, feels like a lightweight reproduction of the original item. Tommy Lee Jones' return to duty as a MIB introduced an interesting subplot that fills in the story behind the story. But I was disappointed in the focus on Laura Flynn Boyle's wonderful looks over the substance of her mission, which was never fully clear to this viewer.

		<shortDescription>Better than I thought it would be . . . **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, obviously, MIB II wasn't as good as the original "Men In Black", but it was quite enjoyable. It's a typical sci-fi/action film with occasional intelligence.I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but if you want fun, then you've come to the right place.The plot deals with alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) attempting to retrieve some jewel that I don't remember what it was called, so she can take over the universe or something. Agent J (Will Smith) is called upon by Zed (Rip Torn) to deneuralize Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), his partner from the original and the "most feared human in the Universe."This film is a good example of how to use special effects. When the effx are in the background, or just monsters (the worms, Jeffrey the Giant Worm), they are quite effective (though I will admit the worms look kind of cheesy). Not when they're everything (backgrounds, characters, et al), like in "Star Wars: Episode II".Frank the Pug-Dog is funny as well, though he is a bit overused. A swearing dog barking to "Who Let The Dogs Out?" and singing "I Will Survive" is kinda funny, no matter how you slice it. Smith's humor (which was very good in the original [ex.: to an alien/criminal: "You just p*ssin' everyone off today!", and his explanation of why he shot a little girl rather than the aliens in the MIB shooting gallery]) is a bit underused conversly, though he's okay (esp. when spitrapping with the alien postal worker). Jones is stern and occasionally funny, Boyle is sexy and evil, and the rest of the cast is okay (though I wasn't particularly fond of that guy with two heads).All in all, pretty good for an action/sci-fi film. No "Spiderman", but way better than "Episode II".7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsense, unfunny,?@disappointing and plain dull (Spoilers in)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment, oh god! A movie like MIB (1) deserved a 1000 times better sequel than this turkey Mr. Sonnenfeld has delivered (or thrown?) to us. It started ok, nice chick, great body, funny scene. But as agent J comes to stage everything goes down the drain like the flush scene in the deneuralizer room. I mean, Will Smith was supposed to make us laugh as much as he did in the first one or even more (as everyone was expecting after seeing the trailer which shows the sole funny parts of the entire movie!). Instead his acting is so cheap. bi-dimensional. and ultimately bad that after the scene with the worm thing in the subway I could just predict that the whole movie wasn't going to get any better. I was sort of praying for Tommy Lee Jones to save the ranch, as he is a serious, more experienced and better actor than Smith. Instead, he was acting like shaving on a Monday morning! Spirit-less, like just making it for the paycheck and the pressure over him to pull out a sequel. Any of his lines in the movie are even close to funny whatsoever. And of course, let's skip Jonnhy Knoxville part! I'm just gonna say that he indeed proved what he is, a Jackass! I think that the only savable acting among this bunch of disasters is the dog which had the best lines and gave a sort of relief to the pain coused by the rest of the cast.Besides this, the special effects are not even close to good, the only acceptable ones where Frank the dog and maybe the flying car, The rest of it....oh boy!! who did this???? same crew as MIB?? what happened to you guys?? had a glitch in the budget and had to change your Silicon Graphics for Comodores 64 to cover it??? I can't believe that in 2002 and with a similar budget to the first movie (made 5 years ago) you can pull off (not even accidentally) such bad special effects like for instance, the Ivy alien, the Worm alien, Jonnhy knowville second head and so many other cheap, close to B-movie SFX that would be only impressive if they had been done 15 years ago! Specially that part when the pod thing mounts fly on the sky in the last part...GEEZ you could even see the residual blue border around the figure of the black girl inside the pod like in movies from the 80's! Unacceptable. period.This movie sucks, from head to toes. It killed the first movie likewise The Lost World did with Jurassic Park (or even worse). You guys (crew) should put the MIB saga to sleep forever for good. This kind of trash is what I call 'let's forget about art and let's make it just for the money. Let's make it more childish, anyway, kids don't recognize a bad SFX from a good one'. What a shame.1 out of 10.000</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flimsy plot with nothing new.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, spoilers will show their ugly faces.Between the two big sequels that came out recently (Attack of the Clones and Men in Black II), I really can't say which one I am more disappointed in.Men in Black was a great movie. Everything was lush and exciting--all new, all surprising. Men in Black II has nothing new, nothing surprising. When Jeebs got his head blown off and regrown in the first one, I was shocked. It happens again--and again--in the sequel, but nobody in the theaters were horrified. Nobody was even amazed at a giant worm living in a subway system. The worm, by the way, is about the only new thing.Sure, it's great seeing J "retrain" K. That's really funny. But it hardly takes the space it needs in the movie, when the previews made me believe that was what it would mostly be about.Stupid plot. Just plain dumb. A "sexy" (I apply the term loosely) female is bent on stealing the "light" (which is never explained why or what the "light" even is) from Earth, where it isn't supposed to be because K hid it after the Zarthans (yeah, really crummy '70's sci-fi flick kind of name) brought it to keep it away from the evil queen. K neuralyzed himself to rid his mind of the memory, which eventually leads to a huge plot hole.If he neuralyzed himself that long ago, the deneuralyzer should have worked, bringing out that info so he would not have to use his own clues.My betta fish could have written a better screenplay than this. Some one-liners make it funny, but the whole plot is too superficial, cheesy, and thrown together. I felt like it was a mismatched jigsaw puzzle with pieces from four or five different puzzles thrown in and crookedly arranged.I was very annoyed by the movie. It's not that it was slow, it was just too perfect in places and utterly stupid in others. A perfect example of both of these together is that the female that J falls in love with is actually the "light" (or so I presume, since that part is so foggy), the daughter of K's beloved Queen of Zartha, and the princess of Zartha. Not only that, but the evil queen is in the pizzeria with her and doesn't even realize that's what she's looking for.Not to mention that the evil queen is defeated WAY too easily. Come on, the bug in the first one took a lot of effort. This antagonist only needed to be lured by the new flying car (with a really cool control mechanism, I must add) into the giant worm's mouth. Not too tough.Like I said, everything was new with the first. This time everything is repeated and I felt like I was just watching the first one with a fairy tale atmosphere around it. I was thoroughly disgusted and hope that if MIB III comes out, it will resemble the other two but still be unique in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to be really disappointed in this movie. I mean, it tries so hard to please. It's short (VERY short) and there's nothing about it that is really horrible. To be sure, the performances are good. The dog is funny. The aliens are freaky. It's everything we'd expect from the team that brought us the original Men In Black, right? Well, no. Not exactly. There's nothing new about this movie. Nothing that expands the world set up in the first movie. It doesn't go off in any new directions. It's basically just a rehashing of the original. Like I said, it's hard to NOT like a movie that features Tommy Lee and Will doing what they do best. But by the same token, it's really hard to LOVE this movie, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It doesn't deserve all the negative comments and reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains mild spoilers.Well, a week ago I finally saw Men in Black II (MIB2). Having read lots of negative user comments and critical reviews, I feared when I finally went to see it on the big screen that I would be appalled by what I saw, that it would be the worst sequel since Speed 2 or Batman &amp; Robin (Not that I went to see either of THOSE movies. I pity the trusting souls that DID go to see them.) Well, I saw it, and I almost liked it: No, of course it wasn't as good as the first MIB. But how many of us really expected the sequel to be as good? On its own terms, this movie is a fine summer entertainment, with enough laughs, thrills and special effects to rate as acceptable escapism; if it were not a sequel to a superior movie, I doubt that anybody would be attacking it so harshly. I was satisfied that the filmmakers kept this movie short and sweet, innocuous enough for kids but not so childish that adults can't enjoy it as well.Whatever plot this movie cares to have is established (sort of) in its priceless opening sequence, which spoofs UFO-speculation series of the '70s and '80s, and is hosted by Peter Graves (of course!) During the opening credits we see a spaceship obliterating planets, and we know that EARTH IS IN DANGER. We all know how the movie will proceed storywise, more or less, from this point forward; in a movie like this the plot is incidental. What mattered in the first MIB were the interesting characters, their lively dialogue, the surprises both funny and scary, and most of all the movie's style: the quirky, subdued manner in which the story was told. MIB2 possesses these qualities as well, but unfortunately it has slightly less to offer in every category than the first movie did (it is, after all, a shorter, smaller movie), and many people have not been able to forgive this shortcoming.If everything in MIB2 was as funny and inspired as the opening sequence with Peter Graves, it would have been a great sequel indeed. But several of its notable gags misfire or fall flat: I can remember four or five separate instances in the movie in which director Barry Sonnenfeld failed to make the jokes at least as funny as they must have looked on paper. At one point, for example, agents Jay and Kay make a quick escape from MIB headquarters by being "flushed," as the room they occupy turns into a giant toilet; this absurd but undeniably funny idea should have been foolproof, but somehow it falls flat, perhaps because it's over almost as soon as it begins: the movie doesn't give us a chance to laugh at what's happening, and (even worse) gives us a punchline that's not very funny (or perhaps only poorly delivered). In another scene, MIB chief Zed (Rip Torn) attempts to fight off Seerleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) by hovering in mid-air, Matrix-style, and kicking her in the face several times. This moment was obviously intended to parody The Matrix, but it's not especially funny because it's not very inventive: Sonnenfeld and the writers apparently thought the mere sight of the elderly Rip Torn performing Matrix-style acrobatics would be enough to make the audience laugh, with no elaboration or explanation necessary. Many potentially funny moments in this movie are ruined by conceit and sheer laziness in the writing: Johnny Knoxville's alien character is given two heads, but no memorably funny lines; the writers apparently thought the mere sight of a two-headed Johnny Knoxville would be enough to make the audience laugh. How hard is it to write jokes about a two-headed alien?Although MIB2 can't match the laughs of the first movie, I still enjoyed it, and I recommend it, for two simple reasons: Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. They are great fun to watch together, and Sonnenfeld, to his credit, gets some hysterically funny moments out of them both. You'll laugh to see Smith wrestling with computer-generated monsters of all sizes: I dare say he earned his money for this movie, which required of him enough pratfalls to fill a Jerry Lewis movie. You'll laugh to see Jones maintain his deadpan expression no matter how silly the action around him: even while hanging upside-down in an elevator, trading shots with a robot that's spewing machine-gun bullets (that's right, machine-gun bullets) at him, he responds with calm courage and cool sarcasm. He's a great guy to plunge so eagerly into such silliness, especially since he's old enough to know better: he has more lines on his face than Jack Palance, yet here he is shooting two little shiny laser guns while hanging upside-down. Smith and Jones: together they recapture the first movie's larger-than-life sense of fun, and give this sequel its most entertaining moments.Please go see this movie, if you feel the need for big-screen entertainment in the next week or two; yes, it has some bad gags in it, but that flaw doesn't make it terrible, or unworthy of the first movie. Except for the bad gags, I would have given this movie a solid 7 out of 10; except for one or two inappropriate moments that hint at black comedy, this is a warm, lighthearted movie that amused me even during its bad moments, and left me feeling good by the time the credits rolled and Smith started singing "black suits coming." I prefer a flawed film that leaves me feeling good to a critically acclaimed film that would probably leave me feeling bad if I saw it. All the evidence suggests that The Road to Perdition is a good movie which does not life the spirits of its audience; the self-serious people who hate MIB2 should go see it. I'd rather see MIB2 again, which sadly seems destined to be one of the last enjoyable movies of the summer.Rating: 6</fullReview>

I guess that's what people want these days, fast food entertainment. And that's what you'll get with this movie.I was surprised by the first one because I didn't think I would like it from the trailers but it turned out to be a fun (and funny) movie...Men In Black II is the disappointment I expected the first time around.Still, if you don't want to think and like shiny objects, maybe this will be the ten out of ten experience you're after.</fullReview>

It is supposed to entertain.It's not the best movie out there, granted (although I found it A LOT more enjoyable than "Episode II"). It's not the sequel I expected to see (Agent K is very subdued this time). And it isn't as imaginative as the first time (probably because shock value is a one time trick). But it's entertaining, a bit disturbing (watch out for the closing scene - it tops the first one's ending), funny (Frank dressed up as an MIB agent is one of the funniest scenes I can remember in a long time), and at parts, clever.It doesn't try to be a serious sci-fi film. It merely seeks to entertain. And I was entertained for as long as the movie lasted.Again - it's not the sequel I expected, but it's not as bad as many of the comments say. And yes, I do think it's a lot better (as far as entertainment value goes) than "Episode II". Big surprise, huh? :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent special effects wasted on anemic sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommie Lee Jones and Will Smith reprise their roles as Agents J &amp; K in Barry Sonnenfeld's sequel to the enormously successful Men in Black of 5 years ago. This time their roles are reversed. Will Smith portrays the veteran anti-alien agent and Jones is the naive postal worker whose knowledge of aliens has been neuralized (wiped out). When the earth is threatened by Lara Flynn Boyle (as the new alien villain), Jones is brought out of "retirement" and restored to partnership with Smith. It sounds like it should work, but it is only fitfully amusing and not very exciting. However, the special effects are even more elaborate than in the original, but it isn't enough. The only thing that saves the film is a canine alien agent who has a leaning towards singing songs like "I Will Survive" and "Who let the dogs out?" He steals the show from the stars. The movie itself is mercifully short (88 minutes, with about 10 minutes of credits making the body of the film only 78-80 min. long, or short, as it were). So if you liked the original, you might enjoy this one. It just isn't fresh or original, just a money-making rehash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couldn't watch for more than 5 minutes. Boring.The first Men In Black was incredibly engaging from the instant the music began through the end. This one sucked with that stupid opening sequence with Peter Graves with "supposed-to-be-bad-special-effects" that were NOT funny, just lame.Early on in the movie Patrick Warburton grabs something that looks like a dandelion from a city sewer grate, which turns out to be a piece of a huge alien that becomes angry at Warburton's grab. The monster jumps out of the sewer and chomps on Warburton.In the first film the MIB were always careful not to let the public see aliens. If an alien was spotted, they had to bring in their "containment" crew to undo the PR damage. Here, they simply don't care who sees it.Typically sloppy for a Hollywood sequel to simply disregard all the elements that made it a good story in the first place.One good thing about this movie. Now I know to avoid Barry Sonnenfeld films. For a while after I saw Men In Black I actually thought he was a good director. Although I never got suckered into Wild Wild West (never appealed to me at all). Another good thing. I was able to get a refund for this film after the first 5 minutes and got to see another film.</fullReview>

There was *nothing* in it except for light and mostly stupid fun. The dog definitively had the best lines. Jones and Smith looked and acted as if it was only the rehearsal. There was no spirit, no real story, no real wittiness building up throughout the whole movie. Even many Special Effects where simply bad ! The ending is incredibly dull, repeating the one of the first movie (which was cool) just on a smaller scale. It looked...thrown in. The movie felt like a cup of coke after 2 days in the sun. What where they thinking ? I mean, are the people involved in this aware of the piece of crap they produced ? One guy in the cinema went to cash desk and shouted "i want my money back" :) The cashier had a agonized look on her face :)When reading the 95% similar comments here i'm somewhat disturbed about the high rating, who are those people ?

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with the expectation that it would be better than the first one (based upon comments from colleagues at work). I was disappointed. It is not that it is a bad movie, but more that it lacked the cohesion and plot integrity that the first one had. A notable example is that although we are told that the earth faces imminent annihilation, we are never really sure why or how this would be carried out.. even after the movie ends.Another thing that bothered me was that in the first movie, you feel that Will Smith's character is smart, on the ball, but a little rough around the edges and will grow to be a great agent. In this movie, although he certainly demonstrates that he knows more about all the various alien species, he comes across as being less capable than he was in the first movie. I was looking forward to him being more competent, and less of a bumbler.In short, the movie was entertaining and definitely worth seeing, but it lacked the charisma and tight story line of the first one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II was, to say the least, bad. To this day, I really have no idea why I saw it on opening weekend. I guess it was the hype talking to me in my sleep. The movie had no heart. Will Smith received somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 million to basically go through his lines. There was no uniqueness about the movie that made the original Men In Black so fun to watch. I think Tommy Lee Jones and Lara Flynn Boyle had the exact same face the entire movie. It really seemed like the movie was made just for money, and it appears to be working in that aspect. Sub-par sequel to a blockbuster movie + holiday weekend = big money.The only time that my friends and I laughed during the movie was during the appearance of David Cross. He steals the scene and perhaps the movie. If you haven't seen him in Mr. Show, I suggest you track it down. Very funny stuff, unlike this brainless drivel.4 out of 10</fullReview>

Instead of going to see it at the movies, you can just sit at home and watch it on your t.v.I liked the first MIB. It was very original. But I'm sure Will Smith will make it up in the future. But overall Jones and Smith tried to keep the movie on track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is OK if you want to "neuralize" your intellect for 88 minutes for some mildy amusing mindless fun. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make the movie survivable. However, it is pretty bad when a dog gets all the good laugh lines! I found the first film completely forgettable, and this goes the same way. Must be that neuralizer again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycled material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good things about this movie (besides Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones' acting) were the dog, and a few of the special FX scenes. Other than that it was mostly recycled material from the original, hastily put together, below-average plot line, and a very unsatisfying ending. Looks like the movie was made by a studio "suit" in order to make money, and not a real writer in order to make a good film. Save your money; rent the first one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones will entertain you the whole time with laughs, action packed sequences, cool new gadgets, and classic alien friends/enemies. Although charecters pop in and pop out (this movie requires full concentration- no getting up to go to the bathroom!) the storyline is good and even has a bit of thematic elements in the end, but i won't go into that. This film has major action and will please all movie-goers! Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the first MIB came out everyone was in a haze of the effects that had gone into it and everyone was talking about the aliens and plot but the second one did not live up to the standards of the original. If your going to go out and make a sequel, make it so that people talk about the sequel and not think back to the original. You want to blow the first one away and out of your mind.The same thing goes with Jurassic Park, first was good and then it just kept going down hill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok,I just got back from watching MIB II and all I can say is, why did I waste my time? I should've waited for it to come on DVD. MIB 2 picks up 5 years after the first. This time around Lara Flynn Boyle is the baddie, who's acting was truly worse than her character. Each of the characters seemed lost within a world that both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith created in the first movie. I felt that it was totally rushed and there was no continuity throughout the picture.It was nice to see Peter Graves in the film. I honestly thought that he'd passed on, but lord and behold, he's alive and well. There were elements within this film that I thought were good. Frank the dog was great comic relief, and the "worm guys" were cool for a chuckle or two.The dissapointment came from the main characters, Jones and Smith. Each seemed to be trying to find more than the "light", they were trying to find the characters. Jones truly was not in character as "K" and Smith was trying to hard to be "J".I truly felt that the story could've been better. The whole idea that K was in love with someone else just doesn't fit with his whole "view his love from a distant" in the first. Barry Sonnefeld shouldn't be blamed for the directing, the film editor should've been fed to the worm in the sewer.Don't go and see this in the theatre, and if you have, build yourself a neuarlizer and zap yourself to forget this dissapointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, the original Men in Black was funny and had an interesting plot that kept me entertained. The sequel may have looked good on paper, but it wasn't nearly as good as it could (or should) have been. The storyline seemed to run out of energy part way in and just trudge along until the end, which was much too soon as the film was unbelievably short. I'm sure a lot more could have been added to make MIB 2 a lot more interesting. If a Men in Black 3 is to be made, hopefully there will be a lot more substance in its plot.On a positive note, Will Smith was quite good (and Tommy Lee Jones was OK). Some of the humor was funny (SPOILERS: the brief Michael Jackson scene and the black driver that "kept getting pulled over") and the special effects were quite well done.Did anyone catch the white buildings to the right of the screen when the giant worm alien was breaking out of the ground and attacking Will Smith and his partner? Looked like the base of the World Trade Center to me.Overall I'd give Men in Black 2 a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Men in Black is one of my favorite movies. It was a perfect blend of action and comedy. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith played perfectly off each other and the supporting cast was impeccable. It also had something of a timeless quality. When I first saw that a sequel was nigh, I was quite excited.What a let-down.MIB II was far more sappy than the original. It was touching to see K pine after the woman he could never have, but to see J making out with a girl who (of course) turned out to be the treasure they sought was too much. The entire point of the MIB is that they are unable to have those kind of attachments. The comedy was also way too topical. Frank barking along to the Baha Men was a little funny the first 170 times I saw it on TV, but in ten years, who will remember that was supposed to be funny? Also, I respect a little commercial tie-in with big summer movies of this like, and even a little product placement, but MIB II seemed like a 90-minute commercial. I got over that real quick. Oh, and I don't know why, but I don't really buy Will Smith's Ghetto-speak anymore. About the eighth time he referred to something as a "joint" I was ready to neuralize him.</fullReview>

Part X-Files spoof(the show's popularity was at its peak) part Ghostbusters the movie was unique because it featured a hilarious talking dog, a guy who could grow his had back after having it blown off, a woman who gave birth to a squid, heroes in the most ordinary-looking suits who never lost their cool, witty dialogue, and one of the most bizarre villans I have ever seen. Well, MIIB is a carbon copy of the first. Except for the part about the witty dialogue, the villain (Famke Jenssen has got to be happy she jumped ship), it being unique....oh what the hell. I hope everybody involved enjoys their fat paycheck. Based on the bad reviews bad word of mouth and a spectacular second week freefall at the box office, I'm guessing the studio exec who even mentions a MIIIB will be neuralized.

Will Smith is great and the special effects are terrific and how can you not love a talking dog! I really liked this movie as summer fodder and if you go in expecting that, you won't be disappointed. 2002 has been a much better year that both 2000 and 2001 and this film benefits from having director Barry Sonnenfeld back in charge and his vision continues until we see 'Men in Black III' where I hope he will return as the man in charge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm going to say what I thought about the movie, although it seems to me as though I'm one of a very small handful who feels this particular way.I loved it. I simply loved it. It was funny and enjoyable. Will Smith did a wonderful job of looking lonely. You could really feel how much he truly missed Agent K. I loved how we found out that he had been neuralizing all his partners. Sure, it's very cliche plot-wise, but *I* thought it was interesting.I think the person who did the best job in this film was Tommy Lee Jones. He was wonderful throughout the whole film: his confusion and skepticism when Agent J tries to bring him back to NYC; his amused naivety when watching Agent J talk to the alien who had the makeshift deneuralizer; his sorrowful, tear-filled expression when remembering the true story of the Ambassador he had fallen in love with. That scene in particular had me *so* close to crying myself. Tommy pulled it off so well, it really tugged at my heart-strings...Frank the Pug was my favorite alien. I loved his rendition of "I Will Survive" and the hilarious "Who Let the Dogs Out?" scene.Anyway, basically, I absolutely loved this film, and having not seen the first movie since it first premiered, MIB II was completely new to me.Here's hoping there's an MIB III!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allow me to preface this commentary by stating 'I am a huge fan of Will Smith and do believe him to be an incredibly talented actor'. Nonetheless, upon leaving the theatre, I couldn't help but feeling cheated out of another $8 for a Will Smith movie!Men in Black II, while having a great ensemble cast, being visually stunning and displaying some mastery of 3-D special effects wizardry, is a movie that suffers from a severe case of 'bad Hollywood sequel writing'. Without going as far as to reveal the plot, this movie does little more than set itself up for another sequel. I left the theatre asking more questions than when I entered but felt dissatisfied with the fact that I just paid $8 to see a 2-hour trailer for Men In Black III. Everything about the movie, and especially the ending, hints at the fact that Hollywood is already preparing for another Men in Black.In a summer chockfull of sequels, Men in Black II is probably the worst of the crop showing Hollywood Script Writing at it's worst. In short, aside from having all the original cast members and great 'eye-candy', the movie lacked the true substance necessary to make it worthy of the title 'A great sequel to a great movie!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When riding on the coattails of its predecessor, a sequel should at least ?attempt' to out-do the first story. Whether or not it succeeds in this endeavor usually remains to be seen. Men In Black II fails and no effort at this attempt seems obvious.If you recall the first Men In Black, it gave us something we really hadn't seen before? a sci-fi action flick, with a comedic twist. The story set itself up nicely upon opening, and the plot had direction and a place to go. The film was full of fresh ideas, filled with new and exciting concepts into the whole ?alien-conspiracy' theories. The effects were clearly thought out and worked very well? but I digress, as this is a review of the sequel.?and a much anticipated sequel from the original fan-base. However, as anticipated and as over-promoted as MIB2 was, it should incite something the audience yearns to go see, something equally fresh as the original gave us. Unfortunately, it does not, and it fails in almost every aspect.It's a mild distraction at best? and most of what we see in MIB2, is not fresh and new, in fact merely a re-hash of what made us laugh, and awe over in the first one. We re-visit Jeebs, the pawnshop owner with the floating eye (and you can BET you know what happens to him ? almost like you expect it to happen) to Frank the Pug (the talking dog) who spouts of one-liners in an attempt at dog-humour. We even run into the worm-aliens (you remember, from the coffee-room in the original movie)? who seem only to be present for the mere re-hash effect. They lend very little to the plot.What little we do see that is new, really isn't all that exciting, nor does it lend itself well to the story. The trailers for MIB2 depict a scene with a huge worm eating the subway train. This is probably the most thrilling and most involved sequence in the movie, and since you've already seen it in the trailer, the scene won't surprise you when it appears in the theatre.As for the acting, it might be hard to tell but it would seem that Will Smith and Tommy-Lee Jones do their best to carry their characters over from the first movie into this sequel. And for what little substance there is to this plot, they seem to give what they can to their characters, almost in an effort to make up for a bad story. Lara Flynn Boyle, the antagonist, is neither as threatening nor convincing a villain as Vincent D'Onofrio was in the first movie. And Johnny Knoxville? well I can't figure how he got into the movie, except maybe that he can just about handle the role of a bumbling villain side-kick.The one thing I did admire, however, was the subway locker. The scene didn't last long, but it was perhaps the most original element of the entire movie, that didn't lend itself to being recycled from the first.Otherwise, I was quite disappointed from this effort. I really don't recommend seeing it. This movie is only 88 minutes long, so if you still feel you can bring yourself to part with 9 bucks to go see it, at least not much of your time will be wasted.</fullReview>

There are a few comedic parts, but many of them were shown in commercials and in the previews. I was terribly dissapointed. I felt like throwing a rock at the screen.

		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely terrible. If it wasn't for the actors and the cool gadgets/sets, I would have left halfway through. The first movie is in my top 15 favorite movies. I loved it, and was rightly excited about this sequel. Well, everything that made the first movie good, made this one bad. The writing...absolutely atrocious. Felt like it was written by a kid who watched too much tv. The acting...D'Onofrio was great in the first one. Lara Flynn Boyle sucked as the bad guy in this one. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were good as usual, but you can only do so much with that kind of a script. The Jeeves character's scenes in this one were so stupid, I couldn't believe it was the same guy. Basically, if you saw the trailers for this movie, you saw the only good scenes. I hope this retires the franchise permanently, because to go from a movie of the first's caliber to this pathetic piece of garbage is quite demoralizing for this movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black is one of the most unique, funny and fresh movies I've ever seen...and I've seen my share of movies. Unfortuanately, Men in Black II failed to live up to its predecessor. I work in a movie theater, so I get into a lot of movies for free. I actually had to pay to see this movie and ended up kicking myself. MIB II is seriously lacking in plot and originality, and has very little of the charm that MIB hooked fans with. Will Smith is a hilarious actor, and Tommy Lee Jones isn't too shabby either, so the superficial story and writing surrounding them seems a bit ridiculous. I left feeling that the sequel was created not for the purpose of fascinating audiences, but out of an obligation to make some money. Millions of people saw MIB in theaters and bought the movie...might as well cash in on a sub-par, mediocre sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Men in Black may be back, but they're not in top form. Here is a film that proves really good movies are more than the sum of their parts. Most of the reasons to see the original MiB are here--and there's still something missing, leaving the sequel to feel pale by comparison.The original, you will recall, ended with Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) erasing his memory and returning to the girl he left behind when he joined the boys in black so many years ago, while Agent Jay (Wil Smith) carried on with the Linda Fiorentino character as a partner. Years later, both Kay's girl and Jay's partner are out of the picture (both incidents are permitted only the briefest of expositions), and Earth faces a new threat from Serleena, an alien that looks like a piece of cooked asparagus in her most basic form but who usually takes on the appearance of Lara Flynn Boyle.Serleena means business--during the opening credit sequence she wastes more planets than the Galactic Empire managed in an entire trilogy. She's looking for a MacGuffin called the Light of Zartha--and since Kay supposedly knows where it is, Jay has to go re-recruit him from his life as a mild-mannered postal worker.As in the first film, there's good chemistry between Smith and Jones, who trade one-liners with relaxed flair. Some bit players from the first film--a talking pug and some fast-living worm-like creatures--make a good showing in supporting roles. And again, many laughs are provided by the extra-terrestrial explinations for a lot of Earth's oddities: my favorite involves Jay and a hefty alien communicating by means of spit rap.Perhaps what MiBII misses most is a sense of urgency--the notion that the characters regard their situation to be of utmost importance. We're told that if the Light of Zartha isn't off the planet by a certain time, it will destroy the Earth, but the threat never seems to hold any weight for the characters. They're detatched, and as a result so are we. Likewise, Jay is given a love interest in the persona of Rosario Dawn (some listings give the character's name as Rita, but I'm sure I heard her spoken of as Laura in the film), but the two never really strike sparks.The original "Men in Black" had an edge to it, a sly tongue-in-cheek attitude and an occasionally creepy aura that the sequel never manages. Instead of the black comedy one might expect, we end up getting comedy with cream and sugar--not entirely unsastisfying, but not what we wanted either.</fullReview>

Even Will Smith seems to be bored this time, his one liners only work a couple times, Jones is OK , his wry style is there but he has nothing to do except cash in his paycheck.

		<fullReview>This is a subversively humorous film, and I guess some people take themselves too seriously nowadays. They can't admit to themselves that they may not be living well, or understanding things properly.In their rush to judge, many people miss the poignance of certain moments, or the clever way they set up the conflicts that people's preconceptions get them into.I found many moments in this movie to be quite funny, and so did the audience I was sitting with. There were some patches of long silence, but there were a number of good scenes to make up for that, and many of those scenes were very original, especially compared with the humor out of most movies out there.I think it's important to note that while other movies have humor in them, this is one of those few that seems to have a SENSE of humor there, a consistent pattern of expectations played with. Evidence that the people who made the movie, even if they didn't make The English Patient, took some pride in making the movie.Isn't that what we want from filmmakers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential...so little time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers I was sorely disappointed with Men in Black 2. I think all of my gripes, though, are because of the ludicrously short run time. It was barely longer than an episode of Law &amp; Order. Because of the shortness, I found problems with the plot, mostly. ***SPOILERS*** I'm watching the movie, enjoying the interaction between Dawson and Smith, but then ten minutes before the end, the script reads like, "by the way Jay, she's an alien." However, that pathetic plot twist sort of explains the random "She has the bracelet that points to the light" scene. The ending was so weak. She leaves, and the boys start into some sad comic relief to build up to the same "we're insignificant in the universe" twist ending THAT THE FIRST ONE HAD! Not to say the whole movie was bad. Good to see the Worms again, the subway scene was hilarious, and I love the video rental zealots of C-18. The Warburton cameo was pointless, the MJ thing was only in there because he asked Sonnenfeld to put him in it, and it just came off as a "look at me everyone! I'm laughing at myself!! Like me! Buy Invincible!!!!!". Knoxville, although a funny character at points, also seemed to just be in there to say, wow, the Jackass guy is in here too! The video store/attic apartment scene was great, though, and David Cross was probably the only cameo I liked other than Peter Graves. So, to summarize, while funny in several parts, this movie was too short to develop an intriguing plot, but just long enough to fill with purposeless cameos. I think I liked the Attack of the Chub-chubs or whatever it was called better.By the way, I HATE Frank. They were going for a Shrek Donkey, but they got Jar-Jar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie definitly has Sonnenfeld's offbeat signature, but was lacking in plot format. The only real problem with it was its repetative theme. As is the case with most sequels, it leaves a bit to be desired. Will Smith (Agent J) does his usual comic relief, while Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) comes back with his (typically sarcastic) charisma. There are a few new faces thrown into the mix, as well as a few old ones. None of this, however, makes up for its lack of appeal. I was a little disappointed with this one, but not completely let down. I did like that the dog (Mannix) was given a wider array of jokes. I felt they could've done more with him in the first MIB movie, and I was glad they took the opportunity (in the sequal) to do so. Comedy-wise, this movie has basic leftovers. Plot-wise, it left me wishing there had been more. All in all, I enjoyed what was put together, but I think this one can be set aside until it's release onto video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first MIB was fresh and fun. It took an interesting twist on the old buddy cop formula - one a stiff and one a loose cannon.MIB II had a tough road to go. The freshness was used up in the first movie. They had the same two lead guys so they lost the best vehicle for fun - the shock and surprise of the new guy. We did get a bit of fun at the start with Patrick Warburton but it was all too short.The dog had the best lines, no doubt about it. The movie would have been much funnier if they kept the dog and left Tommy Lee Jones in the mail business.It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't nearly as fun as the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steaming Turd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from this movie, but it managed to surpass my lowest expectations. WHAT a massive steaming turd sits there on the screen. Everyone involved should be ashamed. By now we're used to movies without plot, but this one didn't even have a beginning, middle, and end! It just starts, goes, and stops. It's over before you feel like it's begun. If something worked in the first movie, you have ten times as much here. The audience I saw it with chuckled lightly maybe twice, and that was it. Anything worth seeing was in the preview. You would think that if you have to spend so long making a film, you would try to make something that is in some way worthwhile, if only to keep yourself interested.What was particularly repulsive were the moments when we're supposed to feel deep emotion for the characters. "Okay! Feel emotion now! Okay, now back to the spaceships!" I hope everyone involved enjoys their paychecks, I'm sure they will. If you loved "Men in Black," my advice is: rent "Men in Black." This movie succeeds best at being an 88-minute commercial, which is essentially what it is. You might save yourself $10 and just stay home driving bamboo underneath your fingernails. Just an option.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the winner of the worst summer movie of 2002 to feature a talking dog is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am saddened to see that I have a maximum of 1000 words to describe the train wreck that is Men In Black II. Actually, the train wreck comparison isn't really fair, train wrecks elicit the famous rubber-necking syndrome, where human nature and its fascination with abomination demand at least a cursory glance at the smoldering wreckage. Men In Black II does nothing to make me want to watch it other than the chance to participate in a fun game of counting up how many different things Will Smith refers to as "joints" in the movie. Will Smith also uses this movie as an opportunity to produce another hit single. And by hit single I mean 70's song which he steals the music from, changes the words to, and then says "ha-ha" a bunch of times during.Speaking of Will Smith, he returns to play his I'm-Will-Smith-and-I'm-in-a-movie-but-I'm-not-playing-Ali-so-I'll-just-prete nd-this-is-an-episode-of-the-Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air character that he's honed to perfection over the years. Taking his side for part of the movie is that talking dog from the first movie who has inexplicably risen his status from scum bag informant to MIB agent material because he is selected to be Will Smith's partner for a brief, although not nearly brief enough, portion of the movie. At this point numerous gags are made based on the fact that the dog is talking. This of course is funny because dogs don't actually talk. Pushing the inane envelope even further, to the point where I developed a facial tick, was when they had the talking dog sing along with the hit #1 single, Who Let the Dog's Out. Sony was obviously trying to cash in on the booming success of Disney's Snow Dogs, and I have to say that although I have not seen Snow Dogs, I liked it better.The phrase cash in reminds me of another great feature of MIB II, the ubiquitous product placement. If you didn't know that Burger King and Sprint were tied to this picture before you see it, you certainly will after. Not that it interferes with the plot, since Sonnenfeld didn't seem to bother with finding one. What little semblance of a plot there is seems mainly concerned with fiddling around with the ending of the last movie so that Tommy Lee Jones can appear again in this one. Other than that, there's some Light of Zarra, or something, that can blow up the world somehow, or something, thereby leaving the audience with a feeling of suspense, or something."But Adam, summer movies don't need plots," you say, "just so long as they keep me laughing." Well I'm sorry my friend but every joke in this movie falls into three categories. 1. Hey, I remember that from the trailer. 2. Hey, I remember that from the first movie. 3. Right, I get it, its a talking dog. The part of the movie I found funniest was the guy sitting behind me in the theater who laughed uproariously at such scenes as, Will Smith driving up to a post office, or Will Smith saying "I'll be in the gym." He also liked the talking dog. Did I mention there's a talking dog? At least we know Sonnenfeld is laughing, laughing all the way to the bank. And good for him, he deserves it.The actors themselves weren't that bad, even if you'd seen most of them before. As for the new ones, there was a slightly attractive love interest for Will Smith who I wish was hotter but didn't do anything to directly detract from the movie. You get to see most of Lara Flynn Boyle's breasts, which are remarkably large for someone who weighs 24 pounds. Jimmy Knoxville plays a dopey alien side-kick competently enough I suppose. The strange thing about Knoxville's character is that he seemingly vanishes without explanation about 2/3 of the way through the movie. However, in all honesty, they may have explained it and I just missed it while I was distracted by lighting myself on fire. There's also a talking dog, but I think I talked about him already.All in all this movie was a double barreled misfire. No plot, not funny, no writers, no ending, but hey at least it was only 80 minutes long, that's $.10 a minute at your typical movie venue, a rate that could be much better utilized by calling your grandma in Topeka long-distance and telling her you love her. I honestly don't understand how anyone living outside of Kentucky or Upstate NY could possibly enjoy this movie. Do not go see this movie, I repeat, do not go see this movie. Take the $8 you would have spent on the ticket and play some mini-golf, buy your girlfriend an ice cream cone, make a donation to Greenpeace, something anything besides sitting in a darkened room for 80 minutes and trying to keep from scratching out your own eyes with the straw from your $4 soda. My recommendation is to wait for it to come out on video, and then rent something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far a sequels go, Men in Black II isn't bad, but it fails to captivate and amuse the audience like the original film did.The film is packed with whiz-bang computer aliens and plenty of jokes, but the film just seemed like a re-hash of the first. It never seemed like the film was exploring new territory in the Men in Black universe. Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Rosario Dawson give good performances throughout the film, but the plot is often hard to follow. Sadly, this film falls short because of the excellent quality of the original Men in Black. When you are watching the sequel, you can't help but wonder how good it could have been.Still, it provides (at times) good, if forgetable, entertainment and should be seen by anyone who enjoyed the original. **</fullReview>

Only you have to watch the entire film to see what you can see in the previews!!

Then at the last minute he's like OH ya... And there goes the credits!!! Buy Buy!! Hell they could have added an extra 40 minutes to the film and make 'er a real long one, that had some kind of a plot and some funny stuff, and I would have been there!! But know, it's like alright, theirs the beginning, beginning, ok what's happening, there looking for clues to find out something that will jog his memory, Oh wait he remembers now, and the bad guys aren't even going to put up a fight, why? Cause it's credit time baby!!! Cu'mon!! Lets roll that shiz nik!! That's right!!! Lets watch the music video for crying out loud, it's funnier, and it has more action!!!!It sure brings a new meaning to that Limp Bizkit song doesn't it!! Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, cu'mon!!Ya!! Thats what I'm talking about!! See,, that's what you gotta do when you watch this movie, you got to pump your self to enjoy those credits!!

		<fullReview>I can't believe I wasted $4.00 (matinee price) on this crap. The plot sucked. The special effects sucked. And Lara Flynn Bole's bony butt should be arrested for wearing lace panties and a push up bra on a movie screen. I didn't expect much from this movie and I damn sure wasn't disappointed! I didn't like the first one so I knew I wasn't going to like this one. The only reason they're making such a bid deal over this movie is because of Will Smith. But I guess $20M is a strong motivator. MIBII is 90 minutes worth of pure, unadulterated bulls#%t! It's rare that I agree with the critics on movies, but they ain't lying about this one. Save your $4.00 (matinee price).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Sequel. *Possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know what to think of this movie.I *had* dropped off in interest in MIB 1 eary on, but watching it now I realize that i really liked it.I agree with many of the comments I've already seen; 'It wasn't made to stand on it's own, and thus will not be remembered in the long run'. Very true.But i think it held my interest long enough. Not great, especially as sequels go, but not awful.I find the thing that i remember most prominently about seeing this movie was picking out the little flaws (or what I think are flaws; you can make up your own mind).Over all, nothing really much different from ones I Found in the original:- Really not sure just how big MIB is. If they go byt the lettering system for agents that they use now, they could have 26 agents. Assuming they they're all paired up, that's 13 teams of agents. I really can't tell how many people really work for the MIB, the ranks of the MIB seem rather shallow (example: after only 5 years of service, J is already on top.)- MIB HQ. One tiny room containing 'all the most advanced technology in the universe. Incredible. In that *same* room, you have the MIB 'armory', if you can call it that, which consists of maybe 5 guns... In addition to that you have a Sprint Store there, and some other stores. I don't know if MIB is letting Sprint monopolize alien cell phones, but I can't see any other rerason why it'd be there (besides the blatantly obvious one).- MIB in general. They make the FBI and CIA look outstanding; lack of numbers, lack of adequacy to control the alien population. Why centralize in NYC?? There can't POSSIBLY be aliens anywhere else I suppose. Case in point: MIB HQ taken over by Serleena. Well. Too bad they didn't expand at ALL. I think it would make sense to have MIB field offices in all of the major cities of the world, and secondary regional headquarters spread across the globe; London, Moscow, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris... EVERYWHERE. SO THAT THINGS LIKE THAT DON'T RERSULT IN A TOTAL SHUTDOWN OF THAT FIELD OF GOVERNMENT. Do the MIB even keep RECORDS?! No. 'We don't know about where the light thing is; OR WHAT it is.' 'Well it's not on RECORD or anything. We're THAT incompetent' 'OK, we gotta rely on individuals throughout the agency who KNOW what we need to.' Good Job.Never the less... it WAS somewhat entertaining. You make up your own mind. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucked major a$$!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I wasted $4.00 (matinee price) on this crap. The plot sucked. The special effects sucked. And Lara Flynn Bole's bony butt should be arrested for wearing lace panties and a push up bra on a movie screen. I didn't expect much from this movie and I damn sure wasn't disappointed! I didn't like the first one so I knew I wasn't going to like this one. The only reason they're making such a bid deal over this movie is because of Will Smith. But I guess $20M is a strong motivator. MIBII is 90 minutes worth of pure, unadulterated bulls#%t! It's rare that I agree with the critics on movies, but they ain't lying about this one. Save your $4.00 (matinee price).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Sequel. *Possible spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know what to think of this movie.I *had* dropped off in interest in MIB 1 eary on, but watching it now I realize that i really liked it.I agree with many of the comments I've already seen; 'It wasn't made to stand on it's own, and thus will not be remembered in the long run'. Very true.But i think it held my interest long enough. Not great, especially as sequels go, but not awful.I find the thing that i remember most prominently about seeing this movie was picking out the little flaws (or what I think are flaws; you can make up your own mind).Over all, nothing really much different from ones I Found in the original:- Really not sure just how big MIB is. If they go byt the lettering system for agents that they use now, they could have 26 agents. Assuming they they're all paired up, that's 13 teams of agents. I really can't tell how many people really work for the MIB, the ranks of the MIB seem rather shallow (example: after only 5 years of service, J is already on top.)- MIB HQ. One tiny room containing 'all the most advanced technology in the universe. Incredible. In that *same* room, you have the MIB 'armory', if you can call it that, which consists of maybe 5 guns... In addition to that you have a Sprint Store there, and some other stores. I don't know if MIB is letting Sprint monopolize alien cell phones, but I can't see any other rerason why it'd be there (besides the blatantly obvious one).- MIB in general. They make the FBI and CIA look outstanding; lack of numbers, lack of adequacy to control the alien population. Why centralize in NYC?? There can't POSSIBLY be aliens anywhere else I suppose. Case in point: MIB HQ taken over by Serleena. Well. Too bad they didn't expand at ALL. I think it would make sense to have MIB field offices in all of the major cities of the world, and secondary regional headquarters spread across the globe; London, Moscow, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris... EVERYWHERE. SO THAT THINGS LIKE THAT DON'T RERSULT IN A TOTAL SHUTDOWN OF THAT FIELD OF GOVERNMENT. Do the MIB even keep RECORDS?! No. 'We don't know about where the light thing is; OR WHAT it is.' 'Well it's not on RECORD or anything. We're THAT incompetent' 'OK, we gotta rely on individuals throughout the agency who KNOW what we need to.' Good Job.Never the less... it WAS somewhat entertaining. You make up your own mind. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the winner of the worst summer movie of 2002 to feature a talking dog is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am saddened to see that I have a maximum of 1000 words to describe the train wreck that is Men In Black II. Actually, the train wreck comparison isn't really fair, train wrecks elicit the famous rubber-necking syndrome, where human nature and its fascination with abomination demand at least a cursory glance at the smoldering wreckage. Men In Black II does nothing to make me want to watch it other than the chance to participate in a fun game of counting up how many different things Will Smith refers to as "joints" in the movie. Will Smith also uses this movie as an opportunity to produce another hit single. And by hit single I mean 70's song which he steals the music from, changes the words to, and then says "ha-ha" a bunch of times during.Speaking of Will Smith, he returns to play his I'm-Will-Smith-and-I'm-in-a-movie-but-I'm-not-playing-Ali-so-I'll-just-prete nd-this-is-an-episode-of-the-Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air character that he's honed to perfection over the years. Taking his side for part of the movie is that talking dog from the first movie who has inexplicably risen his status from scum bag informant to MIB agent material because he is selected to be Will Smith's partner for a brief, although not nearly brief enough, portion of the movie. At this point numerous gags are made based on the fact that the dog is talking. This of course is funny because dogs don't actually talk. Pushing the inane envelope even further, to the point where I developed a facial tick, was when they had the talking dog sing along with the hit #1 single, Who Let the Dog's Out. Sony was obviously trying to cash in on the booming success of Disney's Snow Dogs, and I have to say that although I have not seen Snow Dogs, I liked it better.The phrase cash in reminds me of another great feature of MIB II, the ubiquitous product placement. If you didn't know that Burger King and Sprint were tied to this picture before you see it, you certainly will after. Not that it interferes with the plot, since Sonnenfeld didn't seem to bother with finding one. What little semblance of a plot there is seems mainly concerned with fiddling around with the ending of the last movie so that Tommy Lee Jones can appear again in this one. Other than that, there's some Light of Zarra, or something, that can blow up the world somehow, or something, thereby leaving the audience with a feeling of suspense, or something."But Adam, summer movies don't need plots," you say, "just so long as they keep me laughing." Well I'm sorry my friend but every joke in this movie falls into three categories. 1. Hey, I remember that from the trailer. 2. Hey, I remember that from the first movie. 3. Right, I get it, its a talking dog. The part of the movie I found funniest was the guy sitting behind me in the theater who laughed uproariously at such scenes as, Will Smith driving up to a post office, or Will Smith saying "I'll be in the gym." He also liked the talking dog. Did I mention there's a talking dog? At least we know Sonnenfeld is laughing, laughing all the way to the bank. And good for him, he deserves it.The actors themselves weren't that bad, even if you'd seen most of them before. As for the new ones, there was a slightly attractive love interest for Will Smith who I wish was hotter but didn't do anything to directly detract from the movie. You get to see most of Lara Flynn Boyle's breasts, which are remarkably large for someone who weighs 24 pounds. Jimmy Knoxville plays a dopey alien side-kick competently enough I suppose. The strange thing about Knoxville's character is that he seemingly vanishes without explanation about 2/3 of the way through the movie. However, in all honesty, they may have explained it and I just missed it while I was distracted by lighting myself on fire. There's also a talking dog, but I think I talked about him already.All in all this movie was a double barreled misfire. No plot, not funny, no writers, no ending, but hey at least it was only 80 minutes long, that's $.10 a minute at your typical movie venue, a rate that could be much better utilized by calling your grandma in Topeka long-distance and telling her you love her.

		<shortDescription>See the First Again Instead (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a piece of summer fluff that, while enjoyable, was weak. The plot was thin, and the ending unsatisfactory to me. Sonnenfeld tried too hard with this sequel, and it shows.Serleena, a beautiful alien with tentacles (Lara Flynn Boyle), wants something that only the retired and neurolyzed Agent Kay (Jones) knows the whereabouts of. The Men in Black agency, a beautiful pizza girl, oh, and the world, in danger, Agent Jay (Smith) must deneuralyze Kay to save well, everything.Tommy Lee Jones was the best thing about the movie--he made his character seem believable (well, as much as possible) and humorous. Although Will Smith is now an awardwinning actor with an Oscar nomination under his belt, he did not get a chance to show his dramatic or comedic talent in MIB 2. His dialog was weak and collapsed his character--neither the writers or Smith needed to try so hard to be funny in this movie.The problem or characteristic that Will Smith's character, Agent Jay, was given was not resolved in the film, nor really dealt with after it was presented. This may sound small, but really bugged me walking out of the theater. (It felt like there was a scene missing in which he and Kay either show that they enjoy working together, or where Jay is released from the MIB agency.)Special effects were wonderful, and the aliens at the MIB agency wonderfully creative.Though sometimes the script was really funny, often it tried too hard. If you want a Men in Black fix, rent the first one--better yet, buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Men in Black II" is so lightweight that it doesn't merit a lengthy review, so I'll keep it brief.This movie was a big disappointment. Its main problem? It's not funny. About 95% of the jokes fall flat and Frank the talking dog gets annoying after only a short time on screen. I know what to expect from blockbuster sequels, so I didn't go into the theater expecting an "L.A. Confidential" style plot or "American Beauty" level acting. But I do want it to deliver where it should: in comedy, in pyrotechnics and special effects."MiB II" fails in all three areas. It also took WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long to get to Tommy Lee Jones. Hard to believe, considering this movie is about 85 minutes long, but the filmmakers pull it off. This sequel lacks all the charm and originality of the original, which I heartily enjoyed.In the end, this movie proves to waste two thoroughly likeable characters as they spit out an endless series of lame jokes. Based on early box office returns, this movie is going to be huge. But if you've not yet seen it, I say wait for the video.Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

Some people should fake being in comatose states.Evil plant alien, Surlina, (played by Lara Flynn Boyle)is boring and cliche, but at least she's hot.She easily takes over MIB HQ and gathers up evil alien henchmen, who are very dangerous, yet as soon as K's back, he easily beats all of them in under a minute's time. J also beats an arch nemesis easily too.Next, there's of course J's love interest who just happens to be key to the whole evil plot. Big shock huh? Of course in the end the good guys beat Surlina and save the day. As for the love story, it so tragic because they can't be with each other. Boo-hoo.End SpoilersThe only thing saving this movie from absolute garbage, is tons of great one-liners and plenty of comedic gags, especially from Patrick Warburton who is defiantly not in the movie long enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...followed by Pauly Shore. Jerry's a tough act to follow, right? Well, so was Men in Black. And Men in Black II isn't even Pauly Shore--it's Carrot Top.The reasons why this film falls short of the guilty pleasure that was the original, are that it's stale, smarmy, overly serious, sappy in the wrong places, confusing without explaination, Tommy Lee Jones is terrible (a sad thing, really, he's very talented) and Will Smith is even worse. For starters, Will Smith is not Denzel Washington, though he tries to be. Lara Flynn Boyle is beautiful but overshadowed and disbelievable (Serleena?? Come on, be a little more creative) The movie tries to poke fun at campy science fiction of the 1950s, but fails to get this past the point of "Look, we're making fun of the campy science fiction of the 1950's!"  The funniest parts of this movie are most certainly seen in the trailer, and even Frank the Pug (in a surprisingly welcome comeback) seems dull singing "I Will Survive" for what seems like the 60 billionth time. However, he does have a later song (the surprise is really the best part so I won't give it away) which is good for some laughs. The worm guys are overused and silly; they should have stuck with serving coffee. Catch it in a second run theater when you've got nothing better to do, but don't pay more than 3 bucks for this movie. Or get the same feeling and rent Chairman of the Board off the bargin rack at the video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak story but great chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's that time of year again. The sun is high in the sky beaming that heat down, the grills are going full blast cooking the hotdogs and hamburgers, the fireworks are just about to go off, and Will Smith has a movie out for the 4th of July. This time it is a sequel to that surprise hit, Men In Black. The story finds Will as Agent Jay, the top agent for the MIB, constantly searching for a replacement for Agent Kay, Tommy Lee Jones, who he had to neuralyze at the end of the previous movie. Unfortunately Jay is beginning to get a reputation as someone who will use his "flashy-thing" at the first problem and most of the other personal at MIB are scared of him. Even worse an extremely dangerous alien by the name of Serleena, Lara Flynn Boyle, has traveled to earth searching for the Light of Zartha. Naturally if she gets she will be able to rule the universe. Even worse than we previously thought, the only person who knows where this Light of Zartha is, is Agent Kay who, since his neuralyzation, has been working as the postmaster of a small town. Jay is sent to retrieve Kay, de-neuralyze him so that he will get his memory back, find the Light of Zartha, and defeat Serleena. Not bad for a 90 minute movie. OK. This is MIB ll. You obviously aren't coming in to see this for serious drama. You probably aren't coming to see this for serious character development either. You probably are coming because you are a fan of light action/comedies and are a fan of Will Smith and/or Tommy Lee Jones. With that groundrule stated, does this movie work? Yes. The plot is basically superfluous to the movie. It seems hastily thrown together and comes across more as the plot for an ongoing television series (sequel anyone?) than for a major motion picture. What moves this along is the acting of the two leads and the relationship between them. I have often said that there is a great lack of chemistry in many romantic movies out there today. That doesn't apply here at all. Smith and Jones work perfectly together. The chemistry that flows between the two is easy and established quite well. Smith, as Jay, is the gung-ho top guy at MIB until he brings Kay back and then he easily slips right back into the student role. Smith is the perfect class clown for this role but he needs a foil and Jones provides Kay with the perfect deadpan that frequently comes across funnier than the joker. Is this the best movie ever made? Not particularly. Did I find it entertaining? Yes. The two actors work well together and carry the movie to a satisfying end.</fullReview>

The storyline could have been better. let's see: J fights aliens. Aliens threaten Earth. J needs K. J finds K. J de-neuralizes K. K finds old clues. K stops aliens. I leave disappointed.2. Running time is supposedly 94 min. That's if the 15 minutes of previews are included in the count. I glanced at my watch right when the movie started: 9:00pm. I looked at my watch at the end of the movie: 10:20pm (and that's giving an extra few minutes!). Hmmm....an 80 minute movie? Hell, I still had time to catch the upper arlington fireworks (it was July 4) when we exited the theater. I leave disappointed.3. After leaving the movie (disappointed, remind you), I had a sudden urge to trade my verizon phone in for a sprint phone, and I really wanted a whopper from Burger King. Huh. I wonder if that was from the all of the adds that MIB II shoved down your throat. However, I went home and had a beer because I wasn't giving them the satisfaction of giving my money to their advertisers.This movie seemed like the director had to look for ways to extend the running time. I seldom laughed, and when I did, it was merely a little chuckle. I didn't really laugh aloud once during the movie. On a positive note, the alien really knew how to pick a human disguise :)Save your money for something more than 80 minutes.</fullReview>

It was unfortunate that the film wasn't as expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak story but great chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's that time of year again. The sun is high in the sky beaming that heat down, the grills are going full blast cooking the hotdogs and hamburgers, the fireworks are just about to go off, and Will Smith has a movie out for the 4th of July. This time it is a sequel to that surprise hit, Men In Black. The story finds Will as Agent Jay, the top agent for the MIB, constantly searching for a replacement for Agent Kay, Tommy Lee Jones, who he had to neuralyze at the end of the previous movie. Unfortunately Jay is beginning to get a reputation as someone who will use his "flashy-thing" at the first problem and most of the other personal at MIB are scared of him. Even worse an extremely dangerous alien by the name of Serleena, Lara Flynn Boyle, has traveled to earth searching for the Light of Zartha. Naturally if she gets she will be able to rule the universe. Even worse than we previously thought, the only person who knows where this Light of Zartha is, is Agent Kay who, since his neuralyzation, has been working as the postmaster of a small town. Jay is sent to retrieve Kay, de-neuralyze him so that he will get his memory back, find the Light of Zartha, and defeat Serleena. Not bad for a 90 minute movie. OK. This is MIB ll. You obviously aren't coming in to see this for serious drama. You probably aren't coming to see this for serious character development either. You probably are coming because you are a fan of light action/comedies and are a fan of Will Smith and/or Tommy Lee Jones. With that groundrule stated, does this movie work? Yes. The plot is basically superfluous to the movie. It seems hastily thrown together and comes across more as the plot for an ongoing television series (sequel anyone?) than for a major motion picture. What moves this along is the acting of the two leads and the relationship between them. I have often said that there is a great lack of chemistry in many romantic movies out there today. That doesn't apply here at all. Smith and Jones work perfectly together. The chemistry that flows between the two is easy and established quite well. Smith, as Jay, is the gung-ho top guy at MIB until he brings Kay back and then he easily slips right back into the student role. Smith is the perfect class clown for this role but he needs a foil and Jones provides Kay with the perfect deadpan that frequently comes across funnier than the joker. Is this the best movie ever made? Not particularly. Did I find it entertaining? Yes. The two actors work well together and carry the movie to a satisfying end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but it seems studios know they don't have to create good movies to make money. "You have to see it, cuz you loved the first one!" They can capitalize off image without putting any effort into creating a good movie (the Jurassic Park series comes to mind). MIB2 also fits this mold. This movie was made solely to take your money, not to entertain you.The chemistry between Smith and Jones is largely absent in this sequel. Jones doesn't even show up until half of the movie is over. The characters are horribly underdeveloped (I cared only for the talking dog). The model villain was a complete bore and Knoxville's character was a dismal attempt at a Beetlejuice impression. The film is smothered in rehashed old jokes that weren't all that funny in the first place. As a big fan of YOMOMMA jokes, I was disappointed in the worm's poor delivery and out of context use of "YOMOMMA". The plot is sleeper. The chase scenes were standard Hollywood fare (nothing we haven't seen hundreds of times). The ending drags. Forget waiting for the girl to get beamed away from earth, I wanted to beamed out of the theater 30 minutes into this flick!One good thing about MIB2 is the talking dog. He has some great lines. There are also a few sparse moments when Jones and Smith seem to connect just like in MIB1. But even then, they just can't seem to maintain the chemistry for more than a couple seconds. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you absolutely must see it, wait for the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood seems devoid of anything new and Men in Black II is basic Hollywood 101 for making a cash cow "moo" again.Men in Black One was delightfully different and the payoff at the box office and other perks was almost 600 million. Now we have the sequel. The only thing I liked in the whole thing was the dog. The attempt at some sort of plot and character based interaction is woefully weak. There is plenty of the "let's make a commercial and call it a movie" mentality in this one.Tommy Lee Jones looks like he is ninety (maybe he is) andWill Smith must have done it for the cash only because he is better, no way better than this as an actor.Lara Flynn Boyle is easy to look at and that seems to be a requirement in summer movies these days. I think she has some promise as an actor and maybe in the difficult roles of a villain but this wasn't a proper exposure,pardon the pun, of her talents.Rip Torn is the same as the first film.Michael Jackson in a cameo role caused me to stir in my seat with a bit of expectation but it meant nothing in the grand scheme of the movie and maybe that is too bad for it might have been unique?So what do we have here? Hollywood going for the cash and we fools running to give it to them. As long as re-hashed, re-worked, and re-done left overs make money that will continue to be the bill of fare.Go during the matinee so you won't be the only person on the planet who hasn't seen Men in Black II but don't say I didn't warn you!The dog was good.The rest, well, it was "good as gold!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an already tired variation on a theme that was only good the first time around. You'd think in the last five years they had to prepare this movie that they could get MIB 2 a decent script, wouldn't you? You would. You'd be wrong. I've been on a recent hot streak of movies, there hasn't been one I've disliked in quite some time, what with LOTR, The Rookie, Spider-Man, SW:E2, Blade 2, e.t.c. Well, thanks a lot, Sonnenfeld. Now I've got to start all over. I read an interview with Lara Flynn Boyle, who plays Serleena, saying how happy she was in the role because she could overact as much as she wants. Still waiting...Boyle is one of the worst screen villains I've seen since Ahnold in "Batman and Robin". Yes, THAT bad. While he overacts, she underacts. No emotion whatsoever from her. I've never seen her in anything else, but if that's what she calls overacting, well, then...you get the idea. Highlights? Well...Frank the pug was funny. And there's a segment at the very end of the movie that got the only real laugh out of me, plus a neat little twist similar to the one in the first movie. Aside from the random chuckle here and there (Jacko's cameo, Playstation controller, that kind of thing), nothing. Nothing at all. I just did not enjoy the movie at all. Ninety minutes of my life that I will never get back. I've spent six dollars on worse things, but I had such high hopes. Ah, well...plus, what was up with that videotape?!?! How did that guy know all about the MIB?!?!?!?! I'm sorry, excuse me...but when you see the movie, you'll understand. I gave this movie a 4, for Frank and the last 2 or 3 minutes of the film. It's not that Smith and Jones's chemistry was bad, it's just that I've seen it all before. Bottom line: If you're looking for something new, you won't get it. If you're looking for basically the same movie with the same effects and a less impressive story/cast, you got it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm rather glad I caught the movie during a weekday matinee when it first opened - it is a fun movie, with some good moments, but in the end it really is just a similar plot to the first movie, except that they try to cram too much into the 90 minutes that the movie goes on to allow things to develop. As a result, parts of the plot feel forced... though maybe this could have been fixed by dropping the intro five minute 'video' and making a shorter summary, allowing them to put in a few more minutes of setup.The short summary is 'Agent K and Agent J go back out to kick some alien ass'. The longer form involves some hints of past and present romances, a bunch of worms, a talking dog who has some good lines, and a few parodies which end up falling flat on their faces as far as being humorous. If you enjoyed the first movie, you may enjoy the second if your expectations aren't for something newer and better; that it's not. Is it fun? Yes. Is it worth $8.00? I'm not sure on this one - I caught it on a $5 CDN matinee (which ends up being like 50 cents US), and I feel I got my money's worth out of it. Just don't expect parts of the movie to make sense, even if the few cameos are kinda funny if obvious in retrospect.</fullReview>

The first MIB was fabulous, original, and entertaining from start to finish.The only part of the sequel that was any good was the nerdy video store guy saying that his mother was too spastic to control the cheese distribution on a pizza bagel--funny stuff.

		<fullReview>...and a disappointment as a sequel to the first. Sonnenfeld must have ust sat back, cashed his paycheck, and kind of breezed through this movie without much consideration for characters, story, or much of anything else.There's no point to sum up the plot, because there really is none. While MIB 1 had a very catchy sense of discovery and an original take on alien humor, this movie recycles most of the jokes ("All postal workers are aliens" is the same as "all cab drivers are aliens" from the first one), and the rest are stale, either because of the writing or because Sonnenfeld didn't bother to work on the delivery of the lines with the actors.Smith and Jones barely swim through their roles, exaggerating dialogue in some parts or talking without reason in others. While the first movie gave us a good sense of the "young cop" and the "wise man" aspects of these two, here it sounds as if they're in the middle of some outtakes that didn't make it to the first movie.The villain's boring persona is masked by her looks, and the "evil plot" doesn't nearly tie into the story as well as the first movie. I feel sorry for Tony Shalhoub, for his talent was wasted on a very line-read Jeebs.The "film", just as most of it, ends with a special effects extravaganza that tries to mask all the stumbling it does along the way. The movie ends with a speech from Zed, K, and the dog that makes you want to walk out of the theater and check whether you came into the right movie. Finally, before the credits roll, Agent K pushes open a door that reveals Earth as being part of a locker in some sort of alien train station (or something), which further shows the lack of creativity, as this obviously alludes to the "Earth within a marble Galaxy" element of the first film.Arguably the best part of the movie is Michael Jackson the Alien talking to Agent K about becoming MIB Agent M.Rating is 4/10, that much simply because of the visual effects.</fullReview>

If you thought the first one was because it ends up our galaxy is portrayed as in a marble, you certainly missed the ending of this movie. Great movie, absolutely hilarious.

		<shortDescription>The talking dog scenes played a major role in keeping the movie from being a...well, a dog.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wicked alien, Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), lands on Earth to recover a powerful light device with which she intends to destroy Laranna, Queen of the Universe (Paige Brooks) and take over the whole works. Since the MiB mission is alien control, they can't allow that. What's more, if that device doesn't leave Earth by a time certain, Earth will be destroyed!! And only former agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) knows where it is.Needing his old partner back, agent Jay (Will Smith) gets rid of his incompetent new partner, Tee (Patrick Warburton). Jay seeks out Kay who has been neuralized (memory wiped clean of any MiB traces) and turned out to pasture in a small Massachusetts town, where he is the Postmaster. Together again, they set out to save the world.After a reasonably clever introduction, the movie falls on its face, ker-thud, in the sequences where Jay gets rid of his partner and saves a subway train from being entirely devoured by a huge subway-dwelling alien (it's set in Manhattan). We took in a 4th of July 11:40am showing, and there was a good turnout. Alas, you could feel the anticipation congeal, as the subway sequence labored on to its conclusion, which, thank goodness, consisted of a pretty good sight gag.Things picked up, however, when a talking dog showed up, and the movie won us back, but it had burnt up a significant chunk of good will by then. I found all the characters to be either interesting or engaging, and often both. Even the animated characters, which I'm not always that fond of, were a lot of fun. The plot was just about right, consistent, not too complicated to follow, and humane enough to allow for a touch of romance (provided by Rosario Dawson). It accomplished what it was supposed to do, which was to provide a structure on which to hang jokes. The jokes weren't bad, some were really clever---individually---but they didn't seem to find a rhythm, and so, in concert, fell somewhat short of orgiastic mirth. Except for the dog scenes, which played a major role in keeping the movie from being a...well, a dog. I can hear Will Smith, even now, bemoaning "A dog stole my movie!"Lara Flynn Boyle was straight-on deadpan as the wicked alien, and could have been hilarious. But, aside from her first entrance, they gave her nothing funny to do or say. Smith and Jones work well together, and I wouldn't mind an MiB III, if they could find a script with just a teensy bit more wit to it. Did I mention the dog was great? Worth seeing at matinee prices, but don't set your expectations too high, given those flat early-on sequences.</fullReview>

I was not expecting much and was not disappointed but in spite of the enthusiastic endorsement given by the lead-in review herein, the film does not live up to the original. There are some good moments. The dog gets some witty lines and the new female interest is lovely to look at. Tony Shalhoub is great, of course, and there is still great chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. However, the story never really gets off the ground and quickly gets convoluted. The villain, Lara Flynn Boyle seems almost disinterested at times and bored at others. The lines are funny in spots but many of the gags and gimmicks of the first film are repeated and rapidly wear thin. Still, all in all, MIB2 is not a bad film and the idea of a sequel was a good one. My feeling is it coulda been a lot better with a little thought and imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good-- not great-- but at least it's an "honest" sequel!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED the original, and found this sequel much less brilliant, but still a decent movie. Some good critics have slammed it for not being a work of originality and genius, but that is unfair. True, sequels, by definition, must be taken along with the first movie that inspired them, and put in the overall context. But, can't sequels also be judged, at least somewhat, as movies in their own right?Given the "entire franchise" context, and the "stand alone" criterion, "Men in Black II" has its moments, but clearly isn't as good as "MIB." One nice thing to say in its favor, though, is the evident fact that the director and producers did NOT populate the second movie with 50,000 more aliens, puppets, and cartoons, as so often happens in sequels. That showed a bit of restraint. Also, the plot didn't "undo" all the achievements of the characters and the story in the original. That is, whatever we as the audience might have enjoyed in the make-believe world of the first movie remains intact. Note the difference in some franchises, where virtually ALL of the gains, wins, achievements, etc. obtained by the characters in the original are essentially wiped out, nullified by some lame-brained Hollywood Suit who can only see the dollar signs of the sequels. "Back to the Future" comes to mind--- a brilliant, sweet, and innocently spiritual movie wherein characters changed their destinies and overcame fear, limitations, etc.--- only to have all of that completely undone in the opening frames of the second movie."MIB II" at least takes up where the first one left off--- (although I'd have loved to have seen the gorgeous and interesting Linda Fiorintino return as agent "L.")---and that alone is worth high praise, given the crap that "summer blockbuster" movie producers often deliver via sequels. "MIB II" is true to the theme, although not very well done. It is a bit dim, a bit shoddy-- but at least it is an honest sequel! And that is, indeed, cause for praise and admiration.Bottom line: decent. Not bad. "B-," or a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We still mainline MIB at my house. So, the whole family knew what we wanted. We got it. Plenty of humor, cool toys and effects. I'm still not sure if it's as good as the first one. The film blazed right by. Should probably catch it again. But, if you just want to park your melon and watch J &amp; K do what they do best... MIBII makes for a great afternoon.

		<fullReview>This move was unfunny and souless. Everything established in the first wonder film is thrown out and they try to start fresh. Alas, nothing works. The great chemistry between Jones and Smith is gone as both actors seem distracted and disinterested in the feature. Obviously contractual obligation spawned this film, and its really a shame as the franchise should not survive this choppy and uninspired script. A pity given the talents of everyone involved...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but A DISAPPOINTING COMMERCIAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the plot - if you can call it a "plot". What MIB II really is is a big excuse for the latest digital FX, and shameless product placement commercials. Was it bad? No. But besides being surprisingly SHORT in length, there is really nothing original here nor anything that tries to surpass the first MIB. It is just bigger explosions and weirder aliens, with absolutely nothing of a real plot nor characters we care about.Lara Flynn Boyle - the ultra-skinny Lara Flynn Boyle - is one of those digital creations: she actually has a computer-enhanced body here. She's fine as the cartoonish villain.Will Smith is always good, but the attempts to give him a romantic relationship with a human female are strained and go nowhere. If the movie was a little longer they could have done something with this, but I assume the film is aimed at ten-year-olds with a short attention span.Rip Torn and Tommy Lee Jones, also fine actors like Smith, but are limited by the script which doesn't give them much to work with. We've seen all these same expressions with MIB I.The most memorable "actor" is the talking dog. Which tells you everything you need to know about how lame the script is and how shallow the characters are.MIB II also goes right into shameless product placement with ads for actual products and brand names all over the place. They even got in a plug (or cameo) for Michael Jackson - who looks like more of a freak than the two-headed alien. And I wasn't impressed that much by the digital FX either on him. The alien, not Jackson. Michael always looks very weird and scary.Anyway, it was a passable ninety with lots of effects. I saw it at a half price matinee and even then it was hardly worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>94 minutes of good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who didn't like this movie must have been expecting to see "Schindler's List" or something similar. It's just good clean fun, fully as entertaining as the first movie with, if anything a tighter plot and more character development. The gags work just fine and the film is a wonderful excuse to spend 94 minutes in an air conditioned theater while escaping the global warming one of the film's characters has apparently caused. I think perhaps the main appeal of "Men in Black", as well as the film to which it is most comparable, "Ghostbusters", is that after years of watching the human race appear helpless before various mysterious forces, (as seen in the Mel Gibson movie that is previewed before MIBII starts), it's fun to see some guys with some answers and some attitude on our side. The human race ain't exactly chopped liver, you know!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie suffers from the malady of the sequel that is not meeting the expectation raised by the original. The movie fails at the most unexpected place, Will Smith fails to deliver. In the original, he portrays the enthusiasm, pace and energy of the novice; in the sequel he is supposed to be the veteran but he looks tired and again novice! he special effects are marvelous, Tommy lee Jones is hilarious by being serious. The tragedy of the movie is that the makers stumbled upon the gold mine but passed over; that gold mine is the talking dog who is funny, witty, audience bounds with it, could had been Eddie Murphy of Shrek, but, alas, but the movie makers just didn't gave him enough footage.

To start with, it would have helped a little if all they hadn't put all the funny parts in all the previews and showed them countless times....because when I was sitting in the theater I was like "Oh, I've already seen this part about twenty times"..."Oh, this one too"...."Wow, they showed this one about twenty times as well." The acting wasn't that great either and the plot could have used a little more work. Sexy ladies don't make this kind of movie either....I rarely hear someone say "Wow, I saw a woman in her underwear, that movie was awesome!" No, sorry. I think they should stop here and not make any more Men in Black movies. Don't damage it anymore.</fullReview>

Which was really disappointing. It also seems like the movie was more thrown together like they did it in a hurry. I would prefer that they took more time to do things and make it look better. I think that this could have been a great sequel if they had just taken more time. Though this is the MIB2 so you should see it if you saw the first one. It did have a few good parts :-)</fullReview>

I heard there was a second one coming out and thought "why do you have to drag the first movie through the mud by making a crappy sequel?" Sometimes they can be so bad that you can't watch the original anymore because at the end, all you can think about is the stupid crap you know they're going to do in the future. I saw the trailer for the first time in a movie theater and every second was pure cinematic perfection. I my opinion took a total 180. I was so psyched to see the damn thing and I built it up so much that I probably would have rated it as a "9." That's basically what it is. I just screwed it up by "knowing" it was going to be an "11." You must see this movie. Especially if you saw the first one (like 99% of the U.S. population).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first MIB. It was cool, funny and had a plot I could care about. So when I heard that MIBII was coming out, I was excited. Now I wish I had stayed home and watched the original on DVD again. This second time around just isn't that interesting. Since the whole plot can be seen from the preview, I'll list my likes and dislikes. Dislikes:(1)the huge amount of product placements. There hasn't been a movie with this many commercials since "Days of Thunder." As if aliens would land on Earth and start eating at a Burger King and need a Sprint cell phone. (2)The cameo of Michael Jackson. Scary! (3)Having Zed fight "Matrix" style doesn't fit. (4) The dog singing "Who Let the Dogs Out." (5)Will Smith saying "Talk to the hand." (6) This is some of Rick Baker's worst work. It's like he went through his workshop and found rejects from other movies. (7) Lara Flynn Boyle is just horrible and Johnny Knoxville is wasted. Where did he go at the end of the movie? (8)Will Smith just walks through this. It looks like he was worn out from "Ali." Likes (1)Tommy Lee Jones is still cool. (2)Biz Markie cameo (3)The locker creatures. Hopefully for MIBIII, they watch the cartoon series (GREAT) and get some plot ideas. Bring back Linda Fiorentino and find the fun that made the first one so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, but still a pale sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This was not the worst sequel that I've seen, but it still suffered from "sequel-itis" in all of the worst ways. It tried too hard to top the original with slam-bam special effects and moved at a frantic pace, never giving the audience time to know (or care about) the new characters, while making the obvious assumption that anybody who wanted to see this movie had already seen the original MIB. Therefore, there was no effort to make this film stand alone, a flaw that will make this version age poorly with time.The acting was uniformly good, especially from the wonderful character actors, Rip Torn and Tony Shalhoub. However, it was disappointing to hear that K's (Tommy Lee Jones) wife had left him after he had waited decades for their reunion, which was the sweet ending to the first MIB. They could also have made more of J's (Will Smith) increasing frustration with the job and his attraction to Rita (Rosario Dawson), an appealing character whom we barely get to know, despite her literally-cosmic importance at the end. Also, compared to the first MIB's evil Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), the sequel's tentacle-shooting Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) was not much more than eye candy.All in all, a rather pallid follow-up to a wonderfully entertaining original film. I know I won't make a second trip to the theatre to see this one--nor will I bother to buy the DVD when it comes out. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Men in Black II" is technically superb with many new and wonderful creatures not seen in the original. An Oscar nomination for Best Technical Whatever is probably assured.The story barely hangs together but the bottom line is that my kid and apparently every kid in the theater enjoyed themselves immensely. And that's not a bad thing. Especially when you've got a day where it's 95 outside.Will Smith has some good lines but can't shake a bemused countenance. Tommy Lee Jones starts off semi-sleepwalking as part of his character, a former top Men in Black special agent whose memory of his glorious (and box-office busting) career as an alien-controller with Smith as his partner has been "Neuralyzed" (as in electronically erased). The problem is that even when his memory and authority are restored he still seems to be sleepwalking. Lara Flynn Boyle turns in a credible performance as an alien woman of many parts, all extensions of her petite but lovely figure. But Linda Fiorentino in the original had a bite that was special. Ms. Boyle lacks that quality here.The New York City-joshing one-liners are good. One, which I won't reveal, set me off rolling with laughter. How it will play elsewhere is another matter.My overall impression is that the producer, director and stars knew they had a film that couldn't lose money and not all that much effort was expended in script writing, directing or acting. It was, of course, a field day for the technical wonks. I suspect when the final "It's a wrap" call came everyone went home and started thinking about real future acting.Please, no "Men in Black III." 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, MIB2's not a movie for critics: it is just supposed to be a fun time for kids and families, a comic book. For the most part, the flick accomplishes what it sets out to do, with some fun moments, interesting new characters, and what has already been referred to as an AWESOME last 30 seconds. I do have to say one thing though: I am tired of the ads and the previews taking over 15 minutes before the movie gets started. I mean, we already get the product placements in the film. We pay more than pay-per-view which is commercial free: why should we have to watch ads before seeing the movie? And put previews back at the end like in the 70s, when it ensured that you watched the end credits. MIB II could have been played a bit more loose, but I was especially awed by how Tommy Lee Jones actually brought some emotion to the role this time, more than in the first film. Only he could have made the line, "It rains because you're crying, baby," sound that authentic. The movie will make a ton of money: I just hope they keep on putting out adult films as well (that is movies for adults, not -- well you know what I mean... )HAPPY 4TH!</fullReview>

There are funny moments, but the movie would have been a lot funnier and more interesting with more human interaction and more funny lines, and fewer monsters and effects. Hey, I don't want to bring down the stock in Industrial Light and Magic, but special effects are not so special- a little goes a loooooong way!Will Smith is cool and funny. Tommy Lee Smith is deadpan as a post office worker who is really an alien. This movie explains what is actually going on when you go to the post office and wait forever while everyone working there looks dazed. On the monster side, there is Lara Flynn Boyle, who is way too skinny and with pounds of makeup on, she looks like an evil medusa. But it's the dog that has the best lines and who is the best actor! I always laugh when I see animals in clothes, and this dog in his little Men in Black suit is funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Men in Black -- oh, sorry, MIB -- was a huge hit during the summer of 1997 because it was what so many other would-be summer blockbusters aren't: in a word, original. So, of course, the powers-that-be at Warner Bros. decided to turn around and do the most unoriginal thing imaginative: green light a sequel.Guess what? The joke's on them. Because within the first fifteen minutes of this only sporadically funny film, fans of the sheer unexpectedness of the first will surely be thinking, "Hmm...think I've seen this done before. With more laughs. And better."It was more fun, exciting, and all around better the first time around. In this pointless sequel, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are stuck in a mainly lifeless thing-a-ma-jig about a shape shifting alien that takes the form of a Victoria's Secret underwear model and goes hunting for a crystal that will, somehow and for some reason, destroy the Earth. Problem is, Jones's character, K, is the only one who knows where the crystal is. The bigger problem is that K, you may remember, was brainwashed and retired at the end of the first film. His replacement, Agent J (Smith, looking bored after his superb turn in "Ali") has to bring him back into the fold.The biggest problem, however, is that what was fresh the first time is stale this go 'round. Characters from the original pop up here and there (the talking dog; the worms; the alien store owner who keeps getting his head blown off -- yes, it happens again here, several tiresome times), muttering similar lines under similar circumstances. Was any thought put into this? Doesn't seem so. Matters are not helped by the fact that, since he is now the man in charge, Smith has to play the straight man, a role that does not suit him well. To be certain, there are some amusing bits; a scene in a video store that specializes in conspiracy films (posters advertising Oliver Stone movies and "The China Syndrome" adorn the walls) has some hope; the talking mutt has a few good lines; there's a cute cameo by Michael Jackson. Jones slips back into character nicely, giving K a sarcastic edge in the earlier scenes to a laconic coolness later on. The last scene in the movie is the best one, but it comes about 79 minutes too late. Ultimately the film is as drab as the suits worn by Smith and Jones, and where the original MIB was a good, snappy kick, MIB II needs someone to give it a good, swift kick to get it going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II is a fantastic, funny, and whimsical ride that is definitely on-par with the original, but probably will not be as fondly remembered, simply due to nostalgia factor. It's good to see Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together again, though the filmmakers could have reunited them sooner in the movie. MIB II maintains its momentum with a blend of clever jokes and eye-popping effects, balanced with some nice, sentimental moments.Much of the original cast has returned, but Linda Fiorentino's Dr. Laurel Weaver is sorely missed. Her absence is more than remedied, however, by the presence of NewsRadio's Patrick Warburton, who is as laugh-out-loud funny here as he is playing Johnny Johnson. (also back from the original film, albeit in a different role, is David Cross, another NewsRadio alumni) Rounding out the ensemble is Frank, the talking pug, MIB Chief Zed, Jeebs, and the sarcastic worm guys. The villain this time around is Serleena, an intergalactic Medusa-like alien, bent on destroying the world. One cannot watch this delightful romp through New York City without thinking of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed during the filming of the movie. Director Barry Sonnenfeld opted not to digitally alter the film in the aftermath of the tragedy, and I'm sure the absence of the towers will be felt by all who see it. I couldn't help but think of the scene in the original film where Will Smith's character is quietly contemplating his life before joining the Men in Black, while watching the sun set between the towers.All things considered, Men in Black II is a sequel that fans should thoroughly enjoy, while eagerly hoping for another installment. My only qualm is the song "Nod Ya Head." which will never be as catchy as Will Smith's "Men in Black."</fullReview>

For God's sake, why couldn't they leave `J" the sweet (albeit considerably less naive) guy he was in 1997? Why not bring K back to toughen him up? Work the plot towards the revelation that the Light is K's daughter, the result of his one slip from stern duty, heartbreak at separation, etc.? As it is, it's a string of gags of varying quality, and a totally unlikable smart-ass J.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why ruin a good thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the previews for MIBII came out, my sister and I were so excited we could hardly stand it. After seeing the first 3 times in theaters, then buying the video, we were hoping for another one just as exciting, witty, funny and creative as the first one. However, we were sorely disappointed when we went into the movie theater today and the first few scenes crawled by. I kept hoping that maybe Will had had a bad day on the set, and once Rip Torn came in, the movie would pick up it's pace a little. Well, I got what I asked for, only the whole thing was thrown into hyper-speed, with no logical sequence, and a last minute resolution thrown in. My lack of comprehension might have been augmented by the fact that my sister kept whispering hoarsely "WHAT JUST HAPPENED?" in my ears throughout the film. But not only was the plot hard to follow, there was no spirit- no spunk. Agent J, Will's character, has become so hardened by his experience that he has no more of his anti-authority spunk and "all that" attitude that made him so funny and charming in the first movie. It's as if they used up all their ingenuity on the first one and decided to throw another together just to make a couple billion on opening day before word got out that it, well, sucked. To make a long story short: if the original means as much to you as it did to me, don't ruin your good impression of the cast and crew of MIB by seeing this sequel.</fullReview>

But if you are older than 8 years old...well, I'd say...if you MUST see it, catch the matinee...that way it's only five dollars worth of buyer's remorse. Now, there were some cute effects... Frank has a surprisingly melodic voice, for a New Yorker... the reneuralizer scene and the Peter Graves tape with the campy effect makes a nice contrast. And that video store scene was pretty funny. The first MIB was wonderful...totally from the left field from start to finish. But MIB II is just the same formula movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought some of the jokes were funny, but it just didn't have the overall comedic feel. Admittedly, MIB 1 is a tough act to follow, but I just didn't see any creative effort on the part of the producer/director. I think the appeal of the first MIB was the innovative theme. The innovation just wasn't there in MIB II. And a movie with such high expectations would do well to not to try to ride on the coattails of the first movie too much. How did Frank the dog...he's a dog, OK?! How did he get that darned cellphone headset on his itty bitty head? Don't you need opposing fingers to do that? And ...they're armed, their dangerous, they have six arms...they are ... the worms...Well, not exactly the US marines! they were funny, playing twister and all. Also, I thought the music from the first MIB was also much better than this one. The music from the first one was much better integrated into the movie to give each scene the proper "atmosphere" and to give the scene transitions continuity. I just didn't get that same impression in MIB II. I just didn't get the feeling that the characters were into the film...It just felt like they were reciting lines at a sunday church service. Overall, I think MIB II suffered from a lack of creativity as well as too high expectation. It had it's moments, but I did not feel the whole movie came together like the first one did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I sat down and watched a movie so definitive of all that is unholy about sequels. I've figured out how the production of this movie came to be. It goes like this:Three studio executives sitting around a poker table. "Hey, you know what we should do? Make a sequel to that Men In Black picture." "You know, that's a good idea! We can have that talking dog sing Aretha Franklin songs and smoke cigars." "Yeah, that'd be funny to see."Five guys off the street who had heard from a friend that the original Men In Black was good wrote 40 or so random scenes and put them all together in no particular order. They called their abstract collage Men In Black II (or MIIB so they could fit it on the backs of action figures). Barry Sonnenfeld read the script whilst sitting on the pot and said "We'll start shooting Friday". He then proceeded to direct the movie from 600 miles away over Yahoo! Messenger. They used the first take for every scene and did the special effects with Microsoft Word 97 (Don't ask me how, but they did it). Then Rick Baker made some really good creatures only to have them shown for.00000273 of a second.With filming complete they made the Burger King toys then began editing the feature. With a lack of anyone who knew how to run the editing software they were forced to turn the entire thing into one enormous flip-book. You can know see a screening of the flip-book at your local theater.Good work Hollywood execs you've made us all dumber once again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeez, people are digging into this like it's Satan. This is a funny film that, if anything, has many sight gags, side-jokes and throw-aways that are precious and hysterical that may not all be caught. (C'mon, the dog asking if they are "still sitting Shiva?" That's GOLD! OK, maybe ethnic humor isn't for all since I was the only one laughing.) `4Men In Black II' has great swipes at celebrities, politicians, New Yorkers and more. This is fun, light and breezy viewing. Isn't this what we want from a summer blockbuster? All loose ends tied up? No. All the parts work together? No. But it is entertaining and stands on its own merits. (Perhaps 88 minutes is a tad short, though). Tommy Lee Jones is great as always and while Will Smith does a little too much of his "Hey, I'm funny and have everything under control" shtick, he still does an admirable job. Kudos to the always amazing Tony Shaloub and Rip Torn, who had me at "Defending Your Life." Barry Sonnenfeld has had some wonderful hits (`Addams Family Values' has to be one of the funniest films with a razor-sharp script), and sad misses (`Wild Wild West'.) MIB II helps restore some luster to his name-badge after the recent lower entries from him (remember `Big Trouble'? No? Well, neither does anyone else, but it doesn't change the fact that he is a wildly talented director who, like anyone else, is entitled to some non-blockbusting hits, OK?) Alright, future star watch: Rosario Dawson. A long way from `Josie and the Pussycats.' Well, perhaps not mega-star, but certainly a wonderful character actress. She's got the acting chops and I would rather see her take on serious roles (meaning meaty, not just drama), instead of large and vacuous parts in big films, which could happen down the road. She's a force to be reckoned with and will be around for a while, one would hope. Look, the first film broke some new ground and was such a delight, but seriously, you can't expect to repeat the same feeling again, now do you? Now that things are set-up, it has to go in different directions, and while the story isn't too deep or even menacing, it is the fun in getting through it that keeps us enjoying it. Forget about what I say here; forget about what all others say. Go in with your own tabula rasa and let the movie create the review for you. Don't pre-judge it but enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II is a fantastic, funny, and whimsical ride that is definitely on-par with the original, but probably will not be as fondly remembered, simply due to nostalgia factor. It's good to see Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones together again, though the filmmakers could have reunited them sooner in the movie. MIB II maintains its momentum with a blend of clever jokes and eye-popping effects, balanced with some nice, sentimental moments.Much of the original cast has returned, but Linda Fiorentino's Dr. Laurel Weaver is sorely missed. Her absence is more than remedied, however, by the presence of NewsRadio's Patrick Warburton, who is as laugh-out-loud funny here as he is playing Johnny Johnson. (also back from the original film, albeit in a different role, is David Cross, another NewsRadio alumni) Rounding out the ensemble is Frank, the talking pug, MIB Chief Zed, Jeebs, and the sarcastic worm guys. The villain this time around is Serleena, an intergalactic Medusa-like alien, bent on destroying the world. One cannot watch this delightful romp through New York City without thinking of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed during the filming of the movie. Director Barry Sonnenfeld opted not to digitally alter the film in the aftermath of the tragedy, and I'm sure the absence of the towers will be felt by all who see it. I couldn't help but think of the scene in the original film where Will Smith's character is quietly contemplating his life before joining the Men in Black, while watching the sun set between the towers.All things considered, Men in Black II is a sequel that fans should thoroughly enjoy, while eagerly hoping for another installment. My only qualm is the song "Nod Ya Head." which will never be as catchy as Will Smith's "Men in Black."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1997 MIB was a classic character comedy, never mind the special effects. This one has terrific visuals, but Will Smith is out of character from the first 10 seconds. For God's sake, why couldn't they leave `J" the sweet (albeit considerably less naive) guy he was in 1997? Why not bring K back to toughen him up? Work the plot towards the revelation that the Light is K's daughter, the result of his one slip from stern duty, heartbreak at separation, etc.? As it is, it's a string of gags of varying quality, and a totally unlikable smart-ass J.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, for some reason Men In Black seems like the type of movies that Tim Burton would direct. Anyways, M.I.B. II was a good cleverly done film. I found it more hilarious than the original and I loved all the Spielberg and George Lucas inside jokes (Like the evil-looking R2-D2 droid). The Michael Jackson cameo was hilarious! And Lara Flynn Boyle and Rosario Dawson added a sort of sexiness to the film. All in all, if you enjoyed M.I.B. you'll enjoy M.I.B. II. Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Lara Flynn Boyle, what more could you ask for? 3 1/2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why ruin a good thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the previews for MIBII came out, my sister and I were so excited we could hardly stand it. After seeing the first 3 times in theaters, then buying the video, we were hoping for another one just as exciting, witty, funny and creative as the first one. However, we were sorely disappointed when we went into the movie theater today and the first few scenes crawled by. I kept hoping that maybe Will had had a bad day on the set, and once Rip Torn came in, the movie would pick up it's pace a little. Well, I got what I asked for, only the whole thing was thrown into hyper-speed, with no logical sequence, and a last minute resolution thrown in. My lack of comprehension might have been augmented by the fact that my sister kept whispering hoarsely "WHAT JUST HAPPENED?" in my ears throughout the film. But not only was the plot hard to follow, there was no spirit- no spunk. Agent J, Will's character, has become so hardened by his experience that he has no more of his anti-authority spunk and "all that" attitude that made him so funny and charming in the first movie. It's as if they used up all their ingenuity on the first one and decided to throw another together just to make a couple billion on opening day before word got out that it, well, sucked. To make a long story short: if the original means as much to you as it did to me, don't ruin your good impression of the cast and crew of MIB by seeing this sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!! This was a great movie! It was so cool...and the aliens...and the doggie was so cute!...Mom, can I see it again!!? Can I! Can I! huh, mommy...can I? But if you are older than 8 years old...well, I'd say...if you MUST see it, catch the matinee...that way it's only five dollars worth of buyer's remorse. Now, there were some cute effects... Frank has a surprisingly melodic voice, for a New Yorker... the reneuralizer scene and the Peter Graves tape with the campy effect makes a nice contrast. And that video store scene was pretty funny. The first MIB was wonderful...totally from the left field from start to finish. But MIB II is just the same formula movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought some of the jokes were funny, but it just didn't have the overall comedic feel. Admittedly, MIB 1 is a tough act to follow, but I just didn't see any creative effort on the part of the producer/director. I think the appeal of the first MIB was the innovative theme. The innovation just wasn't there in MIB II. And a movie with such high expectations would do well to not to try to ride on the coattails of the first movie too much. How did Frank the dog...he's a dog, OK?! How did he get that darned cellphone headset on his itty bitty head? Don't you need opposing fingers to do that? And ...they're armed, their dangerous, they have six arms...they are ... the worms...Well, not exactly the US marines! they were funny, playing twister and all. Also, I thought the music from the first MIB was also much better than this one. The music from the first one was much better integrated into the movie to give each scene the proper "atmosphere" and to give the scene transitions continuity. I just didn't get that same impression in MIB II. I just didn't get the feeling that the characters were into the film...It just felt like they were reciting lines at a sunday church service. Overall, I think MIB II suffered from a lack of creativity as well as too high expectation. It had it's moments, but I did not feel the whole movie came together like the first one did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I loved the first MIB. The bug, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, was hysterical. The movie was alot of fun, Will Smith was Will Smith. Goofy and sarcastic.. Just the right amount of attitude. In MIB 2, he's a bit to serious. Almost seemed like the man was suffering some behind the scenes depression during filming. The plot seemed contrived, as if they wrote it solely to make a sequel, rather than because some writer actually had a great story idea that had to be made into a movie. The movie WAS entertaining, for sure, but on an average level whereas the first MIB was one of those one of a kind hits that likely will never be reproduced. My score: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.5 out of 10: Worth seeing, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall good. I don't feel cheated by spending $5.50 at the matinee to see this one. Definitely closer in quality and spirit to MIB 1 than to the Wild Wild West (which was what I was dreading.) Several good gags throughout and the performances are good, but they could have been better had the cast been allowed to act, instead of being jump-cut from scene to scene. Men in Black 1 was comedy of substance; this film does not give you much time to think.  What's troubling is the pacing. Scenes that could have otherwise been great are rendered just OK because they fly by. Most scenes seem to be slapped together without the benefit of transitions. There were several potential themes in the script, but they also zip by without being explored. I don't know if the film makers ran into trouble having to redo the ending because of 9-11: if they were out of money or found themselves painted into a creative corner, or if they were just trying to pander to the current generation of video game-raised youngsters, but I kept wanting to see the movie as it was originally scripted. How this movie will stand up to repeated viewings remains to be seen. I will sit through it at least once more to see what I missed. And it would not discourage me from seeing MIB3 if and when it comes out, but advice to the film makers: Slow it down.  If you liked MIB1, go see this one. If you didn't like MIB 1, I'd recommend not.</fullReview>

I'd hoped they would have used an idea from the cartoon (which is very good) but they stuck with this silly little yarn.

		<fullReview>Men In Black II is one of those films that you will either love or hate. It really depends on personal taste. I honestly enjoyed it for what it was. Frank the dog and the worm guys finally get the screen time they deserve. It was also nice to see the story take off as opposed to the original where they take time to set the story up. Here, we already know the characters, therefore we don't need a complete reintroduction of the characters. The chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was right on as before.What didn't work was Rosario Dawson's place in the film. She plays an important role in the film but the plot to me didn't make much sense. I think the main problem lies in the fact that these movies are too short.With such a short run time, the development of the story is sacrificed. I say the same for the first film as well. Barry Sonnenfeld should really stop fooling around with such short little scripts and give the audience the kind of large scale story the fans deserve. Overall, Men In Black II is not a perfect movie, but it does stay true to the spirit of the original.</fullReview>

With director Barry Sonnenfeld, this movie is gonna be just as big as the first one. Like the first Men in Black, I loved it. Now, people may say this is better, but I think that they're pretty much great in their own way. I mean, in this you are given a plot with more complex creatures, weapons, and cars. Now, of course, where would the movie be without the head guy Zed (Rip Torn) and the dog who stills it all, Frank. Also, with a new character played by Rosario Dawson.  So, see this blockbuster hit.

		<fullReview>Bit of a dilemma on this one. To keep happy the fans of the first film, it needs to be like the first; but in being like the first, it loses what made the first memorable -- the dose of originality which took it a little way off the standard path but not too far to stray over the border.So while there's pleasing brio from Will Smith and terseness from Tommy Lee Jones, there's also a sense of wind `em up and watch `em go. The plot dynamic with Alien Baddy Doing Bad Thing is no more than a device for them to work round, unlike Alien Baddy in Part 1 who was a more organic part of the plot, and a much better and more satisfying actor.Some of the gags comment on the first film, and they're quite good; some are mere repeats (ie person X being an alien) and are weak.The Zaphod Beeblebrox gag doesn't work.Before reuniting with `K,' Will Smith has a new sidekick; unfortunately the sidekick is nothing more than a feed-line for gags.Certain characters from the first film are crudely dumped, further enhancing the suspicion that the film is merely a vehicle for Smith and Jones to be cute.But, hey, since the DVD of the film cost me just 80 US cents from Shanghai, I'm not complaining. And nor would I be had I paid full price at the cinema.</fullReview>

And in MIB fashion, ends with an unexpected twist.Lara Flynn Boyle and Johnny Knoxville do commendable jobs as Sarleena and her two headed henchman, and Rosario Dawson puts on an MTV Movie Award deserving performance as Laura. And Michael Jackson with an unexpectingly humorous performance as "Agent" M. 9.5 out of 10 stars, much better than the first one.</fullReview>

However...there comes a time when someone really needs to decide if a movie should be made or not. Too long, too predictable, too full of plot holes. I think the director was happy with his $200 million from the first movie and thought he could make more money off of a sequel.  Honestly, could we possibly throw Burger King in the movie anymore? And what about those horrible goofy moments showing Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart? Oh, and let's not forget trying to recycle old, terrible characters from the first movie into this one. Johnny Knoxville was definetly a "Jackass" for even being in this movie, his acting was so, so horrible. The worms were the best part of the movie, as was the locker in Grand Central Station. The ending was one of the WORST endings to a movie I've ever seen next to Hollow Man. I mean, wasn't the Earth a marble that aliens were playing with in the first movie? Now we've graduated to being a locker in the second? Do yourselves a favor...either rent the first movie and watch it again, or just watch the trailer a few times...you'll get the drift.

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original MIB, I suggest watching it before seeing the sequel. Otherwise, you probably won't get anything out of this one, like myself. Will Smith is a funny guy and he's the only person keeping this film afloat. "Men In Black II" is a weak hodgepodge of comedy, romance and sci-fi in which none of them stands out from the others. It's basically a shoot-em-up alien movie with some decent special effects, but there's no heart at all. Even during a sad scene at the end, I felt absolutely nothing.Surprisingly, the movie's rated PG-13, yet most of those laughing in the audience were kids under 10. You know, the kind of kids who laugh at anything, even though they don't have a clue what the joke means. The talking dog was the worst thing in the movie, but the little ones loved him. Putting that forsaken song "Who Let The Dogs Out" in one of the scenes was the last nail in the coffin.If you're a MIB or Will Smith fan, you'll probably like this movie. But the movie's extremely short length (it felt like an hour) and lack of any cohesiveness will bore most others. In the end, the whole thing comes across as a money machine that will undoubtedly make millions it doesn't deserve. Do yourself a favor and catch "Star Wars" or "Spider-Man" again before they're pulled from theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, I just got done with seeing this movie today. I was waiting for months to see this ever since seeing movie posters, signs, etc pushing the launch of the movie. I seen it wasn't worth it at all.The characters acted somehow differently. They just didn't have the same effect as the first movie. The jokes were not as good as the first movie as well. I found the story hard to follow as well. The story confused me in a few parts. I know this movie is pure fiction but there is a point where it gets completely unbelievable. An example of such is when the main enemy of the movie and 4-other aliens wreak havoc within the MIB building. The last fight in my opinion wasn't good at all. I was glad when the movie was over so I can do something worth spending my time on.This sequel was not worth it at all in my opinion. I warn many fans out there to be cautious if your going to see this. I wanted to see this for about 4-months and I got disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY contain spoilers*Summer is a great time. It's the time when you anticipate some of the most exciting and action-packed movies of the year. You wait for films to make you laugh, cry, and jump out of your seat with exhilaration. You wait for that one gem to rise up among all of the garbage that plagues our theatres each year.Unfortunately, this 'aint it.Seeing as how the first 20 minutes of the film are setup and "J" trying to get "K" back into MIB, that takes away just under 1/4 of the movie. The film clocks in at less than 90 minutes. Way too short by today's standards.As in the first film, there was a lot of back-and-forth banter between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, but being as though it reminds you too much of the first film, it grows tiresome very quickly. Will Smith gets a bunch of one-liners, which are amusing at times, but once again, become old fast.I would like to have seen Rip Torn in more scenes; he is more fun to watch on screen than Smith and Jones combined, but because of the extremely short length of the film, there wasn't any chance of that happening.We didn't see that many different or exciting aliens this time around. The huge worm (Jeff) in the subway system was more of a main character than "Z" was. Sure, we saw a bunch of friendly aliens (in the Post Office and the check-in station, etc) but the lack of exciting aliens to confront the MIB was disappointing.There WERE a few funny parts; Will Smith is a naturally funny man when he's not trying too hard, and although this was probably his worst acting performance of his career, it didn't stand out because the rest of the acting was just as bad (if not worse).Overall, MIB2 was a huge disappointment. They could have done so much more with it, but it seemed like they relied on the name "MIB" to carry the film. It unfortunately did not.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers! I really liked the first MIB. It was orginal and fun. This one was a nightmare. About ten minutes into the film, I knew right away, this one was going to suck. The jokes, through out the movie, were as lame as Will Smith's acting. This one had one bad joke followed by another one and the special effects weren't that special. The movie, however, does get good towards the end. I found myself enjoying the last fifteen minutes of the movie, because that's when special agent K finally comes back. Up until that point the movie is pure dribble that never really fill the bucket, if you get what I mean. Avoid this movie...trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! The new MIB adventure packs more of action then the first film with more of the comedy that occurs in it also. The movie starts off with a retelling of the MIBs oldest cases in the form of a sci-fi myth show narrated by Peter Graves. The story is of the Zarthons and how they want to hide their light of Zartha...the light is " a cosmic force so powerful that in the wrong hands it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha" the tale ends with the Zarthons fleeing Earth after being refused to hide the light there by the MIB, they are followed after by Serleena...the stories main antagonist....In the opening Serleena (after some cosmic carnage) landing on earth. She's received a tip from an alien (played by Jackass' Johnny Knoxville) saying the light never left earth so goes into motion a race of Jay (rejoined by his mentor Kay) to find the light before Serleena.The movie zips along at a fair pace...I can't believe this is only a 90 Minute movie...but it is and it's fast. Smith and Jones omit the same chemistry that they had in the first film..You can tell these two like working together....but the real star seems to be the effects which areas wild as ever...aliens come in many different shapes and sizes from Jeff the huge ass worm to the worms.....Overall this is a great summer movie and deserves a big box office ranking.... just as memorable as the first...no matter how many times I get flashy thinged...10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to summarize the movie, just give my reactions. MIIB delivers exactly what the producers believe the audience wants. It brings back many of the same characters and effects, and most of the same sets, over and over. The makers found incredible success in the first film, so they took the safe--and bland--approach to the sequel.Hey, McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have done the same thing and made billions.But in MIIB, the jokes are flat and the plot is stale.One example of more of the same: the funny looking alien in the pawn shop who can grow a new head. We get to see his head blown off and grow back twice. With only 90 minutes to fill, we get way too much of the same gags from the first film. (When you see the film, you can count 'em for yourself.)Think about sequels that have offered a new dimension to a great idea: TEMPLE OF DOOM, ALIENS? The new version of MEN IN BLACK offers nothing new, and in fact undermines what was so wonderful in the first movie, the humor, chemistry, and clever satire of government agencies, New Yorkers' apathy, and X-FILES.The producers gave us more of what they thought we liked in the first one?and nothing else.</fullReview>

The story was very similar to the first, big ugly monster lands looking for small item, single girl which makes the movie a trio, much like the first movie.

		<fullReview>The earth is facing a new threat and Agent J (Will Smith)is on it. Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is bought back from his "retirement" (he was flashed in the end of the first movie and doesn't remember he's an agent). But only parts of his memory recovers. Together with Agent J they are looking for hidden clues to find his past, which is going to lead them to "the light of Zartha". But the alien queen Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) wants the light for her own evil means.This sequel is almost as good as the first one. Almost, because the first one had some more moments of laugh and is was more unique then this one. But it's worth seeing and you'll probably have a great time watching The Men in Black protecting the Earth from the Scum of the Universe, again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones put on their black suits and shades to save the Earth once again. This time round, the alien scum is in the shapely form of the lusciously leather-clad Lara Flynn Boyle, playing lizard-cum-lingerie-model, Serleena. She's searching for the ... and that's all you need to know about the plot!What separates Men in Black II from most sequels (purely money-making exercises, all of 'em!) is that it's at least as good, oftentimes better, than the original film.Smith and Jones make an excellent double-act and here they are in top form. Each actor is also given enough solo scenes and material to establish their own individual comedic strengths. Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is snappy, the computer effects seamless and there are a great many excellent sight gags and smart one-liners in Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro's script.The film's opening sequence, a cheesy mysteries-of-the-Universe tv show, shows the filmmakers have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks. That's as in mouth! And that's where they stay for the rest of the film.Yeah, I know, it's all individual taste, but, for me, the first Men in Black was a great idea which didn't live up to its premise. It had too many flat spots, became just another generic Hollywood big budget movie and, for a comedy, had far too many unforgivably unfunny patches.Men in Black II has learnt its lessons, least of which is the two main characters don't get buried by computer animation and can flex their personalities. Purists will prefer the original. But anyone wanting to sit back and enjoy a good laugh from what is the best of the summer blockbusters so far will get a very good entertainment return for their investment.A sequel is probably already in the works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who let this Dog out?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Speed 2: Cruise Control, the sequel Men in Black II went down near the top of the list of all-time drops in quality from the original. This movie sucked.I'll admit some of the humor and special effects were good. That part accounted for 3% of the entire movie. So, math buffs, that means 97% or an overwhelming majority of the so-called comedy lines and special effects were just plain awful. What a giant step backward from the creativity in the MIB universe and laugh-out-loud comedic lines from part 1.Everything, and I mean everything was overkill. Similar to the enormously overused Scrat in the sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown, Frank the Pug, one of the best characters created in MIB 1, is not only in 40% of the movie, they overstayed his welcome to the point of severe annoyance. (Who Let the Dogs Out? was old way before this movie came into existence and was too obvious anyways.) In addition, Kay (Jones) spewing off codes and Jay (Smith) going to mush every time Jay overshadows him was just getting stale.And the worst part (if you don't count Johnny Knoxville selling out, in addition to the worst and most unfunny CGI character since Jar Jar) was that one of the best aspects of MIB 1 was Jones's straight man character, Jay. Here, they have to cover up for MIB 1's mistake in that closing. He went into retirement and they spend exactly half the movie getting him to reverse this error in the plot. Thank God, they didn't give Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) amnesia in the Lethal Weapon 1 finale and then spend half of the wonderful Lethal Weapon 2 trying to not only get his character back on track but satisfy what they audience came to see.In this abomination sequel, aside from the aforementioned bringing Jay back into the line of duty, we have lonely and depressed Kay going through partners like Elizabeth Taylor. Once back with Jay, they battle another alien (in the form of the gorgeous, but practically useless in her role, Boyle) who, again, wants a small object that will again destroy the Earth in the matter of an hour. Again.You'll see characters from part one, like Torn's Zed flip in the air because, well, they think it would be funny for someone 108 years old kickboxing. You'll see Frank the Pug sing and whine and sing and whine?repeatedly. You'll see terrible and unfunny cameos from (the now late) Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart ? which would've been funny, if the joke wasn't already used just about enough in the first movie. You see a grosser Knoxville than his persona from Jackass, but that's just because his 2-headed CGI character was horribly juvenile ? more so than the MTV show. One of him is just enough. And you'll see everything you loved about the original being flushed away. (Literally.) And what's the deal with the original and wonderful Linda Fiorentino not returning? Obviously Jones and Smith were getting a boatload to sell out. It must have played out like this when she read the script: Fiorentino probably smiled and said, "You've got to be kidding me. At least I have standards." SKIP! Let's hope MIIIB is better; they've certainly had enough time to prepare. Jones is NOT getting any younger and he can't start using the Lethal Weapon line "I'm getting too old for this sh*t" as we already know that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As funny as the first on paper. The problem is that with the first all the surprises are blown - it's as if we've seen the second already and not been neuralised.This film relies more heavily on the two principals. This is for two reasons. Firstly, with the jokes better telegraphed the film becomes more of a performance act. Will Smith is the partner in the ascendant here, really timing his jokes well. The second is that in order for there to be some sort of development, relationships have to blossom. These are well-handled and Rosario Dawson is particularly affecting, under the circumstances.The rest is as it was before - i.e. excellent - including an OMG-is-that-for-real cameo from the Prince of Pop. Lara Flynn Boyle might be an exception here but I think her character has a raw deal (inasmuch as she's an alien half the time she's on screen anyway). I can't see a third one. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very feeble sequel to a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is strong argument for the old rule that producers should not do sequels and viewers should not watch them. There is not one original idea or really new joke in it and the old ones are flogged to death. The leather-clad snake-lady is a feeble substitute for the havoc-wrecking giant cockroach of the first film, and a talking animal is only funny in small doses. This either "not-quite-getting there" or "overdoing-it" does apply to practical all figures and scenes. Also speed and timing are definitely lacking - the two aspects which made MIB a must-have-seen for all aspiring comedy directors. O. k. - there were a few jokes that made me laugh after all, therefore three points rather than nil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly disturbing, but still thoroughly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darren "The Human Beat Box" Robinson Mark "Prince Markie Dee" Morales Damon "Kool Rock-ski" Wimbley Peter North This is one of those new convenient direct-to-video sequels that I've discovered in the days since I stopped going to the theater. I always feel guilty going these days because the rude theater owners keep the film running even when the other patrons are getting important cell phone calls. It could be an emergency! I spotted this one during a trip to the "Adult" video section, which I can only assume is reserved for films with complex themes only adults would understand (and even then only with hours of silent contemplation). I had high hopes. I had seen the first Men in Black, and I was impressed with the Fresh Prince's ability to act and maintain a wholesome, family-oriented comedic styling. But with his absence in the sequel, Men in Black II: Black in Men, one can really tell that the film suffered.First of all, there are way too many sex scenes. After six or seven of them, the movie just gets redundant, and when I take the time out of my busy schedule to see a movie, I don't want to get bored in the first half hour. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't mind a sex scene being in a movie, as long as it progresses the plot and it is important to convey the true story or message of the movie. However, MIB just doesn't seem to follow those traditional rules. In the first ten minutes alone, there were 2 sex scenes and one strip-tease that had nothing to do with character development at all: Delivery Man: I have a package to deliver.Agent K: Yeah, I bet you do. You can put it in the rear with the rest.Delivery Man: Well, it's kind of big, so you'll have to sign for it.Agent K: And where should I sign? Delivery Man: You can sign right here. . . *zzziiippp!* The total lack of female roles in the movie was also a bit disturbing. Though when you think about it, the movie is called Men in Black, I just feel that some of the roles, such as the French Maid, the Mother-In-Law, and the Dancing Queen could have been played by professional actresses rather than men dressed as women. But if it worked for Shakespeare, I guess it can work for director MIB 2 Marvin Lebinski (Kickboxing Cyborg 6, Schindler's List 3: Rise of the Vampires).Luckily, the movie kept my attention by headlining the film with such great talent as 1980's rap stars The Fat Boys (stars of Disorderlies and Shaft: Interpret That as a Sex Reference Because this is a Porno), and Motley Crue drummer, Tommy Lee.An imperfect film, but clearly a good, honest effort. I even wrote a letter to the studio and told everyone how much I admired their work. They clearly didn't have the budget of the first one yet managed to make a movie almost exactly as long as the original. There's this great thing the fattest rapper does whenever he sees an alien (they never show the aliens, I guess a budget thing) his eyes get real big and he goes running away, arms flapping screaming "Aaaaallllien!!! Aaaaaallllien!!!" He does this thirty or forty times and in fact these scenes make up the bulk of the cinematic narrative. There are also a series of very innovative scenes done entirely in an improvised, rhyming rap style: Fat Boy 1: "I knew it! The damn President is from Venus!"Fat Boy 2: "Yo, spew it! Let's cram peppermint between us! Fat Boy 3: "Don't je w it! Ham is a resident of my penis!" Tommy Lee: "Don't look at me, man. I don't even wanna fu ckin' be here." And so on, the rhyming sort of petering out until they all stand around in silence and eventually wander off the set. Some will criticize but try making a movie yourself! It's hard! So a few flaws, but definitely worth the buck rental price.I give it two smilies! :D :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What you got with Men in Black, you get again with Men in Black 2. Jones and Smith saving the universe. And we get plenty of wasted time, because before anyone can be saved Jones must retrieve his lost memory. So, that's fun.We have the same cast, only now with more bad actors added to the good. Lara Flynn Boyle, who has never done anything remarkable since "Twin Peaks". Patrick Warburton, who thankfully has a small role because he's worthless outside of "Seinfeld". Johnny Knoxville? What has he done for me lately? David Cross returns, this time playing a geeky video store employee with a co-worker who looks a lot like Natalie Portman. I don't mean to ruin it for you, but it's not Portman: it's some unknown named Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine. But she was just as hot, so I guess it doesn't make a difference.Rosario Dawson was great, she was much better here than in "Rent" or "Clerks II". Her character is similar to the opera singer character from "The 5th Element", in a round about way. (Well, it makes sense once you've seen the movie.) Her role in the grand scheme of things is very interesting (a much better backstory than the weak first movie).I hated the talking dog (Frank). The animation of him talking was urine-poor, and there was absolutely no need for him to sing "Who Let the Dogs Out". Most of this country has already forgotten the Baha Men, thank goodness.I thought the product placement was bad in the first film. It's ten times worse here: Sprint, Burger King, Mountain Dew, Marlboro, Bowflex, and Twister. And I felt like the film was a subtle advertisement for "I, Robot" with Will Smith fighting robots and aliens... even the directing looked the same (but I'm pretty sure it's not).At least one good thing came from this film: the terms "old and busted" versus "the new hotness". Hurrah. Does this make you want to see the film? Then see it. But you're not missing out if you rent "Willow" instead so you can spend more time with your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible sequel - what were the actors thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a fan of the Sci-Fi genre because it's unrealistic and the majority of the time over exaggerated. But I did find myself enjoying the 1997 film Men in Black which provided thrills and spills and great humour but more importantly a thirst for information which left me always wanting more, making me decide to watch this follow up. What we didn't want to see was predictability in humour, action and characters, which unfortunately is what the sequel is all about. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as the 'comedy' duo for special alien service 'The Men in Black' where Agent Jay must recover the light of Zartha and Agent Kay's memory.Their quick wit, humorous relationship and sharp tongues got them recognised in the first film as a comedy duo not to be messed with. However in this sequel they unfortunately can't pull off the charisma they carried so well in the first and are easily pushed aside, are unfunny and my respect for two of the greatest actors of all time was diminished. Predictability and over exaggeration are words in the dictionary and if you look them up you may find 'Men in Black II' listed. As a comedy genre you always expect jokes in every scene and there are but they are really unfunny and it's such a shame to see the talents, especially of Smith, wasted. His character is up to his usual tricks with romance and ass kicking attitude running riot around the streets of America. But his overall act as Agent Jay appears shallow and uncomfortable, contrasting his role in the first. The character of Agent K has also changed from the first with Jones portraying a more bored and unenthusiastic character. The character Frank, the dog, is so annoying I wanted to scream at the producers, typical dog jokes and completely unfunny. Because of these changes the film lacks a thrust of energy. Its very slow moving with in depth details controlling the dialogue which is unnecessary when Jay is talking about certain operations which are irrelevant to the plot. The whole idea of the film is about 'the light of Zartha' which can be confusing but more often is exaggerated and unlikable for many audiences. Even the graphics aren't as captivating as many would have hoped and when used are often unnecessary to the film's plot. Predictable unfunny and exaggerated - a sequel not bothering with</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is humor that drives this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the current commentator on this site that this movie is generally weak in character development and story; however, I don't believe it's milked. Frank is so damn funny and engrossing, the movie was bound to be a hit. Frankly I love the damn dog. He throws one liners, has great scenes (especially while driving around with J), and even converses naturally about women. The best line has to be "I'm attracted to her and she's not even my species." It was clear J was smitten and Frank, ever smitten with J and MIB, called it. He's not a new personality, but he's not old and he's not overused.Tommy Lee Jones is talented and can stretch any character. He starts humorous, which should have been natural and was, before giving way to his prior character. This again was how it should have been - - it was readjustment. Will Smith may have garnered acclaim for "Ali," and regardless of reviews and appearances, looked decent in "I, Robot;" moreover, he has grit in this movie. Particularly, he is quite good in the beginning before settling into his typical, but still engaging antics. The Jeff part that transverses to the pie sequence is followed by major desperation in J's character. It's unforeseen and initially awkward; however, as his relationship with Laura festers with possibility it becomes more natural and fitting. K gave that to us in the end of "Men in Black" with his obsession of stars. The first movie rushed that and it was a bit contrived, but Jones was able to slow it down and make it work.How J keeps "Putty" (come on he has no other name, although he isn't a bad actor) for five months as his partner, is beyond me. Especially because K trains J in two days in the first film. The reason it gets me is how awkward they still are and how dumb he still is (although J hits on this).Before I get to Lara Flynn Boyle, I have to express disappointment in Bo Welch. The costumes of the aliens weren't horrible, but rather really out there and unable to be taken seriously. The first time the aliens were real and the movie rough, but this time it's all about the humor. The aliens designed to bring in K for Lara's character are horrible (a ball-chinian? It's somewhat humorous but it gets ruined when K performs a improbable kick. Even worse is Rip Torn's paddle on Lara Flynn Boyle). The problem with this movie is it is so jokey. I can't stand the automatic driver, and why is a playstation controller the only thing that can commandeer this damn machine at hyperspeed? Overall I love Jack Jeebs, Knoxville's character is forgettable, Ben is cool for five seconds (I get the feeling he cares), Dawson is decent, but K and J are still the men. This movie was focused on J and his definite struggle, not MIB, and that is why the story isn't the focus. But how did David Cross elude being neuralyzed in the first movie? The movie works when the characters act, not when they say choice lines. It's balanced fairly well. And K still throws out some cool guidance to J and leaves the possibility for a MIB III, or MIIIB, if so desired.Lara Flynn Boyle is not bad, but the woman in power line is just poorly delivered, but fitting because it is Men in Black. She honestly seems dumb because she wastes 25 years and still doesn't locate the light; Knoxville's character does. She works though, especially toward the end and is bright enough to use her sexuality to her advantage. Not to mention her stuffing her face is kind of funny to keep tracking. And the robot alien is wickedly, wickedly cool (while K and J are apparently clairvoyant). Mostly I say enjoy this movie because you should laugh and you get a decent story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to MIB finds Agent Jay (Will Smith)getting rid of another partner (Linda Fiorentino's was zapped between movies and is back at the morgue). Jay clearly doesn't want another partner. However, with the arrival of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), Jay has to find the only person who knows the reason behind her presence on Earth: Kevin Brown a.k.a. Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who works at the post office. Problem is, Kay's memory was erased in the previous movie, and Jay must bring it back, save the MIB, which Serleena has under siege, and save the world.This was an o.k. film with a lot of interesting bits and pieces (Especially the little cameo by Michael Jackson as an alien representative), but the film falls flat too many times and too many plot holes (Where did Johnny Knoxville's character go? He just disappeared!). Stick with the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Aliens exist. Well, if you listen to most of Hollywood, a few scientists and a scarily large number of people on the internet. Imagine for a second though that not only do extra-terrestrials exist, but they visit Earth all the time and their 'airport' even has a Burger King. In 1997, we were introduced to the men who monitor these aliens. They don't have a life outside their work, but they save this planet most days without us even knowing it. They are the Men In Black."Men In Black" was an original, funny, well made comedy released to success and popularity in America and the rest of the globe. Unfortunately though, all too often, success leads to something terrifying. Success often leads to a sequel. Made five years after it's predecessor, this inferior second outing contains one or two funny moments, mostly involving the old partnership between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Ultimately though, the jokes are limited, spread too thin, and balanced out with a woeful script. The Men might still wear black, but their sense of humour has long since disappeared.Agent Jay (Will Smith) is working through partners at an alarming rate. Bored and lonely, he is a workaholic. After the evil Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) makes an appearance on the planet though, Jay finds himself travelling to a post office in the country to bring back his old friend/mentor Kay (Tommy Lee Jones). Together they must stop Serleena and save the MiB and all before the world explodes."Men In Black II" takes a lot of criticism for being a worthless, rushed, badly made film, and for the most part, this is acceptable criticism. Often long winded, and crucially, unfunny, it isn't a spot on the standards of the original. Personally though, it does contain one or two brilliant lines.Whether it's the locker people, the joke about the black autopilot or a few other cracking points, the great thing about "Men In Black II" is the way that Jones and Smith work together to practically spoof the original. With the characters changing positions between experienced and newcomer, the two actors are great at playing off each other's mannerisms and attitudes. Jones in particular is great as one of the few actors to ever manage to water down Will Smith's sometimes excessive personality. In so many films, Smith will perform a role, and sometimes ruin it, purely by being himself and failing to abandon his "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" attitude. In both MiB films though, he is able to go as extreme as he likes, purely because the almost deceased like qualities of Tommy Lee Jones balances the pairing out. The two appear to enjoy themselves during the film, and in jokes where they poke fun out of the original ("It's time to put on the last suit you'll ever wear.... again"), they thrive."Men in Black II" is not a particularly good film. With long stretches of tedium and boredom, it is far from the quality of it's predecessor. It does contain a few moments of hilarity though. These rare gems are often brilliant spoofs of the original film, and the reason they often work is because of the two main leads. "Men in Black II" is never going to top anyones list of films, but to see the partnership of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones again, it's worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not worth your time... Superman 4 feel to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And when I say Superman 4 feel, I mean it's bad. Just like this-shouldn't-be-allowed-to-be-called-a-sequel S4, when over, this film leaves a slight, uneasy sensation in your belly, almost like you're becoming nauseous. This is why:I can honestly say I liked the first film, though it has been quite some time since I saw it. The thing about the first film was that it combined a wonderful childish sense and approach, with a cool mood, cool story, cool acting, cool humour, and, ever-so-important, a cool villain. This film has none of that. The childish sense I mentioned, is about commitment, being passionate. Children are much more passionate than the rest of us, more creative. You were really interested in the world, about the characters and especially, in getting to know more about MiB in the first film. In short, it was a big trip of discovery. But as a spectator in the second film, you are not at all engaged or committed, maybe because you know too much about the world you are seeing. Or maybe, because the director felt he had been-there-done-that, maybe he needed that discovery. It just wasn't fun anymore.Also, the villain really blows. It should really be in the Villain Handbook For Dummies: When making really hot villain with nice tits - DON'T give her massive amount of tentacles. The story could have been neat - but wasn't. You get the creeping suspicion they had a checkbook when writing the script: Introduction - check. Getting good guy back alongside lame humour - check. Progressing story alongside more lame and dull and lame humour - check. Putting main character into danger before reaching climax and defeating villain - check. Make good movie - *sinister laughter*MiB II - flat and empty. Buy a soda instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember Barry Sonnenfield being interviewed after MIB 1 saying from a financial and logistical point of view no 11 could never happen, what a shame it did. Not a truly awful movie, Smith is fine(ish) &amp; Lee Jones continues with the MIB 1/Fugitive character that has kept him going through all these years - the script isn't remotely funny, Jack Nicholson's ex is rather dull and Rip Torn looks vaguely embarrassed - presumably until he read the pay cheque. All in all it's just so disappointing, the novelty has worn off entirely - all that noisy cricket waffle etc and frankly the money could have been better spent on decorating a small country in Africa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK 2Starring: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Johnny Knoxville, Lara Flynn Boyle, Rosario Dawson and Rip TornGenre: Action/Comedy/Sci-FiStar Rating: ***1/2 out of 5Rated PG-13 for Sci-Fi Action Violence and Some Provocative HumorAs we enter the sequel to the Men In Black, it is 4 years later from the first movie. Agent Jay (Will Smith) continues to work for the Men In Black and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) returned to the comforts of civilian life. While investigating a seemingly routine crime, Jay uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), an evil Kylothian monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. It's a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay--who not only has no memory of his time spent with the agency. One of the funny things about when Jay is trying to refresh Kay's memory from being with the MIB is when the car pulls up and Kay asks if he is the one that drives and Jay tries a little bit of reverse psychology on Kay by saying that he was the one that did all the driving! Plus another funny part was when Jay needed another partner, Frank the Pug volunteers and he walks out to the car with a little suit and tie on. Another funny part is when the car pulls up automatically and this one fake guy gets sucked into the air bag and then Kay says, "Does that come standard?" and then Jay says, "Actually it came with a black dude, but he kept getting pulled over." I kind of liked this one a little better than the first Men In Black movie. Also I thought Lara Flynn Boyle was really sexy in this movie!BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER EXCELLENT HIT SEQUEL!</fullReview>

The plus points are that the Alien characters are superb especially the dog and that at 80 odd minutes 'it's length is just right.

		<fullReview>Sure, there's a Roman numeral appended to this movie, and we all know what that means. It means someone decided to eke some more cash from the first movie in a series. Which is not in itself such a nasty, horrible thing, but all to often sequels are awash in dreckery, hodge-podge, and undying crapitude.The original MIB starred Will Smith as Agent Jay and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent Kay, part of a superdupersecret organization that monitored the activities of aliens on Planet Earth. At the end of the first movie, Kay neuralizes himself, erasing all memory of his MIB adventures, choosing instead to retire from active duty and leaving Jay to handle those mean ol' aliens all on his own.As MIB II begins, Kay's now a postmaster. Yep, you read that right, a postmaster. In a small town. Wny, he's about as removed from alien adventurin' as one could get. Meanwhile, Jay is BAOC (big agent on campus) in the land of MIB, answering directly to Zed (Rip Torn).Which is all fine and dandy till some oversexed strumpet (Lara Flynn Boyle) from outta space lands on Earth (okay, so she's not really female or human, but rather takes the guise of a model in a victoria's Secret catalog) to find some special light that was supposedly left there back in the day. If she/it finds the light, the planet is doomed. So she takes MIB headquarters hostage. I mean, after all, who wouldn't? It seems like the right thing to do.Jay's the only agent left running loose, coincidentally, but it's Kay who holds the right information in his now-addled brain, info that could Save the World from Destruction. Trouble is, Kay can't remember a darn thing, being neuralized and all. He doesn't even remember being an agent.Can Jay deneuralize Kay? Can they both save the world? Will Lara Flynn Boyle ham it up as the evil temptress, or will she try to save her career and turn in some decent work? YES! YES! NO!This is truly a popcorn movie, although I forgot to eat popcorn while watching it. It's the kind of movie where you do other things while watching the DVD. You look up every now and then, see alien guts being spilled or hear witty repartee, and then go back to what you're doing. It's not a thinking man's movie; it's more of a slouching man's movie.And that's just fine. That's what the original movie was, after all. Smith and Jones are excellent and appealing; they have great chemistry onscreen. Think Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon, or Dreyfuss and Estevez in Stakeout. Boyle's a good foil, but she's mostly ineffectual. After all, it's the boys' show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps my review of this movie is so positive simply because I expected MIIB to suck. The professional reviews were not glowing in mid 2002, and I actually missed seeing this film on its theatrical run because of them. The fact is that MIIB is superb because it is SMART. It is self-satirizing, subtle, sprightly-paced and well performed. Will Smith's seeming biting back of the words that he just said is so delightful, and the film is not smeared with profanity or unnecessary juvenile humor. Tommy Lee is snappy in his delivery, and Rosario Dawson and Lara Flynn Boyle are not merely beautiful but thoroughly smart.In writing this script, someone decided not to dumb down the story. Still, the first film has some of the most memorable lines, where this movie has some of the most memorable scenes. I admit that I laughed HARD when Frank the dog did his extremely predictable but marvelously delivered jokes. Some of the jokes are just chuckleworthy, but they're ALL fairly funny. And Sonnenfeld did something that respected the audience's intelligence in his direction. You can watch the movie more than once and catch many details without getting bored.I cannot give MIIB too many points because it loses something for some cheap jokes, but it's a film I recommend you see because it is so much more smarter than its predecessor.</fullReview>

This film was just rushed, I know there were problems with actor fees and constant script revision. In my opinion this film should never had been made. Don't get me wrong I loved the original. Will Smith looked bored in this the jokes weren't funny the villian beautiful but totally stupid and I've never seen such blatant advertising, the scene when the alien was eating a juicy looking Whooper with a burger king restaurant in the background. I originally saw this in America in its opening week when I got back to London I was on a mission to warn my friends to stay clear of this.

		<shortDescription>The Further Adventures Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are back as (respectively) Agents `K' and `J,' to once again save the world and keep the universe in order, in `Men In Black II,' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, a Sci-Fi/comedy/action film that confirms something we've all suspected for a long time-- that most of the people who work at the Post Office are really aliens in human form (and doesn't that go for the DMV, as well?). And rest assured, it all comes with plenty of alien activity and is served up with a healthy dose of wry humor and `new hotness.' In short, if you've seen the original and/or the trailers for this one, you end up getting exactly what you expect-- and you'll sleep better at night knowing that the Men in Black are out there keeping us safe.Agent K has been `retired' for some time, but recent alien activity involving a particularly ruthless alien by the name of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) necessitates bringing K back into service, as it appears that Serleena is seeking something called the `Light of Zartha,' and if she succeeds in her quest it will spell disaster for the world. And buried in K's memory is information vital to the MIB effort to thwart Serleena. So J is dispatched to bring K back and deneuralize him, so together they can attempt to stave off the evil Serleena and save the world. It won't be easy, however, because Serleena is already a step ahead of them, and right out of the chute they encounter a couple of obstacles: A young woman named Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) needs their help and protection because of something she's seen; and to get K back into action, J has to engage the help of Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), who demurs, afraid of `losing' his head again with K around. And that hurts. J prevails, however, and soon K is back in the last suit he'll ever own-- again.Sonnenfeld relies heavily on the visual aspects of this one, which is wise in light of the fact that there is more by way of F/X available to him than story this time around. And he uses it all to great effect; the bottom line is, this movie is about one thing-- entertainment. And that's what you get. There's enough story to keep the audience involved, but it's nothing that's going to strain the brain cells. It may seem contradictory, but the originality and imagination Sonnenfeld employs here is nothing new-- it's there, but it's really just an extension of all that was generated in the original `Men In Black.' Still, it's used well, and Sonnenfeld keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace that keeps it fun and engaging. What really sells it, though, are the performances-- especially those of Smith and Jones.Will Smith steps right back into his character with facility, and he has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence that make him fun to watch. Smith draws heavily upon his own winning personality in bringing J to life, and he has the timing and a way of delivering his lines that make his character extremely personable. And that's exactly what a movie like this needs. This isn't a project that calls for any in-depth character analysis; still, Smith develops J enough to make him well rounded and credible-- and that's enough. It works. Most importantly, Smith holds his own with the F/X, and the lack of pretense in his performance is refreshing.As K, Tommy Lee Jones gives Smith the perfect straight-man to play off of, and right from the beginning he so perfectly captures that lethargic Postal Worker countenance, giving new definition to the word `droll.' And while J be-bops around (or is that hip-hops?), you get the feeling that as soon as K is back, he's the guy in charge. And leading up to K's deneuralization, Jones does a good job of affecting a believable sense of hesitancy, of maintaining `observation' mode until he gets to the bottom of whatever it is that's going on with this `J' character. You can always depend on Jones to deliver, no matter what role he's playing, and he certainly does here. And the casting is inspired: Smith and Jones make a great team on screen.Rip Torn is also perfect as MIB director Zed, the guy responsible for keeping tabs on all of this alien business. His character is inherently stereotypical, but Torn at least adds a personal touch and plays him quite well, putting some real life into his portrayal. It's a good performance inasmuch as Torn lends some zest and personality to a character that could have served little purpose other than that of being a vehicle by which to move the plot along. And it demonstrates how much a great character actor like Rip Torn can bring to any film.Lara Flynn Boyle does a good job in the less-than-challenging role of Serleena, a character which affords her little opportunity to do more than look good and generate a sense of evil, both of which she succeeds in doing effectively. The main thing is, she manages to establish who Serleena is, which is pivotal to the success of the film.The supporting cast includes Johnny Knoxville (Scrad/Charlie), Patrick Warburton (Agent T), Jack Kehler (Ben), David Cross (Newton) and Jeremy Howard (Bird Guy Postal Sorting Alien). Like the man said, `There's nothing new under the sun,' which is certainly the case with `Men In Black II,' which in essence is a continuation of the original, a kind of `Further Adventures Of' the MIB. But it's well done, fun and entertaining-- it's a kick just being able to spend some more time with these guys. And if you're a fan of the original and you go into this one expecting more of the same, rather than hoping to be dazzled by something entirely new, it'll be a satisfying, worthwhile experience. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard some bad reviews of Men In Black II before I paid for tickets, but no other movie caught my eye, so me and a few friends decided on MIB II.I must say now, that although the movie wasn't as lengthy as I'd hoped, it really beat my expectations. The movie had incredibly funny punch-lines, and what the previews gave away did not compare to the humor inside the movie. Several parts of the movie were just flat out hilarious (remember the locker scene and a certain few agents), and the acting was superb from two world-class actors and computer animated characters. Frank, the worms, and the supporting cast (Lara Flynn Boyle, Rosario Dawson, and Johnny Knoxville) did a very admirable job. Overall a purely entertaining movie with very witty lines.I also must admit, however, that the movie seemed a bit contrived and that some humor was forced and overly done. The story also seemed like it could have been more drawn out, and some plot twists of the movie were hastily done and inexplicably short.Although this movie beat my expectations, it did not shatter them. Frankly, though, I don't see how people can give this movie a 0 out of 10. 8-9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

Of course they could not come together if it were not for Barry Sonnenfeld who directed this picture with a vivid imagination and great special effects. A recent member commented that the worms were as annoying as hemmoroids which is not true, the worms actually make the movie even funnier as does Frank the Pug.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really lacked the spark/hipness/humor of the first one. All the funny stuff was in the commercials. I was really hoping for something that took MIB to the next level. I just didn't realize it was going to be one level DOWN. One last thing, what the hell was that STUPID 5-minute Sprint PCS "commercial" that I had to watch beforehand? Cripes! What REALLY p****d me off is that that "commercial" was actually created for Sprint PCS salespeople -- you'll notice how the guy actually talks about sales for customers, etc. Frankly, I've resigned myself to watching a commercial or two before the previews begin, but this one just made me want to throw my Sprint phone in the trash!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being a big fan of the first one, i heard they where making a sequel, i knew it would be rubbish. I mean MIB is meant to be secret but making the second which had crap acting in by the main actress who i don't even know with Jonny in who is great in Jackass but not in this with a stupid Jajabinks style second head aside him makes his character annoying. Also the all the CGI bits stand out. As for going back to Kay to bring him back its all cheesy. Good acting by of course will and tommy lee. What else can i say about this movie, hmmmmm, also its gone too child like at least the first one was bit scary and weired the seconds more kid friendly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen the first Men in Black, and loved it, don't see this. If you're a glutton for punishment, be my guest.To put it politely, this is not Godfather Part II (which was an entirely different story and concept). Its certainly not Terminator 2 (which improved on the original). Its not even an Alien Sequel (which all match up to the original at least okay).Its more like Analyse That or The Santa Clause 2: a disastrous retreading of the formula which adds nothing and is not enjoyable.Enjoyment was all i expected from MIB 2. I expected to take my dear mother along to the sequel a movie we had both enjoyed together: but instead I sat there writhing, muttering and foaming at the mouth at how they'd just decided to make this before a better script came along.An insult to the standards of moviegoers everywhere.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of these reviews you can tell that SOMEONE who works for the movie industries or the company that made MIB II wrote them. Then there are the ones who like to be different, and 'like' a movie because no one else does. Well, I'm not either of those.Potential Spoilers???In a good sequel, you can say to your friend "Ooh, watch this part that's about to come up".. and then the Predator slices through beef slabs or the lead villain says "Kneel before Zod!" In this particular sequel it would actual PAIN me to sit through again, let alone try to find something to tell a friend to look out for. The ONLY funny scene is in commercials, "Who let the dogs out". I dare anyone to name another funny scene. Sure, there MIGHT be some mildly amusing moments with the "black driver" line (which is in commercials constantly) and the king of pop MIGHT make one smile, but the rest are chin-in-hand, elbow-on-arm-rest moments.At times I felt SOO stupid for being in the theater. To think I spent money on it STILL angers me....Tell ya this...it has forced me to write my first comment on a movie.BAD, BAD, BAD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are the brainless, easily entertained fan boy type moviegoer that Hollywood depends on these days, man is this the film for you. Only this isn't a film. It's 88 minutes of various ingredients that put together by filmmakers who actually give a damn about their craft might cook, but not this boring oatmeal. Imagine if someone gave you three raw eggs, some tomatoes, cheese and ham and called that an omelet. That is the nutshell of what MEN IN BLACK II is all about. To put it another way, if you can remember back to '97 when the original came out then you should remember that it wasn't all that great either. But after a summer that started with SPEED 2, CON AIR and BATMAN &amp; ROBIN the original was a nice diversion. If you want to see a film about humans defeating aliens intent on destroying the earth and are hellbent on paying $9 for the privilege, then see LILO &amp; STITCH. Or at least give yourself some sort head injury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five years later covert government operative Smith has become the top agent of the Men in Black, but is assigned to track down former top agent Jones, restore his memory, and uncover the secret which could stop sexy but deadly alien Boyle and her obnoxious sidekick Knoxville from taking over the universe. Jones and Smith are once again a worthy duo, but the script isn't fresh enough, or inventive enough, or funny enough for this manufactured sequel to really soar. Some occasionally clever ideas, with a few solid laughs here and there, but the film is ultimately left with that dull, seen-it-all-before feeling as the plot is basically recycled from the first film and tries to squeeze as much as it can out of its two great leads. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II starts one dark New York City night, an intergalactic spacecraft crashes in Central Park, an alien life-form named Serleena emerges &amp; takes the form of a underwear model (Lara Flynn Boyle), Serleena is looking for the powerful Light of Zarthar &amp; heads straight for two-headed alien Charlie (Johnny Knoxville) who tipped her off about the Light being on Earth. Eventually the trail leads to an alien named Ben (Jack Kehler) who runs a pizza place who Serleena kills as witnessed by shop assistant Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) who then comes into contact with the Men in Black as Agent Kay (Will Smith) &amp; Agent Tee (Patrick Warburton) are sent to investigate. When it becomes clear that Serleena is after the Light of Zarthar the MIB boss Zed (Rip Torn) says only one person knows about the Light, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) who has been neutralised. Agent Jay must convince Agent Kay to come out of retirement, help regain his memory, stop Serleena &amp; save the planet Earth!Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who also has a small cameo role, I thought Men in Black II was pretty good if undemanding fun &amp; personally that's all I really think it sets out to achieve. The script by Robert Gordon &amp; Barry Fanaro based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham moves along like a rocket &amp; is never dull or boring with some huge special effects sequence not too far away. From flying cars &amp; spacecraft chasing each other over Times Square &amp; a spacecraft travelling through space destroying every planet as it goes to huge alien worms half eating a New York subway train &amp; a variety of bizarre aliens. The humour is still here but somehow doesn't seem as funny this time around as Men in Black II as a whole is very similar to the original Men in Black (1997), I often smiled but I never flat out laughed. The character's are still very likable but basically the same as the original with Laura becoming Agent Jay's love interest &amp; the sexy Serleena the obligatory villain dressed in black leather, hey it works for me! One thing that Men in Black II lacks is a decent interesting story for it's character's, everything that happens in the film seems to be there purely to show off an effect, in fact Men in Black II could be described as one overblown &amp; silly special effect after another with very little regard to what takes place between. While on the subject of the special effects I must admit that I wasn't that impressed with some of them, Will Smith riding Jeff the huge alien worm at the start look fake as does Creepy (Michael Baily Smith) the O-Zone stealing large headed flying saucer riding trio of duplicate aliens, the two headed alien played by Johnny Knoxville is both highly irritating, has probably the poorest effects &amp; strangely just disappears two thirds through the film never to be seen again! Considering Men in Black II wasn't made that long ago I'd say the special effects are actually quite poor. With a massive estimated budget of $140,000,000 &amp; at less than 90 minutes long it's difficult to see where all that money went, unless it was on Smith's salary. It definitely has that big budget Hollywood look &amp; polish about it although nothing really impressed or stood out that much. The acting is OK &amp; both Smith &amp; Jones work well together as mismatched MIB partners. Dawson as Laura is hardly in it while the same can be said for both Knoxville &amp; Flynn Boyle as the villains which is a shame as Boyle makes for a good baddie, in leather. I have given Men in Black II seven stars out of ten as I was entertained, had fun watching it &amp; as a mindless way to pass 90 odd minutes it's great but as a proper emotive, thought provoking film with a moral or a message then it falls well short of the mark. I think it's well worth a watch as long as your expectations aren't too high &amp; are just able to have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plus it has the always reliable Rosario Dawson in it. Just for her you've got to love the movie (or at least not hate it, in my opinion). But this movie delivers on the same formula that made the first one a success. The earnest Tommy Lee Jones, who apparently had no idea, why people would think he is funny, or it's just a rumor. Whatever the truth, his straight face against the clownish Will Smith works perfectly as it did in MiB too.For some reason (maybe creative, maybe because it didn't succeed to top expectations), this was the last MI(I)B people had the pleasure watching for awhile. But of course a third one would be on the way. I wouldn't say it's necessary to watch the first one to get this, but it's always good to have some back-story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Make Up For This..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIB 2 takes place 5 years after the first Men In Black film, both on film and in real-time, and I couldn't believe in that 5 years this is the script they agreed on. It's like they just went with the first draft they received and said "to hell with it, let's make money". Now, I loved the first MIB film. A funny, quirky in it's own way yet instantly memorable movie about a government agent that protects Earth from aliens as well as monitoring alien activity. MIB 2 consists of all the same gags, rehashed material and such as the first one, yet it does it far, far worse.The lines delivered in the movie sound like they were written by a 10 year old, and the dialogue was generally just forced jokes and straight up not funny jokes throughout. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did what they could with this script, as their performances aren't terrible by any means (it's especially funny when K gets his memory back) but they seem uninspired compared to the first. About halfway through the movie we are treated to Agent Z doing a Crouching-Tiger -esque kicks while he floats in midair for about 7 seconds. This type of humour belongs in martial arts spoof, not MIB. There are tons of other flaws like a PS2 controller being used to navigate their car, Michael Jackson having a cameo as an alien, everything about MIB 2 just screams unoriginal. That being said, it does have some redeeming points which stop it from being unwatchable. The chemistry between J and K takes a bit more time to develeop again this time round, but when they do its funny till the end. The SFX are OK, though i thought they were better in the first one, and even though the ending was rushed it was a nice surprise that i didn't see coming.MIB 2, not required viewing by any means, but if your a fan of the original at least worth checking out. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Stars: Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Rip Torn, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub and Patrick Warburton.This is a short and confusing, but quite entertaining sequel to the enormously popular Men in Black. The plot is confusing and kind of stupid, but it's a well done film (except for some of the special effects). One of my main problems with this, is that it all seems like a big merchandising scam. They introduce cute characters and not so cute ones that are quite memorable, just so they can make dolls of it, however I did think Frank the pug was a good addition to the film after making only a cameo in the first film. It's an entertaining film, but in no way is it good.** 1/2 out of ****. 82 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Men in Black 2' is the sequel to the film starring Will Smith, a comical FBI-style agent in charge of the department to keep aliens on Earth under control. As a sequel, it works poorly, and a lot of the charm that was in the original (laughter, character relationships) is forgotten in this film. The moments that were supposed to be funny were not funny, and I found Will Smith to irritate me a lot in this film. I would not recommend this film as a good follow-up to the original, and I would not recommend that anyone see this unless they are a huge fan of the original.

		<fullReview>A rather unappreciated film really, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot of great quirky comedic moments with some excellent physical humour. Depending on whether you enjoyed Frank the talking dog, the audience is overly exposed to the slightly dead pan humour of the dog, but redeems himself later on in the film. Its the minor characters in the film that really make the humour: the door man, Jeebs the funny looking black market dealer, the brief Michael Jackson moment, Zed. If you didn't enjoy the first film, I wouldn't recommend watching the second film, it isn't outstandingly brilliant but certainly a good fun film that the family can also enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith &amp; Jones try their best but the chemistry between them is sorely missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the worst sequel but any time you have seen a good movie and get disappointed by a sequel it's a bummer. The reason why the first movie was so enjoyable was because of the repartee between Smith and Jones. Here the limits of the plot requires them to have little screen time together and when they do share scenes they are usually engaging in a fight for the upper hand. J (Smith) believes that he is now the no. 1 agent but when K (Jones) gets in the game again he is bested until one particular scene involving a fight to beat the clock once again.As for the Alien scum, this time one of them comes in a more attractive package than the rather nauseating bug in the first part. Lara Flynn Boyle may look good but she is definitely in the wrong movie. She is absolutely no fun as the villain and her annoying sidekick, played by Johnny Knoxville is a waste of screen space.That said, the K character does show a little of the old spunk in the mail room scene but it is quickly turned into a rather lame pun on mailmen in general. The new addition, Rosario Dawson is somewhat charming but she is simply used as a cog in the plot machine. The Z character does an imitation of Yoda in a totally ridiculous fight scene and that's about it.The Men in Black are probably but a distant memory by now but back in '97 it was something else. There will probably not be another sequel and that's as it should be because what more could you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Review - Men in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie is interesting and the topic is attractive and special. In this film, I like the character Jay the most because he has a good sense of humor and he always makes people laugh even though he is in great danger. He is also wise enough to distinguish the aliens in human form and communicate with them. Kay is a good and professional alien-seeking agent, too. He shoots very well and is able to kill the evil monsters. K and J are said to be the heros of the Earth. They get along very well and no other partners can replace them. There are many aliens appeared in the "Men in Black" series, almost everyone(even in human form) is alien. The images of these aliens are very realistic and lifelike which people love to see. The special effects are really gripping and exciting. The sound effects are also brilliant enough to grab everybody to the cinema to experience that. I am going to highly praise the crew, extras, director, camera, lighting and sound operators' exertion to the film. "Men in Black" is the best movie I have ever seemed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you loved or even remotely enjoyed MIB, you should AVOID this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be the first to admit that I really liked MIB. It was fun, it was weird, it was cool, it was punchy.I'd started to become so wary of the abject crap that Hollywood was putting out these days, that I'd fallen into the habit of NOT obeying my long tradition of going on opening weekend... waiting for a few reviews to come in from The Man On The Street, and then making my decision about whether or not to spend my hard-earned cash on a movie, or just download it instead, just to satisfy my curiousity. (sometimes the ad campaign hints that the movie will suck, and sometimes the ads can be very compelling for a movie that winds up being very mediocre)Thing is, certain movies seem like such a no-brainer that I throw caution to the wind and go on opening-weekend, just for old time's sake. When I first saw MIB2 advertised, I thought about how much I giggled and smiled during the first one, that I thought sure, I won't download this, it's GOT to be good, I'll cheerfully fork over the cash and go see it opening weekend.Very rarely am I THIS wrong about a movie. The entire plot was a rehash of the first movie, without any of the wit, charm, pacing, or gee-whiz of discovery.I actually find myself enjoying the original Men In Black, in retrospect, LESS than I did before seeing MIB2. I don't know how to describe it... it's not that the plot of MIB2 breaks continuity with MIB or anything technical like that. It's just, somehow, I didn't feel cheated after seeing MIB, but after seeing MIB2, I feel not only cheated by it, but also by MIB.Lara Flynn Boyle was supposed to be sexy and/or funny, and she was neither. The gags were supposed to be funny, and they weren't. The action wasn't interesting. The gadgets weren't cool. The CG was cheap and fake-looking and bad. It wasn't even that the whole story played like a feature length Mercedes-Benz commercial, it was that people I normally like in movies were just bad. I never hate Will Smith in anything, he usually nails it. Not here. The only person who wasn't awful was Tommy Lee Jones, but that's probably just because the role called for a very flat performance, making a "good" performance somewhat indistinguishable from a bad one.Even if you're curious, take my advice and save your money at the rental shop and/or your bandwidth on the P2P systems, and keep your happy memories of the first movie.I wish I could "un-see" MIB2.(end of primary review, specific details of the movie follow, stop reading here if you don't want to be spoiled)SPOILER-SPACE .......... SPOILER-SPACE .......... SPOILER-SPACE ..........Certain details were handled badly. This movie could have been great as a turn-the-tables style rehash of MIB, only now it's young hotshot MIB Will Smith who must show new recruit Tommy Lee Jones "the ropes"... only his style of indoctrination is comically different from how it was handled in the first movie. Instead, we get "the Re-Neuralizer"... a big white room that undoes whatever magic the De-neuralizer does.Also, and perhaps this was a nod to the comic book, I never read it, but showing us another closing shot of the "worlds within worlds" idea seemed unnecessary, but maybe the comic always ended that way. It seemed less gimmickey in the first movie. It was actually kinda cute. In MIB2 it just came off as tired.The family room scene with a cameo by Sonnenfeld was gratuitous and broke the pathetic excuse for comic pacing that this movie had. Speaking of Cameos, I really didn't need to see Whacko Jacko in this... the idea that Michael Jackson is really an alien is a cute and potentially funny joke, but he was just on screen for waaaay too long, and it just didn't 'hit'. It came off as indulgent and was actually painful to watch.There was exactly one joke in this movie that actually worked, and it was A) a mildly racist cliché and B) in the commercial. The line about how the inflatable driver of the spiffy Mercedes-Benz used to be black, but he always got pulled over. Every other joke either fell flat or made me wince.And I know I'm kinda weird in that, even though her acting is often less-than-stellar, I kinda like Linda Fiorentino. For some reason, I enjoy her in every movie I see her in, even if she's kinda bad. Maybe I just want to bone her, I don't know. Short version, she's not in this movie at all, with maybe one cryptic line of explanation as to why. I thought she was kinda fun as the one person who would actually make a decent sidekick for Will Smith's character, and ultimately winds up as his partner in the end of MIB. There was something about that which 'hit' for me. But alas, no Linda. Instead we get Lara as the Big Bad, who I really, really wanted to like in this, and find her all Deliciously Evil and gigglesome. She was just boring, unsexy and unfunny. In the minor gripe category, this movie killed my disinterested quasi- crush on Lara. It's just gone now. Poof. Not a huge loss, admittedly, but certainly an E Misdemeanor to add to this movie's huge list of crimes against the MIB franchise.The pacing sucked, the comedy wasn't, and the plot bored. To reiterate the non-spoiler portion, save your happy memories of MIB by NOT seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior but fun in spite of itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy sequels in that it is always fun to watch people's reactions to them. What do they expect? They expect a good continuation of the original story. What do they get? They get a mindless monkey-making vehicle with little or no consideration given to the consumer.This was no different. However, it is a decent continuation of the original. Not good, but decent. I did enjoy the story, but the premise was over-used and a bit dog-eared (pun intended for those of you who have seen it). What I do enjoy about this movie is that when you play MIB 1 &amp; 2, back-to-back, it plays like one long movie.The science in this installment is a bit better than in the original, but the comedic element gets a bit tired after a time. As I've said, in my opinion, Will Smith is highly over-rated, and should be replaced, if Barry Sonnenfeld decides to do another one of these.Other critics have declared their disdain for Frank the Pug having too much screen time, but compared to Smith, I think I preferred the little fur ball.When we left the MIB at the end of the first installment, K had resumed his normal, mundane life. But now, because K was the only agent with knowledge of a mysterious alien artifact, J has to recover K, restore his memory, and get him back in black. With the help of Frank the Pug (the scene in the car with "Who Let the Dogs Out" and Frank is the most endearing scene IN the movie), J sets out on his mission, but he has very little time. If the artifact is not returned, Earth could be vaporized.We discover a few things about K's past of which we had no prior clues and it leads to a nice ending elemental twist.While it was not as enjoyable as the first, I was still entertained by this production, in spite of the obvious subtitle, "...2, The Quest for More Money." Yogurt, "Spaceballs." It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, aware of all the bad reviews, with the optimism that it may be enjoyable. Unfortunately it wasn't. There were good visuals, but that was what they put more time into, as opposed to story and characters.The basic plot involves Jay (Smith) bringing back Kay (Jones) to help investigate Serlena (Boyle,) who is out to get the Light of Zartha. Good luck trying to decipher more than this. It's bogged down with clumsy dialogue and an over-emphasis on Frank the Pug. In the original, Jones' straight man played greatly off Smith's flamboyant character. Now it feels like they're squeezing the last drops out of these characters. MIB2's script isn't nearly as clever as the original, aside from one cameo, but this cameo could be declared obvious by some. The major twist at the end doesn't make any sense either.This is the kind of movie made to make money off of a familiar name. Unfortunately they decided that was all they needed for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the MIB cartoon a lot better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was way too over the top. All the mystique that the MIB agency had in the first was lost in this one. I mean, there was a Burger King in their central terminal thing, come on! The only part that seemed to maintain the quirky mystique from the first film was the beat boxing post office workers, that was truly clever. Frank the dog, however, was irritating and unfunny; seeing a dog in a suit singing I Will Survive doesn't make me laugh! Normally, I'm a big fan of special effects, but not in this case. The effects were plentiful and all horribly done. Jonny Knoxville's character looked especially bad with the neck moving in the most unnatural way possible. The subway scene *could* have been good, but that too was ruined by bad special effects. I just gave up once the cars and spaceships started flying everywhere, but I'll bet all the kiddies got a kick out of the PS2 controller Wil Smith used to fly the car.I wish the writers had looked to the MIB cartoon. That cartoon had better plots, better acting, and better effects than MIB 2 did! It didn't try to turn quirky dead-pan into goofy "Fresh Prince" one liners like this film did!</fullReview>

Perhaps, because I liked Men In Black so much, I was so disappointed by the sequel.It was as if they took all the intelligence out of it, took all the mystery out of it, and then tried to replace those elements with Will Smith's ability to be funny. But then they forgot to ask Will Smith what was funny.They ended up with no humour, no mystery, no believability, no .. I could go one. All they had left was Will Smith acting "cool", which I think even he could agree, given the script, was lame. It was a B-movie... unless there is such a thing as a D-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rent the original instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most cases sequels are the work of the devil. It is rare that the second kick at the can compare favourably with the original, although several films have managed to muster up enough inventiveness to keep things interesting. The Bride of Frankenstein and The Godfather II are examples of movies that equal or surpass their namesakes. Sadly MIB II is no Godfather II, heck, it's barely Police Academy II. The first film was one of the funniest, original and entertaining comedies to come down the pike in quite a while, which makes the failure of the second one so much more profound. MIB II seems tired ? almost as tired as Will Smith's lyrics to the movie's theme song ? and vaguely familiar, like we've seen it all before, only better. It's the dumb younger brother who can't seem to measure up to his older, brighter and better looking sibling. Smith and Jones fit their roles like finely tailored suits, but aren't given much to do. Even the jokes feel dated. When Frank the talking dog cranks the radio and sings along to Who Let the Dogs Out I cracked a smile, but wasn't that same gag in a car commercial about two years ago? The special effects are good just not that interesting. Only Smith's elaborate fight scene against a cloned flying bad guy is truly inspired. Keep your thirteen dollars locked away in your wallet, and rent the original Men In Black on DVD instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD is must-see for filmmaking aspirees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say up front that before exploring the DVD goodies, I watched the movie straight up with no preformed prejudice. And yea, it was painful. I might say that the plot/script was done by a fifth-grader, but that would be unfair: no, there are plenty of fifth-graders that could come up with plots that blow this away. Ouch! (Disclaimer: I am a critical filmwatching adult, which probably counts one one-thousandth of the teenage money this film soaked in.)That said, I endured the entire length and proceeded to the DVD treasures. And yea, they pay off handsomely, if you have a bug for the moviemaking process. Extensive attention is given to items such as score, lighting, blue-screen, makeup, sound(foley), puppeteering, and CG interplay. And for me the big payoff was the Sonnenfeld director's commentary, with nonstop narration of every second of the film. You'd think that this would grow old after a while, but at least for me, I found something interesting and educational in everything he discussed, from start of film to finish. (You will have to get past his whiny voice, though it's not as bad as the guy on Alf :))Stuff like this can yield a true appreciation of the awesome breadth and complexity of successfully producing a Hollywood feature film. Though not really demonstrated on this DVD, there is also a hint of the chaos and insanity in making it all work. If you are not a director or producer but intend to ever be one, the DVD goodies have stuff you really ought to know.After taking it all in, I have a greater respect for MIB II, in that they pulled off what they did. It's a shame that such a tremendous amount of work and investment was applied to making the film, while the script/plot was just some garbage thrown together to fit the pre-established motif from the first film. I would hope that lessons were learned in the biz from MIB, about throwing massive resources into a stupid story -- but nay, conventional Hollywood wisdom will prevail: "Thou shalt produceth CRAP for sequels to blockbusters ... and thou shalt becometh rich. And this is Good."P.S. There is a cute animation short on disk 1 called "The Chubb Chubbs" that might be worth investing a couple of minutes in; and if you have a DVD reader on your PC, I'm told that the video game on the DVD is pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't need a strobe light to wipe this from your memory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of "Men In Black II," the light of the Columbia logo's Statue of Liberty flashes a la the MIB's neuralizing device, in an attempt to wipe the audience's memory of the previous movie and thus deliver an excuse for the pale imitation that follows; it's shorter than the first one - even with the extensive end credits (which clock in at 7:05 - yes, I timed them), it comes in at around 84 minutes - and the duration isn't the only way it's lesser.The thrill and freshness are gone in this belated sequel about another threat to the future of the Earth arriving in pursuit of something that's hidden here, and only the Men In Black can stop it/her... but when the villain takes the form of a Victoria's Secret model and it still isn't stirring, there's something wrong. (Admittedly after "Wild Wild West" I can understand Barry Sonnenfeld bypassing actual models like Frederique van der Wal in favour of proper actresses like Lara Flynn Boyle, but it might have benefitted the movie to see Heidi Klum with tentacles or Laetitia Casta in lingerie... actually, almost anything would benefit from the latter. But I digress.) In fact, the movie doesn't get going until Will Smith tracks down Tommy Lee Jones and brings him back into the field; Jones's underplaying is worth any amount of Smith's mugging, but he's one of the few positive aspects.Blame the true villains - Robert Gordon (who co-wrote "Galaxy Quest," which is in his favour) and Barry Fanaro (who used to write for "The Golden Girls," which isn't). The threadbare and illogical script doesn't have much for anyone to work with, and the setpieces just seem to lie there from the opening with a subway worm-creature onwards - the latter not helped by some weak effects-work. And unlike "Addams Family Values," this doesn't add anything of its own to the mix - from the Xerox of the "Smaller-than-it-looks" title sequence to the you-need-a-sense-of-proportion ending that completely lacks the sense of existentialism the first one had, it's the prototype for lazy sequels. Basically, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before, with the exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle walking around with an enormous stomach and Tommy Lee Jones in postman's shorts.Frank the pug, the worms, Tony Shalhoub and a wasted Rosario Dawson are great, however, and you should definitely sit through the end credits (not for Will Smith's obligatory rap - "The best looking crimefighter since myself in Part 1"? You wish - but for Danny Elfman's swinging music). But apart from that, stick with the original movie or the far superior animated TV series.</fullReview>

Whereas the first movie combined clever sight gags and special effects with solid writing and dialogue, this movie completely dropped the ball in terms of the latter. The movie had a "slapped together" feel, with the impression that the actors were simply doing the work for the paycheck. After watching the movie I had that duped feeling that one gets when taken advantage of. Fortunately, I only paid three bucks for the rental rather than 20 for myself and a date at the theatre.

		<fullReview>Where did they find that font? I want it. In white, sprawling generously over shots of stuff happening in outer space, it's more than attractive; it's positively intriguing. I'll go so far as to say that the opening credits sequence could well be the handsomest of any released in the year 2002.It ought to be. It's clearly where all the effort went. The film itself has us glancing at our watches and saying, "Yeah, whatever," almost before the first line of dialogue is spoken.Tommy Lee Jones's character has been pulled out of retirement on some phoney pretext, and he too looks bored (certainly he goes well beyond deadpan). He virtually yawns as he delivers the final "revalation". It's as though he's simply making it up with the camera rolling, not caring much what he says, but knowing that whatever he says, everyone else will be forced to play along, and then it will be over, and we can all go home.I must admit I've never fully understood the appeal of the first film, but it's clear that Barry Sonnenfeld understands it even less. It has something to do, you can hear him thinking to himself, with Tommy Lee Jones looking deadpan, Will Smith wearing sunglasses, and aliens. Very well then: three times as much of each for the sequel. Cram them gimmicks in. Never mind that whatever appealed to us about Jones and Smith's characters has been lost ? EVERYTHING about their characters has, in fact, been lost ? and that the aliens, underneath their brash, zany schtick, are all crushing bores.Rosario Dawson is as lovely as she was in the vastly superior "Josie and the Pussycats". She's easily the best thing to happen to the film. She tries to make us feel that it's more than a big goof-off, and while the attempt comes across as just one more cynical ploy, SHE does not. I'm in love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching MIIB, I had the feeling that the film makers thought that the orginal movie was so successful because of the special effects. So, when making a sequel, they should just put in more special effects; And they did. If you thought the "weird aliens" were funny in the first, there are more here. If you thought a talking dog was funny in the first, lots more of him here. If you liked the car that is part spaceship, lots more of it here. If you thought the alien getting his head shot off and it growing back was fun, it happens about 5 more times here. Of course while putting in all the extra fun stuff, a few minor things like the the characters and the plot had to be squeezed out.The first movie developed a little background Smith's and Jones' characters, and let you sense a bond between them. No time for that here. They were mostly just typical buddy cop characters. Setting out to save the world, always a 1/2 step ahead of the villains. There are a couple of clever jokes, a chuckle here and there, but there was too few for the humor to save the movie, and there was too little development of the characters or the plot for me to be concerned about resolution of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4.5 out of 10Director Barry Sonnenfeld's sequel to the popular Men in Black is a total retread, without a whit of originality. Will Smith once again stars as Agent Jay and this time he's got to bring back Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) from retirement to help him find the Light of Zartha or the Earth will be destroyed. That's as far as it goes in terms of plot and as you can tell, it's not that different from its predecessor. The movie fails to explore its fun premise by extending new ideas, it's basically all formula, designed to ensure the masses will churn in their hard-earned cash. Consequently, boredom eventually sets in when you realize the movie almost never offers any surprises or fun ideas.The movie isn't, however, a total bust. The opening, involving a giant alien worm, is an enjoyably wild sequence. Will Smith's performance is energetic and likeable and he does manage to squeeze off a few good laughs here and there. There are also a couple of genuinely fascinating concepts the movie introduces, such as the miniature globe that's actually another planet altogether and an alien race living in a train station locker that worships the keyholder as their god. And yes, the final scene is very cool, and makes a good set-up for another sequel. Let's just hope they follow through on it the next time.</fullReview>

However, if you know what you bought tickets for, and if you get in the right mood, you can really enjoy it.MIB 2 repeats many of the original gags in the original MIB. It does it with enthusiasm, and adds sufficient new effects to make the whole film enjoyable. Tomy Lee Jones and Will Smith have fun, and this is so obvious that it makes us join eventually. The comic arrows are still on the science fiction and cheap press, and the film is almost completely lacking vulgarity - which makes it palatable for children (or better their puritanic parents).And yes, there is a fresh new character - a Princess! - leaving an un-finished romantic line by the end.

Frank the Pug is one of the stars of the movie, every time he opens his yap you just know it's going to be funny Will Smith is as always hilarious, and Tommy Lee Jones' dry wit is as fabulous as in the original. The story is a little far fetched, but it grabs you and pulls you in, so you really don't mind.

		<fullReview>One of the biggest films of 2002 is of course, Men In Black II - the super-cool sequel to the 1997 sci-fi original starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. With a mysterious alien creature on Earth trying to find 'The Light' which could destroy Earth as we know it, Agent K (Smith) must find Agent J (Jones) and get his memory back, for he might be the only one who knows where The Light is hidden. One of the good things about MIIB is Rosario Dawson - a key witness to an alien attack - fresh from such flops as Josie &amp; The Pussycats and Down To You, this is bound to kick-start her career. OK, it's not the most sophisticated of storylines and you won't come out of the movie feeling any smarter for having seen it, but at least, while you're in the movie theatre, it's an exhilirating rollercoaster ride filled with blinding special FX and a humourous cast with plenty of jokes. I wouldn't say it was either better or worse than the first one, but both are solid sci-fi action comedies to enjoy on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see MIB II really wanting to like it. I thoroughly enjoyed the first MIB and hoped that the sequel would be just as entertaining, but alas it was not to be. It seems that "they" took everything that "we" liked about the first MIB and just repeated it again and again and again in MIB II, but they forgot that no one laughs at the same joke twice (let alone three or four times). In the first MIB we laughed when the alien shook Agent J around as she gave birth. We laughed when J was tossed about in the speeding car. And we laughed when Agent K shot the alien's head off and it grew right back. But in MIB II we yawned at these same antics replayed. MIB II hasn't turned me off on sequels (I REALLY enjoyed Toy Story 2!), but I can certainly understand why a lot of people groan when they hear the word sequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I saw this film today. And I thought once again the old stereotype, sequels are usually worse, came into to play once more. It was not as good as the original, not nearly (except maybe the SFX, but that was to be expected).Firstly, the things that really annoyed me. Johnny Knoxville's character was the typical idiot side-kick to the villain, whose main purpose was for ten year old kids who stay up late, to stand up and shout: "Look it's him from Jackass."The villain herself was disappointing, and not as, for lack of a better word, "interesting" as "Edgar". I think her abilities i.e. the snakes or whatever they were. Were just an excuse to show some SFX.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, had lost all of their comic chemistry that was there in the first film.It was too short. Maybe to keep children entertained and not bored.However there were some good points. Will Smith did keep me amused, and not Tommy Lee Jones also. But not at the same time, as mentioned earlier. The story gave K a little more depth and background.Overall, I didn't really like it. But no-one can give an opinion until they have seen it. So go see it and hopefully you will think the same as me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened to Barry Sonnenfeld? He made three great and funny films: Addams Family, Addams Family Values and Men in Black and then what? Did he have a nervous breakdown? Lose his funny friend who was the true inspiration? Who knows? Wild, Wild West is crap, Big Trouble wasn't much better and Men In Black II just plain stinks.And I'm not sure what's happened to Will Smith either...is it just that we've seen his schtick in an action movie (Independence Day) and in a comedy (Men in Black) and it's just not interesting any more? Maybe if he'd do something in a different genre, he might be funny again. Will go find a musical or mystery -- please don't do anymore comedies. You are no longer funny.In any case, Men in Black II is the longest hour &amp; a half I've spent in a theater in a long time and I want my time back. Bad plot, characters who were developed in the first film fall completely flat in the sequel, and no one's funny. Oh yeah, and there's a lame, unfunny cameo from Michael Jackson -- who cares?If you've seen the trailers, you've seen the best parts: the post office with the human/alien beatbox dialogue; Frank singing in the car, and J's quip about the white "auto pilot" driver.

		<fullReview>First: I loved the first one. And the commercials on TV looked rather promising so I decided to watch MIB2 right on "launch-day". Midly said - I was really disappointed! The jokes were lame, they wanted to make the movie funny but that just didn't work out, no match for the first part. Second bad thing - the worst FX I've seen in a movie for a long time. It looked even worse then part 1 and that is five years old - some generations when it comes to computer graphics! But what disappointed me the most in the end was the final fight. It was sooo short and boring and again with very poor FX that I went out of the cinema with the worst feeling I ever had for a movie that I went to the theaters for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsSorry folks,but it's been a disappointing Summer at the box office this year.The trouble this time round has been the sheer lazyness on display in terms of creativity.Proof of this exists in the endless amount of sequels we've been bombarded with.Men in Black stands out ,in retrospect,as the most obvious example of desperation in terms of the Hollywood screen-writing 'hacks' coming up with something to keep the crowds entertained,coming five years after the way,way superior original was released.When the story has basically been recycled from the original (this time with Will Smith mentoring Tommy Lee Jones's character,unlike in the original where Jones mentored Smith,zzzzzzzzzzzzz) it shows even more.Unlike in the original,the chemistry and general banter between Smith and Jones is non-existent,and the plot is really hard to get into,and even harder to care about.And maybe someone thought having a Michael Jackson cameo in it would draw a bigger crowd.But hey,for all this,who knows,maybe Men in Black 3 will be better.Or 4,or 5,or zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where it may have been a better idea just to not make a sequel. I would say it's worth watching, but it's really not very exciting or interesting, and not as much fun as the first one. However, the one thing that is more fun is the pug, Frank, who's a much bigger star in this one than the first. Aside from him, the characters are predictable and the story pretty weak.I'll probably buy it, but it won't make my top 100 list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: Now I have seen some absolute tripe come out over the past 3 years from Hollywood, this one takes the cake. For some unknown reason other than money they decided to make this abomination of a film, whoops maybe it was for the cash?The first movie has some funny parts, one being the whole concept of a secret service that control's alien activity on earth. Now if they were for some reason thinking that this would be a point or a launching pad for gags they were clearly delusional A talking dog? We saw him in the first, and have seen talking animals to the point of if you heard one in the street you wouldn't think twice and move on. Granted the dog 'Frank' was funny for about 1 minute, but the next 87 minutes of the film would have been better off without it.Onto Will Smith, the main man, just one of whom should carry the blame for this film. Just when people thought he was getting serious as an actor, and getting some respect (not to mention an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor) he pulls out his blandest performance ever. Having to read out some of the worst jokes I have ever heard should have been torture, but he seemed to be enjoying his role. Maybe he should stay in teenage comedy land for a bit longer.People over at ILM must have been punching themselves having to view footage from this all day long while working on mediocre effects. There was much talk about this giant worm creature, quite frankly it looked like crap, literately.And how many establishing shots did we need for MIB headquarters? I had counted 6 times after realising that they had used the same identical shot twice already. Obviously the black Mercedes Benz was an awesome vehicle, but how much were they paying Sony for product placement, half a million, 1 million per placement, it felt like I was watching a commercial.To take in this Goliath of a mistake you have to step back and look at its Box Office dominance over the past couple of weeks, astounding. How is it possible that word of mouth didn't kick it in the but I don't know. It is quite beyond comprehension.Final comments: This is the worst film I have seen over the past 2 years! I'm quite astonished that Spielberg kept his name in the credits. Do not believe the good reviews of this film, it is not worth your money. The 88 minutes I was in there it felt like I'd just watched Lord of the Rings back to back. That's it. Tommy Lee Jones I have nothing to say other than give up comedy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first movie was a summer smash and a real Blockbuster with a truly original idea, and concept. The first had so much to offer, the two totally opposite end of the spectrum actors like Smith, and Jones. In the second one the magic doesn't seem to be there anymore. At this point I think a remake of the first one with more of the same jokes and ideas would have been better than this monstrosity. The story is easy to follow, to easy almost. All these people are falling in love but you don't care because you are never really introduced to them. There is a lot of inside humor from the first one that would make this especially unenjoyable to anybody that watches it not having seen the first. Overall, a 5/10, because it had its moments, but ultimately lacked in what should have been a STELLAR sequel. That's the worst part all the hype and excitement for such a disappointment.</fullReview>

Some of the scenes seemed forced onto Jones', who really only stuck it out because he was making $20 million instead of the $7 million he made the 1st time around. And Smith is just annoying as ever.

		<fullReview>This was the best of the two that have been done so far. The main aliend is played by that good looking lady from Law and Order. She is mean and has tentacles that kill people. They even tease that man from the Jackass show. He is a bad guy also and tags along with the Law and ORder girl. They are looking for some light that was hid on the Earth a long time ago. So, Wil Smith goes to get the memories back from Tommy Lee Jones so he can help find the light. Once they get some clues the deal with a lot of aliens that have some short screen time that is not really interesting other than to simply look at. There is no sex in this an no violence either. No blood and nothing that is shocking or scary. The best part of this movie is the manner in which Tommy Lee Jones and the Wil Smith play off eachother. The part I hated was that black girl who was the token obviously. The highlight is the PUG. This talking PUG was the best part of this movie!! Way up!

		<fullReview>1997- Director Barry Sonnenfeld and stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones teams up for the first time in the surprise hit "Men In Black" ("MIB") grossing over $250 million.Now, it's 2002, after Will Smith's duds- like 1999's "Wild Wild West" (becoming the worst film of 1999 by the Razzie Awards), 2000's golf drama "The Legend Of Bagger Vance," directed by Robert Redford and co-starring Matt Damon and Charlize Theron, and 2001's "Ali," the true story of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, directed by Michael Mann ("Manhunter," "The Insider," "Heat," "The Last Of The Mohicans," etc.) and director Barry Sonnenfeld's "Wild Wild West" and this past spring's "Big Trouble" (pulled back from Sept. after the N.Y. attack, in which the plot involved two criminals carrying a bomb in a airplane), Sonnenfeld, Smith, and Jones team up again for "Men In Black II."The movie is about Agent J (Smith), who, after K, keeps getting partners and neuralizes them. Now, a female alien named Serlena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and a 2-headed alien named Scrad/Charlie ("MTV Jackass's" Johnny Knoxville) are in Earth to find the light of Zorlon and destroy Earth. Agent Zed (Rip Torn) hires J to find Agent K (Jones) and de-neuralyze him. In order to fight the alien, they're gonna need some help. The worms (Mannix, Neeble, Gleeble, and Sleeble), Frank the pug, Jeebs (Tony Shaloub), and Laura (Rosario Dawson), who saw her pizza boss get murdered by Serlena.So, what did I think about the movie? Well, it was very good. More enjoyable than the first one. Smith and Jones sure know how to have a good time. If you enjoyed the first "MIB," then check out "MIIB," or "MIB 2."A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an undeserved record-breaking weekend, I'm probably posting this too late to save anyone who was looking forward to "Men in Black II" their money. A two-headed alien henchman in the film (not very convincingly computer generated) is played by Johnny Knoxville. If you're not familiar with Mr. Knoxville, he has an MTV show called "Jackass", on which he performs such idiot stunts as putting on a scuba suit and sealing himself into a portable toilet, which is then overturned. That casting choice and the fact that there is a giant toilet scene in the film cannot be mere coincidence. It also should neatly illustrate what's wrong with the movie. Apparently unable for the most part (though there are a few brief entertaining moments) to come up with a script as smart and entertaining as the first, they settled for an alien with testicles on his chin, giving the talking dog a bigger part, and toilet jokes. Don't bother with this cosmic loser.</fullReview>

Try renting movies like Captain America and the Punisher if you want to see really bad Marvel Character adapted to movies. Added bonus is whether you can get your hands on a copy of the Corman Fantasic Four movie. I thought MIB2 was alright. Like some people have stated it looks like they were trying a little too hard to make it funny rather than letting the humor flow out of the script. It's like trying to spoon feed too much sugar into someone's mouth all at once at times. While it was entertaining it still is a knotch below the original. Some of the funny parts started out humorous but then they started to beat you over the head with its repetitiveness until you just wanted to cry Mercy. All in all I think it wasn't a bad sequel. It just really wasn't a great one either.</fullReview>

Just scanning some of the comments, i saw that the bashing came from people in colorado, canada, alaska, etc. Must have something to do with that, because here in new york you'll find few complaints. Seeing it opening weekend, the theater was packed, and i can honestly say everyone was cracking up the whole time and i did not see one disappointed face coming out of the movie. Even the plot was really good, and nowadays it's hard to find a movie where u can say that. And of course the acting was superb. I mean, with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, how can you go wrong. Lara Flynn Boyle was great also, and makes a pretty hot and evil villian. A few things that added to the extreme humor: Frank! MJ (if u saw it, u know who i'm referring too.

		<fullReview>"Men in Black II" is a worthy sequel to the 1997 smash hit of the same name. The plot is pretty simple other than it involves Agent J (Will Smith) trying to locate a neuralized Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) because he may know the location of an extraterrestrial device that a hostile femme alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her idiot partner(s) Scard/Charlie (Johnny Knoxville), a two-headed alien are looking for. "Men in Black II" is not nearly as clever or original as the first film, as that is this movie's only shortcoming. The jokes are also a little thin but not too thin. The acting is pretty good too. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make one of the best comic teams in movie history.A good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return in a mindless sequel that fares no better or no worse than the original. ?Men in Black 2' is a repackaging of all the elements the first had and makes no attempt at a creative excursion. Sure, we discover we have some new aliens on earth (Oprah Winfrey) and we see some new gadgets, but nothing seems inventive in this Summer Sequel that will definitely attract the masses and disappoint the discerning viewers. Set in present day New York, the Men in Black are comfortably monitoring the extra terrestrial activity on earth when a new threat must be dealt with. Will Smith reprises his role as Agent J, the resilient and courageous Agent who was recruited in the first film by Tommy Lee Jones's character Agent K. In this installment, after being voided of his memories of the MIB, Agent K must be recruited by his old partner as only he knows the secret at stopping this new hybrid of evil ? a voluptuous Lara Flynn Boyle. Boyle attempts at personifying evil but many will not be able to get past her black bra and full red lips as she portrays Serleena, a ravenous extra terrestrial hell bent on destroying the Men in Black. As one may expect, the plot is wafer ? thin. The first indicative of a mediocre film is the running time. Director Barry Sonnenfeld seemed content to deliver a mediocre and thinly paced film that was barely 90 minutes long. Sonnenfeld took the exact same style and production values from the first and does not impress at all in this installment. This can be seen from the opening credits as the mosaic like credits seen in the first open the film along with the film's score. Even Danny Elfman's musical stylings do not seem at their norm as he tries his best to compliment the weak pace of the film. At just about 90 minutes, this would call for a fast paced film. Those who have seen the first film will easily become accustomed to this film's exact mirroring of the plot development. Scripted by Robert Gordon, the writer of this installment seems to have taken a page from the first film's writer Ed Solomon. The first film had Jones' character recruiting Smith's character; as aforementioned, the second has the exact opposite occurring. Set in a surreal and awkward New York, the film wastes no time introducing us to the weird and at times comedic aliens that inhabit the earth. From talking dogs to talking worms, to 200 foot aliens that reside in New York's subway tracks, Sonnenfeld wants to capture that same inventiveness and fails as we are treated to a film developed through the art of recycling.  The film impressively does not rely on special effects to dictate the story. Sonnenfled just uses them at the end to kill off a decent time at the movies with an overkill of stupidity. The film attempts at working on underdeveloped and uncaring characters as they are supposed to be the focal point of the film. Yet, they seem to be the laughing stock of the film as these are just about the most one-dimensional characters you will ever see. Smith and Jones seem to have a great rapport and are the film's only fun factor. Yet, romance sparks in the unlikeliest of places as love at first sight is experienced in this film foreshadowing a ridiculous and altruistic climax. The film's formula is simple: explain the threat, recruit Agent K, have fun with attempting to retrieve the memories Agent K had in order to save humanity, and roll the credits. In a nutshell, that is it. How fun can a movie like this be? Not that fun. The meat of the movie is in the middle section and surprisingly does not rely on aliens, it is between the interplay Smith and Jones have as they engage in some character clashing. Smith takes control of the film's opening as he showcases his character's bitterness towards loneliness in the employment. As a result, he falls for the girl in the crime scene (Rosario Dawson) who turns out to be much more important than she seems to be. Facing a threat; under strict orders from the returning Agent Z (Rip Torn); he is assigned to recruit Agent K and retrieve his memories. Sonnenfeld's direction is lackluster and makes it seem as if he knows how to direct a film ?like the back of his hand'. This is stated due to the blatant lack of originality viewed resulting in this writer to think Sonnenfeld is better than any other Director. There is no effort seen on screen ? not a good thing. Still, the movie turns out to be not as bad as it could have been. Despite the flawed script, flawed characters and flawed directing, the film does retain a sense of fantasy that serves its' purpose. Smith's acting is average as he must act alongside a smile- less Jones as he tries his best not to crack a smile for his tough guy persona to play out for the story. In this review, references were constantly being made to the first film because if you have seen the first film, you have seen it all. A promising first 60 minutes fizzles out into an overblown, fabricated and corny climax that will leave audience members screaming for mercy. Without saying too much, romance has no part in science fiction/fantasy film, furthermore, using it as am apparatus to make the ?wussies' in the audience sulk is insulting. The worst part of the film is that it makes no attempt at trying to outdo itself. It is clear that Sonnenfeld and company decided to play it safe with this installment and did not even attempt to deliver the world an interesting piece of entertainment. Instead, we are treated to a film that is no better of no worse than the original. Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men in Black II is clearly the worst movie I've seen this summer. The film's funniest scenes are all shown in the trailer and the rest of the funny scenes come from a talking dog. Althought Lara Flynn Boyle is hot she makes a horrible villain. The chemistry between Will and Tommy is lacking and the theme song to this film well in a word shit. Barry Sonnfiled is in need of a hit after Wild Wild West and Big Terouble both bombed. I don't reccomned this film at all. Horrible acting, dialouge, no atcin and slow pacing. The only thing good about the film is the MJ cameo and the sexy Rosario Dawson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure Barry Sonnenfield was thinking, "Why not make a sequel (to Men in Black)? It made over 200 million bucks and there's no reason to not make more money, right?" He's right. There is no point in not making a sequel to a great movie. Just better make sure that you don't make a horrible sequel to a great movie (like Grease's pathetic sequel). Trust me, he didn't. Oh, he definitely didn't. Here's my review:The movie is excellent. Perfect. It's no Coming to America or Training Day but it is definitely awesome. The movie is basically what you see in the trailer. Agent J (Will Smith) is doing his work as a top secret agent and making sure no one learns about aliens. K, on the other hand, is a postal worker. Yep, a postal worker. There just happens to be an evil alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) who needs something before the world will be seriously screwed. One problem. K knows where that is. It is J's job to locate K, deneuralize him, and rid the world of the scum of the universe... again. They reprise the role of Z, played by Rip Torn. They also have a few new characters, T and Rita. It is a great movie. Sure, the trailer gave away some good jokes but they have enough more to please us all.The acting...what do you think. An Academy Award winner, an Academy award nominee, two VERY sexy ladies, and talking worms. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are excellent as always. They brought a little more to there characters and worked there jokes perfectly. Lara Flynn Boyle is one of the sexy ladies and was awesome as the villain. I can't choose if she or Vincent D'Onforio was better. The other sexy lady is Rosario Dawson who was very good here. Patrick Warburton was there for a little while and his character was good. The worms. I liked them as much as I like hemorrhoids. Enough said. I don't loath of them as much of Jar Jar Binks but I still didn't like their presence. The found a few chuckles out of me but not enough. The dog was pretty good here. I think his name was Frank.Overall the movie is definitely awesome and VERY recommended. Another summer blockbuster. Rating VERY BIG 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1978, the people of Zartha wanted to hide their MacGuffin, The Light, on Earth, but it went against MIB protocol. Serleena wanted it, and it was sent out, and she has been seeking it ever since(all of this backstory? Delivered in a clumsy exposition dump. Show, don't tell, movie). Well, that's what she says, the opening credits(by the way, not counting the ones at the conclusion of this, this is 77 minutes long... no, really. How many Hollywood mainstream flicks do you know that don't break an hour and a half? And it's incredibly padded; I can tell why it's so short, it was clearly cut to pieces in editing) have her blowing up one planet(though once she lands, her ship is suddenly tiny(laugh, darn you! I mean, we even brought back the theme of the size of something not equaling its significance! By which we mean we've kept it out of fear that was what you liked, and you wouldn't spend money on this one if we removed it, even if its inclusion has no bearing on anything!), so those must have been as well... that, or they were making this up as they went along, and actually, I do believe the latter) after the other(ooh, how else can we make the audience stay if there aren't explosions immediately?!?)... anyway, she copies the appearance of Lara Flynn Boyle in lingerie(which is what she looks like for the rest of this... who needs anything interesting in their villain when she can just be a hot chick, right? And we get downblouse shots and early, she walks away from the camera, her butt the focus... classy), and we instantly get a bulimia joke, which serves multiple purposes; to serve as a great metaphor for the regurgitated nature of every gag and joke in this, and to set the bar low, to let us know that they are all going to be that dumb(and trust me, there's maybe a single funny one in this entire thing... no, really). I'm not kidding, they bring back *everything*(and "beef it up", as if it wasn't pitch perfect in the '97 one(by the way, how good a sign is it that a sequel took *five years* to come out?), and as if a huge part of the attraction wasn't that we hadn't seen it before... the first one opens a door into a fantastic universe, letting us breathe but promising to go further in follow-ups, this one reluctantly blocks that path, like a kid worried about his parents seeing his bad report card), including the basic story structure(!). If the one who did/said it in the first is gone, they just have someone else do it. Example? Before it was "cab drivers are not from Earth", now it's "postal workers". The worm guys return, and like Frank the Pug(who is made a freaking *agent* in this one! Think about that for a second, how is that inconspicuous? How would he handle a gun, cover tracks, chase down a bad guy... OK, well, you're still one for three; in general, in this, they don't give a crap about hiding their operations, and somehow, hardly anything gets noticed by anyone), never shut up, are obnoxious, and are only there for the "humor", expanded greatly beyond the one bit they had(that they should have stayed as... they were not strokes of genius, they were goofy little ideas that worked for the minute or two of screen time). Jeebs returns, looking weirder than before. How? He was told to leave Earth in 1. And they take away the perfect ending to the character of K! That alone makes this a wretched production. Thankfully, right after that revelation, Lee Jones punches the one explaining it in the face, saving the audience the trouble. He's "deneuralized", whatever that even *means*. So now you can bring *back* memories? I guess they wanted the same dynamic between the partners, which is a foolish idea. J has years of experience now. Actually, they try to swap it some, as Tommy is now briefly a rookie. And then they go back, and have him be more cool-headed than still young and brash Will Smith. That actually works a little. Doesn't offer this any tension or any measure of creativity to alien designs(seriously, they're basically all humanoids(what a waste of Rick Baker)... this reeks of studio interference, they're terrified of taking any chances whatsoever, and their product ends up impossibly uninspired... like the "do you even remember her name" love interest played by Rosario Dawson, she has to be appealing to everyone so she has no personality, then there's nothing to put people off... I'd love for her to meet Sin City's Gail, see how they get along...) or the big, shiny guns. The climax has a suddenly introduced "ticking clock" that doesn't make sense(much like the ending sequence). Knoxville doesn't do anything that I imagine people connect to him and Jackass, and he's as terrible an actor as you fear. Fiorentino is dismissed with a single line, and on the whole, this is lazily put together. There is a little sexually suggestive content and mild language in this. I recommend it to kids without taste who enjoyed the original and want something similar, whether or not it's any good. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intergalactic disaster is about to occur as Kylothian monster Lara Flynn Boyle comes to Earth and immediately takes the Men in Black headquarters under siege. She is after a so-called light that could be used to destroy the planet and possibly allow her to over-take the rest of the universe. The only one who can stop her is former agent Tommy Lee Jones, who has been re-recruited by Will Smith to save the day once again. The first "Men in Black" was really not a very good movie, but it thrived on its lunacy and became one of the more charming successes of the past few years. "Men in Black II" still has some of that magic left, but just not enough to really make a lasting impression. The teaming of Jones and Smith is still brilliant casting, but the direction and screenplay ultimately end up failing the famed performers this time around. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, I did not pay to see this film. I was coerced. Needless to say, I expected nothing out of my moviegoing experience. I was still let down. I could attempt to summarize this film, but frankly it was so poorly put together that I can't remember anything but tentacles sprouting from an otherwise very attractive Laura Flynn Boyle. I didn't care much for the first installment of this corporate sellout franchise, but I never hold a grudge (I've sat through both Lethal Weapon 4 and Beverly Hills Cop 3 with an open mind).The special effects, which were stupid and not believable in the first one, have gotten even worse. How is it possible to be thrown 100 feet in the air and land without any broken limbs, let alone without a scratch? I guess they're going for the 'ol make the dumb audience chuckle routine, but not many fish were biting in the theater I attended. Sure, the guy in front of me seemed to enjoy some of the dumb one-liners thrown out like peanuts - however I did not break a smile once. I was insulted at how dumb the studio writers must think we all are.I felt angry, cheated, and generally miserable by the time the movie was half-way over. I thought the first MIB was bad, but not as catastrophic as Independence Day. This installment was made even worse due to its incessant product placement. I stopped counting at around a dozen blatant product ads. I usually can at least find solace in looking forward for a film to end, but with MIB II the anger wouldn't subside. I waited for something, anything, to peak my interest or draw me into the story but nada, zip. 0.5/10</fullReview>

Where is the suspense, the humor, the quotable lines, everything that made "MIB" a pleasure to watch? The sequels screenplay could have been written on a stamp. In the 88 minutes of this film I had time to regret every single cent I spent on it. I can understand Agent L, who left the MIBs to work again in her mortuary. It is an improvement.</fullReview>

It's never truly developed and the ending makes little to no sense at ALL. Why did the light have to get off earth? Can someone explain this to me?The plot's faults could have easily been outshone by outstanding comedy, but again: NOTHING! The movie tries to get by on Will Smith spouting slang and stupid cliches ("I'm gonna lay the smack down on your candy ass") while Frank (the dog) makes horrible attempts at canine related humor and Tommy Lee Jones tries his damndest not to fall asleep. All the funny sequences are in the TV ads. If you've seen the commercials you've seen the movie. Yes Laura Flynn Boyle and Rosario Dawson are beautiful, but who really cares in a movie this BAD!Please don't waste your money on this movie.

The MIB have to prevent an alien from stealing an artifact from Earth, well, that's ok, good for them, but wait, if they don't get it off of Earth it will explode. Hmmm, that makes a lot of sence. Oh, and Kay, he get's de-nuralized, but, go figure, he can't remember where the artifact is, he remembers nuralizing himself to keep it's location secret, but he doesn't remember where it is, but he remembers EVERYTHING else... That also makes a lot of sence... And the characters are boring! Way to much Frank, he has no official ties with MIB, yet he is like Jay's partner. Lara, wow, she has vines, good for her, ahhh, I'm really scared now! Worst villan ever. Jonhy, this really upset me cause I think this guy is pretty cool, but his part sucked. All he does is tries to be funny, but makes us want to vomit in a violent rage. Word of advice, stick to Jackass. There were so many failed jokes and attempts for laughs that I wanted to cry. There was maybe 3 good jokes, most of them came from Agent T. Jay turned into a wussy, and Kay has like some attitude problem. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. It ruins all the work of the first one, and the ending... Don't get me started on that! Well, I'm tired of ranting, I think I'll go watch the original and pretend the sequel never happened...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men In Black was a movie that I liked, although I am not a HUGE fan. It was a movie that was not really open for new ideas, and did not necessarily deserve a sequel. That being said, no movie deserves this sequel. It is a rehash of all of the worst elements from the first film. The writers apparently believed that the last five minutes were the best part of the first film, and they wrote a movie based on those five minutes. There is none of the wit of the first film present in this movie. Do yourself a favor and skip the movie because all of the best parts (if you can call them that) are in the trailer. This film was obviously made to make money, and I'm sure that it will succeed. It does not succeed, however, in entertaining the audience, but rather in ruining the memory of the first film. I'd like to suggest M$B as an alternate title to this film.</fullReview>

A lot of critics don't like this film, because the originality is gone. I was too busy laughing my butt off that I didn't notice there was no originality. Any movie in which Tommy Lee Jones is funny has got to be good. Will Smith is a great actor and his song "Nod Ya Head" is really good, too. Lara Flynn Boyle was decent. I never saw The Practice, but I actually remember her as Stacy in Wayne's World. The guy who played the two-headed alien was pretty funny and even Rip Torn had his funny moments. Tony Shalhoub was funny again and Rosario Dawson was okay, but she was too hot to notice her acting skills. The worms and the dog were hilarious. If the critics loved Spider-Man and not Men In Black, then I don't have to worry about movie reviews from them this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to be entertained. I don't like to waste money. With tickets costing upwards of 9.00, the average movie date costs as much as an average dinner. The difference between dinner and this movie is that I can send dinner back.The point of a sequel is to move forward in some type of timeline, introducing some (I repeat, some)new characters. This movie was a dog, in the sense of a dog chasing its own tail. With the predictable plots, lines that could have been phoned in, wooden acting, and rehashed themes, it looks like Sydney (Random Hearts) Pollack and Robert (Dr. T. and the Women) were consultants on this film. When Academy Award-nominated actor gets upstaged by a dog, it's time to pack it in and go straight to video.If MIB III is made, someone needs to see if Barry is really a Ballchinian in disguise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!! I can scarcely describe how terribly poor and disappointing is Men in Black II. The actors should be extremely ashamed for having toured every talk show to promote such waste of otherwise impressive talent. The film seemed to be have been written to entertain four year olds as it contained ridiculous slapstick and endless loopholes that were extremely irritating and made the audience not only wish for a refund but to be generously monetarily compensated for being witness to worst film since Scooby Doo.As irritating as the lack of humor were the scenes that made little if no sense. Among others were: 1. The video from the low budget science show. How did they get the story? And why didn't Agent K. get the original file that the video was based on to read, instead of relying on a low budget reproduction. 2. The size of the space ship. The ship that the evil medusa alien used was quite large in the video rendition and in Agent K's memory, yet when it crash landed, it was four inches high. 3. The deneuralizer/Blue Flush. These scenes made completely no sense. The aliens were allowed access to top secret information, the terminal was on the same circuit breaker as the deneuralizer, the reason for the blue flush was not explained, why it flushed them past everybody and ended up on the streets New York-so much for top security. And why the device could bring back memory from Agent J's neuralizer but not Agent K's.4. Get a gun and Shoot. Why could the bad red-haired alien have so much hate for Agent J, insomuch that he was willing to build or procure two ships for free just have the chance to kill him, and then just fly around with his little clone ships to smack J in the face when he could have taken care of him with one bullet.? Also-with so many powerful guns around, why didn't Agents J and K use the big one to begin with instead of letting the medusa get away so often? Anyhow, the entire film was crap and the more I think about how pitifully unrealistic it was and unfunny and unentertaining, the angrier I get. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could sum up this movie in one word it would be, Terrible. This movie gave me a headache it was so bad. First off it seemed like it was one big advertisement, they changed the MiB head quarters into an airport full of burger kings and Sprint stations. And the playstation controller as the steering wheel to the car... that just made me sick. Now I loved the first movie, and knew that this wouldn't live up to the name and would probably be bad. But I at least thought it would be entertaining... nope. And the fight scenes looked like they were made just so they could make a video game, and no that's not a good thing. Wasn't even fun to make fun of with my friends. Now they very well could make a third movie, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if they started talks about it since this movie will make a lot of money. If they do, then I hope they decide in the third one to take out all advertisements, add character development, make a decent story, and don't jump into things right then waiting halfway through the movie until anything changes. If you feel like giving yourself a headache, or feel like getting angry at something, then go see this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst sequel ever made without a doubt. They had five years to think up a story and clearly thought one up in 5 hours. This film is a disaster from start to finish. All the humour is lost, all the chemistry between Smith and Jones in now non existant. The plot is basically a recycled version of the first film, only worse. It has the insidious Johnny Knoxville who seems to dissapear without any reason half way through the film (which is good because he is terrible, but makes no sense). Lara Flynn Boyle single-handedly kills her career with one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Will Smith's love interest has mysteriously vanished from the first film (because Linda Fiorentino probably could tell this film would suck and bailed out -good for her) leaving the audience with the most worthless female character in sci-fi history: Rosario Dawson who is the least interesting film character in the history of films. If you've seen the trailer for Men in Black 2 then you've seen the film, because they put ALL the good parts in the trailer. Tony Shalhoub as the storekeeper with the re-growing head is back and is unfunny. The stupid talking dog from the first film also returns and is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks (especially in a scene where he sings along to 'Who Let the Dogs Out' -any film which uses this God-awful song should be destroyed). There is honestly NOTHING good about this film. It is just mind-numbingly stupid. Tommy Lee Jones looks bored in his scenes and clearly was just in it for the money. Will Smith puts in a little effort but can't do anything with the awful script where he gets zero good lines and has to act to a cgi dog which is embarassing to watch. Avoid this film because it sucks. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think "Men in Black III" will ever be made...and after seeing "Men in Black II" I can't say that I'm sad about that.The first "Men in Black" already wasn't exactly a masterpiece but at least it had some fun moments and was original.I think that the originality is the main problem with this movie. Once you have seen "Men in Black" this movie can only be disappointing since it adds nothing as a movie.But a just as big problem is the story. It really is one of the weakest stories of 2002. The movie is very simply and quite frankly it doesn't always make sense especially the horrible ending which I hate with a passion.However just like the first movie this one is also fun and has some good moments but unlike "Men in Black" it also has some very bad and unfunny moments. Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are really the two highlights of the movie. The both are wonderful together once again. Also Michael Jackson shows up in a fun cameo and Tony Shalhoub reprises his role as Jeebs but it once again is Frank the Pug that steals the show.Just as in the first movie the special effects and most of the make-up are just plain horrible. They look so fake, I don't know was it intentional? Either way I just can't like it.Lara Flynn Boyle is terrible as the main villain, for once I can fully agree with Razzie Awards for giving her a nomination. Johnny Knoxville is a waste of talent, he actually has lot's of potential as a comedy actor but his talent is truly wasted in this movie and his character is even irritating at points. About Rosario Dawson I also can't say much positive...Her character was irritating me and there was no chemistry between her and Will Smith.Believe me, there are some good moments in this movie and I laughed more than once it's just that there are so many things wrong with this movie and the movie leaves an overall pointless impression.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For such a belated (and now unwanted) sequel to feel so much like a quick-rehash to cash in on the original's success is weird. This movie had 5 years (and some false-starts) to refine and for the filmmakers to really make it something special for the fans and to pay tribute to the brilliant Men in Black. It never happened.Instead we have a plot (that doesn't even make sense) so wafer thin it's almost invisible and repeats of old scenes. Always, always, always a bad, bad, bad mistake for a sequel. NEVER homage or try to be smart by repeating scenes. John Carpenter did this with Escape from LA and that was lost on almost all audiences. Just like what has happened with MIB II. I did expect this to be a huge hit. But it's gone largely unnoticed because it's asking for money for old rope.David Cross (who played the morgue attendant in the original) has the only funny scene and I swear any other laughs will be no more than exaggerated smiles. You'll want to enjoy, but won't. Lara Flynn Boyle is not the uber-[female] her character should have been. And Rosario Dawson has NOTHING to do in her role at all. I don't want to say that she is a bad actress because the part offered her so little to do. Not even so little. It was nothing. Never before in my life have I seen such a pointless character. All she did was stand around with her eyes open in amazement. That's it. Had her character been called Laura MacGuffin instead of Laura Vasquez it would have been a tiny bit acceptable. What IS the deal with that silly 'light' nonsense?Plus the chemistry between Smith and Jones is gone. It's simply not there and there is no spark. Jones originally didn't even want to do this film (Linda Fiorentino was supposed to return) and he seems like someone totally different. First time round he was wise and crafty. Here he is just a gear in the machine. There's no magic. No comic timing.MIB II should have been one of those surprising sequels that blows the original out of the water. Like Gremlins 2 for example. Spielberg was producer on that movie too. It came 6 years after the first. MIB II had 5. And it seems like they just hastily threw it together in a couple of weeks. It is so puzzling. And what is even weirder is that the Men In Black Limited Edition DVD has a trailer for MIB II. And that DVD was released in Fall 2000! (ages before this film's eventual release, where they aiming for a summer 2001 release?) And the trailer for MIB II on this DVD is anamorphically enhanced at 2.35:1. But the actual film itself is 1.85:1. I found this to be one of the most strangest things of all. It's practically false advertising. Oh well, I don't want to give the film 1/5. I really don't. Not when MIB deserves a sequel so much better. And by giving it 1/5 I am, in a way, insulting the original. But I must. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just for the record, I loved the first Men in Black movie, it was funny, original and just enormously enjoyable. This sequel is not as good, but it is perfectly decent considering how awful some sequels have been. The stunts, special effects are gadgetry are just impeccable, as are the sets and cinematography, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones still make for a charismatic and entertaining duo. I also liked Rip Torn and Rosario Dawson. The pacing is also fine, not as fast paced but efficient enough, and the music was catchy. However, the script does have too many weak spots(some of Smith's jokes are somewhat amusing though) and while the plot starts off great it meanders. The direction wasn't as brisk or as innovative either, and the ending was a little too silly for me. Overall, decent sequel but not great. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this movie didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIB2 suffered from several problems that Ghostbusters II suffered from.The first is, that by the second go-around, you have already accepted the premise. There are ghosts, and these lovable losers catch them. There are aliens amongst us, and these guys police them. Once you've accepted the premise, it just isn't as funny. It just doesn't seem as fantastical, and therefore, not as farcical.Another problem, both movie franchises had an animated cartoon in between movies. (The Ghostbusters cartoon was actually quite successful and ran for a season after the second movie, even though the second movie and cartoon had irreconcilable time lines.) In GBII, that meant that the ghost "Slimer" became a more featured character because he was such a popular character in the cartoon series (even though his presence made little or no sense in the context of the second movie.) They were appealing to the kiddie audience.The second MIB movie had the same problem. The Worms, Frank the Pug and Junkman Jeebs were all minor characters in the first film, but were popular in the cartoon series. So all got major roles in the sequel. Probably Wil Smith contributed to this, since he tried to make the sequel more "kid friendly" than the first. That meant the comedy wasn't nearly as biting.Still, you have to like this film. Wil Smith is charming and Tommy Lee Jones is bitingly ironic. Rosario Dawson is sexy. You want to like this film, it's just hard with the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why It's Very "2" Indeed ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1 ? Too short ! The first was one of the 98 minutes' movies that really looked like more than this with its rich details, too many successive jokes, and good flashy sudden sequences. But on the other hand this one is only 88 minutes time, and the 88 minutes type also ! 2 ? The surprise effect. When the first one came out it was such a new genius formula for Sci-Fi Action Adventure Buddy-cup Comedy, not to mention its smart ironic paranoia. So this time, along with the inferiority of that very formula's factors, you'd feel how it wasn't that completely new either.3 ? The fact that (Tommy Lee Jones) didn't act a bit in here ! Actually he represented the ideal image for an-actor -in-Hollywood-who-had-been-forced-to-do-the-same-over-and-over-again kind of matters !, and in a historically rebellious sort of attitude he expressed his own objections against that by doing nothing at all in front of the camera ! Like he tells them "Do you want a sequel?..Well.. Here you are right in your faces !". Maybe this movie will be mentioned in the books of movies' history, where some actor patented the invention of being so frigidly dull as a perfect slap on the face of Hollywood's hackneying.4 ? Although there was too many bizarre characters, but all in all the CGI wasn't as good as the original (it was so badly obvious at the big worm's sequence for instance) like the budget was that low.5 ? The interesting paranoia is missing in this sequel.So that's why this movie will be always and forever number 2 as the ordinary numbering, and when it comes to make comparison with its original in quality as well. Though, it's nice fun if you want silly comics for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

As soon as I saw that stupid dog, I just knew it was going to talk. It was inevitable. I had no idea it would be such a major character. Dumb. This film is not nearly as entertaining as the first one...typical sequel fare. The good guys are largely the same but the aliens are different this time, and the stakes are higher. However, the film's writing is poor and inclusion of a talking dog is totally stupid. There's a decent bit of action in this, as you'd expect from a Will Smith film. Tommy Lee Jones is back as K (once his memory has been restored) and Rip Torn's back as Zed. And all of them are decent enough in the acting department. It's the script, basic story and screenplay that leave this one wanting. Sorry, but this film's a stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back in Black? I Don't Think So...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men In Black II, the follow up to the hit film Men In Black, features Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the agents K and J respectively. This time around, J finds trouble in the universe as a hostile alien hunts for a mysterious object on Earth, and the only man who can help him doesn't remember a thing ? that man (of course) is K. So after J restores K's memory with a `de-neuralizer', together they hunt down the alien scum. Men In Black II (advertised as MIIB) isn't half as fun or entertaining as the original 1997 film, and falls short on the jokes almost all the time. One must wonder why the writer(s) couldn't have come up with a better excuse for bringing back K other than the cheap gimmick of, `Hey, let's just have a DE-neuralizer to bring his memory back!' I hate when sequels use subjects like that just to bring back a character. `Hey, he's not dead, he was just run over by a tank!' Come on, writers, a little bit more credibility, please?  The jokes in MIIB, as I mentioned, almost all fall flat. There were a few giggles from children during the film, but when I was sitting there, I could tell that almost no one liked what they were seeing, including the children. Have you ever been to a film that is so bad, that people try to laugh at the `jokes' because they are so embarrassed they paid to see `this stupid film'? That's MIIB for you.  The actors in the film seemed to be holding back a little as well, and J's love interest was a really untalented actress. I think she was trying to act like Halle Berry (even the haircut) but I personally wouldn't even want Halle Berry, seeing that I think she isn't a good actress. I don't agree with other reviewers when they say MIIB is repetitive, recycling the jokes from the original film. I think that even if they had repeated all the same jokes, the audience still would have liked it better than the way it turned out.  Barry Sonnenfeld may be losing his charm as a director. I have not seen Big Trouble yet, but I heard that it is not funny, so maybe that is a clue. And the aliens in this film look like they came from a Jim Henson's R Us store. There is a crazy fight sequence in the middle of the film, and J fights all the creatures?I think that was the closest I came to laughing ? the time when the director DIDN'T want us to laugh. But, during that sequence, there was a segment where we see an up close and personal view of an alien's genitals, hanging from his chin, and where of course, J punches him, causing much pain (for the alien, and the audience). There are the cheap jokes like these that ruin this film, another being where Rip Torn (reprising his role) jumps up in the air, and we see a shot of him (obviously hanging from cables) kicking at the enemy, but the thing is, he stays in the air for about ten seconds, swinging his legs, like a crossbreed between Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, and a Looney Tune character. Not a single person laughed at this scene. All this closes with a witless and unimaginative climax, including a repeat from the ending of MIB, involving a locker, but I won't spoil it anymore for you (though it doesn't matter-it was stupid). A tip to writers: next time, come up with something that has some important key elements, called humor, originality and wit: something the first MIB had.  2/5 stars- John Ulmer</fullReview>

It's as visually stimulating as "MIB1," and rather cleverly written and surprising! One highlight is the opening, in which a TV show sets the prologue with intentionally bad special effects. Another is Frank the Pug's extended screen time. And be prepared for Michael Jackson's cameo! I enjoyed Johnny Knoxville as space villainess Serleena's henchman Charlie and Scrad.

The only version that I have seen of the Men In Black franchise is ONLY the cartoon version which was fairly passable. But as for the sequel to Men In Black is this quote.................I didn't like MIB:2Even more surprising,its not even a close call with me. It was passable due to the highly populated star status of its biggest stars...actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. It feels overly mechanical,tired,and only half-imagined in which everyone is going through the motions on this one.This one has hardly any zip to it at all even though it only ran for under 90 minutes the whole thing seems like a quick rip-off of the original. Believe me,the minute I paid for my ticket,went to the concession stand to get some snacks and sat down in my seat for the feature presentation,it was over by the time I got ready to see it.

		<fullReview>The original MEN IN BLACK was classic. There is no doubt about it. But, here we are a few years later, and director Barry Sonnenfeld has decided to create a sequel which is loaded with special effects and humor that goes flat on just about every joke. Tommy Lee Jones offers us little amounts of humor this time around and he almost seems like he was suffering from depression. Will Smith, however delivers a terrible one-liner just about every thirty seconds. Patrick Warburton is in the film for about five minutes, and Johnny Knoxville's character disappears about half-way through the film. And we are even told that his character survives. But for some odd reason, Sonnenfeld made him vanish. Lara Flynn Boyle is pretty hott as the alien disguising herself as an underwear model and the special effects were done pretty well also. In fact, they might have been worrying about the FX so much, that they forgot about developing the story. This could be part of the reason why we have a sequel that is way too low on the humorous moments. The action sequences are pretty good and they are mainly what saved the film. So, from me, MEN IN BLACK II gets 3/5.NOTE: Another bad element that this film provides is a completely unfunny talking pug.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is to the people that have been giving this movie bad reviews is to lighten up! This movie was made for the fun of it. It shows onscreen &amp; even in the audience. The sequel will never live up to the original 'Men In Black' &amp; unfortunately will always be judged by it as well. What makes this movie work is several things; a great cast, directing &amp; creature FX by make-up master (if not the greatest in the world) Rick Baker. He even has a small role in the film! The plot is simple; when an alien (Lara Flynn Boyle) returns to Earth in search of a powerful weapon, the only person who can help the Men In Black is retired Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones). When his memory is brought back &amp; is brought to speed on the situation, he &amp; Agent Jay (Will Smith) get help from characters from the 1st film to help them out. The worm guys return to this movie &amp; are very funny. This film works on many levels, mostly because it wants to. You can tell everyone gives 200% to make this movie &amp; their hard work shows. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just what it's cracked up to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie -- sure it was silly and improbable and had a lot of gratuitous violence. But it's SUPPOSED to. It has no pretentions, and is just as it's advertised -- a roaring good time. It's hilariously funny, Will Smith has perfect comic timing, and the aliens are cool. And great music. Besides, it's worth it just to see Michael Jackson playing an alien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody earns money, and this movie is wasting our time! AT the end of the movie, you wish that a MIB could flash you to forget what you've just seen...Clichés after Clichés at the half of the movie, you're still wondering what you're about to get...At 80% of the movie, it's like watching a Cheap TV adaptation of the movie... Awful!The Attitude of Tommy Lee Reflects the feeling of the watcher ' what the hell am i doin here ? '...They wasted the talent of the actors by a lack of real story...Elvira would say the problem of this movie is : '1hour and half too long'.No need to precise that i hated this movie, and i'm not heartless enough to recommend it to my worst enemy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As the Tagline says, Same Planet New Scum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the movie at a screening, and I have to say this was horrible. The movie had a few funny parts, but the entire idea seemed to be pulled together in a few hours. The comedy besides, a few parts, was based on the first one which isn't a very good thing. The acting, is just like the rest of Will Smith's movies... Horrible. Except Tommy Lee Jones, he would happen to be the only good part of the movie. Also, the movie isn't even very long for it to be good. This is one movie, you'll be ashamed to talk about at the water cooler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was AWFUL! For one thing, with the film being so SHORT, the head and end credits amount to 10 percent of the film. Now, what is that? If that was a joke, then it was the best one in the film. This movie is almost as bad as Mac and Me, so you know we're talking bad here. Whatever you do, avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another cash cow sequel! An incredibly poor script with very low standards of acting. Although not my genre, i kind of liked the first Men in Black. But this is incredibly stupid. Thanks God (really thanks to IMDB for providing ratings and comments) i didnt go to watch this at the cinema. Got it on DVD and i still feel i was seriously ripped off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 Reasons Why I Like This Sequel Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to a popular first film was a pleasant surprise to me. In fact, I think I like this better than the original, much better. Why? Well.....1 - It is extremely entertaining and just an hour-and-half long; 2 - It has a much softer edge to it with more humor than the original; 3 - the special effects with the variety of little aliens are excellent; 4 - it's easier on the profanity than the first film, making this more kid-friendly; 5 - at 90 minutes the length of the movie is just right.Yes, the story can be stupid at times, but so was the first one, and the good qualities listed above far outweigh that negative. Tommy Lee Jones is fun to watch again and Will Smith isn't as arrogant as he was in the first movie.This is a no-brainer played strictly for laughs and it succeeds beautifully in that regard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When alien Serleena returns to earth looking for `the light' that alluded her over 20 years ago, she takes control of MIB headquarters in order to flush out those who know where the light would be hidden. Agent J heads out to recover Agent K, now living a normal live with no awareness of his past. K is the only person who knows where the light is and he and J follow clues he left years ago as he had removed the memory to protect himself.When I watched the first film I thought to myself that it was a film that looked like it was designed to spawn a sequel rather than be a film in it's own right. A few years later and I was right. This sequel basically tries to repeat the chemistry of the first film and to a certain degree succeeds. The plot is basically a rerun of the first film except with everything bigger. Most of it works because it is short, punchy, funny and energetic ? the jokes are mostly new and not straight lifts from the first film. The characters have changed a little and it manages to pull off the same blockbuster humour that it had before.The effects are good but really it is the humour that drives it. While much of it is amusing rather than hilarious, there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep it going. Smith is slumming it here ? he gives a sort of typical `urban attitude' play to things and says `your ass' a lot. Want to see what money will do to someone? Watch him in 6 degrees of separation and then watch this! Jones is the core of the film as he was before and is a great straightman. Smith carries 15 minutes and then wisely they bring back Jones. Boyle is so-so, she doesn't have much to do to be fair. Knoxville is alright I guess. Dawson is good but I'm biased as I've liked her since Kids and He Got Game. Torn and Shalhoub make good returns.Overall this is not rocket science ? it is the original formula done again with bells on. It won't win many awards for content but it is an entertaining, undemanding blockbuster that does what it says on the tin. Quite fun as long as you don't expect the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame duck sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agent J (Will Smith) now partnered with Agent T (Patrick Warburton, Puddy from "Seinfeld"), after wiping out the memories of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). When that partnership doesn't work out as planned, and with Agent J on a mission that he needs all the help he needs, he goes out to make agent K remember and partner up once again to foil the plans of an alien spore in the guess of a centerfold model. This film was an obvious attempt to cash in on a franchise. And it obviously worked since it made oodles of cash. But as a true movie, it's a lost cause as it's just more of the same of the first movie. Minus the originality, and even the minuscule amount of charm that the first one had. Instead really too much on sight gags and lame humor, sacrificing the story, as flimsy as it might be. Only worthy of a rental, simply for the "Chubbchubbs" short that is available on the same DVD.My Grade: D 2 disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director Barry Sonnenfeld with optional "Telestrator Diagrams"-feature; access to the "behind the scenes" during the film; "The ChubbChubbs!" short; Teaser &amp; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "Spider-Man", "Ghostbusters", "The Mask of Zorro"; Game trailers for "Alien Escape" &amp; "MIIB Crossfire" Disk 2) "Special Delivery MIIB Orb"; Blooper Reel; Serleena Animatic Sequence; 5 Multi Angle Scene Deconstructions; Alternate Ending; 7 Creature Featurettes; poster gallery; Will Smith music video; and Cast &amp; crew filmographies and biographies DVD-Rom: "MIIB Crossfire" -game demo; Weblinks; "Behind the scenes"-featurettes &amp; concept designs; and Screenplay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SEQUEL LESS THAN EQUAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MEN IN BLACK II (2002) ** Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, Patrick Warburton, Tim Blaney (voice) (Cameo: Michael Jackson) Lackluster sequel to the sci-fi comedy actioner with Agent Jay (Smith at his cockiest to date) re-enlisting a de-neurolized Agent Kay (Jones appearing to sleepwalk his way through this endeavor) to help the secret government agency save the world (again) from a threatening alien force (inhabiting the Victoria's Secret model visage of Boyle, an apt femme fatale) hellbent on destroying it. Rick Baker's make-up upstages the flimsy recycled plotline basically airlifted from its precursor. Show stealers, Frank the talking pug (Blaney) and the alien quartet - The Wormguys - provide the only suitable laughs in this sad misfire to a lucrative franchise.

		<shortDescription>Men in Black II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have said a couple of times that there are some films that do not need sequels, or at least could be made better, and this is one of them. Basically another alien being has landed on on Earth, Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), and plans to take over the planet. Agent J/Jay (Will Smith) is obviously assigned, but the one who knows the most about Serleena wants has had his memory wiped, Agent K/Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), or rather Kevin Brown. So J obviously takes him back to the Men in Black (MIB) to get him back in order to defeat Serleena. In ways, it's pretty much K becoming a member of MIB instead of J, like in the first film. Also starring Rip Torn as Zed, Jackass's Johnny Knoxville as Scrad/Charlie, Rosario Dawson as Laura Vasquez, Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs, The Emperor's New Groove's Patrick Warburton as Agent Tee, Scary Movie's David Cross (returning from the first film) as Newton, and an appearance by Michael Jackson. There are plenty of special effects to satisfy, but the story could have done a lot better than this. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!!I saw MIB 2 a couple of hours ago and it wasn`t untill I typed this review that I suddenly realised I can hardly remember a thing about it ! Now let`s see I remember special effects ..... well CGI which is so common nowadays I`m not sure if it`s classed as a special effect anymore. Oh and the usually impressive Tommy Lee Jones is in it , but he doesn`t actually appear until the mid way point of the film and this leads to a subplot with Agent K teaching Agent J what M.I.B operations involve . Oh yes those cute worm guys are in it just like in the first film , oh and so`s that guy who can grow a new head .Ah I`m starting to remember what`s wrong with this sequel - it`s very very similar to the original . In fact it covers very little new ground which is okay if you loved the first MEN IN BLACK film but I didn`t , I found it typical Hollywood Summer blockbuster FX laden fare . And I found the sequel worse in this respect</fullReview>
