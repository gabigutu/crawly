		<shortDescription>an overlooked gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for "Airplane", "The Kentucky Fried Movie", and the "Naked Gun" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the "Hotel Gay Schluffen", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If "Top Secret!" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means "She whose bosoms defy gravity"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, "Top Secret!" IS one of the great comedies of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top Secret is one of the funniest, most off-the-wall movies ever filmed. Featuring a young Val Kilmer, I think Top Secret is the best of all spoof films (Spaceballs is a close second). This thing spoofs everything, Beach Boy's songs, spy pictures, war movies, westerns, and even Elvis is not safe. It's ridiculous, outrageous, hilarious, and all in the name of good fun. The spit gag has to be my favorite bit. You've seen it in countless movies: the hero is being verbally accosted by the villain and he spits in his face. This time, however, the hero is on the other side of the room. Other memorable jokes include the skeet songs, the anal intruder, the "cow" scenes, and the backwards bit with Peter Cushing. There are countless little things like that which make Top Secret a definite cult classic and a certifiable must-see."Wish they all could be double barrel, wish they all could be double barrel guuuuuuuns."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American rock and roll idol goes behind the iron curtain (while there was one!) for a culture fest but instead becomes involved in the resistance movement.Forget about the film itself, the very idea of an Elvis Presley movie being mixed with a French resistance film and produced by the Airplane! crew is enough for laugh number one. Not only is this a bizarre world but seems to be playing games with time and history, the communist East Germany being portrayed as a kind of war time Nazi set-up!Kilmer does well with an impossible role to the point where you wonder if he didn't miss his vocation. He can sing and dance better than many real singers and he proved in The Doors that he is really a major musical force. Strangely it is rumoured that he didn't realise this was a satire!The stupidity of many Elvis movies and those Saturday morning children's reels (scientist and beautiful daughter) are taken to the cleaners and you have fantastic sight gags. The "falling guard" gag is one of the best sight gags in the history of movies - I challenge anyone not to laugh at it.I enjoy a stupid movie every now and then and admit I enjoyed this one. Clearly the authors know little about German history or European culture and the little they do know seems cribbed from watching bad B movies on the subject, but what the hell. This is too stupid for anyone to get seriously uptight about. "How silly can you get?" sings Kilmer at one point in the film: Maybe a little, but not that much!</fullReview>

For me one of the funniest part is the "german language cassette" Rivers' is listening to in the train (!) to Germany. This words make absolutely no sense! :) The whole train sequence is funny. The train station and the guy with the tree also rock!Val Kilmer did a great performance, acting, dancing and singing!The title sequence "skeet surfing" is also a great parody for the American way of life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie truly is another great work from David Zucker and Jim Abrahams team. In some scenes you will laugh so hard that you have to pause the movie, laugh for five minutes then play it again. Also, Val Kilmer does a great acting for his first movie!This movie may not be the best comedy ever made but it still is among the top of its genre and a great movie to watch even and specially if you're not in a good mood.If you found "Airplane!" funny then watching this one is highly recommended. It has the same stupid and totally funny jokes and same sense of humor. It also is the best parody of WW2 spy movies. Rent or buy the DVD and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best spoofs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>are usually the ones with plots of their own. This one is such a spoof and it is very funny. You don't have to see any movies to find this funny either. You just have to have seen parts of an Elvis movie over the years or saw a scene or two from an old espionage flick. You don't have to watch an entire movie to get the jokes. Val Kilmer is very funny here as is all the cast. The jokes are great even with some of them being a bit dated. The resistance group is great, the escape, everything in here is really funny. After "Airplane" this one ranks right up there with the best spoof movies made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman meets Alfred!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his first leading role, Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an Elvis like pop star sent to Germany on a good will tour as a fill in for Leonard Bernstein. Once there he gets caught up in all sorts of misadventures that lead to him being a part of the French under ground resistance. Lucy Gutteridge is his German lover.An often overlooked - maybe even misunderstood - film from the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker team (who gave us "Airplane!") the film takes pot shots at "The Man Who Knew Too Much", pintos, rock 'n roll, Nazis, and other various spy movies with more gags than you can shake a stick at. A hilarious romp of madness.Val himself is pretty funny here, managing to both wink and not wink at the camera as he is placed in a number of absurd situations. Also interesting of note is that this one features Michael Gough, who would later play Alfred in the Batman series, and Val himself would later play Batman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, master of the rapid-fire humor and insane spoofs, strike again! This time with "Top Secret!", which is a very underrated movie that, in my humble opinion, is just as good as "Airplane!" (which of course is considered their best work). I don't understand it - what makes this film inferior to "Airplane!"? There are just as many jokes, the jokes are just as good, the timing is as always perfect. Am I missing something? Is it just that "Airplane!" was bold in breaking barriers for spoof movies, setting a precedent that "Top Secret!" was just there to follow?That's not to diminish the quality of "Airplane!", which is one of my favorites. But what's wrong with "Top Secret!"? Why only a 6.6 rating? It must be from those purists who don't understand movies like this, and don't like this movie because the plot is not as well-developed as the plot of "Airplane!" Don't get me wrong - ordinarily a more developed plot only makes a movie funnier, but in the case of a spoof like this, the plot isn't important (it has often been said that the plot is just a "clothesline" for the jokes in such movies). Those purists completely miss the point of this movie.Watch this movie unless you're one of those blasted aforementioned purists. If that is the case, go watch "The Philadelphia Story" for the thousandth time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious From A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the popular success of "Airplane!" and its less acclaimed sequel, the ZAZ trio was back to what I believe to be the funniest comedy ever: "Top Secret!" a hilarious parody of the WWII spy films and the 50-60's rock-themed movies. Speaking of rock'n'roll, one of the most defining songs of the film performed by Val Kilmer aka Nick Rivers is titled "How Silly Can you Get?" which sounds like a self-reflexive motto."Top Secret!" probably features the highest laughs-out-loud-per-minute ratio from any movie, as there is not one single moment where the action isn't punctuated by a gag, and that this very gag doesn't work. Everything in "Top Secret!" is both hilarious on an anarchic and cathartic level in the way it plunges you into a never-ending positive mindset. You may say that this is the very principle of a comedy, what's more a spoof movie, but it seems like "Top Secret!" has been specially concocted for pure and genuine amusement, and while the much more respected "Airplane!" has its slower moments, especially during the flash-back parts, "Top Secret!" was hilarious from A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker brothers.There are two kinds of gags in "Top Secret!", the direct and the indirect one. The direct is immediate, mostly visual and slapstick, like a "find him and kill him" stamp or a sunbathing girl leaving boob-holes in the sand. The best gags are extended and feature a lot of dancing like the ball scene, the outrageous ballet sequence or a feet-view panic scene. Anyway, whether it's an offensive national anthem, a singing horse, a little German, an over-hilarious moment when Nick is about to be executed and an old lady slowly approaches to pick up the phone, any attempt to list the audio-visual gags of the film is as ludicrous as trying to define which is the funniest. The indirect gag is the elaborated one, already funny by itself but leading to a much more delightful punch-line.The first one involves a weird shot illustrating the road taken by Nick Rivers and his manager, the map looks more and more familiar until Pac-Man makes his appearance, the very gag that sets the tone of the film. When Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric meets a colleague disguised as a party tricks vendor, the whole interaction is funny enough but the icing on the cake comes with the "You dropped your phony dog pooh", an item which obviously is not sold. The gag works even more because we expect it, like when Nick is introduced to the French Resistance, what would you expect from a man named "Déj? Vu" apart from "Have we not met before?" It could have concluded here yet the French sounding names punch-line was with the black guy named 'Chocolate Mousse", which says a lot about an era where anything was acceptable in the name of pure comedy.I don't mean to be too analytical, but my regard for "Top Secret!" is due to one of the two funniest and creative gags from any film, starting with the Swedish bookstore sequence, a cinematic achievement that would have made Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proud. During that part, there is a gradual suspicion that we're not watching a normal scene, even for a spoof movie, there is something weird in the walking and the talking that gets funnier as it is more noticeable, the scene becomes hilarious when we get the point and yet it goes on and on, a book getting in the right place immediately, dust from ear to mouth, and finally Nick and Hillary 'sliding up' a pole. The sequence goes from funny to not funny anymore until it becomes funny again with the throw away gag of the puppy going backwards leaving the Swedish bookstore owner in a priceless doubted expression.The other and maybe more memorable one, as it made it in the poster involves a clever cow disguise that looks like a real cow from our point of view, it's simple but someone should have thought about that. Now, it became a comedic landmark used in many comedies when a guy disguise as an animal, inopportunely choosing the female one, and invites a male on heat to come on him, but back then it was new that even pushed the outrageousness by involving a little veal thirsty for milk, the villain's reaction (in the disguise) is a laugh-riot. That's the secret of "Top Secret!", a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously except for its genuine desire to make us laugh. The rest of the gags are as good as it gets, and features many fourth-wall breaking, like when Nick and Hillary feels that the romance "makes it's like a bad movie" and then they look at us, and many film references are made, notably one hilarious climax in a sub-aquatic Western bar, and a clever farewell a la "Wizard of Oz"."Top Secret!" is made in such a way, that we either enjoy a gag or wait for one to come, so there's no time break. The only little pauses are provided by these moments when we can enjoy Val Kilmer's musical performances but the humor is never away. But my enjoyment of the film is proportional to my sadness to see it so often overlooked by the peers and movie viewers, playing on anagrams, I want to say that "TOP SECRET!" is a comedy "TO RESPECT!". Indeed, when I checked the list of AFI's Top 100 Laughs, I was surprised not to see "Top Secret!" listed while "Fargo" and "Jerry Maguire" and less 'lol'ling comedies were, I'm even surprised that the film is hardly mentioned among the greatest parodies or that it didn't have any nominations for the Golden Globes.Seriously, I can't see, regarding "Top Secret!", how funnier can a movie get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZAZ Blitzkrieg-humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between their most successful films ? Airplane, Naked Gun and Hot Shots ? the ZAZ team modestly spoofed the espionage and conspiracy theory thrillers in Top Secret! The film involves American teen idol Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer in his first big screen role) attending a culture festival in Nazified East Germany. The festival merely is a cover-up for the sinister and evil practices of the Nazis who kidnapped an eminent scientist. Nick quickly interferes in all this and ends up as member of a resistance-party, existing of French dudes with funny-sounding names and weird comical habits (like drinking gasoline?) . Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks, 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The European-minded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French, German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surf-generation. As usual in this type of films, the widely elaborated jokes miss their target (sometimes they even are painfully unfunny) but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape', 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate, but it perfectly reflects the type of over-the-top humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teen-popstar credibility. Furthermore, there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff, Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work, but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In East Germany, the American rock and roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) in a fancy restaurant. Hillary is a member from the resistance and her hope is to rescue her father, the scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough), who is imprisoned by the Germans to develop a powerful weapon. Nick is arrested and sent to prison for helping Hillary and he meets Dr. Flammond in his laboratory. Hillary helps him to escape during a show and when he tells that he has met Dr. Flammond in the prison to Hillary, they decide to seek out the resistance leader. When they meet him, they discover that Nigel (Christopher Villiers) was Hillary's first lover. Further, they learn that there is a traitor in the resistance. Who might be the traitor?"Top Secret" is a very funny comedy by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker. The plot is a parody to World Was II movies with the French resistance and it is impossible not laughing along the adventures of Nick Rivers in the East Germany. Val Kilmer steals the movie wit ha magnificent performance and singing most of the songs. In the end, time is cruel to everyone. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Top Secret ? Super Confidencial" ("Top Secret ? Super Confidential")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOP SECRET?Directors?Jim Abrahams?David and Jerry Zucker? Cast Inc?Val Kilmer?Peter Cushing? I was booked for a couple of days to play a straight faced German and a very good actor (Warren Clarke) was to be my boss. The directors of this film had already shown their comedy worth with all the Airplane films in the USA.. So it was gag after gag in this film too. I don't know if this was Val Kilmer's first leading role but he certainly went to the top in his later films..The scene I'm in goes something like this. Warren is checking Val's papers on a train and this is set during WW2. After the dialogue scenes between them Warren and I get off the train and wait for the train to pull out.. We stand on the platform. The train doesn't pull out, the directors think it's funnier if the platform pulls out instead. (British Rail should make note of this as it saves on crowded trains.) Warren and I did work together again over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing that "Top Secret!" comes from the guys who gave us "Airplane!" and the "Naked Gun" movies, I shouldn't have to really explain it. The plot has rock 'n' roll star Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) getting sent to East Germany to rescue a scientist (Michael Gough). Of course in reality, the movie's an excuse for a gag every minute. Making fun of both the American and Soviet spheres of influence, this flick pulls no punches. I suspect that you'll really like the scene where Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) and Nick explain their names to each other, and then where they introduce the resistance fighters. All in all, a wonderfully goofy romp. As a side note, Val Kilmer and Michael Gough later co-starred in "Batman Forever", although Jim Carrey stole the show in that one.</fullReview>

Kilmer is at his second best, after The Doors, with an Elvis Presley and Spy-Movie spoof. This range of subject matter may account for the relatively low box office. But when I hear the over-used title TOP SECRET this is the only thing that springs to mind. There is a great BLUE LAGOON parody, which may be out of date, but with Survivor as the latest fad it may pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A parody of espionage films from the '40s, it's Val Kilmer's first movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots of laughs in this film from the Zuckers who know how to create visual gags that are even funnier if you know what film is being spoofed. The main plot (if there is one) seems to be based on a certain Hedy Lamarr film called THE CONSPIRATORS with she and Paul Henried trying to escape the Nazis during WWII's Lisbon.Homage to a lot of other Hollywood films are scattered throughout. Fast-moving and fun loose, it's one of those films where you're waiting to see what the next gag will be.Everyone plays their roles with a straight poker face, particularly VAL KILMER in the lead as Nick Rivers, a rip-off of Elvis Presley. He doesn't show any particular flair for comedy except when he goes into his Elvis act. Then the wooden expression vanishes and he's limber enough to give the impression that he can sing and dance with the best of them.JEREMY KEMP does his best to look sinister as a Nazi officer and LUCY GUTTERIDGE is the pretty wide-eyed miss who gets Kilmer involved in a messy espionage situation. All of it is played for laughs and there are plenty of those, but I suspect this will appeal more to anyone who has experienced all the movies being parodied--even, for one fleeting moment, "The Wizard of Oz." Summing up: Some uneven moments but generally an enjoyable romp. Kilmer went on to better, more serious roles for the rest of his career.</fullReview>

At first this movie appeared having a lot of not funny jokes (which were probably funny for that time audience, but would appear banal for a nowadays audience). I was thinking of switching a channel, but then this movie finally became funny. There was so many stupid jokes, there was just no seriousness in this film, so just when I get used to it, it was really funny. I think that they used 500 jokes in this movie, or maybe more. They were parodying that time movies and using a good old slapstick jokes. So it's a really worth watching 80's comedy.</fullReview>

Some of the scenes are laugh out funny, and I'm talking laughing each time you see it, over and over. The cow scene is hilarious. Chocolate Mousse, the big phone, the fireplace...this is a must see for any comedy fan. Especially with all the lame Zucker-ish type movies now a days that aren't funny at all (simply taking a sentence literally is not funny) and that includes that last Naked Gun film, which was just a rehash of jokes from the series.

		<fullReview>If you try and ignore this "Spy" offering from the Airplane team, you won't last long. When it's on your TV screen there'll soon be something so outrageously daft that you have to at least stare in dismay and amazement.Yes, it's a pity it hasn't got Leslie Nielsen at the helm but the young Elvis-sort of looking Val Kilmer is good, but not brilliant. It's just not in the class of the best Abrahams and Zucker's, especially the fore- mentioned Airplane, hence my four stars.Sent off to cold-war East Germany and playing rock'n'roll to an audience not yet immersed in such, at a concert that aims to unite west and east Berlin, Nick Rivers (Kilmer) encounters an array of mishaps, from the outset. Naturally, the opposite sort of happens and I'd like to say that plot details are fairly useless here and they're pointless in a script where gag after gag is out for laughs, most of them hitting some spot, or another. There's Omar Sharif as you've never seen, or ever thought you'd see him and a turn from Peter Cushing, too.Venturing into a parody of WWII films, including The Great Escape, it ends up with a herd of cows wearing wellington boots...What happens between is fast and funny and whilst Top Secret isn't the funniest thing you'll see, it's good and worthy of including in the 'ones to see'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly, the writers of Top Secret! didn't know what decade they were spoofing. From 1950's dances and music to M*A*S*H and Mary Tyler Moore TV references to Satellites (?),Top Secret! simply got lazy at times. After awhile, you'll simply get used to them as none of this is really supposed to be taken seriously.So, get past that, I did, and you'll have a freaking blast as the good enormously outweighs the flaws. Sure, some (make that few) of the jokes are corny, predictable and don't work (Val's head in the toilet would've been funnier animated ? wait, it was, on Scooby-Doo?weekly) but most will have you rolling ? A new version of Frogger, Der Pinto, The Tunnel of Irony, Tic Tac Glass, just to name a very few.American sensation, Nick (Kilmer) travels to Germany just as the rebellion builds up against the Nazis around World War II. He continually saves the damsel in many dresses while singing a few tunes and dances away unscathed. His mission, he didn't really choose, is to rescue the dame's imprisoned father and Batman's butler and escape East Germany.Really, the plot doesn't matter and as slim as it is, it's actually more complicated than the highly superior Airplane! The real joy is seeing true slapstick as it was meant to be, unlike the failed attempts of recent years. And yes, they can make a spoof without Leslie Nielsen, though he's a big part of why most of them worked in the 1970's and 1980's.The movie starts off with a bang telling you it's a silly movie, it only has one shot that they looked at the screen ? something I only like in very small portions ? and when they did, it was absolutely hilarious and the movie kept to what it was: spoof of war films, or the war itself, or Nazis. In either case, it didn't go in 50 directions like recent and unbearable spoofs, like Scary Movie 2, 3, 4, etc.Highly recommended for those who do love the 1980's, genuine spoofs and booted cows. Make sure you go to the special features on the disc ? the deleted are really funny and I'm surprised they were cut, and there's an Easter Egg concerning yet another hilarious scene and its original format. One scene, I might have missed, but I recall a scene in which the table "rises" with the gentlemen's excitement and I didn't see it this time. I'll watch it again, but I'm kind of disappointed that wasn't here. Anyways?SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies of all time. Although it's so silly ("How silly can you get") it's beyond silly, that is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It doesn't take long to get that this movie is all about the gags. Either you accept it and laugh your head off, or you turn it off. Val Kilmer is perfect for the role that is not a role or a character at all - he's just hanging on for the ride of the Zuckers and is oblivious to it all. And that's what makes the movie (beyond the fantastic gags), because all the characters find the things that happens very real. Forget about Scary Movie or whatever stupid movie there is out there. This is THE silly movie of all time. It's better than Airplane!, the Hot Shots movies and the Naked Gund-movies. This is the movie that frees itself from every rule and setting and just play all the jokes it can master. Yes, it's a parody of both Elvis-movies, war movies and spy movies, but at its core there's just true comedy with only one rule: There is no rules. "Souvenirs, novelties, party tricks!"I love it, I love it, I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say to those who didn't like this movie is "are you sure you have a sense of humour"? This is a send up second to none, the gags come thick and fast and even though I am a very ardent Elvis fan even I found the parody of Are You Lonesome Tonight absolute brilliance. I saw it when it had it's cinema release way back in the 80s and the whole place was rocking, the songs are first class and the fact that Val actually sings them is ace (I never knew he could sing). There are loads of visual jokes as well as slapstick and ridiculous flights of fancy. My favourite comedy to dig out of my DVD collection on a miserable rainy day , it's guaranteed to bring a smile even after the dozens of times I've already seen itTo Sum up BLOODY GOOD FUN !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sneak preview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the spring of 1984, I got to attend a sneak preview of a rough cut of "Top Secret!", several months before it was released. Since ZAZ had attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, they did a preview at the student union there, to gaga audience reaction to the various gags.One of the Zucker brothers was sitting directly in front of me during the screening. Early in the movie, when Nick and Hillary are dancing, Hillary says, "My grandfather used to live in America. He escaped in a balloon during the Jimmy Carter administration." The audience laughed, and Zucker turned to the person he was with, and said, "See! I told you that was funny!" After the movie, ZAZ did a question-and-answer period. They said that, after the success of "Airplane!", Paramount wanted them to do a sequel. "No, we've done all the funny airplane jokes; we want to do something else." And, so, Paramount went and did "Airplane 2" without them. For their next project, they had debated whether to spoof WWII movies, spy movies, or Elvis movies...and decided to do all three at once, which is how "Top Secret!" came to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When one gets ready to watch a film made by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker &amp; Jerry Zucker....the viewer should take a look at their work. Their work is Baffonery, Crazy, Nutty &amp; Horrifyingly Stupid. Not everyone can like their work. I do, I loved 'Airplane' and I continue to hail it as the finest slap-stick comedy ever.Coming to, 'Top Secret!', This flick is amongst the stupidest films of its time, that manages a set of good laughs in the meantime. Jim Abrahams, David Zucker &amp; Jerry Zucker eat Humor and digest slap-stick comedy. They can do anything! They are perhaps, the least bothered writer-directors of all-time.'Top Secret!' tells the story of an American pop singer, played awesomely by Val Kilmer, who goes to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival. While there, he becomes involved in a resistance movement and helps his lady-love, rescue her father, who is being held by the Germans and forced to build the deadly Polaris naval mine.Val Kilmer is awesome, as told before. Also, he dances with great energy and the songs he sings, have the funniest of lyrics. The Late Michael Gough is exceptional, as always. Others perform their "Crazy" roles, efficiently.On the whole, In comparison to 'Airplane', this flick offers lesser laughs and thus, I rate it a 6 on 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a genuinely amusing film from start to finish, and I think will ultimately be remembered as one of the best comedies of its era.There's no doubt that some material could be tighter; that much of the humor is topical and now somewhat outdated; that the film lacks an inner cohesion, and thus comes across as a series of skits in many respects.But lovers of comedy can forgive many of these faults - much of Fields is now outdated, Laurel and Hardy never showed concern for tight construction, the Three Stooges are frequently lacking in inner cohesion; yet they all made screamingly funny movies! All right, perhaps this isn't 'screamingly funny' - but it's dam'ed amusing, start to finish, and just feels good for being that. Even when not laughing, you will always find yourself smiling - that's worth about everything in these grim times.Needs a second and a third look - never stops.(Side note: Val Kilmer's first film - and he does his own singing!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time in the original English version, and it's silly, but VERY entertaining fun.Indeed, from "There's Sauerkraut in my Lederhosen" to the moving train station to D?ja Vu ("Haven't we met before?") to Rivers placing his head into a gas oven (an overt parody of the murder scene in "Torn Curtain", I think) to the Blue Lagoon spoof, this has to be counted as a classic.It may not reach the heights of some French film comedies (like "Oscar" or "The Great Blonde"), but it's a very well done parody in its own right.Some personal remarks: My appreciation for Val Kilmer has grown immensely after watching this film; this fellow is a gifted dancer and an achieved singer. --- Jeremy Kemp playing Major Streck has such a sweet German accent I couldn't believe he's an Englishman. --- Has anyone noticed that the heroine lodges in hotel room # 409 - hardly a surprise after the Beach Boys-parody intro? --- I may be wrong, but one of the East German Olympic team's women in the honorary ceremony at the beginning of the film looks suspiciously like Sylvester Stallone --- I was pleasantly surprised by the liberal use of Yiddish in the English original. That was phased out in the German dubbing; apparently this was still a no-no twenty years ago. Thank God this has changed in the meantime. Still, it made me angry and sad that the crazy Nazi barbarians succeeded in eradicating this rich culture from our midst.The latter notwithstanding, this film gave me a very good time, indeed.</fullReview>

Young and handsome Val Kilmer seemed so cool and nonchalant there, that we all simply tried to imitate his gimmicks and we all dwelt on repeating some of the craziest and funniest routine of the movie. Years later, I finally watched this one in English. Yeah, much of fun is still there and cameo by Omar Shariff is excellent, but still, some of the older magic is gone. Some gags ran stale, some jokes look vapid, some routine seems banal and not good even for a parody spoof film. The ZAZ team did a fine job. Yeah, some films lose charm, some stay the test of time. This on is 50/50, as some of the jokes grew rotten. But still, it can be watched</fullReview>

It has the same sense of irreverent fun. Val Kilmer is pretty good but there is nobody equivalent to Leslie Nielsen in this movie. Also going back to Elvis Presley from the 60s is not as immediate as the disaster movies that were still in the conversation of the day. Overall, it's a fun little film.</fullReview>

The cast is good, the acting is good and the film itself is generally pretty good too. Though slightly dated now, if you've got time go back to this 80's gem to see what the hype was all about.

		<fullReview>I can't believe I didn't see this terrific slapstick comedy decades ago. It holds up remarkably well. Since the story takes place in some alternate reality inspired by several different film genres, it still does not feel stale three decades later. Anyone from age ten and up would enjoy it today. Reviewers who criticized the lack of logic are seriously missing the joke. This sort of joyful craziness is usually only found today in the worlds of sketch comedy and animation. The audience for this picture needs to stay loose and accept that the film is about being funny and nothing more--and it's hugely successful. I appreciated the fact that gross-out jokes in the Farrelly brothers vein are kept to a minimum. There is some low humor but it doesn't dominate. Absurd sight gags and wordplay are the most common type of joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I adore "Airplane!" and the "Naked Gun" films and the former is one of my top 20 films of all time, I had never even heard of this Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker film until last week when one of its cast members, the always wonderful Warren Clarke, sadly died. The film is a laugh riot from start to finish! In his first film, Val Kilmer is very entertaining and has seldom been more likable or appealing in any of his subsequent films. He leads a very strong cast of mostly British actors including Clarke, Peter Cushing (in his penultimate film role), Michael Gough (who later played Alfred to Kilmer's Batman), Omar Sharif, Jeremy Kemp, Lucy Gutteridge, Ian McNeice, John Sharp and Jim Carter, all of whom excel at their comedic roles played with a completely straight face. The film is an hilarious parody of the films of Elvis Presley (whose ex-wife Priscilla later appeared in the "Naked Gun" films, funnily enough!), World War II films and Cold War films. My favourite joke in the film is Nigel and Du Quois dressed in a cow costume, which is played by a real cow with black spots painted on it! Outside of its parody elements, the plot is surprisingly good as well. I've seen plenty of straight dramas with more nonsensical plots!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a comedy-spoof from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, featuring Val Kilmer in his film debut. It is an outrageously funny parody of World War II spy movies in which American rock singer Nick Rivers (Kilmer) visits East Germany to perform, but ended up getting caught in the middle of a communist German plot aimed at forcing scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough) in making ultimate super-weapon, the Polaris Mine. Rivers and Flammond's daughter Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge) join the French Resistance, whose members have the most clever and hilarious sounding names you've ever heard, to rescue the doctor and foil the plot.At only 90 minutes long, this movie is stuffed with non-stop laughs and outrageous gags one after the other, from the Resistance members doing the tap dance right in the middle of a gun fight, to the underwater fight in a saloon between Nick and the main villain. From start to finish, this spoof that will send tears to your eyes and have you horse laughing from all the surprise gags, film and cultural parodies and funny dialog.With all the jokes and comedy in abundance, you wouldn't want to treat this movie seriously. The characters, however, seem to treat their "mission" seriously, giving this movie a fast-paced plot, no unnecessary fillers, and a fun story nonetheless. Kilmer did a great job in his first motion picture acting performance, as well as the host of other actors, providing us a thoroughly entertaining movie with comedy that just flows naturally, for a spoof, rather than force, slapstick nonsensical stuff.Overall, it's some of Abraham and the Zuckers' best work. It'll lift your spirits and keep you laughing all day.Grade A</fullReview>

Well the Zaz guys were never big on plot, if you've seen the type of film they are spoofing you should be well aware of the conventions, which is maybe why this film is as little remembered as it's peers, it's attempting to spoof multiple "genres" at once.I've never really seen any of the old Elvis musicals, so a lot of the humor in the musical moments falls flat, and confuses, when your waiting for more spy and espionage gags.Not quite as good as their other more well known films, but good viewing for those interested in the mile a minute, absurdist visual gags and slapstick and vernacular jokes that only these guys could do, after Woody Allen and Mel Brooks the comic torch for the 80's passed through the hands of the trio Zaz, where it continued on past Kevin Smith and the Wayans to Judd Apatow and co, and beyond.Oh and it was funny too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How silly can you get?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Top Secret!" is a comedy that parodies spy films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team that created "Airplane!" (1980) and later the "Naked Gun" films. The story follows the exploits of Nick Rivers, played by Val Kilmer, as he gets tangled in a plot in East Germany. Strangely and amusingly enough, though, East Germany's officials deliberately resemble Nazis.Val Kilmer does well with the humor and musical numbers in the lead. Lucy Gutteridge is also appropriate as Nick's love interest. The resistance members and East German/Nazi officers were all well-cast as well. There are some brief but nice appearances from Omar Sharif and Peter Cushing.The film has a number of funny moments, such as the singing of the East German anthem or Nick's air duct escape. I also enjoyed the musical numbers, particularly "How silly can you get?" However, I didn't find this film to be as consistently funny as "Airplane!" or the "Naked Gun". "Top Secret!" effectively mocks spy films, but isn't as amusing as other films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team.</fullReview>

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2003)Top Secret is the funniest movie i have seen because its a perfect blend of Social Satire, cleverness, stupidity, one-liners, Parody, and plot (or lack there of). i loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Rivers an American 50's Rock star is invited to perform at a festival in East Germany. Throughout his stay he falls for a charming young lady, Hillary, who's involved with the French Resistance because of her scientist father being captured by the Nazis. Nick then suddenly finds himself caught in this conflict and goes out of the way to help Hillary and the French Resistance free her father.Well, I simply adore this broad and terribly ridiculous skit-riddled spoof by the comedy team Jerry &amp; David Zucker and Jim Abraham. Nothing is safe (especially stereotypes), where the 50's Rock n Roll era (Elvis flicks); Espionage films and Hollywood Movies (such as Blue Lagoon and Wizard of Oz) hit mocksville. But while rock 'n' rolling with the Nazis, it also manages to poke fun at itself along the way, because really it's just one big joke with the little ones feeding off it. The lively premise is simply unhinged with a wild range of rapid-fire gags (the under-water saloon brawl being my favourite) and crazy musical segments, which are loosely tied to the thin central story. It doesn't wallow on about things, as there's always one joke after another, which mostly comes off and if not, it's quickly forgotten. Plus you got little diverting actions going on in the background behind the main dig, which can raise smirk. Amongst the many droll wisecracks in the script, are some smart jibs.A very young looking Val Kilmer makes his big screen debut and passes with flying colours. His appealing persona is more then credible, as the rock heartthrob Nick Rivers (which clearly is a parody of Elvis Presley). Sharing the screen with him is the very lovely Lucy Gutteridge and a risible turn by Christopher Villiers. In enjoyably short roles are Michael Gough, Omar Shariff and the unforgettable Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore owner.When watching it, I mightn't have been always laughing out loud, but at least this rollicking spoof manages to provoke a wry smile on my face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOP SECRET is a rare example to show how we are conditioned to screen flashing lights. Is a film to see not once, but twice, at least. Since our grandfathers were running from the early theaters due the close "train arriving" or a "triggered gun" facing them, we had change almost nothing in our needs to see illusions. TOP SECRET presents us the gold secret to diffuse a message: visual traps and tricks. We do not know what is reality or illusion when we go deep in a screen, theater or TV. This nice film alert us not to give - completely - our precious mind to screen effects, and to recognize we and our mind are not the same! TOP SECRET uses widely untruthfulness to catch our attention. And they got it! A wonderful mind game film that match our needs to laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is funny, but not as funny as I was expecting as I was a bit disappointed, however I still enjoyed it. All the characters are cool, and the story is fun, plus Val Kiler is surprisingly above average in this!. It's pretty well made and written, and while it didn't really have any real ending, it was still amusing, however I'll be honest I didn't find some of the spoofs funny, because I just didn't get them. There is one hilarious scene where Kilmer is fighting a guy in an underwater Bar, and he also cracked me up whenever he started singing, plus Christopher Villiers is fun as the villain. all the characters are very likable except for that guy who checked for tickets at the train stop, and while I wouldn't consider this to be anywhere near as funny as The Airplane or Naked Gun films it was still a pretty funny film, plus the whole cast seemed to be enjoying themselves and what was even better was they all played it straight!. It would be cool if they made a sequel to this, and even if you Aren't laughing your head off you'll still be chuckling. This is funny, but not as funny as I was expecting as I was a bit disappointed, however I still enjoyed it, and I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Jim Abrahams and The Zucker brothers do a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film amusing and at a fast pace. The Acting is fun. Val Kilmer is surprisingly very funny and likable here, I usually really dislike him in films but he was great here, as this role suited him, and he seemed to be having a lot of fun, why can't he do more stuff like this?. Lucy Gutteridge is decent as the love interest and did what she had to adequately and had fun with it. Christopher Villiers is great fun as the villain I really liked him. Peter Cushing has a cool role here too. Michael Gough is great as the father&amp;doctor I liked him as well. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall while I was a bit disappointed I still highly recommend it!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a disclaimer: I'm going to talk about the movie now, and if you haven't seen it, then you won't know what the heck I'm talking about. But it's pretty hard to review a movie without mentioning anything specific. And so therefore I am checking the spoiler box.Top Secret! is a hilarious movie that everyone should watch every day after school every day of the week during fourth or fifth grade.There are two basic kinds of great scenes in this movie - whenever Val Kilmer dances (because he actually dances, up on tables, down the steps, in long takes), and during the scene in the Swedish bookshop where everything's backwards and waaay in the background there's a book about lesbian iron-smiths or something.The only negative thing about this movie is that its humor is sometimes so wacky and scatterbrained that I lost the plot. Wait, what's going on now? Luckily, the plot is the least important part of this movie. It's almost more beside the point than Aeon Flux.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, "Airplane!" started it all, and the "Naked Gun" movies had their moments, but the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team really hit their stride with "Top Secret!" It rivals the great "Duck Soup" as one of the funniest, most off-the-wall comedies of all time."Top Secret!" takes no prisoners. Where else can you see a dead-on satire on World War II spy thrillers, Elvis rock musicals, "The Blue Lagoon," "The Great Escape" and "The Wizard of Oz?" Val Kilmer even does a very credible young Elvis impression -- it's obvious he's having fun, and so we have fun, too.This is one of those movies that you need to watch a couple of times to get all the jokes. I bet you'll never find a movie as consistently hilarious and clever as "Top Secret!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOP SECRET is a spoof on Elvis musical movies as well as World War 2 films, the spy genre, rock music, and everything in between. The story is about a Elvis style rock star who runs afoul of the dreaded East German High Command and their evil plan to takeover NATO.. Val Kilmer sings all of the songs used in the film...yes, he sings! This is one film I had to watch 4 or five times to catch all the sight gags. Some of which are:1. The "I know a little German" scene. 2. The scene where a german mortorcycle courier removes his helmet, yet the chin strap is still attached to his chin. 3. The scene mocking ALICE COOPER and the music group THE LETTERMEN. 4. The scene involving the fake EXTREME CLOSEUP of the ringing phone when a officer picks it up. 5. The scene with the ANAL INTRUDER 6. The scene where the guy is looking through the binoculars at the cows and they do a POV shot showing his perspective...we see one of the cows hop over the fence and into the POV shot. 7. The "Aliright be a ASS##le" scene involving the cowsuit. 8. The "where are you taking him/we are not taking him anywhere" scene 9. The scene mocking the map sequences in Indiana Jones films. 10. The Nutcracker ball scene 11. The shootout at the old farmhouse 12. The awards ceremony with the East German women's olympic team 13. The BEACH BOYS opening credits spoof. 14. The BLUE LAGOON spoof.You get the idea. This is by far the best of the Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker films...if you like AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN you'll love this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This forgotten classic is probably as funny as "Airplane!" (if not as well-known) The gags come rapid-fire, the amorphous "plot" changes every couple of minutes, and Val Kilmer is surprisingly funny as the dumb old-country boy rock singer "Neek." There's simply too much funny stuff in this movie to describe, but it one-ups "Airplane!" in one respect: The songs. The songs (some sung by Kilmer himself) are hilarious and well-done. From "Skeet Surfing" to "How Silly Could You Get?" (My Favorite, and it's title pretty much sums up the movie) to a warped advertisement version of "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" this movie's soundtrack deserves to be re-issued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, I Don't Care Anymore. It's Just Hilarious, So Watch It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a movie so abjectly campy and poorly made that enjoying it is like watching a performance while someone next to you obnoxiously chews gum the whole time. It is so obviously shot on studio sets. Actors are so obviously wearing make up. During the hilarious German magic salesman bit, whatever the German sprays in the spy's face makes the spy's make-up smear more and more. I can't quite figure out if Val Kilmer is just all-around wooden or if the Zuckers just don't tend to use his better takes. The musical sequences are truly boring, except for the rug sequence which is pretty cool. What it ends up boiling down to is an unending stream of puns and coarse visual gags one must wade through hopeless production values to take pleasure in.Regardless, if one can, there is one sequence that's such a unique example of expressly cinematic humor that I'm surprised to find it here rather than an early Woody Allen comedy. The hero visits a Swedish bookshop. The scene relies not on why, but on English played in reverse, which sounds Scandinavian. The entire scene does this, with English subtitles. This is funny enough at the outset, before we even get it, but it becomes exceptional at the end of the scene, when it finally gives itself away. This is a level of filmic wit so far beyond comparison the surrounding movie that it's almost a contradiction splattered in the middle of it.Nevertheless, like a Mel Brooks film, this movie will readily go for a laugh wherever one is even distantly liable to be found. It has political jokes and boob jokes, dog poop gags, and ballet jokes. It teases two utterly divergent Hollywood genres: the spy thriller and the Elvis Presley musical. It concerns an expatriate who escaped America by balloon during the Carter administration, an associate of the French underground named Escargot, and Omar Sharif contained in a flattened automobile.Unlike Airplane!, which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of recognizables whose careers were secured by such films, Top Secret! is based on no directly familiar forebear. It's by and large a lampoon of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to go with a star like Elvis Presley or Frankie Avalon, something that no East-West espionage film ever remotely came close to doing. But now that I think about a lot of the shameless WWII propaganda using A-list dramatic talent, why not go all the way and put Paul Anka and Fabian on the frontlines with the dirty Japs and crouts? The foreseeably threadbare story in Top Secret! has something to do with an East German plot to bring Germany back together, ostensibly by containing the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean. This really is a funny idea, too. I mean, can you imagine the Joint Chiefs being so concerned with whether or not Leonard Bernstein shows at a cultural festival that they would neglect to look at their daily intelligence reports?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on VHS in 1984 and thought, "Wow", "This movie is what comedy and slap-stick movies are all about." I rate it one of the best along with "Shot in the Dark". It was also the first time I took notice of Val Kilmer for the first time, then and wondered why he never continue to star in more comedies as he has the knack for that kind of venue. Instead, he accepts bete noire roles. He came close to near comedy in "Comanche Moon" which belies his talent for comedy.The funniest scene from this movie I thought was when he was tortured by the GDR guards in prison until he became unconscious into the dream world of a nightmare depicting him missing his final exams at high school. When he awakens from that nightmare, he is smiling while he is still being whipped by the guards, saying to the effect, " thank god that was only a dream". I think all of us at one time or another had similar nightmares about our high school or college experiences.A must see movie just for the hell of it.</fullReview>

And other funny jokes like crazy names/hairstyles/clothes and just dumb scenes.And of course a library with rare Swedish books! It is about a Rock n Roll star from America (Val Kilmer) who travels to WORLD WAR 2 Germany to have a gig, when he gets kidnapped because the German police Gestapo thinks he is a spy.

		<fullReview>This is simply Marx brothers in the 80's. So many remarkably intelligent gags that are simply so laughable to think of days after the movie is unique. Where other funny movies rely on one-liners to carry the movie, this stays funny also in the 2nd and 3rd view. More, the movie builds itself up to become more and more funny and crazy, and never loses pace. What is wrong with you guys. This deserves a much better ranking than a mere 6.8. See it over a few beers with some good friends and you will have a most enjoyable evening. Omar Sharif in the crushed car, and the unlikely detailed model of the castle followed by the funniest prisoner freeing scenes of all times simply makes you laugh to tears. Val Kilmer was never in my list of top-actors, but he does a remarkable job in this comedy. He can sing like Elvis, and dance like Travolta. I'm surprised he never got a similar role where those skills could be expressed further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZAZ's greatest movie and Kilmer is actually fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Germans have always been a target for either parody or down right ridicule and there are not much prejudiced German behavior that isn't given the full once over here. Still, when you see this movie you will find yourself laughing at the most stupid, almost racist remark and you will kick yourself afterward to find out why the hell it was so funny.Let me say that I had absolutely no idea who Val Kilmer was when I first saw this back in the mid-80's but without stretching much of the truth, I have to say that I have never enjoyed watching him more than in this movie. Since then he has mostly disgusted me with the rather ugly characters he has played like Iceman in Top Gun and the worst, Jim Morrison. He had some appeal in Heat but that was a great movie for a whole other reason.There are virtually no other famous actors in this movie and the leading lady, Lucy Gutteridge has never filmed a well known movie to this date as far as I can recollect. The most well known after Kilmer is of course, Michael Gough. It's funny that many years later they would play master and servant in the third Batman film totally by accident.This movie can only be described as pure gold from start to finish and there are so many funny scenes that my eyes were in tears midway through the whole event. If you should point out a flaw it's the annoyingly smug Nigel but I think he was meant to be that way, a total perverted Ken look-a-like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Top Secret!" by the guys that brought us "Airplane," (And individually would surprise us with films like "Ghost" and "First Knight.")is a worth successor, almost surpassing "Airplane" as the funniest of the 2.Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is a very popular singer who is one of the headliners of a festival in East Germany, which uses the festival as a cover for world domination. When Rivers meets up with Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge), he is drawn into The Resistance, a group with colorful names (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, Latrine). The leader of the group, Nigel (AKA The Torch), is a former love of Hillary's, which complicates things.Never mind the formula plot, though.The film is played STRICTLY for laughs, and the laughs hit you hard and fast. So much so that you can't recover from painful laugh attacks. It's hard to pinpoint which scenes are funnier, so I'm not going to try. Omar Sharif, Peter Cushing and Michael Gough actually have some pretty funny moments in the film.</fullReview>

In the tradition of Airplane and Naked Gun, there is not a single moment when something funny isn't happening... either in the foreground or the background or both. The plot is bizarre and almost not relevant because the slapstick humor supercedes any plot devices. The soundtrack is equally hilarious with parodies of Beach Boys and Elvis classics. "Are you lonesome tonight, is your kitchen asight" etc. I was able to see Jerry Zucker at a UW Madison graduation ceremony and he is as hilarious in real life as his movies suggest.I also highly recommend Real Genius for another humorous Val Kilmer role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews here are hot and cold. People love it, or find fault with the weak plot structure (doesn't even exist to the critics, hell to the directors according to the DVD commentary). I understand the people who don't like it. But you have to understand, Airplane is not a parody, it is a comedy. Yes, it makes fun of Airport '77, but that is not enough to warrant the term "parody". Top Secret parodies many specific scenes from many different WWII movies but what I believe makes it the equal of 'Galaxy Quest' is that it parodies the 2nd unit shots, the cliches. There is a shot of a german waving his arms telling a convoy to move forward, the shot zooms out and they are going in circles. the guy crawling on his stomach runs into a pair of boots and looks up to see..a pair of boots. OK, a lot of people have seen the Great Escape and Steve McQueen jumping the fence on his motorcycle, but how many made the connection when Val Kilmer does it?This is basically the WWII galaxy quest, instead of fans of sci fi shows and their filler / typical cliches that are obvious to people WHO CONSTANTLY WATCH THESE THINGS, this movie is for the WWII buffs.</fullReview>

This film provided many clips for the trailers for "night time TV" in the UK (the rest were mainly provided by Battlestar Galactica). I still want to know how many folk provided arms and legs for the desert island scene.The soundtrack is classic rock 'n' roll and very singalongable - I just wish I knew where too buy it!Although Val Kilmer is not my most favourite actor, I cannot fault his performance in this film - after all - "it's just some bad B movie". ;-)Get some beers in, loads of chips and enjoy a light hearted, nothing to think about film. No sex/drugs/mindless violence. It would be a perfect film for the whole family if you didn't need to concentrate to find all the best gags. 10/10P.S.At the end of the film - don't forget to read the credits to find out ... who the cow was ... and to find some other gags.

He's sitting right over there.(cut to shot of midget waving to camera).It's also smart enough to have an entire scene based on the premise that English, when played backward, sounds like Swedish(don't even ask).It somehow manages to spoof Frankie and Annette, Elvis movies, "The Great Escape," "The Dirty Dozen," Westerns, "Casablanca," spy movies,"The Blue Lagoon," and even "The Wizard of Oz." I have no idea how this movie was conceived, or what studio executive greenlighted this, but God bless everyone involved with this movie, because it is a sublime idiocy, and one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you loved "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun," and you've never seen this, you missed the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one line summary says it all, really. There are funnier movies out there, such as the later Naked Gun and Airplane movies, but Top Secret is still good. If you don't like Airplane or Naked Gun or Hot Shots, then odds are you won't like Top Secret either.Like the movies to which it is often compared, Top Secret is filled with a dozen jokes, gags and/or puns in nearly every frame. Even if you don't see them initially, I assure you that they are there, especially if you speak either German or Yiddish or if you've seen more spy movies, film noir, Elvis musicals, war movies or westerns than is healthy.Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American singer on his way to East Germany to perform at the government's request. This actually is the one flaw with the movie... Since he's a singer, that means... Val Kilmer sings... Argh. But, thanks to the wonders of DVD, I can now skip through that with barely a wince. From there he becomes involved in an East German plot to ressurect the third reich, and what would a movie with Nazis in it be without the resistance movement? Of course all the resistance fighters are French for some reason... But that's just the type of warped movie you're looking for. For a serious movie person, all the logical leaps and bounds will cause their heads to explode, but if you're that serious, you wouldn't watch this anyhow.So I give this movie two ratings. On the one hand, there's the rating for the casual viewer who is just looking to laugh a bit-- There it's an 8/10, one point knocked off for each song break (except the first, which is actually good). But if you're looking for a serious movie with social commentary... 1/10. Frankly, though, if you're looking for that, why are you in the slapstick section of your video store?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"NEEK!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top Secret is undoubtedly one of THE funniest films ever made. It is chock full of one-liners and sight gags that come fast and furious. So much so, that I'm sure some viewers will miss things the first time around.Val Kilmer is indeed underrated: the guy can act, sing, and dance! You don't see many actors these days that are that well trained in the film industry. How many of you were smart enough to buy the five-track vinyl EP of Val singing the songs from Top Secret all those years ago? It's one of my most prized possessions. When listening to Nick Rivers sing you too will scream "NEEK!"The spoofs of Elvis and spy movies are the main focus, but you'll be treated to plenty more references from The Wizard Of Oz to The Blue Lagoon, and everything is interwoven with brilliance. After all, in what universe or time did this East Germany exist? This concept for Top Secret is so bizarre and I think it just can't be topped. The cheesy pizzas at Der Pizza Haus had me laughing so hard I was crying. Undoubtedly it would receive a PG-13 if released today, this film had a lot of great adult humor in it for a PG. I was gasping and laughing so hard at the introduction of the Anal Intruder product -- as with that scene, everything was played so sincerely that you just couldn't believe what you were seeing. Of course, the Swedish bookshop has to be considered one of the funniest, most clever, and complicated sequences in film history. Frankly, I enjoy this film a lot more than Airplane (a classic too of course), as it touches on things that I relate to more. Yes, I GOT the Pinto joke....our family owned one of those cars. Speaking of cars, seeing Omar Sharif crunched up in a car cube was astonishing! There's so much attention to detail in EVERY frame of this film, down to even the choice of backing singers for Nick Rivers when he performs. Simply amazing.There's no need for me to go on and on about this film, as I'm sure many have read all there is to know about the plot and what people consider the funniest moments. I primarily wanted to get my two cents worth in and say that Top Secret is a true classic, deserves a lot more respect, and maybe Paramount will some day put out a MORE special edition of the DVD than the one that's available now -- this is the one movie I have been waiting for on DVD more than any other besides the release of Eraserhead in 2002.Top Secret is a real treat and will have you singing "Skeet Surfin'" for days! Say, where can I get one of those giant telephones?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two movies that as a kid I watched endlessly (kid = 8-12 years old) but no one had ever heard of. One was UHF (A movie that I will grant all of the bad reviews on, it's far from perfect, but I love it, what can I say) and Top Secret! When I was about 15 or 16 I decided to have my friends watch them both thinking that I was going to love them and they'd hate them. Well they loved both, but over the years Top Secret! has grown to be one of the funniest, if not THE funniest spoof film ever made. Yes I love the Farrely brothers, and the Coehn Brothers, and even The Brothers Grimm, but the Zucker team outdid themselves on this film. There are so many jokes it's impossible to keep a straight face for more than about 5 seconds. Those who don't get it, I'm convinced are either so highly educated that they've forgotten what funny is, or are so uneducated they don't see the great pains it took these film makers to truly attack the cold war in no way any Bond film could ever do. The cast is superb and just too many lines or scenes but I'll give my top few as others have: The boots on the ground, CLASSIC; the man running to catch the tree, where has a gag like this EVER been done; The Little German, a GREAT one line gag; Playing the scene backwards to make the shopkeeper sound sweedish, I don't think epople understand why that's funny; and probably one of my favorite site gags EVER done in ANY film, the scene at the ballet with the ballerinas jumping on, well, if you've seen it you know what it is and it's unparalleled FUNNY!" Run don't walk to get this movie on DVD on July 16th, outtakes, deleted scenes, and commentary, truly deserved by this FANTASTIC film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this is the best of the Abrahams/Zucker Airplane!-genre spoofs, probably because I prefer the genre of films being spoofed here, which are spy thrillers and Elvis movies. Some of the jokes are a little inside, but I think that it makes them funnier (although less accessible). For instance, the scene in the diner where Val Kilmer sings is even funnier if you recall the analogous scene in "Loving You", which is a wonderful Elvis turkey (and I say this in the most affectionate way). And to me, nothing in Airplane! equals the hilarity of the interaction between Nick Rivers and the border guards or the fun of the opening music video...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No 'Airplane!' but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Top Secret' is one of the comedies from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. During the years they have brought the wonderful 'Airplane!', the very funny 'Naked Gun'-series, two 'Hot Shots!'-movies, 'Jane Austen's Mafia!' and 'Rat Race'. This movie belongs in that list of very funny movies. It is not as good as 'Airplane!' or the first 'Naked Gun' but it comes close.Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, an American rock n' roll singer, who comes to East-Germany. To tell you the truth I can't remember really why he did that, but of course that doesn't matter very much. In East-Germany he meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge). Her father is imprisoned by the East-German regime and Nick wants to help Hillary to find him back. The movie is not really about the plot but to tell more would reveal some very funny surprises.A lot of movie references will pas during the movie, the most obvious are probably from 'The Blue Lagoon' and all the Elvis Presley musicals. It is a little hard to explain the movie but consider a scene where Nick and Lucy want to hide. They pass a closet that says "Janitor", you see them in almost every building. They open the closet and behind the door we see the actual janitor in a very small space. They close the door and enter a room that says "props". In the room we see actual props. There are many of those scene and most of them work. I had a good time watching this.</fullReview>

There are funnier spoof movies today, but "Top Secret!" is still worth watching.If you are familiar with Abrahams and Zucker movies then you know what you are in for here; a movie full of really odd comedy spoofs and gags.The core essence of the story is about an American rock and roll singer named Nick who is on a promotional tour to East Germany during World War II. Here he becomes entangled in a conflict between the Nazis and the French resistance.There was actually a fairly good ensemble of talents in the movie, including Omar Sharif, Val Kilmer and Jeremy Kemp."Top Secret!" does have some funny moments and does bring about a good laugh here and there.If you enjoy movies such as "Hot Shots", "Airplane!" and the like, then you will also like "Top Secret!".</fullReview>

She is 13 years older than him... weird.The German jokes are great, knowing they are not real German.

		<shortDescription>Simply the funniest movie that has ever been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can be no doubt this is the stupidest movie ever made. It has plot holes all over the shop and the characters just don't make any sense, but if you're after a character-driven comedy that speaks to you on multiple levels, then you wouldn't be watching this in the first place. This film is about one thing only, making you laugh! And it does it better than any other film in 20 years since its inception. There can be no argument that this is Val Kilmer's finest moment, because despite the high-profile roles he has starred in since, he has rarely revisited his comic roots. Only in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang does he once again display his talent for brilliant dry delivery, and spot-on comic timing. Obviously, the plot is irrelevant, but it centres around an American singer caught up in a Plot from the Germans to, once again, take over the world. That really is all you need to know, because it's not important. The first time I watched this, I'd gotten home rather worse for wear, and flicked on the TV and some un-godly hour of the morning. Within 5 minutes I'd shouted at my mate to come and watch this crazy film, and the rest is history. None of my friends have still seen this film, but the two of us still fondly remember some of the fantastic gems that are contained within; the pacman scene upon arrival in Germany just blew our minds, the man chasing the tree still gets us every time, and as for Chocolate Mousse (Gasoline Ha Ha Ha!), well, if you haven't seen it, then it cannot be explained. Suffice to say, I love this film. I love it for what it is, because it doesn't try and pretend that it's a great film, it knows that it's a stupid comedy,and is extremely proud of it. This film has more hilarious moments in the first 10 minutes than almost all modern-day comedies can boast in their entire repertoire! To summarise, I'd say that everyone needs to see this film. Many will not find it funny, as it does appeal to a certain type of humour, but for those that get the first slapstick gag that they see, they are in for a treat! There are too many comic gems to list in this film, but I think I could pick out any 5 minutes of the feature and there would be something ingenious contained within. Just thinking about the hamster scene makes me chuckle!! It must be watched, it demands to be laughed at, and above all, it must certainly not be taken seriously!</fullReview>

Peter Cushing makes a cameo appearance speaking "Swedish" as well as film great Omar Shariff. Another funny film from Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.The humor is fast and so is the pace of the movie.

One can see why he was chosen to portray "The Lizard King": Jim Morrison (Morisson - spelling?).Regardless of the somewhat crass one-liners, Kilmer IS a 50s maybe 60s Beachboy clone.The notion of clay-pigeon shooting combined with surfing: "Skeet Surfing - USA", really sets the mood for the rest of the movie.And so it goes.

In my opinion, they made the right choice.Although "Top Secret!" wasn't a hit at the box office, it's developed into a cult classic. This didn't look like it was an easy comedy to make. ZAZ were working without a net. Especially trying to combine two dissimilar genres (the WWII spy thriller &amp; the silly, Elvis-like musical) into one funny comedy. Some of the one-liners, the pratfalls, the skits don't always work. But I've had so much fun watching the movie that I don't really care.If I'm feeling low, "Top Secret!" is one comedy I usually rent. It's dumb fun.</fullReview>

Val Kilmer looks ridiculously young, with typical '80s hair, and shows a real comedic flair here-he probably should have stuck with comedy. He then wouldn't have gone in the tank with that colossal "Island of Dr Moreau" disaster (or maybe that was a comedy?)

With Val Kilmer in the leading role in his first feature length movie and a set of stars that never made it big, Top Secret is sure to bring a lot of laughter to viewers of all ages. Not only it is sure to give you a great time laughing, but it is worth watching just because of those amazingly made scenes such as the underwater fighting or the one shot totally backwards.

		<fullReview>I think you're being a bit rash, Agent 10. The fact that you think the funniest bit of the movie is a 'pooping pigeon' says a bit, I suppose. To forewarn readers, before you get too far into this, I have a very warped sense of humor. I'm one of 10 people on the entire planet that think 'The Jerk' (Steve Martin) is one of THE funniest movies (for it's sort) of all time. 'Top Secret' falls into the category of THAT type of movie. There are movies that are supposed to be the height of dumb, yet still manage to keep you giggling, if not laughing outright, throughout the entire presentation. Please do keep in mind, however dated, however overused some of the taglines might seem on the surface(Airplane gives a classic example of this 'Don't call me Shirley') the Zucker/Abrahams team were the FIRST TO USE these lines. They were the original idea men for this ilk of humor; authors of phrases, so overused that they have become a part of the American vernacular. Movies of this ilk are mindless entertainment, but unlike so much drivel released by Hollywood they hold a unique position...they are SUPPOSED to be mindless entertainment! 'Top Secret' is not an artsy film. It won't make you cry. It won't make you examine the cosmos or the meaning of life. It WILL, if you have a sense of humor, and an appreciation for the slightly surreal (Example: Nick and Hillary are looking out of an upper-story window down at the busy street bellow and everything's so far away and tiny. Suddenly, a normal sized white mouse runs through the street, over the tiny cars etc.) make you laugh, and forget the world outside for a couple of hours of giddy fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top Secret! is one of those movies that is all about reading into the details. Forget about the weak plot and cheesy jokes...that's what most comedies are all about.My favorite part of this movie is something that people probably don't really pay attention to at all. Near the beginning, the general is handed a letter. The letterhead states: "East Germany, better government through intimidation"....I think that's great. The general then uses a premade rubber stamp that says, "Find him and kill him" as if this is a command that is used several times a day.Come on, how cute was Val Kilmer in the 80's?....Top Secret! and Real Genius are two of my favorite movies. I'm a fan of ridiculous comedies, and this is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie on DVD, I hadn't laughed like this for any movie in a long time. If you love slapstick comedy, you've got to see this funny film. It goes on my list of the top comedies I've ever seen. The best part of the movie is when there crawling through the fence and see a pair of boots with standing before them, but let out a sigh of relief when the camera backs away to show the boots are empty. That's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film on it's original release in 1984, I was slightly disappointed, but having seen it more recently on a Christmas TV schedule, the gags and general atmosphere of the film holds up well. It was released roughly around the same time that the classic 80's British show ALLO, ALLO started and Lucy Gutteridge reminded me so much of Kirsten Cooke in that show. Omar Sharif steals the show, especially when he emerges as part of a crushed car and some nice visual gags help to make it fun, albeit predictably in terms of the comic style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has everything you would want into any comedy. Val Kilmer does it right and fits perfectly his role. On that well known genre that is "comedy-simple-parody-multiple_gags", this one is easily the best, maybe even better than "Airplane".Don't expect any intellectual meanings. Just a comedy, but a very funny one. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Top Secret' is amiable for a spoof, but is not in the league of "Airplane!" or the "Naked Gun" movies. The problem I had was with the leading role. Val Kilmer was terrible in this movie and "Real Genius", and he's mediocre at best today. I found a lot of the gags funny. I felt bad laughing at the "Nazis getting blown up by the Pinto" scene, for that's what happened to 3 Hoosier teenage girls when their wagon tapped the bumper of a Pinto. The explosion resulted in their deaths. (I don't believe the parents would be watching this movie more than once.) Still, a good time waster if your into ZAZ and spoofs in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOP SECRET! (1984) spoilers((( Val Kilmer looked very good as young, and, no affence, he still does, but here: he's young and unknown, funny to watch. Top Secret is a underrated comedy classic that really shows how a good parody shell be done. Not is only the movie funny, it's also original and cool in its very own way. Kilmer sings Elvis' songs but with a new text, funny. And off course, the final battle between hero and villain is superb underwater fist fight, as when they suddenly appear in a western saloon and Kilmer knocks the bad-guy down, the Bonanza theme roll up and Kilmer picks up his cowboy hat and dries it for dust and smiles with his charming smile, one of the best fight scenes ever!The movie is also filled with rare jokes that you can also see in movies like The Naked Gun and stuff. As when Kilmer starts twisting on the floor in a sort of dance and suddenly he drills a hole threw the floor and down he goes! It's hilarious! STARS: ***** 5/5 (one of the very best comedies ever)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is a classical. After so many spoof movies that we have seen in the cinema in the last decade this one with Airplane! remains to be the best spoof ever made. There are so many details that you will have to watch the movie several times to catch them all. I found myself discovering new jokes after some years later! In these films u expect to find a few very good jokes, several good ones and many bad ones, but in this movie most of them are hilarious, smart and very imaginative; not like the movies today where bad taste and repetitive jokes prevail among the others. If u like spoof movies this is probably the best, and if you don't, it is impossible that after watching it you haven't laughed quite a few times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like almost everybody else, I caught this only by accident, years after it was first made, on late-night cable. From "Skeet Surfin'" on, I was hooked, and really impressed with Kilmer, whom I would have had trouble picturing as either an Elvis clone or a comic before I saw this movie. When my wife and I were watching the credits, mostly to look for the usual Zucker silly touches, we almost fell out of our chairs when we saw that Kilmer hadn't lip-synched each song, as we expected, but sang every one of them! And did all the dance moves, too -- and damned well at that. I heard somewhere that Kilmer went to Julliard, and he obviously paid serious attention to his music. The guy is GOOD.I suppose it is possible to have such an absence of a sense of humor as to not like this movie, but it's hard to imagine. I watch it every time it's on (maybe 6-7 times now) and enjoy it more each time. Of course, like Deja Vu, the Resistance fighter, I have a vague sense that I've seen this all before somewhere ....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost twenty years on, this is still a solid winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember getting my first taste of this film as an impressionable ten-year-old, when my father took me to the cinema to see some classic reissued Disney fare. A trailer for TOP SECRET! came on and I almost wet myself laughing - Peter Cushing's amazing prosthetic eye, the cow in galoshes, the holes-for-the-breasts beach bunny gag, the guard falling to the ground and shattering like a clay statue, the giant telephone - all these little gems and more flashed before my disbelieving eyes like tantalizing glimpses of a forbidden world. When I finally got to see the full movie a couple of years later, I was not disappointed. Having recently viewed it again, I can honestly say it's still as wonderfully stupid and infectiously funny as ever. Watching TOP SECRET! is like being under the influence of a particularly hilarious mind-altering drug. Set in a bizarre nowhere-land somewhere between World War Two, the rocking fifties, the early sixties and 1984, the film spins an exhilaratingly surreal variant on just about every spy / war / rock movie ever made, with Elvis Presley's cinematic fare coming in for a particular battering, together with sly (and not so sly) digs at everything from Jane Fonda, Pacman and Leroy Neimann to Jimmy Carter, The Wizard Of Oz and The Blue Lagoon. There is a decent plot, but it ceases to matter once the onslaught of dumb, tasteless, surreal and side-splittingly funny verbal and visual gags kicks in. This kind of thing isn't to everyone's taste (my mother hated it, particularly as I learned the "coitus interruptus" part of the doomed Priest's pig-Latin spiel and repeated it ad-nauseam, and because she couldn't understand why ANYONE would want to rip into the Presley legend so mercilessly) but if you're in the mood to enter a different level of comedy consciousness, this is the ideal film for you.A couple of side notes - I was amazed to find out that this was Val Kilmer's first ever film! A starring role too! Full marks to Oliver Stone for trusting him with the Morrison role in THE DOORS! And why has this sublime spoof been virtually forgotten these days? This is the 'bridge' between the ZAZ team's Kentucky Fried Movie / Airplane!-type satire and their later, more polished (and more restrained) Naked Gun features, and it's priceless. As soon as I get through typing this, I want to go home and watch it all again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely has its moments, but it simply doesn't match up to the ZAZ team's masterpiece. I think the main difference is that in "Airplane!" the humor is effortless, the gags just flow naturally, wheras in "Top Secret!" it's as if they were trying too hard, straining to be funny, and it shows. Or perhaps it's just that maybe spy movies aren't as easy to parody as disaster films. Whatever it is, this movie just wasn't nearly as funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Stupid And Brainless? So Much Better!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Abrahms-Zucker-Zycker trio has given us the best dumb comedies ever: Airplane! (not the pathetic sequel) and the Hot Shots! and Naked Gun sagas. Not to mention this one, which became my favorite comedy as a child. All I cared about were the scenes at the German prison with the guard breaking like glass and the jeep exploiding after a simple 'tling'. That was good then and now I like it much more. The French resistance is hilarious. When I caught the English version and heard the black guy's name I laughed at my ass for 5 minutes! and I don't mind that much about the dubbed version because it is mostly visual gags and not much spoken humour. But the best of all were the German soldiers with their big boots and the big giant phone. There are movies with good and inteligent humour, but I have no doubt that the stupid jokes will make you laugh harder with every time you see it. The trio has better movies, but to be their second major one, it rocks.By the way, half an hour ago I finally got to understand the 'prop room' joke. Cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is very rare that I laugh more than 5 or 6 times at a movie, but this one managed to surpass that by at least threefold. Top Secret! kept the jokes rolling, the puns flying, and the slapstick humor and visual gags coming. While overall there were no big names, except for Val Kilmer in the leading role, all of the cast members pulled through in a big way, making this movie shine. The lack of plot didn't detract from the humor in the least; in fact, it merely strengthened its ability to be that funny. Clearly, Top Secret! is well worth going out to your local movie shop and renting it. Oh, one last note: Sorry kiddies, no flashing in this movie.</fullReview>

During his stay there, he gets involved with a resistance to overthrow the German government.From the same people that brought us Airplane! (another idiotic film), this movie is full of sight gags and cheap parodies of other films. What gets me is that films of this nature are so popular. This type of comedy is not funny at all, and is usually very tasteless humour.If you like the type of comedy in the Airplane movies or the Hot Shot series, then this film is definately for you.

		<shortDescription>Keep the joke a Top Secret!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pound for pound, no comedy has made me laugh more than "Top Secret!". It's a satire by the Zucker Brothers (Airplane!) of both WWII flicks ( like the Great Escape) and Elvis Presley musicals. Think about the chronology for a minute. Satire for the most part isn't done very well these days (see the awful 'Not Another Teen Movie' if you don't believe me). The trap that many satires today fall into is that they simply recreate a scene but they do not let you onto what it as about the scene or movie that it deserves to be zinged. The Zucker Brothers know this. There's a satire early on of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" which starts with the familiar scene as we know it from Raiders but it soon goes into other areas before revealing itself as one of the more creative jokes in the movies. That's really a theme to this movie. The scene start familiar as we know them, but get stranger as they play on before revealing themselves at the end. This is evident with the fist fight in the truck, or the famous "Swedish book store" scene. The Zucker brothers seem to take scenes that one step further than what everybody else would (something the Farelly brothers have picked up on). They also fill the whole screen with jokes To comment on the acting is a exercise in futility (nobody goes to see Top Secret! for the acting) but here it goes:  The actors play this perfectly for a satire. Throughout the movie they are deadpan serious (even when a long lost love is 'measuring you up'). The actor can't be in on the jokes (another thing you see in newer satires). The casting is dead on as well. Similar to Airplane!, character actors play the key roles. You have Omar Sharif as a much abused spy ("This isn't the Howard Johnsons"), Michael Gough as a kidnapped scientist ("But what about my tunnel"), and Peter Cushing as the aforementioned Swedish bookstore owner. All of them seem to have fun poking fun at their more serious images Top Secret is a satire up there with the 50's Warner Brothers, 70's Mel Brooks classics, and recent Farelly Brother romp- and don't let anybody tell you the joke before you watch</fullReview>

Kilmer sings his own songs and dances wildly as the Elvis-like Nick Rivers while "Blue Lagoon", "Bonanza", "The Great Escape", and others are cleverly spoofed (as opposed to the sometimes shameless spoofing of other films in the genre such as "Spy Hard").This was the Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams follow-up to their previous hit "Airplane", so if you liked that film, the Naked Gun series, or any of their others, you will most definitely appreciate this!</fullReview>

And it is truly funny, and earns a place not quite at but near the level of "Young Frankenstein," "Blazing Saddles" and "Airplane" (the undisputed classics of this odd mini-genre).I get mild chuckles from the first "Naked Gun" movie. And "Spaceballs" has one classic line that makes me laugh every time I hear it - but that's the only time I laugh at the whole movie. "Hot Shots" does nothing for me. And Mel Brooks has just been churning out endless, boring dreck like "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" for many years - thank God he's apparently focused on getting "The Producers" going on Broadway so as to spare us any more awful films from a once-great writer/director.So anyhow, "Top Secret!" sorta marks a dividing line - the last time one of these silly spoof movies was actually truly funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why are movies like this left forgotten? "Top Secret!" should be anything but.Created in that dark period of time between "Airplane!" and the "Naked Gun" movies, "Top Secret!" is a gem of a flick given to us by the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker). These guys have obviously watched a lot of spy films, Elvis films and at least one or two Swedish films. Every convention, cliche' and possible double entendre is mercilessly dissected and delved into head first. If you love any of the aforementioned genres, this is definitely one to seek out: you'll bust a gut!Kilmer is dead-on as Nick Rivers (his dad thought of the name while he was shaving), a crooning teen sensation the Germans think would be great to invite to their country to entertain while they plan the downfall of the rest of the world. Of course, they don't count on Nick Rivers falling in love with Hillary Flammond (Gutteridge), daughter of a famous scientist (Gough) being held by the Germans. They also don't figure on him becoming a member of the French Underground, singing such classics as "Share this Night with Me", "Straighten the Rug" and "Skeet Surfin'" or trying to pass himself off as Mel Torme'.How can anyone not like this movie? The sight gags are inexhaustable, and so is the script, dispensing one-liners and quips at a blinding rate. My favorite scenes: the cartoon map of Germany, the park statue, the introduction of the resistance fighters, the entrances of Latrine, the scene where....Well, you get the idea.Ten stars. Tell the world: watch "Top Secret!"And find out what they really put in a prop room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the last great spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it can be argued that they are still being made, the 'spoof' movie really died a death in the 1990's. Recently, there have been tragedies such as Epic Movie (2007) and its various imitations, all of which were the cinematic equivalent of sticking your cock in a blender. They used to be the forte of comedic giants and legends such as Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and the Monty Python crew. David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams made perhaps the last great spoof in Top Secret!, a relentless parody of spy thrillers that seems unfairly forgotten in the wake of ZAZ's (Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker) more popular Airplane! (1980) and The Naked Gun (1988).With East Gemany planning an attack during a cultural festival, they invite American rock 'n' roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) to perform as a distraction for the audiences. Rivers, a sort of Beach Boys meets Elvis Presley, soon gets embroiled in the French resistance movement when he meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) who is searching for her missing father Dr. Paul (Michael Gough). Along with a group of misfit revolutionaries with various French pun's for names, and Hillary's lost-love Nigel (Christopher Villiers), they must break into the high-security prison where Dr. Paul is being held. Top Secret! is a film of such effortless hilarity, it's a wonder how and why the three directors behind it parted ways and made such drivel as Jane Austen's Mafia! (1998), Rat Race (2001) and Scary Movie 3 (2003), highlighting just how much they needed each other. It offers near to non-stop sight-gags that vary from the inspired (a train station pulling away from the train) to the downright ridiculous (a character gets crushed in a car then is seen later with his arms and legs sticking out of it, still alive), nearly all of which hit the mark. But there's also clever word play, and that lost art - embracing the stereotype. Would a film nowadays get away with calling it's only black character Chocolate Mousse? There are literally too many funny scenes to mention, but the one that had me in stitches is the scene in which Nigel and Du Quois (Harry Diston) dress up as the rear and front of a cow, when a real cow comes to suck on its udders, much to the pleasure of Nigel. They stop, with Du Quois insisting they make haste, and Nigel replies "you're always in such a bloody hurry!". It's marvellously old-school, headed by a wonderful performance from Kilmer, who as well as getting plenty of belly laughs himself, also proves himself to be a bloody good dancer in the few performance scenes he has. But it is also a sad reminder of just how good this sub-genre used to be.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Silly Can You Get!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lots of fun in this shambling parody of a dozen different genres, mainly those in which the good espionage agent is sent into enemy territory to rescue an imprisoned scientist, climb fortress walls, outwit the Gestapo, uncover a spy in the midst of the resistance movement, slaughter innumerable Germans, make love to a beautiful woman, and do Elvis impressions.Some of the gags are pretty inventive. A giant telephone looms in the foreground of the shot and when it rings a man in the distance marches up to it and picks up -- a giant phone. A man falls off the wall of a fortress and does one of those carefully times head-over-heel flips that stunt people have perfected and when he hits the ground, he shatters because the figure is made of pottery.Others come across as rather too extended. At least a minute is given over to a scene in a bookshop -- one take -- that's filmed backwards and has the dialog backwards as well. It's funny, but it must have taken a long time to get the whole thing right. Every backward movement must be timed perfectly. Eons, geological epochs must have come and gone during rehearsals. Dynasties rose and fell. And the novelty is worn off as soon as we get the joke, which is about ten seconds into the skit.And one Elvis number would have been enough for me, but I had to sit through three -- I think. Maybe it was four.Val Kilmer is very pretty but acts as if he can't act. Later, when he was over the top of that cinematic arc, he turned in a splendid performance in "Heat." He does, however, capture Elvis's kinesics very well. Not that they're at all suggestive. No, no. As The King himself put it, "I don't make no dirty body movements." Best male performance in a slightly-better-than-average comedy: Jeremy Kemp as the German General Streck. He's absolutely marvelous with that pocked face and thick neck and built-in sneer. His German accent is convincing too.The object of the parody gets a little mixed up at times. The East Germans are all dressed like Nazis from World War II. And they act and speak accordingly. But of course East Germany at the time was under the domination of the Soviet Union and was dying from an excess of communism. Still, the Germans are always good when you need a villain. It seems that we've never been able to forgive them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great spoof roughly following the plot of the 1944 classic "The Conspirators" starring Hedy Lamarr. Some scenes are copied directly and others have hilarious extras thrown in, but most are pure genius created by masterminds of comedy. Val Kilmer plays an all-too-sexy parody of the likes of Elvis Presly and the Beach Boys while narrowly escaping Nazis and fighting for freedom. This film may not be as good as some others of Abrahams', such as Airplane! or Hot Shots!, but like them, it is guaranteed to leave you on the floor struggling to breathe as laughter consumes your body. I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't afraid of being entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top Secret seems to have little place in the Zuckers/Abraham/Zuckers team's career. It does not seem to be as successful as other films of theirs. In fact, it seems wedged right in between the extremely well respected Airplane! and its sequel and the Naked Gun series. Everyone has seen all five of those films, but only those who have caught it on Comedy Central seem to have seen Top Secret. I don't know why it occupies such a low tier. I believe that it is at least as funny as the classics Airplane! and The Naked Gun, if not a bit above them. There is one hilarious sequence after another with a few misses, but what are you going to do? All of these types of films hit and miss with their jokes, and Top Secret hits with about 90% of its jokes. Who could forget the Skeet Surfing song at the beginning? Who could forget the bull sequence? Or how about the ballet sequence? The underwater cowboy fight sequence? Oh, and, probably its most well remembered sequence, the backwards-Swedish sequence, a marvel in film history. I give Top Secret a 9/10, the same that I gave both Airplane! and The Naked Gun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the clever, comical writing that makes the Zucker Bros. films worth watching, and although watered down a tad bit, TOP SECRET! still carries the fine tradition. Noteworthy are Val Kilmer's singing acts and the looney German National Anthem. The last 20 minutes delivered the fun-filled goodies, as the most of the movie had little that was original and slapstick compared to AIRPLANE!, which remains my valid choice. Good thing it was void of any strong profanity, although there had to be something here that would make any comedy a bit trashed. But I can't stand that "Tutti Frutti" much longer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick Rehearsal !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This round (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker) and (David Zucker) made nothing but a bunch of jokes on the war movies, which didn't hold together as a whole movie. I wished that the parody's most famous team would present something more solid and effective than these desultory weak sketches. True that there was an ambitious intention, but the final outcome was purely deficient. The plot line is thinner than a thread. Most of the gags are juvenile. There are some comic moments that manipulate the cinematic medium for just the manipulation (the bar fight under the water, the library scene played backwards), without at least real laughs along the way. Choosing (Val Kilmer) was a big hole to a ship with already many holes. He had such a stiff face, which didn't fit comedy (or in fact anything !). The supposedly comic lines were delivered miserably by him.Speaking of which, if you noticed well, you would discover that the-stiff-face choice was kind of a habit of the (Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker). From (Val Kilmer) in (Top Secret! ? 1984), to (Charlie Sheen) in (Hot Shots! ? 1991) and (Hot Shots! Part Deux ? 1993), ending with (Jay Mohr) in (Jane Austen's Mafia! ? 1998) !!! Maybe the studio used to demand a young handsome guy as a lead, whether had a talent for comedy or not ! Sure (Leslie Nielson), a regular ? and better ? face in that team's movies, wasn't always satisfying for the producers as only handsome guy (young age beats talent is an old Hollywood story !).2 things live from this movie : its actively ironic spirit out of the movies' exposed tricks, along with few marginal jokes. It's not a perfect movie in the first place; just a quick rehearsal for (Hot Shots 2) later. After parodying the 1940s and 1950s war movies in (Top..), they would parody the 1970s and 1980s war movies in (Hot..). Btw, character actor (Miguel Ferrer) was in the 2 movies, playing nearly the same role. The only difference was that the last one was more funny and more like a movie as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the spoof films the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams have made, This one sticks out as the sore thumb. With the success of 1980's "Airplane", They tried to recapture the magic in "Top Secret" to no avail. I watched the opening sequence with Shotgun toting surfers riding the waves to the tune of "Skeet Surfin" sure the rest of the film would be just as good. I was wrong. The film just wasn't funny. Granted, There were some silly moments but the writing just didn't measure up, The timing was off and the direction lacking. Maybe it was the premise of mixing a 1950's rock and roll star in a cold war setting that was the mistake as their later films such as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots" proved the genre can be successful if done properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am probably suspicious to say anything about this film, since that i really dislike the parody genre, but frankly that one is awful even for that genre. Jesus. It's so dull and repetitive that almost walked out. I mean, obviously there was a gag or two that inevitably made me laugh, specifically the cows scene, but apart of that scene, the rest is garbage. The story is totally disjointed and confuse, even for a spoof film. Some of the references are not funny at all, and i am familiar with the WW2 'spy' sub-genre. Val Kilmer's debut couldn't be any worse. He tries to be funny, but his acting limitations were evident here. Being funny is not something easy, anyways. Omar Sharif was, despite his relatively short screen-time, in the most dumbest and ridiculous gags in the film. I didn't want to believe that the guy who played the protagonist so masterfully in Dr. Zhivago was in that dumb film. After 90 minutes of childish and crude sexual jokes, you probably will think: What did i just watch? Because it's really impressive: but not in a good way.Avoid it. 3.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all sounds like some bad movie. And it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoof movies, which parody some existing film or genre, have a long history (several of the British "Carry On" series fall into this category), but they were particularly popular in the seventies and eighties, the period which saw some of Mel Brooks' finest work such as "Blazing Saddles" (which parodies the Western) and "High Anxiety" (the films of Alfred Hitchcock) as well as the likes of "Naked Gun" (cop thrillers), "Airplane!" (disaster movies) and "The Big Bus" (ditto)."Top Secret!" is another film of this type. It tells the story of Nick Rivers, an American rock star who travels to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival but while there becomes involved in espionage and in a plot by the East German regime to sink the entire NATO fleet. He meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond and helps her to rescue her father, a brilliant scientist being held by the regime and forced against his will to build the deadly mine which will be used in the attack. We are informed that the name Hillary is German for "She Whose Bosoms Defy Gravity", a piece of information of dubious veracity but one that seems appropriate to the striking Lucy Gutteridge. (Less so, perhaps, to America's current Secretary of State).In their efforts Nick and Hillary have the assistance of the French Resistance. (You can tell they are French because of their accents and because they all have names like "Déj? Vu", "Escargot" and "Chocolate Mousse"). Now anyone with even a token knowledge of history might ask what the French Resistance are doing in 1980s East Germany (a country apparently still ruled by the Nazis), but this is one of those films which are made both by and for those whose knowledge of European history, geography, culture and politics is somewhat less than token. (In other words for about 90% of the US market). I could fill my entire review with a list of goofs (about the only thing they get right is the distinctly unfeminine looks of the East German women's athletics squad), but there would be little point as the film-makers are clearly not aiming for an accurate portrayal of life in the German Democratic Republic, any more than Mel Brooks intended "Blazing Saddles" to be a true-to-life picture of the Old West. Spoof movies are not generally the place to go if you are looking for factual accuracy.Spoof movies are, however, normally regarded as one of the places to go to if you are looking for laughs, and this is unfortunately a department in which "Top Secret" is sadly lacking. It is a parody that never knows what it is supposed to be parodying. It starts off as an obvious parody of spy films, both of the James Bond type as well as of more serious offerings such as "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold", but with the introduction of the Resistance it turns into a spoof of war films, especially those set in Nazi-occupied Europe. (There are obvious references to "Casablanca" and the motorcycle scene from "The Great Escape"). The fact that Nick is a rock star also allows the film-makers to aim at Elvis films and sixties beach movies (surely a rather outdated target by 1984). Bizarrely, at one point it even turns into a satire on the Brooke Shields version of "The Blue Lagoon", a film so bad as to be beyond parody, and ends with a blatant reference to "The Wizard of Oz".One of the faults of "The Big Bus" was its scattergun approach, aiming at too many targets and missing most of them, but "Top Secret" is even worse; it aims at even more targets and misses all of them. There are some occasionally funny visual gags, but most of the jokes are either feeble, corny or tasteless. (Man being raped by a bull, Nick's manager and his "anal intruder"). To describe the plot as "nonsense" would be to credit it with more coherence than it actually possesses.There is one memorable line. At one point, after recounting her highly improbable life history to Nick, Hillary says, "It all sounds like some bad movie". You said it, girl, you said it. I couldn't have put it better myself. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Top Secret" makes a goofy parody on the popular spy movies of the 1940's combining with some of the humor of the 1980's, and it's so dated that can only cause one or two haha's in the audience. Won't even bother detailing the messy plot. Really. Not funny. Maybe two or three jokes. That's it.Charismatic as usual, Val Kilmer delivers some fun while his leading lady has some appeal but we never heard from her again, so who cares; Michael Gough is the coolest guy of the film playing a scientist while Peter Cushing, in one of his final roles, is outrageously reduced to a part that consists of speaking in another language pretending to be German and you don't have a clue of what's he saying (at least in the version I've watched, I don't know if there's something understandable about his character). One of the main reasons I didn't enjoyed this is probably my current dislike in brainless movies that makes parodies on another movies. There's so much of them now, like Aaron Seltzer's flicks (I don't even bother in watch them, but every time I'm bombarded with more and more trailers of their upcoming projects), they're not funny anymore, and this one was quite sleepy, tedious, with few good parts (only the sexual jokes work). The ZAZ trio (Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker) at one time was the greatest team to make such movies and they were very good, being "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun" their biggest comical efforts. "Top Secret" is a big disappointment that consists of giving objects random purposes, characters falling to pieces like a jar crashing on the floor and ruthless scenes that don't cause any kind of amuse on us.And please, answer me this: in what year the story takes place? Everything looks so 1940's, Nazi German, but then there's this rock idol (Kilmer) who sings surf rock from the 1960's and there's devices and cultural references of the 1980's. It's so bloody confusing. Why bother, anyway? Endure for one hour and a half into a pile of wasted things is something to be treasured here and I don't suggest you to look for this. Comedies must accomplish more than a dozen of cheap laughters. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Zucker/Abrams/Zucker film that parodies WW2 and Elvis films, has Val Kilmer as Nick Rivers, a rock and roll singer who founds himself drawn into the French Resistance while performing a concert in East Germany. Chaulk this up to yet another watchable but overrated Kilmer film akin to "the Doors", "Real Genius", or "Pollock" as opposed to the handful of REAL good movies he's done. The problem is while the jokes are as rapid-fire and humorous as any other ZAZ spoof, the characters don't have the likabilty that they show in "Airplane" or the first Naked Gun film. In the commentary track they almost seem apologetic, well I wouldn't go as far as thinking that they should apologize for this film (Scary Movie 3 however they SHOULD be sorry for) My Grade: CDVD Extras: Commentary by Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker &amp; Jerry Zucker, Producers Jon Davison &amp; Hunt Lowry and Moderator Fred Rubin:; 4 Alternate Scenes; 3 Storyboard sequences; Theatrical Trailer Easter Egg: In the Storyboards menu highlight the magnifying glass for the Bookstore scene unreversed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me a while to figure out why this movie is so painfully boring, while very similar films such as AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN are hilarious.The whole point of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker brand of zany, off-the-wall humor is to confound audience expectations. This was easiest, of course, in AIRPLANE!, when most people went into the theater unfamiliar with Z-A-Z. However, even in the later NAKED GUN (and the POLICE SQUAD! TV series), when everyone knew what to expect, Z-A-Z set up certain expectations by making it a parody of cop shows and effectively establishing the "cop show" feel. The jokes naturally arise from the very familiar cop-show situations and turn those situations on their heads. In TOP SECRET!, by contrast, the idea seems to be to give the audience *precisely* what they are expecting--wacky jokes.As a parody, the film fails utterly. Trying to "do" three different genres completely prevents them from establishing a specific genre feel which then leads naturally to the jokes. Instead, Z-A-Z just throw a bunch of jokes up on screen, because they know that's what the audience wants. And it simply doesn't work, because the jokes aren't *about* anything. It certainly doesn't help that they're also mostly unfunny and uninspired.4/10.</fullReview>

This one is a meaningless assembly of gags, most of which aren't even good. If you are looking for a good parody of WWII movies, then go and watch the TV series 'Allo, Allo' which was also filmed in the 80-ies. Now that is what I call a good parody, and it is hilarious!All in all, Top Secret! is a waste of time.

		<fullReview>How could the creators of Airplane and Airplane II follow up these great films with this dud?!? This is a mostly unfunny film. Shortly after I started watching the video, I was inclined to turn it off out of sheer boredom. However, I KNEW it must get better, so I waited, and waited, and waited. It never provided an eventual payoff and I realized I had wasted all this time for nothing.Even for an Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker film, the plot was hard to follow and confusing. This was good in Airplane but in this case the movie just looked like the script had never been completed. And the jokes looked like they had never been tested out to see if they were actually funny (such as skits involving sex with cows and the use of an "anal intruder"--both very crude but just not funny in any way). My advice? See the Airplane films again or the Hot Shots movies--they provide more laughs in the first 5 minutes than Top Secret had in the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a well-known saying that "sarcasm is the lowest form of humour". I disagree. I think it is spoof movies. This pathetic film is a prime example. The pitiful "jokes" can be seen a mile off and it is truly as bad as the likes of 'Airplane' and 'Hot Shots' etc.If it's low brow laughs you're after, then try a Farrelly brothers film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not very much as I expected. This movie has no action, no trace of it....It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, well this is not - it' s very not funny indeedThe plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for "Airplane", "The Kentucky Fried Movie", and the "Naked Gun" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody!I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the "Hotel Gay Schluffen", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him finally!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If "Top Secret!" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means "She whose bosoms defy gravity"?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I got enough of guessing if the humor in this movie is voluntary, or involuntary. Some may call it a parody, but the only parody is the claim of the authors that they know anything about film making. They certainly have no clue about geography, history, the difference between Communism and Fascism (East Germany was more anti-fascist than its Western counterpart, guys!) and less of all about cinema. The only humor may be related to some US TV comedy jokes, but this is mostly lost 18 years after the making of the movie, or was lost from the beginning for the non-US audiences.Skip this precursor of the parody about films genre when you meet it at the movie rentals. 4/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>
