		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece. Amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days has got to be one of my absolute favorite films of all time. To me, it's a film that balances story, characters and atmosphere better than just about any other. It's truly a great work of art, and a very, very underrated one. The best thing about it is how Allen's love for his subject, the romantic nostalgia he feels, translates so eloquently to the screen. You've also got to hand it to the cast. Diane Weist, Julie Kavner, Mia Farrow, Josh Mostel, a briefly-glimpsed Jeff Daniels, and a young Seth Green all give great performances that are right out of the period, yet instantly recognizable. Allen had Santo Loquasto, his art director, do a bang-up job on creating the world of early-1940s Rockaway, New York, and Jeffrey Kurland's costumes help immensely. Particularly note-worthy is Carlo Di Palma's stunning cinematography. The colours, the smoky nightclubs and soundstages, the dimly-lit nighteries and the dazzling rooftop set come to life like few sets do in films. And then there's the music. That dazzling array of classic music, from one of the best periods for it in American history. Allen's decision to use only music from that time might sound cliche, but he's definatly justified here. And there's always the Radio Show Themes piece by Dick Hyman (I'm always by that name) that accompanies many of the scenes. That piece of music alone is worth seeing the film. As you can probably tell, I love this film simply for the fact that it's such a charming, enchanting, beautiful film. It's one I'd show my children, even the nude dancing scene, had I any children to show it to. Woody Allen's turn in the films he's made lately (as of 2003) are, to me, pretty depressing and perverse, with none of the charm, life and humor that works like Radio Days symbolize, Sweet and Lowdown notwithstanding. Hopefully, more films like this gem are on the horizon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shouts one word: WARMTH. The colors, the plot, the characters, they are all wonderfully warm.I've watched this movie with senior citizens who were around in the forties. I once watched it with a Jewish guy who grew up on Long Island (albeit in the early 30's, not the 40's). All comments were the same: THIS was life in New York during wartime.Vietnam was my war, so this era was a mystery to me. However, any time a genius like Woody Allen can create a film that not only makes me and my rowdy friends laugh, but gets guffaws from my dear old Mom as well, it deserves a little fanfare.I didn't even mention the solid gold music.See this film at once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's own "Amarcord"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days (1987)- written, directed, and narrated by Allen:What a beautiful, kind, gentle, ironic, warm, sentimental (in a very good way and yes, I am talking about Woody Allen's movie, that's right) yet perfectly balanced delight. It is a series of sketches about young Joe (young Allen, of course, played by Seth Green - that was a surprise), an adolescent in Brooklyn, NY during 1930s-1940s who was passionately in love with radio which was a king. The film is a tribute to the magical radio days and the myths and legends about radio personalities, the memory of a grown man who never forgot where he came from, the love letter to his always fighting and arguing ("I mean, how many people argue over oceans?") but loving relatives and a very funny comedy (the way only Allen's comedy can be). It is the film where pretty like a doll and painfully naive Sally (Mia Farrow) asks who Pearl Harbor is? Where gorgeous Diane Keaton sings and Diane Wiest, his beloved Aunt Bea never gives up hope of one true love. He never told us if she found it..."I never forgot that New Year's Eve when Aunt Bea awakened me to watch 1944 come in. I've never forgotten any of those people or any of the voices we would hear on the radio. Though the truth is, with the passing of each New Year's Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer."The Radio days are gone but thanks to Allen, the voices of the times passed are still clear and sound and they always will be.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Piece Of Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for the normal amount of big laughs from a Woody Allen film, then you will be disappointed here. It's not that kind of film.I was anything but disappointed, but I knew what the film was all about before I saw it. Actually, what drew me to it was that I had read where this was a wonderful visual film, filled with rich colors and great set designs. It did not let me down. This is a great visual tribute to the 1940s, to be exact from 1938 to 1944. A real treat for the eyes.The story centers around a Jewish family in Queens and the importance that radio shows had in that day-and-age. Also profiled in here are some of those radio performers.It does have laughs but not as many as the normal Allen movie because the idea of this is simply to be a nostalgic piece, mainly Allen's tribute to his own family days of growing up, what it was like around his house.It was interesting to see Seth Green playing Woody as a youngster with flaming red hair. The most interesting person, however, was Diane Wiest who played a man-chasing sister-in-law. The film gives you a real flavor of the period, of New York and of a Jewish family.Overall, it's simply a nice film....and gorgeous to look at. Sometimes I think some of Allen's work is overrated but, boy, here is one that is definitely underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody's Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful wonderful movie that exemplifies the phrase, "misty watercolored memories." It is a joy to watch and listen to. The era before and during WWII, however, was anything but wonderful. Radio Days presents a time when America was dealing with the Great Depression and its after effects and the horrible event that was World War II. Since the man narrating the memories was only a boy then, it is altogether fitting and proper that he see things as a child; for as he states in one scene, "our conversation turned from Nazis to more important things,like girls." No movies, except this one, that I recall, are able to deal with this critical age in American history without conveying the tragic time that it was.I would like to think this family was really Woody Allen's, but it is probably a work of fiction, like his other pieces. But how tremendous that he can create (or remember) these people. As I watched it, one thought that kept recurring was that these were not "beautiful" manufactured people like we see in the media today; they had big hips and were fat and poor and... and none of that mattered. They were real. They were believable. You can't watch this movie without wondering what happened to them, did Aunt Bee find a husband? You cared about this family and personally, I wished they were mine.The vignettes were sad and sweet. My favorite was poor departed Kirby Kyle; at least he had heart! And Leonard; and "donations for the promotion of a state in Palestine." So many memories that make us a part of a family most people never had. The viewer belongs to this warm and loving group.Something has been lost with the concept of "nuclear family," with the lonely big houses and empty hours and unshared hopes and sorrows. Radio Days reminds us that having someone to experience life with is a treasure and a blessing, despite whacks on the head, martians, and fish, "That man always brings home fish!" And oh, the music!This is Woody Allen's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recollecting Can Be Meaningful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I was being original when I made the connection between Woody Allen's "Radio Days" and Federico Fellini's "Amarcord," but I was being naive. The parallels are so transparent it is of no surprise that most of the IMDB reviewers (and I imagine those others as well) caught the similarity.And it's a good similarity - "Radio Days" is as successful in transporting the viewer to a different place and time as "Amarcord" was. It also cements my conclusion that Woody Allen is the only director who "spoofs" great art films and artistic styles, confirmed by his tributes to Ingmar Bergman and German Expressionists.All that aside, "Radio Days" is, second of all, a look at Allen's childhood memories weaved together by radio. It's the story of his family (his large and extended family and neighborhood personages), their likes, dislikes, relationships and favorite radio shows. They are inextricably connected as genetic members of a family, but also more intangibly linked by radio broadcasts, to which they listen to individually as well as collectively. They have favorite songs and shows - each favorite reflecting the personality of a given character. They also share great love for one another, though they quibble like all human beings do. In fact, that tender quibbling, love and loss and understanding is what makes Allen's characters come to life so successfully - no wonder he speaks of them with warmth.What "Radio Days" is about first of all and foremost, is nostalgia. The film would only be a heartwarming family tale and nothing more if it were not "recollected" by Woody Allen, the narrator. His role in the film (in which he never physically appears) is that of a story-teller. He transports the audience to his memories consciously, mixing present reflections with the unadulterated spirit of his memories. And it is he, not the characters in the film as much, who experiences the nostalgia, the central theme of "Radio Days."In narrating his memories, Allen is able to distance himself from them temporally. He is telling a tale that borders on fantasy, such as that on whose form nostalgic memories take place. There is a bittersweet yearning for the past and a realization that memories must inevitably fade, change, yield to time's destructiveness. Re-telling them not only reveals how one thinks life once was (usually painted over with warmth and pleasantness), but also oneself and the knowledge that these times are no longer physically accessible. How we recollect our past tells us of us as much as it does of the past. In "Radio Days" that past is warm and Allen's yearning for that warmth and childish innocence is what pervades the film so well giving it its nostalgic quality.And nostalgia, the film seems to suggest, is a feeling worth experiencing. If one can glance back at his life and feel a longing towards the past, a warmth emanating from his memories, then he remembers life as having been kind to him. Even if the details flee from the mind (as they inevitably do) and only the feelings inspired by hazy memories remain. And that, if nothing else, is not only comforting, but also meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wistful, Sweet, and Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RADIO DAYS is one of Woody Allen's most underrated comedies, a fond look back to the days of radio and its effects on his family.Set against long-forgotten radio programs, hit songs, and the coming of World War II, we get two narrative threads. The Rockaway family dealing with everyday issues in a series of vignettes, and the fictional life of Sally White (Mia Farrow) as she rises from cigarette girl to glittering radio star.The cast is excellent. Farrow has a solid role as the Brooklyn girl with the Judy Holliday voice who battles her way toward upward mobility. Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker are terrific as the parents. Dianne Wiest is sweet as Aunt Bea, always on the lookout for true love. Seth Green plays Woody as a kid. Diane Keaton and Kitty Carlisle show up as singers. Josh Mostel and Renee Lippin are hilarious as the aunt and uncle. Wallace Shawn has a funny bit as the "Masked Avenger." Other notables include Richard Portnow as Si, Kenneth Mars as the rabbi, Larry David as the crazed neighbor, Jeff Daniels and William H. Macy as radio actors, Tony Roberts as the game show host, Danny Aiello as the gangster, and a special kudo for the hilarious Gina DeAngelis as his mother.Highlights include Bea's date on the night of Orson Welles' famous radio program about a Martian invasion, and the poignant episode about the live radio coverage of a girl who's fallen down a well. The film also takes nostalgic looks at radio serials, quiz programs, and comedy shows.The film perfectly captures the middle class neighborhood of Allen's youth. The interiors are beautifully done (Santo Loquasto), and very memorable is the awe-inspiring visit to Radio City Music Hall with its dimmed lights, lush carpets, and warm red-and-gold tones.There is also a parade oh hit songs of the day that include "September Song," "Tico Tico," "Mairzy Doats," "South American Way," "Pistol Packin' Mama," "If I Didn't Care," and so many others.A final word for the many actors and actresses in small parts who make this movie feel so right. Many have walk-ons or have only a line or two but they add the perfect touch and help recreate Woody Allen's beloved New York City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, waddaya know, Woody does have a heart after all . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preface, let me say that I was born at the tail-end of the "golden age of radio," but just in time to experience a touch of its magic and the hold it had on households night after night in that pre-TV era. Add to that a favorite aunt who had worked in radio for years on the West Coast and who regaled her nephew with story upon story, which in turn led to the years I later spent in radio (luckily, prior to the "formula radio" days). It all adds up to my absolutely having to go see "Radio Days" when it first came out, despite the fact that I'd never been the world's foremost Woody Allen fan. Too much of his work, for me, lacked that indefinable but oh so recognizable element of "heart."Well, I was wrong about Woody. This film shows it.Autobiographical -- or perhaps semi-autobiographical -- in nature, "Radio Days" evokes the time when people returned "to those thrilling days of yesteryear," and for whom, quite probably, it was equally thrilling to contemplate the magic of a box in their living room that could cause them to "watch" the stories unfold in their minds. "Remotes," or on-the-spot broadcasts transported them to the scene of unfolding tragedies or triumphs in a way that newspapers never could (and which TV, for all its advantages, rarely matches).And yet the film, for all its authenticity in recreating studio practices (watch, for example, how the actors drop completed script pages onto the floorrather than turning them and risking a tell-tale rustle of paper), isn't really so much about radio itself as it is about the people who listened, as personified by one raucous, cantankerous and loving Brooklyn family. Beautifully evoked, particularly by Julie Kavner (Mother), Michael Tucker (Father), and the incomparable Dianne Wiest (as the perenially lovelorn Aunt Bea), it is their reactions to what they hear on the radio -- whether listening breathlessly to the war news (at a time when the end result was anything but certain) or Bea's abandonment in the middle of nowhere by a panicked suitor as Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" broadcast takes hold -- that bring to life the era and the power of that medium.Standouts? The whole cast is perfect, but for me, in addition to those previously mentioned, I have to cit Mia Farrow's portrayal of the dim-bulbed Sally White, who transforms herself with the aid of speech lessons into a radio personality. (For that matter, catch Danny Aiello as a less-than-brilliant hitman, particularly his scenes with Dina DeAngeles as his mom.)Criticisms? One: At the end of a poignant scene in which young Joe has finally discovered what his dad does for a living, Allen insists on falling into some standby "schtick" in his voiceover. (I guess he couldn't resist; thankfully, it doesn't ruin the moment.)Ultimately, of course, it is the era itself that this film celebrates. Faithfully, and lovingly, it is recreated with a skill that points up its absurdities at the same time it makes one hopefully nostalgic. And, if you're not very careful, you wind up falling hopelessly in love with this funny, obscure Brooklyn family.And to the end of my days, I'll always wonder whether poor Aunt Bea ever did find her "Mr. Right" . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody's best " memory" piece has great set designs, a sad and funny script and the usual great, well chosen cast, including a very young Seth Green playing Allen as a boy. Diane Wiest and Julie Kavner excel strongly in the female leads, Allen's voice narrates the whole picture, and Mia Farrow squeaks deliciously as a bimbo cigarette girl who gets a culture make-over. This is the only Allen movie that both Farrow and Diane Keaton appear in (she has a very brief cameo singing a song in a night club.) The final scene on top of the roof is almost bittersweet, altho it is nice to see a landscape filled with wide eyed people, before the world was dominated by television. The story becomes even more poignant as you age. Watch it repeatedly over different stages of your life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully nostalgic, funny and historically interesting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Radio Days is right up there with Annie Hall though it's different in that it's following several people's lives. Woody doesn't act in this, but his narration is excellent.He takes the wonderful old songs and commercials from that time and weaves them into the story. I was completely captivated.It's not a "laugh a minute" type film, but it also gets you thinking. Nevertheless, it has some hilarious scenes. Check out the Jewish fasting holiday scene. I've watched it at least 6 times and I still laugh. Also the scene with Mia Farrow's character was superb. One of my favorite lines is when she tells a top radio producer in her high-pitched nasal voice, "Jeez. We can't keep meeting like this. In the backs of cars, movie theaters and stalled elevators. You're gonna lose your respect for me!" I love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Woody Resurrected the Radio Star" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could use one word that perfectly describes the effect Woody Allen's "Radio Days" had on me, with no hesitation, I would say: magical. I am a kid of the 80's, too young to be classified among the TV generation but too old to have grown up with the DVD, I guess it puts me in the VHS generation. But don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to label demographic groups through media ... the point is simply that the era Woody Allen paid tribute to through this film, is not mine, not even my parents', but while watching the film and its succession of irresistible vignettes, I had the strange feeling as if I lived it, and in my turn, I felt nostalgic ? that is the magic of "Radio Days", one of Woody Allen's very best.Woody Allen made an excellent transition from slapstick to comedy drama, somewhere between the late 70's and the early 80's, but rarely has a director been so prolific in one decade. The 80's were probably to Allen what the 50's were to Hitchcock, and the filmography is quite impressive. "Zelig", "Broadway Danny Rose", "The Purple Rose of Cairo", three great films, followed by what will be considered Allen's masterpiece "Hannah and Her Sisters". Indeed, after 1986, I guess Allen could have comfortably seated in his throne after having reached the perfection, "Hannah" was his closest film to his idol Ingmar Bergman, just like "Interiors" but this time with the 'Allen-ian' comedic touch everyone expected. I seriously believe that after "Hannah", Woody was relieved from an obligation, which could allow him to make something more personal, and less 'ambitious'. And this is how he brought that cinematic little gem that stood the test of time and revealed to be one of his most endearing films."Radio Days" is not a film in the strictest sense, it's more an assemblage of little episodes, each one relating a generally amusing anecdote about the Radio. From the opening, the mood of the film is set, with the two burglars who win a 'guess the tune' contest. The movie couldn't have had a better start, and never the cheerful and tender tone of the film ever desert it. Woody Allen is the narrator of these episodes where we meet his family, neighbors, classmates, teacher, rabbi, and of course, the Radio stars..Why should we ask for more after all, aren't we entitled to watch a film just to spend a nice moment, and end with a positive feeling? "Radio Days" is a feel-good film not just because of the mood, but also in the way it relieves our minds from the idea of having to follow a plot, it's a film made of stories but not 'a story', only a succession of nostalgic vignettes.Of course, there are some characters' arcs: Mia Farrow as the unforgettable ill-fated Sally White, the running gags with Aunt Bea's men, the history of America in the background with the 'Pearl Harbor' episode and the many mentions of the war, these elements of continuity solidify the structure of the narrative, through the succession of funny anecdotes that paint a beautiful time-capsule capturing the spirit of a lost era. The film is not without a certain melancholy ... as time goes by, we understand that this colorful gallery of characters will fade into oblivion. So we take our time to savor those last moments and enjoy the cameos of Woody Allen's regulars, including Tony Roberts, another lost friend from the 70's. "Radio Days" is a succession of homage within homage, and the art-direction, the colors, the decorations are so neat that we're constantly inhabited by the era's atmosphere.And if I had to keep one image from this film, and which is probably my favorite moment from any Woody Allen's film, it's probably the "South American Way" dancing and singing along with the radio. Why this particular scene? Because I think it summarizes the spirit of "Radio Days", ordinary people, played by unknown faces, transcending their everyday setting and using their imagination to be transported in a sunny world made of brightness, joy and shining colors, a pleasure shared when the two men dance along with the cousin Ruthie. It's simple, funny, but for some reason, extremely touching. And it works for me, on a more personal level, as it was that tune that I heard once on TV, as a kid, when I first knew about Woody Allen. It's my personal nostalgia of the film, and finally, it's just a damn good scene.And always respectful to his audience, Allen punctuates the film with more serious moments. You all know, which one I'm talking about ? The 'Polly Phelps' episode that takes us in the middle of a crazy Konga, totally by surprise, and leads to a particularly dark epilogue that proves that emotions didn't need a screen, even a voice could grab people's hearts and inspire their empathy. And it's also a reminder that "Radio Days" is not just about radio, it's about family, and the way the father was holding young Woody Allen in his arms said it all ? The film concludes in a bittersweet mood with the New Year party in the middle of the war, where we say good-bye to the two groups of protagonists, the radio stars on the building's roof, and Allen's family. Two families with two things in common: probably that in the 80's, when Woody made this film, most of them were already belonging to the past, and I guess this is the double homage Allen succeeded to do ...... and since the radio stars' voices faded more precociously than the shouts of his mom, the cries of his sister, and the noisy neighborhood, they indeed deserved this beautiful cinematic eulogy, this is the 'Woody Allen' way!</fullReview>

It is one of Diane Weist's best performances. She is one of Woody's favorite actress' especially when she appeared in Hannah and Her Sisters. Supporting cast superb; Josh Mostel extremely funny as Uncle Abe; and the cameos by old radio people were really enjoyable.I knew Diane Keaton sings but I didn't know how well until she did that number for New Year's Party.

		<shortDescription>those were the days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen fondly recalls that age before TV when radio was the nucleus around which family life revolved (and evolved). It's an affectionate (and, for Allen, atypically nostalgic) period piece, sketching with disarming humor the memories, anecdotes, and fantasies of an East Coast childhood in the 1930s and 1940s, narrated by the director himself and set against a collection of once-popular radio songs and programs. Television could never trigger such glowing memories, because TV numbs the imagination while the invisibility of the radio voice tends to enhance it. Allen includes plenty of jokes to that effect: the heroic Masked Avenger turns out, off microphone, to be the portly Wallace Shawn; the nonsense song Mairsie Doates recalls a neighbor brandishing a meat cleaver on a downtown rampage. The comedy is never more than feather-light, demanding nothing from its audience except uncomplicated laughter, but this is one filmmaker who has always been more effective on a smaller scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unique Woody Allen experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is incredible that Woody Allen can churn out so many movies and so many of them be such high quality and such good films. Radio Days is one of those films. It is unique and fun and has Woody Allen written all over it. The film is a nostalgic look at the golden age of radio during Allen's childhood as he reflects on the impact it had on his young life. The whole story is told in anecdotal form. There is a wide collection of stories, all related to radio broadcasts of the time as well as the great music that the time period spawned. The movie is short but is still a very good watch that provides a very unique and entertaining experience.As with most Woody Allen films, Radio Days is a one of a kind experience because of the way the story is told. Allen is a master at substituting conventional storytelling methods with his own unique storytelling flair. And he is able to do this without seeming pretentious or self important at all. He simply knows how to creative a narrative in any style he chooses. He keeps the story very interesting with his colorful cast of characters and the interesting things they go through. The film uniquely combines stories of fictional radio stars and fictional characters (which are obviously based heavily on Woody Allen's actual family) with actual stories of the time period. Obviously the film focuses a lot on World War II because it is set in the 40s. The time period, however, is solely established through the radio broadcasts our characters listen to. These actual broadcasts are used in certain places for humor and other places for somber dramatic effect. The film did a great job at combining funny with serious in all the appropriate places. There were moments when I would laugh out loud, as well as moments that sent a chill through my spine. It is a fascinating watch.Staying true to the Woody Allen experience, the dialouge in Radio Days is great. It is fast and chaotic, but also sophisticated and mature. The whole cast is very talkative and this is played up excellently. There are plenty of great characters with some wonderfully witty lines that put a smile on your face. The characters are all very different and very quirky. There are a lot of memorable people in this movie and some hilarious performances.This movie is a lot of fun, but it also has a clear motive. That motive is to respect the radio era and make sure that it is never forgotten. Allen clearly defines is it as an extremely important and culturally significant piece of technology in the time period. Allen plays up his jokes a great deal and the movie is very entertaining, but its main goal is to show that radio is something that should never be forgotten in the long history of technical innovations. All of Woody Allen's films have some sort of personal significance to him, but Radio Days displays a different kind of personal connection. Instead of being a film which reflects on Allen's relationship and his adult life, it takes us back to his childhood and reflects on the things that affected him there. Radio Days is an important watch, but it also very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video will never kill these radio stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something just surprisingly captivating and enchanting about Woody Allen's ode to the time when families gathered around their old radio sets for entertainment, news and company.Seth Green (in one of his earliest roles) plays the alter-ego of the narrator, someone reminiscing about the years he remembers with such fondness. It may not have been that way for everyone, what with reality encroaching on everything, but looking back through rose-tinted glasses is perfectly acceptable when thinking back to youthful endeavours (in my book, anyway).Written and directed by Allen (unsurprisingly), the film weaves a number of tales throughout while also focusing on the one particular family and the ups and downs they go through. There's no big plot line here, no major revelation or climax, but we do still get a structured piece that gets us to care about almost everyone on screen.With a cast including Julie Kavner, Mia Farrow, Dianne Wiest, Wallace Shawn, Danny Aiello, Larry David, Jeff Daniels and many others this is a delight for both fans of the silver screen and the radio itself.Deceptively simple, and simply flowing, the movie ends up drawing you in amongst the family and placing you alongside those listening out for their favourite stars, tunes and stories. It's quite a wonderful little film and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Medium Of Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some other reviewers seem to think that Woody Allen got his inspiration for Radio Days from foreign sources. I think his own childhood, similar to mine a half a generation later, was all he needed and for any further influence, he must have listened as I did to the radio ramblings of Jean Shepherd on WOR Radio back in the day.With the casting of young Seth Green as the protagonist and childhood Allen this was the start of a whole series of quirky roles he's played right up to this day. Allen has a good eye for detail and places that haven't changed too much since he was a child. The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was. One thing that certainly hadn't changed was the elephant house at the Prospect Park Zoo where young Seth Green and his parents Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner meet one of the Quiz Kids and his parents. An all together unsatisfactory experience all around.The film does not have any plot so to speak, it's simply a collection of stories from just before World War II and American entry into World War II. It was the height of American radio entertainment where all you needed was imagination. Radio as we see influenced young Green/Allen in direct and subtle ways as well. Television first became commercially popular in 1947 the year I made my earthly debut. But Allen's childhood was influenced by radio. You could believe anything if the actors were good enough. Young Mr. Green believed that Wallace Shawn was a superhero because of the radio.The technique of the film is like Jean Shepherd's The Christmas Story and his monologues on WOR were exactly like Radio Days, just a collection of loose ramblings about the things that Shepherd remembered from his childhood in the Midwest of Hammond, Indiana. Only the Jewish humor of Woody Allen makes it distinct from a Jean Shepherd radio show being made into a film.Woody cast his film well, but my absolute favorite was Dianne Weist as his lovelorn Aunt Bea, destined to be a spinster like another Aunt Bea from television. The poor woman was in love with love and constantly dating a real collection of losers that never quite cut the mustard.If you are a fan of Jean Shepherd's nostalgic humor and The Christmas Story, you will love Radio Days. You don't have to be Jewish, honestly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may be Woody's greatest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the joys of Woody Allen's movies is the sound track. If he loves anything more than film-making it is music. 'Radio Days' is a high tribute to the golden age of popular music, filled with great songs and dance tunes from the 30s and 40s. This music accompanies a very funny and nostalgic story of a family during WWII living in Far Rockaway, Long Island. 'Radio Day's is from what I think of as Woody Allen's middle period, following on his more raw-feeling early work and preceding his current period of what seem to me less- inspired writing, with casts who often seem too conscious that they are doing a 'Woody' film.During this great middle period, with films like 'Radio Days', 'Alice' and 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', he was graced with a fairly regular team of core actors who inhabit their roles so completely as to banish their own identities. Not an easy thing to do when an actress like Mia Farrow, so famous for so many years, can disappear so fully into the far-fetched characters Woody creates.As she did in 'Hannah and Her Sisters', 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', and 'Alice', Farrow displays her formidable gifts with dazzling effortlessness. She, along with Dianne Wiest and a sensational supporting cast, carry the viewer along on a fast-moving sentimental journey. Along with the laughs are a few tears, something that is not always evident in Allen's films. He blends these moments seamlessly into the over-all fabric of the film and the viewer never feels emotionally manipulated, the emotions well up naturally, adding depth to what might otherwise have been more akin to the 'Big Broadcast' movies of the 30s.Woody Allen stretches his leading ladies, especially, to the limits, and they are great. I think it is time for some enterprising producers to bring Ms Farrow and Ms Wiess back to the big screen. Their absence from the big screen is a crime. And given all the multi-million dollar, money-losing flops Hollywood continues to barf out, with a bunch of scrawny-assed, personality-less young celebs simulating sex, the return of some of the greats of 20 years ago might be just what the industry needs to get people back into the theaters.'Radio Days' is classic Woody at his most inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born and raised in Suburban Texas but this is one of my favorites.It is by no means a New York story that Non-New Yoikers can't understand and a lot of us Provincials resent the very provincial thinking of a few classless fools in the Big Apple. This is a delightful piece of fun. It is a joy to watch. The cast is put to superb use in this heartfelt tribute to the simple glorious joys of an ordinary childhood. Like most autobiographical works this film has a resonance that isn't present in other works. As Crooklyn is one of Spike Lee's best works so is this one of Woody Allen's best. The color is lushly aged and beautifully underscored with the delightfully nostalgic music of the forties airwaves. Even though I am only in my early fifties this film reminds me of that simpler time that perhaps never was. It shows a healthy family going though the most fascinating of all things, namely ordinary living. This is the kind of "reality" that should be on T.V. instead of the dreck the major networks are commiting financial suicide with. I watch this every time its on. Its one of those films that helps you understand how different and yet the same families are. If a person doesn't understand this film it's definitely a case of "something missing". The radio stories are the only fantastic aspect of the piece and they perfectly underscore the basic reality of the story. Movies like this, Meet Me in St. Louis, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I Remember Mama, Life with Father, and Crooklyn are essentials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a Woody Allen fan since the 1970s, when I was about 20, and this gem is one of his absolute best. Sweet, nostalgic, fall-down funny, wistful, at times remarkably poignant and sad...this Allen film has it all and shows the director at the top of his form. I have a soft spot for Dianne Wiest and she's fabulous here as the marriage-hungry Aunt Bea, whose terrible luck at chasing matrimony makes you wish you could push your favorite unmarried cousin her way. Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker also shine as the main set of parents in the piece, Mom &amp; Dad to Allen's childhood alter ego. I never had a family and relatives as neurotic and wild as this bunch in Brooklyn--but Allen almost makes me wish I had! Possibly his best work, and accessible to a wider audience than his usual showcases to angst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idealistic look at the past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not common for Woody to have made such a bright film, especially about childhood. Compare this to the home scenes in Annie Hall. Woody insists that his films are not based on his life, though he admitted in part that these are. I was born in the 80's. This time period is completely foreign to me. It is also very fascinating. I love jazz, I love the movies from this era, all my knowledge of it comes from movies. That is why I would call this my favorite Woody Allen movie, well, my favorite movie of all time really.For the entire 84 minutes of it's running time I am transported out of my life and set in this wonderfully ideal world of Rockaway. This movie also contains two of what I would call Woody's best shots. One the scene of the street and the ocean as Woody gives his "Forgive me if I tend to romanticize the past...." dialogue. The other is a pan across a dinner table to some beautiful music, I forget what song. This shot is so perfect, and I instantly care about these characters from those few seconds more than I can care about most characters from spending the whole movie with them. 10/10</fullReview>

To be quite honest with you, I don't either.I'm even younger than you are. Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) is a nostalgic look at those times.Mr Allen isn't seen in this movie, only heard.Seth Green plays in a way the young Woody Allen.Only that his name isn't Woody but Joe.This Jewish boy lives his life in New York under World War II.And listens to radio.The acting work is superb in this movie.Young Seth Green is excellent.Then there are names like Mike Starr (Burglar), Julie Kavner (Mother), Wallace Shawn (Masked Avenger), Dianne Wiest (Bea), Mia Farrow (Sally White), Larry David (Communist Neighbor), Danny Aiello (Rocco), Jeff Daniels (Biff Baxter), Mercedes Ruehl (Ad men), Diane Keaton (New Year's Singer) and William H. Macy (Radio actor).The movie is wonderfully written, by Mr. Allen naturally.This is a walk down the memory lane.A look at the past, at the 1940's, at the radio days.This is funny and sad movie filled with nostalgia, with memories of Woody Allen.At the end when there is the New Year's Eve, Woody says these words as the narrator; "with the passing of each New Year's Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Nostalgic Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first impression of Woody Allen, was of a nice, funny old man. That opinion has gone up and down over the years, but one thing remained the same. He's a genius. From his hilarious early comedies, to his later dramatic reflections on life, death and love, he showed his proficiency at all genres. In Radio Days, he tries his hand at a genre all directors get to sooner or later, a semi-autobiographical story. In this case, it's a nostalgic throwback to the days when radio was king, and the ways it affected everyone, in their own ways. The plot is simple. Joe is a young boy growing up in Rockaway Beach in the late 30's/early 40's. His family is a lovable collection of oddballs. Parents who argue about which ocean is better (the Pacific of course), an aunt who's sole purpose in life is to get married. An uncle who, everyday, brings back fish from his friends at the docks. Then there is Joe himself. He is a young boy, teetering on adulthood, who spends his days listening to the radio and watching for Nazi Submarines off the beach. The film itself is basically a collection of vignettes about a family and the one thing that ties them to the rest of the world, the radio. The film intersperses sequences of Woody's, sorry, Joe's family life with scenes of the radio celebrities that they loved so much. In particular, of cigar girl Sally, who rose up the ranks to become a radio star. Much of the films charm and magic comes from the scenes in which Woody Allen narrates. He easily navigates through the multiple vignette's, always with a smile and a joke. His passion for the radio shines through in every scene. You can always hear the sound of a radio in Joe's house, even when they leave the house, there's the car radio. I've always found that the main criticism's of the film are that the period it revokes has long been forgotten. My responses is that, yes, the golden age of radio has long been over. But did you have to be a teenager in California in 1962 to enjoy American Graffiti? Did you have to be a preteen in 1958 to enjoy Stand By Me? The answer is no. The whole draw of nostalgia is to remind you of better times, happier times. The point of nostalgia is to make you feel mournful that that era is over. Radio Days does just that.I have few actual criticism's about the film. Perhaps the vignette style gets old, maybe, but it couldn't have worked any other way. Perhaps the only thing I can say is not truly a criticism, but more of a testament to the films greatness. My only problem with Radio Days, is that it ends. Truly, I cannot sing a greater praise.Speaking of praise, this is the paragraph in which I endlessly gush about this film. The performances, Dianne Wiest as Joe's love struck aunt and Mia Farrow's aspiring cigar girl are two standouts, are terrific. Appearances from Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts and, of course, Woody Allen's excellent narration, add to the film's magic. The direction is spot on, and the sets are just magical. I must make special mention to the classy restaurant rooftop set, it contains a feeling of nostalgia for the grandiose sets of past Hollywood, something I haven't seen in a long time.The score is a medley of classic radio hits, the screenplay is just wonderful. I must make a comparison to The Purple Rose Of Cairo, another Woody Allen film, about the magic of movies. Radio Days and The Purple Rose of Cairo have a similar aspect, the magic of art, and it's power to transform our lives from the ordinary and mundane, to the fantastic and extraordinary. I apologize for running on for too long, I'll wrap it up. Radio Days may not be for everybody, but for anyone willing to give it a chance, you'll certainly have a big smile on your face by the time the end credits roll. That I guarantee. Radio Days 1987 Directed by Woody Allen Starring: Mia Farrow, Diane Wiest and Seth Green.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely memory piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautifully looking film, both in its production design by the great theater designer Santo Loquasto, and the wonderful photography by Carlo Di Palma, in his first of several fruitful collaborations with Allen. Together with Allen's witty, tender script, and a host of excellent performances, the film does a terrific job of creating an intentionally larger than life, and slightly surreal memory piece of short stories about growing up in an age when radio was still the king of entertainment.It's a small, sweet. charming piece. Some of the stories are flat out great, some occasionally feel a bit meandering or pointless, but none are truly weak. The best moments rival Felliini's 'Amarcord'. Perhaps not among Allen's greatest films, but still better than 99% of what has gotten produced in America in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The litmus test for flashback films is simple: Does it appeal to anyone outside those who experienced these memories firsthand? Thanks to Woody Allen's romantic story-telling and gorgeous cinematography, "Radio Days" stands as sweet nostalgia for every generation, a universal valentine to days gone by...This may not be Woody's funniest film, or his most dramatic, but the appeal here is mood: minor-key episodes set against cloudy beaches and schoolyards and scored to the strains of a melancholy "September Song." Allen does such a masterful job reproducing his youth you will smell the sea air and taste the champagne. It's very difficult for me to describe the movie without sounding like some corny back-of-the-box, but this really is a movie that appeals to young and old, sweet and funny and completely original...The movie has some step-brothers: its premise is similar to TV's "Wonder Years," and has always seemed to me a perfect double-feature with the classic "A Christmas Story." I'm also struck by the fact that the family in the film plays like a rough draft of "The Simpsons"- and not just because Julie Kavner's playing Mom.Maybe the best you can say about Woody Allen is that he always made his movies for himself- not critical praise or box-office potential, not for ego or awards-season glory... nowhere is that more evident than in "Radio Days" It's a wistful document of days-gone-by, and anyone with a heart can relate to the genuine nostalgia that's conveyed. A lost classic.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1980's, Woody Allen hit a prolific streak of form which I think has never been bettered in the history of cinema. During this period Woody released, amongst others, `A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy', `Zelig', `Broadway Danny Rose', `The Purple Rose Of Cairo', `Hannah And Her Sisters', `Another Woman' and `Crimes And Misdemeanours'. `Radio Days' followed in the wake of the critical and commercial success of `Hannah?.' allowing Woody the money and freedom to make his most personal and nostalgic film.`Radio Days' has been criticised for being too thin and flimsy but for the discerning film fan, who isnt bothered by the absence of explosions and car chases, the film is a delight. Basically a collection of anecdotal sketches, each featuring the backdrop of a radio programme, `Radio Days' effortlessly re-creates, in fine detail, America of the forties.Well paced and beautifully acted throughout, `Radio Days' is funny, sad, evocative and memorable, a treat from America's most consistent, prolific and, arguably, greatest director. 9/10</fullReview>

The acting and direction are wonderful. Michael Tucker brings a great comic warmth to the screen, and Julie Kavner and Dianne Wiest are both very, very strong. But the star of this movie is the time in which it is set, and the set design, cinematography and overall mood of the movie are captured wonderfully. I've spoken to people who grew up in New York City during the "Radio Days" and they say that Allen captures the era perfectly.I love this movie because Allen doesn't pretend that the past is perfect, but he loves it even with its flaws, and he presents it to us with the love that feels for this time gone by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what nostalgia is all about! Woody Allen takes a look at the 1940s, when radio was still the dominant medium. Young Joe (Seth Green) is the window into this world. I'm assuming that Allen based that character on himself. Meanwhile, we get to see also the lives of various radio performers, among them Mia Farrow's and Wallace Shawn's characters. My favorite scene was the snowman scene, although I don't recommend it for squeamish and/or prudish people.Anyway, this is a nice, wacky look at the days before TV. I am particularly inclined to agree with his statement about boy crooners; I would have to say the same about boy bands. All in all, Woody Allen does best when he sticks to straight forward comedy and doesn't try to look at neurotic rich New Yorkers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe (Woody Allen), the narrator, explains how the radio influenced his childhood in the days before TV. The young Joe (Seth Green) lives in New York City in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The tale mixes Joe's experiences with his remembrances and anecdotes, inserting his memories of the urban legends of radio stars, and is told in constantly changing plot points and vignettes.So much greatness in this film. An impressive ensemble cast (between this and "Midsummer Night", Tony Roberts really blossomed under Allen's direction). Great music, excellent stories. And a very young Seth Green, around the same time he appeared on "Amazing Stories". Who would ever have thought he was going to be huge within a decade? Ebert calls the film "so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description. It's a kaleidoscope of dozens of characters, settings and scenes - the most elaborate production Allen has ever made - and it's inexhaustible, spinning out one delight after another." Well said, Roger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Radio Days is a strong directorial effort by Woody Allen and it's funny, charming, and even nostalgic. This movie touches up on the fact how popular radio used to be during the golden years in the 1940's. During this time, the lives of people revolved around listening to radio and Allen does a great job in bringing this fact across. However, this is a story about family and kinship and how radio particularly affected this family.Woody Allen directed a rather charming film that is narrated by Joe and he talks about how radio influenced his childhood and he talks about his memories of his family and how radio associated with them. Not only that, but he also gives vivid descriptions on behind-the-scenes as well from the eyes of the radio personalities.This film has a strong cast led by regulars of older Woody Allen films. Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton makes some appearances here and do fairly well. Dianne Wiest had a great performance as Aunt Bea and Julie Kavner did well as Mother.Overall, this is a charming and witty film that will make you be overcome with nostalgic feelings. Even if you weren't born or alive in the 1940's, you can't but feel like you've been a part of this life someway or another. It's a great look on how radio played a part in everyone lives and how it's missed from today's society. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugely entertaining movie, soaked in unique kind of vinegary nostalgia: Allen never permits anything syrupy to overwhelm the script.It's a pity his relationship with Mia Farrow ended so sourly. He gives her such a terrific opportunity in RADIO DAYS, which she seizes and runs with. It may well be her best movie performance, because it's so unexpected: surely no one anticipated her coming up with anything so funny.In addition to Ms Farrow, the film is populated by a crowd of phenomenally good character actors, who can set you hooting with laughter with how they turn a one-liner or the way they react to someone else's. There's also a rich vein of poignancy, mostly mined by the ever-wonderful Dianne Wiest. For admirers of Mr Allen at his most dazzling, there's nothing better than the girl-talk scene between Ms Wiest and Julie Kavner. It's perfect.Woody Allen is, by any standard, a film-making phenomenon. One picture (sometimes two) a year since ANNIE HALL in 1977 is quite an output. I think you'd have to be a die-hard fan to deny that the quality of his work has declined, in spite of charmers like MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011). For me, his last masterwork was BULLETS OVER Broadway (1994), but how many writer-directors make one such, let alone several? As far as I'm concerned he can put in that category MANHATTAN (1979), STARDUST MEMORIES (1980), ZELIG (1983), Broadway DANNY ROSE (1984), HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) and, towards the end of that highly fertile period, RADIO DAYS (1987).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing up in Rockaway in the late '30's and early 40's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days (1987) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The movie is set during the "golden years of radio," when radio programs, listened to at home, were an important aspect of American entertainment.The film is narrated by Woody Allen, and is a nostalgic--and possibly autobiographical--look at the childhood of a young boy growing up in Rockaway, Queens. Allen grew up in Brooklyn, but the culture and customs of lower-middle class Jews in Rockaway would have been similar to those that Allen probably witnessed in Brooklyn.The movie is set in the late 1930's and early 1940's. Surprisingly, World War II doesn't hold a prominent place in the film. Although the war was thousands of miles away, no aspect of life in the U.S. was untouched by it. Allen chose to concentrate on other matters--failed hopes, unfulfilled romances, and family bickering.Despite these negative aspects of day-to-day life, the film projects a cheery, upbeat attitude. After all, it was a time when someone who looked like Wallace Shawm could star as radio's "Masked Avenger." Woody's subdued narrative lets us know that he loved those around him and was loved by them in turn. Life wasn't perfect, but it could have been worse, and who knew what good things the future might bring. We saw Radio Days on DVD. It probably would work somewhat better on the large screen, but it's worth seeking out and seeing in any format.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of Woody Allen's best movies. There is no plot to speak of, more a series of anecdotes and episodes revolving around 10 year old Joe (played by Seth Green) and his large working-class Jewish-American family in 1940s New York City all linked by the ever-present voice of the radio. Interspersed with these tales are the stories of the radio personalities themselves.It is one of Woody Allen's warmest works. Funny, and at times very moving, it's a tribute to family as much as the Golden Age of radio. The various episodes are weaved together very skillfully and the large cast all turn in fine performances, the film also looks fantastic, full of a nostalgic golden glow.There's also a bittersweet quality here, lamenting the passing of an age long gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autobiographical Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days comes across as perhaps the most autobiographical of Woody Allen's films. It recalls fondly the period in time when the radio ruled supreme as the great communicator and entertainment medium in people's lives. Allen looks at various aspects of this through the eyes of a working class Jewish New York family. The story is essentially made up by a number of small of vignettes. In these short pieces Allen looks at various radio-related stories such as real events like Orson Welles' famous War of the Worlds broadcast, to fictional stories like the little girl in the well news item that shows how the radio could bind communities together in times of tragedy. As should also be expected, much of the observations are comic too, such as the fact that the popular radio super-hero of the day is in reality a short unassuming bald man.It's very much an ensemble piece with the usual good characterizations we have come to expect from Allen. And while I think it is a good film, it isn't amongst his strongest work in my opinion. The main problem being that it's overall a little too fragmented for any characters to really stand out. I don't mind it being relatively plot-less but we never spend enough time with individual people in order to get a handle on them or really to care enough for them. Still, it's a very loving recreation of a period in time close to its director's heart. And this does come across quite clearly. Radio Days is not essential Allen for me but still a pretty solid bit of work with some heart to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What actually happened isn't nearly as important as how we remember it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen normally makes one film every year, but in 1987 he made two, "Radio Days" and "September", about as different from one another as it would be possible for two Woody Allen movies to be. "September" is a dismal and quite deliberately humourless psychological drama about unrequited love; "Radio Days", a period piece set in the New York of the late 1930s and early 1940s, is much lighter in tone. Indeed, it is also lighter than many of Woody's other comedies, substituting a nostalgic warmth for their frequent tone of neurotic or cynical angst.The film is sometimes described as autobiographical, although this is not quite accurate, even though Allen narrates the story himself. (He is never seen by the audience). The main character, Joe, is, like Allen, from a Jewish-American family, but rather older than Allen would have been at this period. (I doubt, for example, whether Woody, born in December 1935, has any memory of Orson Welles' famous radio adaptation of "The War of the Worlds", broadcast in October 1938 when he was still under three years old). The title reflects the fact that the thirties and forties, in America as in many other countries, was regarded as the "Golden Age of Radio" before television replaced radio as the dominant medium. The film explores the ways in which the lives of young Joe and his family are influenced by the radio shows of the day; Joe is particularly inspired by an adventure serial about a superhero known as the Masked Avenger. There are also anecdotes about the radio stars of the day; showbiz urban legends of this type play an important part in other Woody films such as "Broadway Danny Rose" or "Sweet and Lowdown". An example comes when a well-known radio presenter known for his womanising gets locked on the roof of a nightclub with Sally White, a cigarette girl with ambitions to become a radio star herself. (She eventually succeeds, despite an obvious lack of talent). There is, in fact, no single coherent plot line; the film rather consists of a series of stories and anecdotes, most of them amusing, occasionally sad as in the tale (based on a real-life incident) of the young girl who dies after falling into a well. Compared to the great Woody Allen films like "Manhattan" or "Hannah and Her Sisters", made the previous year, "Radio Days" is a slight work. To call it "slight", however, does not necessarily imply low quality; it is, for example, far better than "September", a film which Allen clearly intended to be portentous and significant but which ended up as dull and depressing. I suspect that Allen's target audience for "Radio Days" was people of his own age group or slightly older (he would have been 49 in 1987) who wanted to look back nostalgically at the days of their youth; the film contains not only references to the radio shows of the thirties and forties but also much of the popular music of that era. I was not around during that period (I was not born until the sixties) so presumably do not qualify. Nevertheless, this was still a film which I enjoyed. Woody cast a number of actors who had appeared in his earlier films, such as Mia Farrow as Sally, Dianne Wiest as Joe's Aunt Bea whose search for love is a running theme, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels, Diane Keaton and Wallace Shawn, and gets good performances out of all of them. There are any number of amusing incidents; the burglars who accidentally win a big prize for their victims by answering a ringing telephone and correctly answering a question on "Name That Tune"; Joe's misappropriation (much to the disgust of his rabbi) of funds collected for Israel; his disappointment on discovering that the Masked Avenger is not the handsome hero he had imagined but is played by a short, bald actor; his search with his friends for enemy submarines after the outbreak of war. Despite the episodic nature of his material, Woody manages to make the film hang together as a whole as a warm, loving recollection of childhood. The nostalgic atmosphere is heightened by the lush, warm tones in which it is shot. This is the Golden Age of Radio, not necessarily as it was, but as it should have been. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, what actually happened isn't nearly as important as how we remember it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful and witty nostalgic trip to the glory days of radio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I have never been a big Woody Allen fan. I found his Alvy persona from Annie Hall, a persona he carried through many of his films less than intriguing. So it's probably no surprise that my favorite Woody Allen film has no Alvy in it or as little as possible. No ruminations of the meaning of life, no endless intellectual babbling about nothing just an incredible trip to the days when radio was king and live with no prepackaged music wrapped around rude loudmouths.The movie spans the time of pre-WWII America into the war years ending in 1944. The movie is narrated by Woody Allen and we see the young version of the narrator in Joe (played by Seth Green). We see his family as they go on about their daily lives, but majority of the film is about the radio shows of the day and the people who made them.The movie is full of anecdotes of supposed radio stars and what they were doing behind the scenes. I don't know if any of them are real but they certainly were enjoyable to watch. Most of the radio personalities were only shown in one or two segments. The one the film did followed was Sally White, played by Mr. Allen's then girlfriend Mia Farrow and adopted mother of his wife. Sally is a radio wannabe who tries everything from sleeping with radio stars when she was a cigarette girl to singing jingles to finally creating a new persona for herself. One funny bit is when she is finally making her debut in a radio drama which coincided with a very important historical event.The other part of the movie is about young Joe and his family. They live in a crowded house. Joe and his parent, his grandparents, an aunt and uncle and their daughter as well as unlucky in love aunt Bea. (One of her dates take place during the night of Ordon Welle's famous "War of the Worlds" broadcast). Joe's parents are always bickering, one good argument is which is the greater Ocean the Pacific or the Atlantic. As a matter of fact there are a lot of arguing going on in the household and as you can expect from Woody Allen much of it is funny. Watching or rather listening to this movie, one realizes that today's movies have lost a tremendous amount when they rely less on words. Partiicularly comedies that rely so much on sight gags and visual pratfalls.The movie is also wonderful to look at. The set decorators and the location scouts certainly did their job well. The sets, from the fancy restaurants, to a great theater (radio city music hall?) looked incredible. Woody Allen's films are not usually known to be visual feasts but this one certainly is the exception. Also the music is wonderful including the main theme which perfectly suited the movie.This is a wonderful movie to see even if you don't like Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative and good-natured nostalgia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about growing up in Rockaway during the early 1940s, framed by piece after piece of contemporary pop radio songs and programs. It strikes a viewer as even more autobiographical than usual for Woody Allan. That's not necessarily a good thing, I suppose. What happens to an artist may seem pregnant with import to him but rather flat to an outsider. But "Radio Days" succeeds where so many others fail. It belongs in the category of other autobiographical achievements -- John Boorman's "Hope and Glory," Philip Roth's "Portnoy's Complaint," Jack Kerouac's "On the Road." The Masked Avenger in Allan's movie muses with others on New Year's Eve, 1944, "I wonder if anyone will remember this." They will now.A lot of the credit goes to Carlo DiPalma's photography and Santo Loquasto's artistic direction. It's an awfully familiar environment, stylized to the point of enchantment. I forget how much younger I am than Woody Allan but it can't be by much because I could decode some of the characters and incidents he gives us here. The vast mural advertising Camel cigarettes on Times Square, for instance, with a hole in the guy's mouth and the smoke rings issuing forth, inviting us to inhale. Victory gardens. Watching the skies for enemy airplanes. Collecting scrap and milkweed pods. Liberty bonds. The tragedy of the little girl trapped in the well, whom I remember as Kathy Fiscus. The ridiculously inspirational stories of sports heroes who, through an excess of "heart", overcame their disabilities. The broadcaster was I think Bill Stern.The brief episode involving Stern's rendering of the Monty Stratton story is a good example of what buoys this up and lifts it above an ordinary autobiography. Monty Stratton, a major league pitcher, lost a leg in a hunting accident and came back to pitch again. In Woody's scenario, the pitcher loses his leg and comes back alright. But then there is another accident, and he loses his non-pitching arm -- and still comes back. Another accident. He's now blind -- but he STILL returns to major league pitching. Finally he's run over by a truck, killed, and Stern tells us he is now pitching in that Great Major League in the Sky. Now, I find that to be a successful combination of personal history and satire.It's impossible to avoid sentimentality in a movie like this. And, after all, what the hell, if you had a happy childhood, you miss it, so why not have lonely Aunt Bea taking up with the wrong guys? Why not have sappy songs like "I Don't Want to Walk Without You"? They were part of the period and there were a lot of guys overseas and many of them didn't come back. Every other window seems to have a flag with a blue star on it or, for the unlucky ones, a gold star. Not everyone was as confidently sarcastic and loving as the families we see in this film, of course. But at least the country was pulling together against an agreed-upon common enemy. The Air Raid Wardens and the ration books now seem like a small price to pay for that kind of solidarity. Living in a city at the time when neighborhoods were relatively stable was a little like living in a village in which everyone seemed to know everyone else and you couldn't sneeze without someone around the corner saying in a familiar voice, "Gesundheit." It's impossible to imagine that kind of taken-for-granted intimacy in a post-war bedroom community. (I think I'm getting a touch of that nostalgia myself. Is it catching?) Woody Allan narrates the thing and at the end he observes that he will never forget that New Year's Eve of 1944 when they woke him up to hear Guy Lombardo. "But, to tell the truth, the memory gets dimmer with each year." Righto, Woody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Those Very Cozy Woody Allen Delights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days is a wonderfully entertaining sort of novelty store of a movie. Woody Allen fashions his film a la Fellini, carrying it with streaming events rather than a plot, and crowding the screen with the commotion of a cast that includes characters of very short screen time. Allen accentuates his Felliniesque vision of the film by putting surprising name actors, like Diane Keaton and Jeff Daniels for instance, in minute-long roles, pointing at those key elements of Fellini films like La Dolce Vita or Amarcord. Amarcord, specifically, is a film about the filmmaker's loving recollection of time just as this is. Even so, that's not what Woody Allen is interested in here. Unlike Interiors, his hero worship for other directors does not get the best of him here. The focus lies in the passionate nostalgia of his days growing up with the radio in the background of life.Radio Days's sense of humor does actually surrender to the influence of Fellini, but not without Allen's provocation of a response more than just laughter. He wants you to curl your eyebrows in misunderstanding for a second and thus enjoy the laugh more, the best example being the radio vignette involving the sports historian who tells the story of the very unfortunate baseball player who loses a limb in a hunting accident but continues to play because what he lacked in the missing limb he made up for with heart, yet the story is far from over. Also, the very commotive Jewish family, characterizing Allen's own and including an impressive young Seth Green as the figure for young Woody, is portrayed with a loving naiveté, as is displayed so pricelessly in their shock that on Yom Kippur, the neighbors actually have the nerve to work on their house, and because they believe that they are communists and because they're making so much noise, the uncle works up the nerve to go next door and confront them, thus ushering in a shouting match with one of them, played by fellow Woody Allen's fellow Jewish comedian Larry David, who provides great enjoyment a la his perpetually conflicting character on Curb Your Enthusiasm.Allen's Radio Days is also a much more emotional experience than any Fellini film. Though I loved Amarcord and I believe Fellini is a very good director, he is the king of dry. The irresistible lure of Allen's films is their warmth and atmosphere. He's one of the subtlest and most deadpan of all directors, yet his films feel so good and comfortable to watch even more so than many lavish and intense filmmakers. The emotional arcs of the characters played by Dianne Wiest and Julie Kavner are very heartfelt and poignant. Radio Days is one of those very warm Allen experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A loving, beautifully narrated postcard of times lost, but never forgotten.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to "Annie Hall", this is my favorite Woody Allen pic! It's an unabashedly ultra-nostalgic, starry-eyed glare through a misty window, (with an ear pressed against it!) to lovingly embrace the golden age of radio in the 1940s, and the Jewish family that lives through it. It's a welcome break from his acid-tongued, contemporary battles of the sexes.In many of his works, Allen's character galleries can sometimes be too boisterous and annoying, but not here. We laugh AND care for them as their fates entwine- Wiest's and Farrow's particularly. Hilarious and moving episodes roll by with a sweetness that doesn't feel schmaltzy or contrived. And visually... ah, the period feel, the costumes &amp; colors- It's simply a beautifully narrated (by guess who?) postcard of times lost, but never forgotten, that I can watch repeatedly! 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

That was a very strange scene. But this movie, about the days when RADIO was the main thing, not TV - really made me think about what life was like for my Mom and Dad in the 40's. Very good movie and there was so much history in it. I liked that one radio show that focused on having breakfast with this pretentious couple. Today it would not go over well. Now we have legends such as Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh talking politics. Back then, it was more of an entertainment median. I loved this movie.

		<shortDescription>Beautifully crafted homage to the 30's and 40's, when Radio was King!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a motion picture capture an era with such nostalgia and reverence, as Woody Allen's "Radio Days". Set in New York City as World War 2 breaks; "Radio Days" captures the mood of the times through the music, drama, news, sports - and even the commercials that entertained and informed listeners in the days when radio ruled the media roost. Seen through the eyes of a young Jewish boy and his extended family in working class Brooklyn, the movie is really a series of well crafted vignettes, based on fact mixed with fiction. Some are hilarious, some touching, but always entertaining and filled with the great "Swing" music of the era. As usual, Allen's ensemble of actors deliver terrific turns as they recreate those great old days. Mia Farrow, Diane Wiest, Julie Kavner, Michael Tucker, and Seth Green are standouts, while Woody Allen narrates as only he can. A triumph in every respect, "Radio Days" will leave you, as the final scene does; longing for a more innocent time, while sadly knowing it is gone forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I thought it was one of Woody Allen's best, I must say that I am biased. Most of America (anywhere west of Manhattan) doesn't get Woody. I do. I also don't like a lot of what he's done, but this wasn't one of those times. Anybody under the age of 40 probably was turned off by the music in the film. Sorry, but that's what made it for me. I do have one minor comment about ten seconds of the movie. There was a scene in a Jr. High classroom in which one kid brings a condom to class and the entire class breaks out in laughter. Never would have happened. Kids in the 30's had no earthly idea what a rubber was, not even in New York. I grew up with radio and the movie showed how much affect it had on the daily life of all Americans. It accurately depicted the morals of the country back then, not like some more modern films that like to distort what America once stood for. Hats off to Woody for this one.</fullReview>

He not only shows how the radio played a part of his fictional family's lives but goes behind the dial to tell the stories of the radio performers themselves.Mr. Allen strives successfully to place the viewer right in that time period.

		<fullReview>"Radio Days" is a film centered around the effects of radio programs of the day on a tight-knit Rockaway Beach, NY family during the early 1940s. The film ranges from sentimental (Dianne Wiest's Aunt Bea looking for love) to hilarious (Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker's deliciously bickering couple), all the while keeping a touch of cynicism that keeps the movie believable and moving. Subplot involving Sally White's (Mia Farrow) rise to radio stardom is marvelous. Who knew that Farrow could play the "dumb blonde" so touchingly? Carlo DiPalma's photography and Santo Loquasto's set decoration give the film a most authentic feel. Also starring Tony Roberts, Danny Aiello (a riot as a soft-hearted hitman), Jeff Daniels, Josh Mostel and Diane Keaton (in a cameo as a nightclub chanteuse in her first Allen film since 1979's "Manhattan" ), "Radio Days" is a slice-of-life masterpiece not to be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Tribute to those "Radio Days" of the Past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those little memories that might be conjured up from seeing your old neighborhood, or a song from the radio. These are the memories Woody Allen remembers, in his tribute to those radio days of the past. Whether they are true are not, I do not know, but it is both interesting and fun to see. Watching Allen's mind spill on to film is tends to be very offbeat, and a bit odd, but that is what makes watching his films such a great experience. There is no real plot to be found here, but as the title vaguely suggests, they are just a collection of small stories. Some of them, told through the point of view of lower class people in the eyes of younger Woody Allen, Joe, played by a tiny little Seth Green.He goes on about how the songs played on the radio remind him of a particular event. It is strange how memories work like that, rising from that archive inside your brain that seems to be lost, but in a single second, a certain song or picture might dust off that memory, opening a doorway into the past. The film seems to stress how songs from those radio days bring back such memories. Not all of the stories revolve around Allen's younger self, but through various characters. Like radio voice, Sally(Mia Farrow), and his Aunt Bee(Diane Wiest), who just can't seem to find her true love. Reminds me of the way A Christmas Story is told, but on a larger scale, not sticking to one story. I guess a series of vignettes to convey the memories fit Allen's purpose here. I truly don't think he has one particular story that he can remember in full, but these scattered memories pulled together to create the whole works well.Allen has a great eye for period detail, and I felt like I was taken into that time and place. The dialogue is sharp and funny; he sure doesn't fail us in that category. I guess such a film as this could go on forever. Stories like these could continue, and he shows us that the absence of a proper resolution is a better choice. He could end it anywhere, and the way he chooses is indisputable.Those listeners didn't have television, and Allen illustrates here how much the radio effected these people's lives. If some tragic event were to happen to someone they didn't even know, they would be effected emotionally. Young Joe's obsession with the "masked avenger" is humorous to the audience because we find that he really is just a short and bald man played by Wallace Shawn. And such a little kid looks up to him, even if it is only the man's voice. The radio people ponder to themselves about how they have missed the great things about the city. While the normal people have seen it all, they have spent their time entertaining and wonder where that time has all gone. Years from now, will they be remembered? Probably not, but it is the essence of memories that keep them alive. But, as Allen points out, `as with each passing year, their voices do seem to grow dimmer.'He has created a marvelous tribute to the era of Radio Days, showing me a time that is rarely recalled, unless I'm threatened to get my TV taken away, then the guilt-trip line is, `all they had back then were radio's, they didn't have TV.' Allen, however, brings those memories back in sort of a dreamlike fashion. There is no story to be told here, just memories told to us in the way he remembers them (such as setting the place and time up with a rainy street in Rockwell, New York; it looked most beautiful when it was like that, he says). Some parts are touching, some of them are funny and full of his off-the-wall humor; I just couldn't get enough of this movie. One of Woody Allen's best.****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favorite movies and, I believe, Woody Allen's best film.What sets this film apart for Allen is the special warmth he has for the era and the characters that populate it. Recently reliving the experience on DVD, I was amazed at how every scene seems to hit a bullseye...both as individual vignettes and ultimately weaving together to make the overall quilt. It is a film that celebrates the glorious quirkiness of our own families and the wonderful stories that individual lives can tell. It is also a loving tribute to the medium of radio, which has ultimately been destroyed by FCC deregulation. It's nice to think of it in the days when it enriched the imagination of everyone listening.Guy LeBow's bit with the increasingly handicapped pitcher and Mia Farrow's brush with the mob over an italian dinner are priceless. But this is a film laden with jewels. </fullReview>

He is a person who has nurtured his child within through his life and I think of all his films of an autobiographical nature (most of them) this is way the best. The Jewish reverence for the family and their particular humour is practically edible in this wonderful homage to playfulness. One of my favourite scenes is when grandpa harnesses grannie into her corsets. So poignant and well.... loving. He plays on the soundtrack himself and along with most great directors displays a myriad of talents. This is a magnesium flare of pure memory that makes one smile.Vintage stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Woody Allen - sensational sets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, in many ways, seems to be the most effortless of Woody Allen's comedies. A major part of the pleasure for me is the way in which the minutiae of the characters' lives are contrasted with the dazzling sets. Santo Loquasto's sets - particularly the one for the final scene - are absolutely sensational - carving up space better than anything outside the work of Antonioni.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't yet have enough Allen-experience to judge for myself, but I often heard and read the criticism that Woody Allen is at his worst when leaning too much towards personal nostalgia and sentiment. Well, if that statement is true, it certainly isn't applicable to "Radio Days". This is as nostalgic and sentimental as it gets, but it's also very great! The film describes Allen's own personal childhood years, set more or less at the start of WWII and playing in a not-so-wealthy Jewish household in the New York suburbs. The entire family, and young Joe in particular, fancies all the different radio broadcasts varying from silly game shows to serious news bulletins and music programs. The screenplay exists of numerous little vignettes and anecdotes that are all somehow connected to the titular medium. The mini-stories either focus on the members of the family (like aunt Bea's desperate search for a husband or uncle Abe's encounter with the communist neighbors) or on the persona's behind the radio voices (like Sally White's incredibly career change from nightclub cigarette salesgirl into singer). The little segments are funny without becoming ludicrous, touching without becoming melancholic and sentimental without becoming smarmy. The tone and pacing of the film are exact right, while the re-creation of the early 40's era is near perfect. The WWII anxiety, the mesmerizing music and yellow-tinted cinematography ? it all fits. These were the days where radio hosts were still mysterious and mythical and pathetic little bald men provided the voices of superheroes like "The Masked Avenger". The comparisons between "Radio Days" and Federico Fellini's legendary "Amarcord" are justified. Allen catapults us all back to his childhood years, and he's more than welcome to. He takes care of the narration ? wonderfully, I may add ? and cast a very young Seth Green as his allegedly 9-year-old alter ego. If you see the youthful Green here, you'll agree this is one of the greatest casting jobs ever. The rest of the cast is praiseworthy as well, particularly Dianne Wiest as the spinster aunt and Mia Farrow as the naive mistress. This is truly a beautiful and enchanting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's Affectionate Valentine to his Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1987's Radio Days is Woody Allen's nostalgic look at an era gone by, when families used to gather in front of the radio instead of the television.Woody's imaginative, Oscar-nominated screenplay recalls his childhood in Brooklyn, weaving family stories with radio programs that ignite certain memories for him.Seth Green had one of his first major film roles as Joe, a fictionalized Woody, whose loopy behavior with his family generates big laughs and connections with radio shows of the period and certain fictional and non-fictional radio personalities.Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner are wonderful as Joe's parents...his dad spends the story trying to hide what he does for a living and Mom loves to listen to a morning radio program hosted by glamorous Irene and Roger, a glamorous couple who it is revealed has an open relationship, resulting in Roger's affair with a cigarette girl named Sally (Mia Farrow), a character who becomes central to multiple story lines.Josh Mostel and Renee Lippin are funny as Joe's aunt and uncle. Aunt Ceil drives her hubby crazy because her favorite radio program stars a ventriloquist. Dianne Wiest plays Joe's other aunt, who loves to listen to music on the radio and wants nothing more than a husband. Since the story is centered around radio, music is a key element of the story and Woody's wonderful taste in music is utilized to great effect here and if you don't blink, you will catch a musical cameo by Woody's favorite leading lady, Diane Keaton.Woody scores big here with a winning comedy that produces equal doses of laughter and warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woody Allen masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely in the top 10 of his best films along with Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Husbands and Wives, Love and Death, Zelig, Sleeper and Stardust Memories and even in the top 5(so far that is, haven't yet seen all of them). That is how great Radio Days is and I'm still kicking myself for taking so long to see it. Radio Days looks wonderful, with the smoky cinematography being some of the most beautiful of any Woody Allen film and the minute period detail is very evocative. The music score is also among the best of any of his films(or at least one of my personal favourites from them), wistful and very catchy with a strong hint of nostalgia, the Radio Days theme is irresistible. Allen's scripts are on the most part very insightful and much of his humour is smart and at its best hilarious. That for Radio Days is one of his smartest with cracking, witty dialogue that makes one laugh and cry and is full of insight, with themes that are explored intelligently and in a way that is easy to identify with. The story cuts seamlessly from family life to the empty glamour of Radioland with no signs of being disjointed, there is not a dull moment and it is certainly among the most heart-warming and charming stories for a Woody Allen film. It has nostalgia written all over it, and I'd go as far to say that Radio Days is one of Allen's most accessible mainly for this reason. Allen directs intelligently and with no signs of smugness, and he draws great performances from his cast. Mia Farrow's performance here is one of her best and she is supported impeccably, especially with Diane Wiest who has the most juicy character(of a film full of interesting and likable, for Allen at least, characters) and gives a performance that is almost the equal of the one she gave in Hannah and Her Sisters. Allen's alter ego characters have always been a very mixed bag when it comes to the acting stakes, with the worst case being Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity, but Seth Green is clearly one of the better examples along with Will Ferrell in Melinda and Melinda, he's funny and charming but also doesn't try to be too much of a pale impersonation. All in all, a Woody Allen masterpiece and one of his finest. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hark, I hear Woody Allen roar. Is that the King of Comedy approaching?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a comedy classic that even non-Woody Allen fans can enjoy. It is a trip down memory lane of that old fashioned novelty called radio which kept families together for generations before that other invention television (which that other Allen named Fred referred to as a medium because nothing on it was well done) came along to replace it. The story surrounds a Jewish family out at the end of the A train in Far Rockaway where a young boy (representing the young Allen himself) views the lives of his family members and the action surrounding World War II through the shows he listened to on the radio.An all-star cast of Allen veterans shine here, particularly Julie Kavner as the hard-working mother, Dianne Wiest as the hopeful romantic Aunt Bea and Mia Farrow as a dizzy cocktail waitress. "Hark, I Hear the Cannons Roar! Is that the King Approaching?", Farrow repeats over and over, while Wiest declares, "You can meet all sorts of interesting men in a conga line!" The music of the era is heard to, from "Mairzy Dotes" to "I Don't Want to Walk Without You" and even a bit of Carmen Miranda thrown in. Every detail of World War II New York (and even before) is felt, including a take-off of Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast. While the family never ventures to the sophisticated world of the swells here, their love for the radio and every type of program to come off of it is saluted. The soap opera, the serial, the game show, even some funny bits by familiar faces like Kitty Carlisle and Tony Roberts. "You're listening to a ventriloquist on the radio!" one of the uncles exclaims. "Shut up! Who cares?" the annoyed aunt retorts. "I've got fresh fish!" he later exclaims as Allen's narration goes on to reminisce about how she always ended up filleting his flounder. A grandmother whose breasts seem to keep growing and a niece who prances around like Carmen Miranda also fill out Allen's family circle. So many great moments come out of this, and in the end, Allen's 70's female lead, Diane Keaton, comes on to sing a brief song. Jeff Daniels' Biff Baxter from "The Purple Rose of Cairo" also makes an appearance, connecting one of Allen's previous hits to this film. He would go on to make a few more serious films before returning to similar theme with the brilliant "Bullets Over Broadway", set in the same era, yet covering a different fixture of the New York entertainment world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the air tonight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much everyone's childhood no doubt is bathed in a golden hue, including, almost literally, Woody Allen's in this cavalcade of pre-teen reminiscences to the backdrop of the music of popular radio.That nostalgic glow is everywhere, to the extent that there are no bad characters to cloud the atmosphere and the insertion of a blatantly sad story (a little girl dies off-screen down a well) seems unwelcome and indeed out of place. Allen paints an attractively quirky set of characters, no doubt drawn from memory, of a hard-working extended Jewish family and contrasts this with the glamour and glitz of radio show performers with whose lives they occasionally interact and certainly aspire to. He leaves us in no doubt however as to who's the richer, metaphorically speaking.Interestingly, although the film is narrated by Allen through his childhood self, his character isn't the emotional centre of the film. That, for me, is Dianne Wiest's nicely played Aunt Bea, forever carrying a torch for a mixed assortment of men. As a "Rhoda" fan from the mid 70's I was pleased to see Julie Kavner in a prominent role (pre Marge Simpson, of course) although she still seems too young for her part as family matriarch. That said, I much prefer Allen's films when he's not employing "flavour of the month" big names (who of course would all "just die" to be in a Woody film) and instead gets more out of lesser known but no less capable baggage-less actors like here - Tony Roberts even gets a look-in.The comedy is smile rather than laugh inducing and some of the scenes have been done before (Bill Forsyth for one, beat him to the punch in "Gregory's Girl" with the school-kids accidental viewing of their future teacher's nude dancing in her apartment), but the film's evocation of New York in the war years is beautifully managed and certainly draws comparison to Scorcese's earlier "New York New York".And that sure is a pretty shot at the end as the neon hat is doffed to us to send us on our way, no doubt with thoughts of our own hopefully happy childhoods, wherever they were.</fullReview>

Clark, Mia Farrow,Lee Irwin, Roger Hammer,....................etc., etc., Some Love 'um, others can't standum! Personally, I'm kinda in betweener. Some of his Comedies really grab me! They belong right up there among the best. Films like the episodic TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN!('69), the fractured Japanese Bond-type entry WHAT'S UP, TIGER LILY?('66), SLEEPER('73) and EVERYTHING YOU'VE WANTED TO ASK ABOUT SEX BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK('72), all rank high up on the old personal list! But then you see something like MANHATTAN('79) and just wonder. Just what was it? Did it have an ending, or am I so square(no, cubed)that I really missed something? (Please! Someone tell, is it me?) In RADIO DAYS(1987) we have a premise that Director/Writer/Narrator Woody has used briefly before, but now goes into with Sabres Drawn, Guns Blazzing! The whole story is done in one in nostalgic flashback. Autobiographical material is the basis of the screenplay and Mr. Allen's ethnic upbringing as a Jewish boy of New York City supplying the humor and nostalgia.In short, the telling of all family deeds, misdeeds and non-deeds are related to the audience by the unfolding story, as witnessed by the young boy. The setting is Rockaway, Queens,New York, mid-1940's. The characterizations and the Jewish Ethnic Humor is abundant, loud and strangely endearing, even to an Irish-German Gentile boy, like me.All of the trials, tribulations and affairs of all kinds, happening to various family members are revealed in both child's and grown-up's version. And the difficulties of being a kid and growing-up are displayed for the world to see.And the glue to hold all of this together is the Radio in the parlor, its diverse programming and its effect on American Life. Their outcomes, which seem to have varied degrees of success and failures.A Quiz Show, the Soaps, Serialized Drama and the Kiddie Shows. One show in particular, along with THE SHADOW and SUPERMAN holds the great interest of the boy, and that is the (fictiscous)show,THE MASKED AVENGER! In fact, it is the Boy's great love of the show and his burning desire to obtain his own Radio Premium of "The Masked Avenger Ring" that cements the story together and dominates a great deal of the action. Gentle, non-intrusive narration from Woody, and generous sprinkling of his own brand of humor keep it moving all the way to "THE END".But just one minute, Woody. We thoroughly enjoyed your humor and your picking apart the eccentricities and foibles of the Adults in this(your)childhood world, and the whole production has a great physical look about it, and is very reminiscent of the 1940's.Your use of the kid, the radio programs and his relationship with the parents, when added to this great desire and yearning for the "Masked Avenger Ring", seems a little like the Jean Shepherd project, A Christmas STORY(1983) While this is certainly no charge of plagiarism here, there is some relationship and similarities.

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's amusing, meandering, and pretty joyous nostalgia-chest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a nostalgia-chest when you see it; it's where you put everything that you want to hold on to from childhood and adolescence, and have a real mesmerizing time going through it again decades later. This is Woody Allen doing that, though it's more of the mood and patterns of characters, I'd bet, then a full-on autobiography. This is like a series of stories that Woody knows based on experience and memory, though probably not entirely from his own life. To say it's one of his most personal projects is a given. To say that it also might not be one of his very best is up for discussion though. It's got a very fine structure to it, which is (no pun intended) often found within the house of the main 'real' characters of the Jewish family in Rockaway. There are stories to tell through the characters- the parents (Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner, both in some of their best work yet), the wanting-engagement aunt (Dianne Wiest, a narrow role to play but one done very sweetly and genuinely), the possibly fictional character of Sally White (Mia Farrow, often charming) who goes from chirpy cigarette girl to radio star, and the young protagonist himself (Seth Green, a surprise I'm sure) who lives in total fantasy- as kids should do- and gets into misadventures amid the stories around him.It's appropriate to hear other compare this to Fellini's Amarcord, but I think even if I hadn't seen Amarcord before I would've sensed right away the Fellini influence here. It's got some very funny moments, and even some tragic ones, and the spirit of the picture at the least doesn't come off as false. There's a lot of life to be found with these characters, who are split between the bounds of the real struggling existence of the Jewish lower-middle class Queens 40s life and the varying radio shows provided at the peak of popularity. The storyline for Farrow's Sally White might be not as entirely focused and a little weaker than that of Joe and his family, but there's still very entertaining bits, like when she ends up getting out of being killed by a mobster (Danny Aiello) because she charms his mother. Or when Wiesst's character is on a date with a man, but then he runs off when, of all things, martians are heard to land in New Jersey! The little bits involving Joe also vary from being nice to being hysterical, like when he rips off the collection fund for the creation of Israel for a ring. There are all kinds of resonant scenes do end up sticking through the picture, such a solemn note where a girl falls down a well. All of this amounts to a great deal of earnest fun and sincerity, but if it's less than a masterpiece for me it's because its own structure lends itself to, like memory, sticking out stronger in parts as opposed to the whole of it. Even still, as a Woody Allen fan who's seen the bulk of his films it is more often than not a fine concoction with a true fondness for the period. And it's also chock full of bit parts and cameos that had me smiling; Larry David (hard to see on screen but can be heard) as an angry communist neighbor; Jeff Daniels for one line on top of the roof in the New Years Eve scenes; Diane Keaton- the only time Allen's two most notorious co-stars/lovers got to share a picture- as a wonderful singer; even Tito Puente can be spotted. Not a wholly successful picture, but it's got a lot more good jokes and lines and character than other comedies I can think of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this movie just 8 because of other Allen's pictures I liked much more, and I guess it's understandable. Of course the casting is absolutely terrific, with one of my favorites - Diane Wiest as a frustrated Bea. There's also Diane Keaton that has a cameo appearance, but is as always charming. She sings just as in 'Annie Hall'. You can feel that Woody really liked the radio days and longs for the times. The movie refers to some significant radio events, like Orson Welles audition about aliens invading United States. Some of the sketches are really funny, some less, but it is Woody Alllen that enjoys audience and doesn't allow you to get bored during these ninety minutes. This is must-see movie for all Allen's fans, although from time to time lacks in genius jokes that only Woody can create.</fullReview>

Everybody rightly praises the cast, the music, the humor, the look. So how 'bout the trivia? Did you notice William H. Macy as a no-line radio actor? Or how about the overlap of Mia Farrow and Diane Keaton? (She plays the night club singer Helen Kane, who also recorded a song about Leonard "the Lizard" Zelig.)

		<shortDescription>A good woody allen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's nostalgic look at the golden age of radio through concentration on one ordinary family and the variety of favorite shows among that household is both interesting and entertaining. It doesn't possess the usual cleverness or snappy dialogues and comedic moments of most Woody Allen films, but it achieves some emotional elements which are not present in many of the 80s and 90s Woody Allen flicks. Radio Days isn't the best film to watch from the writer/director but it definitely isn't the worst. Its good to watch this film to get a sense of some different work Allen did. I liked the use of the old age music and the impressive cinematography from Carlo Di Palma and Susan E. Morse's editing was also good. -- IMDb Rating: 7.3, my rating: 8/10</fullReview>

Kids would tune in at 6pm to hear Orson Welles as The Shadow, brought to you by Lux! There was adventure, romance, swordplay, like on TV.7/10.

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's wonderfully sentimental, nostalgic and funny homage to radio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man reminisces about his youth, growing up in the 1930s and 40s in New York. We see and hear stories of himself, his parents, neighbours and friends and local celebrities. The common denominator in all the stories and in the overarching plot is the presence of the radio - it brought music, news, stories, escape and comfort, made stars of everyday people and was often the glue in families and relationships.A wonderfully sentimental, nostalgic and funny homage to radio from Woody Allen. Though the story in the movie doesn't fit his life story exactly you can see how it could be very close to it. It's also a history lesson, as many of radio's seminal moments from the 30s and 40s are covered (eg Orson Welles's War of the Worlds). Moreover, the broad feeling of nostalgia for a time and experience that cannot be relived and retrieved is very palpable and emotional.It's not all sentimentality though. The movie largely consists of episodes and vignettes from the narrator's memory. Many of these scenes are absurdly funny (Mia Farrow with the gangster takes the cake, but the prize-winning burglars aren't far behind). Allen allows his imagination to go wild, and it takes him to some wonderfully offbeat places.Performances are great too. No Woody Allen himself (except as narrator), but we have a young Seth Green effectively playing Woody Allen as a child, and doing a solid job. Good work too from Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker as his parents. The supporting cast is huge, due to the many mini-stories within the movie, and includes many Woody Allen favorites: Mia Farrow, Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest, Jeff Daniels, Danny Aiello, Tony Roberts. Some only have one or two lines (or, in Diane Keaton's case, one song). Nobody puts a foot wrong. William H Macy and Larry David, unknowns at the time, have minor, non-speaking parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slightly Overrated Woody Allen Movie that is not as Funny or Sharply Witted Woodster as some of His others. The Film couldn't Look better and the Soundtrack has Over 40 Songs interspersed among the Nostalgic Narrative. There are some Drop on the Floor Laughs, like the Bill Stern Sports Parody. The rest of the Jokes are Labored at times (the fat uncles fixation on fish) and are Hit and Miss. What Allen Hits Out of the Park is the Period Flavor and, as usual, a Wonderful Cast of Actors.The Short Running Time is a Blessing because if You are not fully Invested in the Time Period, it tends to Run On and On with its Dysfunctional but Loving Family Affairs. But the Film is so Beautiful to Watch that it is Joy for the Eyes with its Warm, Soft Color and Attention to Detail.It's a Woody Allen Movie that by Definition has a Narrow Audience, but Woody does His Best to bring Everyone along on His Trip Down Memory Lane. It's Far from His Best, but a Glorious Picture Nonetheless. That's Genius when a Lesser Effort in a Creator's Canon can be this Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Radio Days is a wonderful piece of nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I see this film I find myself enjoying it, as it has to do with one the periods in history that is a favorite: the Second World War. I like the movies from the era, and the music, and it is nice to see a film that goes into what life was like for a certain family in Brooklyn and how they handle their many problems and still continue to care and love another. Besides the nostalgic aspects of the film, another thing that I like about it (and I know that others will likely hate me for this) Allen is no where to be found! He is only the narrator, and I have no problem with that, considering that his acting is stupid and awful. It is a good family film, and should be shared in this setting, because it exhibits what we were and what we may become again. Then I see that Seth Rogan is the kid in this, and realize that he should have never been offered the role in Green Hornet (which was a radio show back in the thirties and forties, which is the era that this film is based in) and that movie was a Hollywood turd, but I digress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A warm tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boasting superb art direction, lush photography, and painterly compositions, this is easily one of Woody Allen's best-looking films. I've never regarded Allen as much of a composer of images, but his domestic scenes, full of interesting deep-focus views through multiple rooms, are densely packed with 1940s accoutrement, from the furniture to the trinkets on the shelves, nostalgically lit in brown hues by Carlo Di Palma. Certain sets?a nighttime roller-skating rink, an oyster-and-beer dive boarded by mirrors and globe lights, and the Radio City Music Hall?are as meticulously re-created as any filmic period-piece I've seen, certainly deserving of the warm tribute Allen's narration accords them. The story is a series of reflections about growing up in the early 1940s, pleasantly acted (Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner are especially good as the boy's parents) and likeably told. Sound design cleverly integrates radio programming as a narrative device, providing both pace and atmosphere. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything grander than a slice of nostalgia and a paean to a lost era. Not one of Allen's best films, but surprisingly warmhearted and a transporting experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An only intermittently funny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nostalgic tribute to old-time radio, this is an only intermittently funny comedy. Woody Allen's direction is certainly good but his script is lacklustre. The film does not really have a plot. It's more of a series of vignettes. It unsurprisingly feels disjointed but I wouldn't have minded that if most or all of the short scenes that comprise the film were entertaining. However, most of them were quite boring. "The Purple Rose of Cairo" was an enchanting evocation of the indefinable magic of going to the movies and I was hoping that this film would be just as effective when it came to radio in the days before TV. Unfortunately, that was not the case, even if Allen's fondness for the medium in its golden age can be keenly felt throughout. There are a few wonderful lines though.The film is narrated by Allen as the middle aged Joe, who recalls with great affection the impact that radio had on not only him when he was a boy but his parents and extended family. One thing that is very effectively communicated in the early part of the film is the way in which the radio captured his imagination. He was entranced by the adventures of the Lone Ranger, the Shadow and particularly his beloved Masked Avenger. The fact that said adventures really took place in his head meant that they seemed more vivid than they would have if they had been presented in a visual medium. In comparison to the power of the imagination, reality has a way of disappointing. He imagined the Masked Avenger as a cross between Superman and Cary Grant whereas he was played by a short, bald man. This is a great starting point for the film as it could have explored the often stark contrast between expectation and reality but this idea never really goes anywhere. It is instead more concerned with the family's love of the radio providing a form of escapism during the dark days of the Great Depression and World War II. I found that considerably less interesting, particularly since "The Purple Rose of Cairo" covered much the same territory far more effectively and cleverly.Mia Farrow certainly gives the best performance in the film as the lovably ditsy cigarette girl Sally White, who aspires to be a radio star and gets a little help in that respect from the Mafia. She has an hilariously pronounced and high-pitched New York accent and is not the sharpest tool in the shed. Along with her innocence and charm, these things make her a very endearing character. I would have preferred it if she would have gotten a film all to herself, frankly. Farrow was the only person who really got a chance to shine on this occasion. Dianne Wiest is a fantastic actress but her character Bea seems like a more comic, watered down version of Holly from "Hannah and Her Sisters". I liked the 12-year-old Seth Green's performance as the young Joe in his first major role. Julie Kavner has a big role as Joe's mother Tess while Tony Roberts, Wallace Shawn, Jeff Daniels and Kenneth Mars all have cameos but none of them get anything very interesting to do. Incidentally, Diane Keaton's cameo as the New Year's singer makes this the only Allen film in which both she and Farrow appear in spite of the fact that they were two of his most frequent collaborators in days gone by. On a very tragic note, the role of the Communist's daughter - which was largely cut - was played by Rebecca Schaeffer, who was murdered by a crazed fan in 1989.Overall, this is a rather disappointing film, not least because there are ideas on display that had such potential. Honestly though, this isn't a film that I have strong feelings about one way or the other. Mia Farrow is the only thing that really makes it stand out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"With the passing of each New Year's Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Woody Allen film that I've seen from the late 1970s and 1980s seems to have been a very personal project for him. Each of these films exist to demonstrate his unbridled passion towards something, be it New York {'Manhattan (1979)'}, Fellini {'Stardust Memories (1980)'}, movies {'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)'} or radio {'Radio Days (1987)'). Whether this is true, or whether he simply has a talent for imitating passion, the intimacy in Allen's films is what ultimately makes them must-see viewing. Despite it being one of his lesser works of the period, 'Radio Days' remains a wonderful example of the director's film-making talent: I am completely ignorant of Allen's childhood, and so, for all I know, he didn't even listen to the radio in his younger years. However, through his character's simple narration, we come to understand Joe's fondness for the radio programmes, the stars and the stories surrounding them, with each recollection triggered by something as simple as hearing a classic song one more time.Though Woody Allen restricts himself to a role as narrator, his character's younger self is played by Seth Green, a wide-eyed young kid with flaming red hair and a huge grin. His Jewish-American family is something of a peculiar group of people, each with their own quirky personalities but whose love for one another is beyond question. Though they live a modest existence in the New York neighborhood of Rockaway Beach, the family enjoys a sort of luxurious lifestyle through the wealth of programmes broadcast on the radio: while the rich and famous celebrate New Year's Eve and drink champagne, the average family can listen to them celebrating and drinking champagne, a seemingly-peculiar practice that somehow bridges the gap between the distinct classes of American society. The film unfolds as a selection of roughly-chronological episodes, not really following any clear plot, but offering a wide-ranging assortment of small anecdotes that combine wonderfully to express the narrator's undying passion for the largely-forgotten medium.Allen sprinkles the narrative with some sparkling yarns concerning the voices behind the radio, dedicating considerable time to the exploits of dim-witted singer Sally White (Mia Farrow), whose career is boosted dramatically thanks to diction lessons (her heavily Bronx-accented rendition of "Hark! I hear the cannons roar! Is it the King approaching?" proves very entertaining). However, at its heart, the film is most concerned with those whose names nobody ever knew, those working-class families who clustered around the radio each night. There's something extremely special in the scene involving Polly Phelps, a young girl who fell down a water well and didn't survive. Prior to the news broadcast of the incident, Joe's family had been in disarray, and Joe had just received a thorough spanking for his recent mischief. However, as the story unfolds, every family in America is seen huddled together around the radio, and Joe's father is clasping him tight in his arms, immediately grateful for his son. This, Allen emphasises, is the true magic of radio: it brought people together like no other invention before or since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's Home Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts with a couple of burglars winning a big prize on a game show that happens to call the home where the crime is taking place except of course the prize goes to the surprised homeowners. Amusing but what happens next? Nothing. We move on to the next story and the next after that, and so on. This movie is nothing more than a series of vignettes. It's like watching someone else's home movies, with the goofy uncle, the loving aunt, the chubby cousin, etc. If it's not your family, it gets boring after a while. No matter how lovingly it's filmed, an hour and a half of unrelated sketches is a bit too much to sit through. It's interesting that this has both of Allen's leading ladies: Keaton and Farrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days is a masterpiece, a work of art that requires multiple viewings; not so that one can get everything, but so that everything can penetrate. And, even when it does, it can be seen again so that different aspects of it can work on the viewer in different ways and strengths. It is not nostalgia- a term often tossed about with contempt, but about memory (which most art has at its core), and whether memory is a dead thing in the past or a living thing in the present, as well as whether memory changes reality or reality changes memory, or both (see my earlier comment on synaesthesia). In fact, the excellence and speed with which the jokes, ironies, and vignettes fly by makes this nearly hour and a half long film seem only a third that length- an excellent demonstration of my just stated thesis on the way memory and reality interact. Let me end by stating that, having demonstrated this film's objective greatness, I also subjectively love it; for so much of this material resonates with me, born in 1965, because I had Great Depression era parents who schooled me in the culture of decades earlier to such a point that I often feel I was born three decades earlier- in Allen's birth year. Regardless of that, Radio Days stands as a great comic invitation to an American past which sort of existed. Finding out the edges of that 'sort,' however, has rarely been as joyful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentiment without punch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even at his most sentimental, Woody Allen writes characters who, rich or poor, are gleefully corrupted. "Radio Days" is a series of vignettes centering around the popular radio shows and personalities of the early 1940s (just prior to the start of WWII and just after), and though writer-director-narrator Allen exposes a loving heart (and melancholy yearning) for this era, the film feels rather slight because Woody tends to cringe at the face of pure sentiment. He gets a familiar, funny rhythm going in the autobiographical stories of his family in the Rockaway Point region of Brooklyn, the radio always playing while his parents and relatives jokingly bicker. These bubbly nostalgic tales, however, aren't shaped, and some of them (his aunt's date with a man who confesses a gay affair, or a group of boys spying on a woman who soon becomes their substitute teacher) fall flat. The Manhattanites and radio stars are far less amusing (or interesting) than Woody's family, but at least there we have frizzy-haired Mia Farrow as a nasal-voiced coat-check girl (she gets to sing a lovely solo for the USO, and has a funny scene pleading for her life after mobster Danny Aiello kidnaps her). One presumes Woody Allen's whole-heartedness is the real thing here, and he does show a tender side (especially in a well-edited sequence with all of New York glued to a story of a little Pennsylvania girl who has fallen down a narrow well). Still, the picture has so little punch that sequences tend to ramble or fade out before they are actually finished, and Allen's mock-innocence is an amusing sham. He doesn't have an innocent bone in his body. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A photo album comes to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, you can only assume that Woody Allen is reminiscing about the youth that he gave us a quick glimpse of in Annie Hall. He takes some memories and embellishes, adding comedic (and presumably fictional) touches. What results is a string of vignettes that are funny and sometimes bizarre, although the sequence dealing with the child being rescued from a well seems a little out of place. America was infatuated with the radio in the '40s, which is the point of this film and probably the reason why the tragedy of the child rescue is included in the film--the radio didn't always deliver happy news about celebrities or news about a war that seemed like a million miles away. It's an enjoyable lark, but just that--a lark, a glimpse into Allen's memories of growing up in an ethnic household and how the radio seemed to rule the household. A good companion piece to two other Allen films: The Purple Rose of Cairo, which was about America's love affair with the movies in the '30s, and in a strange way Celebrity. New York City is beautifully photographed, and Allen fills this movie with just about every actor he's worked with--including Diane Keaton, in her first Allen film since Manhattan. But this is not one of his masterpieces, mainly because it is so episodic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something about this film threatens to overwhelm and swerve off the railway tracks in its first 15 or so minutes. The hectic editing and narrative style is something that with certain films can work, but for this, I just wasn't sure just how well it would all work. A little time later and I found myself swept up in its story and its brilliant use of structure. I think the editing certainly helped it more and while it's not flawless, it works brilliantly for the most part. Technically-, this is a great film. Story-wise, it's good but I don't think it does anything all too great. Still, this is definitely recommended and better than expected after the first few minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits and misses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am watching RADIO DAYS on Hulu as I write this. Supposedly Roger Ebert gave it four stars. I don't think all the simultaneous parallel plot lines work. The one with Mia Farrow's radio star is virtually disconnected from everything else. At least the other characters cross paths peripherally, but her story is mostly standalone and almost belongs to another movie. I think some of the bits meant to be humorous try too hard to be 'funny.' The kid getting whipped by the rabbi and his parents over the decoder ring was definitely overplayed. The Miss Gordon episode, where the boys had seen the substitute teacher undressing in front of a mirror seemed off to me. Kids that age would be giggling, embarrassed that they had seen her partially naked. They wouldn't be acting lascivious, especially if they hadn't reached puberty yet and clearly these boys were too young to have hit puberty.Another issue I have with the film is that Allen doesn't let the actors bring their own unique performance styles into the roles. Basically they are all mouthing, like puppets, Allen's latest jokes or exasperated musings-- and they all (including the women) sound like extensions of Allen's own persona. So basically it's like having Allen playing every part, just the faces and shapes of the characters are different. On the upside, the music is good. I particularly liked hearing the Carmen Miranda tune. And the coffee jingle with Kitty Carlisle Hart is certainly a highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nostalgic look at the Golden Age of radio...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that there are a few anachronisms present in the script, RADIO DAYS is a nostalgic reminder of what life was like during the '40s when the TV age was still in its infancy and not yet a part of every American household.It's a recreation of the '40s era, set in Rockaway's Playland area, presumably near Beach 116th Street, and deals fleetingly with all the elements that made up that period--including air raid blackouts, radio serials ("The Masked Avenger" is the kid's delight), pin-up stars like Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth, evening roller skating rinks for couples, the thrill of experiencing Radio City Music Hall, and the billboards of Times Square featuring the huge Camel smoker ad puffing smoke and used prominently as background for a couple of pivotal rooftop scenes.MIA FARROW does a nice job as the ditsy blonde aspiring to be an actress (complete with a New Yaaawk accent), DIANNE WIEST is a knockout as Aunt Bea, looking for romance with all the wrong suitors, and JUDY KAVNER is fine as the mother clucking over her rambunctious household brood of unruly relatives. Woody Allen is the narrator and, for a change, makes no appearance in the movie. The '40s band music is played prominently on the soundtrack adding further touches of nostalgia.The aforementioned anachronisms are simply that the girl who fell down the well (Kathy Fiscus was her name), a tabloid story that held the headlines for days, happened in April '49 (beyond the time span of the story), and the Mercury Theater presentation of "War of the Worlds" about the invasion in New Jersey of space aliens, was broadcast in 1938. Allen protects himself on both points by not mentioning the girl by actual name or going into any of the details of the story--it could have been any girl who fell down a well--or mentioning Welles or the Mercury Theater for that matter. But both well-known events happened outside the time frame of this story. Granted, he was entitled to take dramatic license and include them both.Summing up: Entertaining, but especially for those acquainted with the era in one way or another, who can better appreciate the film's setting and humorous elements in the way intended. Not one of Allen's best, in no way comparable to BULLETS OVER Broadway, which was much sharper and funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gloss of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In voiceover, Woody Allen describes his childhood in the 1940s in an unsalubrious suburb of New York. The radio is the focal point of family life and Allen describes in a series of anecdotes the effect that the songs, jingles, quiz programs, plays and news reports had on them. The anecdotes are given a gloss of reality by the fact that most of them have no dramatic shape or punchline..Allen's family is played by unknown, at least to me, actors with the exception of Dianne Wiest who plays Aunt Bea. She has a succession of unsuitable boyfriends including one who runs in terror from his car when he switches on the radio and hears Orson Welles famous broadcast of The War Of The Worlds. When he phones her the next week, she tells her sister to say that she has married a Martian.Mia Farrow plays a cigarette girl who witnesses her boss being shot in a gangland slaying. The assassin takes her home to his mother, who feeds her meatballs and offers her the recipe while discussing with her son the best place to murder the girl and dump her body. Eventually, because she is so stupid, he decides it is not necessary to kill her and, foreshadowing Bullets Over Broadway, he uses his influence with the mob to get her a part in a radio play.Other Allen stalwarts who have cameo parts include, Michael Murray, Jeff Daniels, Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton. Fletcher Farrow Previn plays one of Allens friends and Wallace Shaum turns up again as the Masked Avenger. One is tempted to think that Allen uses Shaum so often because he is the only actor he knows who is less preposessing than Allen himself.The music is even more glorious than is usual for an Allen film. Particularly memorable are Benny Goodman's version of Body and Soul and Carmen Miranda's song South American Way being mimed by the Allen family ? la Pennies from Heaven.</fullReview>

The plot is a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and actors and actresses who appeared as regulars in Allen's earlier and later films, show up here and there, sometimes in very minor roles. It's a pleasant film but hardly a laugh riot. As a survivor of the same scene in a similar childhood, though not in New York, I kept thinking of opportunities for laughter that Woody (of all people). I had an Aunt Bea (Diane Weist) who went looking for love in all the wrong places, and it wasn't a lot of laughs in real life just as it wasn't a lot of laughs in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Radio Days seems like it should be one of Woody Allen's best movies. Unfortunately, the structure is so amorphous that nothing at all registers. There are a ton of promising vignettes, but none of them are developed. Like, for instance, what happened with the burglars, or even with the prize they won for the people they were robbing? Where does Sally (Mia Farrow) fit into the story at all? What about the teacher whom the boys saw naked? Allen drops it like a hotcake. The actors are all good, but their characters aren't developed enough to really care about. I guess that they were so familiar to Allen that he forgot to do so. It's not often when an 85 minute movie seems long. I did enjoy myself watching it, but I was glad when it was over. It won't stay in my mind for more than 20 more minutes. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: This movie was, surprisingly, quite entertaining! It's narrated by Woody Allen, whose telling his story about growing up in a packed house in New York in the days of no TV and just a radio and it also follows the rise of Mia Farrow's character who starts out as a waitress and ends up a star. Some of the family scenes are funny and interesting, but I didn't see the whole point of Mia Farrow's character. Her storyline seemed a bit disconnected to the rest of the film. Anyway, the family stays in touch with the world through the radio and they enjoy music, quizzes, drama and the news by tuning in during most of the day. Its amazing to see what people used to go through to broadcast there shows. How times have changed! Basically, it's a sweet film which gives an insight about how it was for Jewish families in New York during the 1930s. Watchable!Round-Up: If your familiar with Seth Green, then you will be surprised to see how young he looks in this movie. He's the guy who plays Dr. Evils son in the Austin Powers franchise and he also supplies his voice for the Family Guy. There are some other familiar stars in the movie, like a young Dianne Keaton and Jeff Daniels, but if you blink, you will miss them. Anyway, on the whole, it's actually not a bad film from Woody Allen. Its well written and all of the characters had depth and they all took part in keeping the family together. They all put in good performances, which made the movie seem realistic and interesting.Budget: $16million Worldwide Gross: $15millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies which follows Allen as a 10 year old kid, growing up during the 1930s and being entertained by the radio. 5/10</fullReview>

The film, in both tone and visual style, is drenched in nostalgia, but it's too episodic to be involving as a story.

		<shortDescription>Allen Pays Respect to His Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radio Days (1987) *** (out of 4) Extremely well made film has Woody Allen narrating the story as he takes a look back to growing up in the late 30s and early 40s as the radio programs would have a major impact on his life. Allen tells the story of his early days growing up in New York with his rather eccentric family and how certain radio programs stuck with him through life. RADIO DAYS probably isn't going to appeal to everyone but fans of the director will get a kick out of seeing these vignettes brought to life. The young Allen is played by Seth Green and he does a very good job in his part as does Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner as his parents, Dianne Wiest as his aunt constantly looking for love and we get Mia Farrow playing a "radio voice" who's actually based on the career of Hedda Hopper. The actors are all terrific in their parts as they bring to life these stories that you can see probably had a major impact on Allen's future films including the bits with his parents constantly fighting over anything. This was also joked about in ANNIE HALL so it's funny to see some of the arguments here including the two getting into it about which ocean is better the Pacific or the Atlantic. Another great gag has the Allen character stealing from a charity so that he can buy a Masked Avenger ring only to get caught and have not only his mother and father hit him but also the rabbi. There are so many wonderful, small stories told here and some of the best happen around various true events that the family witness from the radio. One great one has the aunt out on a date when a alien invasion takes place, which of course is the Orson Welles/War of the Worlds bit. There's also a bit about Pearl Harbor and in one of the film's best moments there's a re-enactment of a little girl falling down a well in Pennsylvania. The way this sequence is edited ranks among some of the best work in the director's career and the emotion is certainly there. Whenever you deal with a film that tells small stories like this you know some are going to miss so this at times makes the film seem a tad bit uneven but in the end there's no question that there's enough heart and soul to this thing to make it worth viewing. Even better is that some of Allen's co-stars from the past make quick cameos including Tony Roberts playing a radio host and Diane Keaton plays a singer during the New Year's Eve special.</fullReview>

I got a personal kick out of relating to a bunch of New York references and sights (hey, there's Playland!) which I could relate to, having grown up around there. Woody does succeed in nailing the era he means to, and there are some occasional chuckles to be had (the opening joke with the burglars is pretty funny) but there is a general air of the ordinary to the proceedings. Mia Farrow often surprises me with her well-done characterizations in a few of these Allen films, but there doesn't seem to be much of a point to what her character's doing in this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comfortable but Unmemorable Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's films look better when he does not worry about the meaning of life or filmmaking, and when he focuses on directing behind the camera. Reflecting his childhood memory in Brooklyn in the 40s, when the radio was the main source of information and entertainment, Radio Days offers the audience comfortable nostalgia; however, the comfort ironically makes the film unmemorable. Too many subplots and side characters may be the other cause of the weakness.Allen's way to picture the past resembles Fellini's portrayal of Italy in the 30s in Amarcord; ordinary people's everyday lives are humorously caricatured. Mia Farrow may be overqualified to be in this film; but her contribution is huge, distinguishing her role's speeches before and after taking the voice diction classes.</fullReview>
