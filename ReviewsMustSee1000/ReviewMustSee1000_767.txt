		<shortDescription>The Anatomy of Dysfunction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is a powerful study of three sisters and a faithful maid who share a manse in a remote location. One of the sisters, the sympathetic and essentially good-hearted Agnes (Harriet Andersson in a gut-wrenching performance), is dying from an indeterminate cancer, and it is her slow journey towards death, its effect on her sisters and Anna the maid, and its aftermath that is the center of this story. Though why she, and not her sisters, should be afflicted, neither the movie nor Bergman can explain, and rings out as an injustice.The reason if, the other two sisters are variations of monstrous people who are successful: Karin (Ingrid Thulin) is what seems to be an icy control freak, not a horrible woman, but close, who cannot stand human touch of any kind, and we're privy to her torment in a flashback where she uses a piece of a broken wine glass to literally mutilate her vagina, seemingly enjoying it (as she shocks her husband), while writhing in unspeakable pain. Maria (Liv Ullmann) shows less, is more of an enigma and a hard character to pinpoint, but she's equally manipulative if not flatly repulsive: she not only tries to resume an affair with Agnes' doctor (who points out she her internal ugliness is starting to show through her facial expressions as she apparently enjoys this criticism) but she also fails to help her husband at a critical moment when he stabs himself in the stomach. Later on, both sisters (particularly Karin) verbally express their hatred for each other in a powerful montage that leads to a moment of equally intense reconciliation that comes without the use of dialogue and is emphasized by the swell of music (Chopin). Ingrid Thulin stands out, letting the gamut of Karin's sheer rage our out of her visage while suddenly changing back to a softer self, then to her steely image of self-control and back to fury in a snap of fingers.There's a lingering question throughout the movie: there must have been some extreme trauma, some truly horrific event (or events), that must have set forth the deluge of pain that rips throughout the entire story right up until the end. Karin herself alludes to the "tissue of lies" that could mean anything: possible sexual abuse by the unseen father, a complicity between Maria and her mother, and Agnes in the center, rejected. Although Karin does mention the revulsion she felt towards Maria, one can only wonder what it was that transpired which seems to have driven her into momentary lapses of insanity. In fact, her self-hatred mirrors Agnes' intense suffering rather closely, although both characters rarely interact and are on entirely different planes. In some ways, it wouldn't be out of place to say that Agnes, despite the unimaginable suffering she endures, serves as merely a catalyst, a materialization of the horror Karin herself has had to face. At least Agnes has experienced a form of love, if selfless, under the guise of Anna who comes to her aid, gives of her breast in an almost saint-like passion. Karin only has the cold future of her own dismal life to face. And Maria isn't even alive, but sadistically observing.Aside from PERSONA this has to be one of Ingmar Bergman's most powerful works, one that hits an audience at a gut level (cliched as though it may sound). The dominant color red only adds tension to the already tense scenes between the quartet of women (and the men, who only make pat but indelible appearances). Woody Allen would use these stylizations of the face looking dead at the camera, telling a story of its own in INTERIORS, another looks at three sisters, neither of them sympathetic. Grueling, sometimes unwatchable, this is movie watching at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quietly disturbing work of genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a perfect demonstration that horror and trauma are the stuff of real, everyday life and not the macabre vision of fantasists, Cries and Whispers marked Bergman's recovery as one of Europe's greatest film directors.Like most Bergman films, Cries and Whispers is concerned with death, the suffering before death and the re-evaluation of life that death brings. It centres on three sisters: one dying of cancer, another trapped in a repellent marriage, and the last engaged in an uncomfortable affair. Moving between these three women is the maid, who tends the dying woman in her agony and, in one stunning scene, holding her to her naked bosom like a mother holding a child.It is not, then, a barrel of laughs. Bergman films are not often for casual viewing, and I certainly won't be taking this one home to watch with my mother.Like a great classical composer, Bergman uses contrast to enormous effect. Muted sounds which force you to strain to listen are punctuated with heart-rending screams from the dying Agnes. The colour scheme is a disquieting red, fading into pastoral greens and blues as the women reminisce about their younger life.The characters also contrast uncomfortably. The two younger sisters, Karin and Maria, are sitting the deathwatch for their sister, but their task arouses no compassion in them. They are appalled and repelled by their sister's suffering, but they will not hold her hand or comfort her. The mutual dislike for each other is palpable. This contrasts with the simple humanism of their maid Anna ? whom they callously talk about firing, once their sister is dead.Set in the late 19th Century, the story flits intermittently between present and past, fleshing out the motivations and the stories of the sisters. One of these flashbacks confronts the audience with one of the most disturbing image in cinema, a repressed Karin cutting her vagina with glass to avoid sex with her husband.Only a director of Bergman's calibre could make such a film riveting. Yet riveting it is. Bergman gets sensational performances from his four main leads; regulars Liv Ullmann, Ingrid Thurin and Harriet Andersson and a majestic, understated Kari Sylwan. To call this film Ibsenesque would be a slur on the originality of Bergman's vision. It is a testimony to his genius that this may not be his best film, yet it is one of the most striking films in modern cinema. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sounds Of Cries And Whispers Or A Study In Red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of this film that is considered by many as Bergman's crown achievement came to him in his house at Faro where he lived by himself for sometime in a melancholy state of mind after a rather painful breakup. One image kept coming to him and it was a very vivid and persistent image of a red room (red walls, red furniture) and four women sitting at the window in the room and dressed by the fashion of the beginning of the 20th century. He could not shake the image out of his mind and he knew that the only way to deal with it would be to start writing about the women ? who were they, what was their relationship, their lives, their fates?.. He also knew that should the movie be made of his writing, the dominating color of it would be red. Bergman talked with affection and gratitude about his friend and long time collaborator Swen Nykwist who spent many days creating the passionate haunting red world of "Cries and Whispers. The title came to Bergman from one of the reviews on a Mozart's sonata (he does not remember which one). The sonata was described as sounds of cries and whispers? "Cries and Whispers" is about pain, death, love, lust, hate, and self-loathing. There are more than one scene in the film that I found unbearable, horrifying and depressing. In the same time, it is about beauty and power of life, every minute of it - how little we appreciated it until it is too late. Typical Bergman's subjects, Bergman's actresses giving amazing performances, strikingly beautiful ? it even hurts your eyes cinematography by Sven Nykvist - typical Bergman's masterpiece - what less do we expect from him? I admire the brilliance of it: acting, cinematography, Bergman's simple but devastating approach to Death as an inevitable part of life. The ending is heartbreaking - with Harriet's face and her words from beyond the grave about appreciating every minute of life...Powerful and devastating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bergman's Most Powerful Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon its release CRIES AND WHISPERS was hailed as one of Bergman's finest films. Although it has not quite held onto that original evaluation, it remains a very fine film--a subtle and delicately performed drama as remarkable for its silence as for its occasional moments of dialogue. And in many respects it offers an extremely good introduction to Bergman's work.Like many of Bergman's films, CRIES AND WHISPERS shows the director's preoccupations with memory, communication, time, community, and death. The story is bleak: Agnes is dying and her sisters Karin and Maria have come to attend her during this final illness--but they prove unable to communicate in a meaningful way with either Agnes or each other, and Agnes' emotional care is left largely to her long-time maid, the devoted Anna.As the film unwinds, we are bought into the memories of each woman in turn. The dying Agnes (played with powerful realism by Harriet Andersson) not only grapples with increasing pain, she recalls with regret the emotional separation that existed between her long-dead mother and herself. Sister Maria (Liv Ullman), a mindless sensualist, recalls an act of adultery that has poisoned her marriage; Sister Karin (Ingrid Thulin), who is emotionally cold, recalls an act of self-mutilation designed to thwart her husband's desires. Only the maid Anna (Kari Sylwan), with a peasant's directness, actually works to be of comfort, even going so far as to cradle Agnes' head on her naked breast and dreaming of comforting Agnes while her sisters fail.The film is ever so delicately tinged with subtle elements of lesbianism, sadomasochism, and incest, and the emotional problems experienced by Maria and Karin are at least partly sexual in nature--but these are not the focus of the film so much as they are surface indications of a deeper internal turmoil. As to what that deeper turmoil is... Bergman might say it is the nature of life itself. We each stand alone, usually in denial of our own mortality, usually unable to reach each other in any meaningful way. A deep film, and in spite of its occasional awkwardness a memorable and touching film. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, cold, profoundly desperate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see Liv Ullmann, whose nature is so warm and natural, play a role in which her warmth is superficial and fraudulent, is a little offsetting; yet, great actress that she is, she pulls it off, so that if I had never seen her before, I would believe she was that way."Cries and Whispers," much ballyhooed, I recall, when it appeared, seems too psychoanalytically intense today; dark and mysterious, beautifully filmed in an intense red-yes, very striking against the northern cold, but somehow not entirely convincing. The people are cynically presented as tortured animals caring only for themselves, without a scrap of genuine feeling for others. Anna, the maid, is the exception, so that she may serve as a foil for the rest of them.Harriet Andersson gives a striking performance as Agnes who is dying of cancer. I have seen what she portrays, and can tell you she expressed it in all its horror and hopelessness. Ullmann plays Maria, one of her sisters who touches others easily, but without real feeling, so that the touches mean nothing. For those who grew up cinematically during the seventies, she was a great, expressive, sensual, flawless star of the screen, one of Ingmar Bergman's jewels. Bergman himself of course was already a legend by the time this film was made, a great master who did what he wanted and what he felt, yet never lost sight of the audience. What he seems to be saying here is we are desperate creatures living a cold and ultimately empty existence. The ending clip seems an after thought that seeks our redemption, but it arrives too little too late. We are lost.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pain, Hate, Love, God, Death...Yet Another Bergman Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many masterpieces can one director make? In the case of Ingmar Bergman, the answer would be plenty. This is one beautiful, but very painful and at times horrifying film. I think I've yet to see another film that depicts the pain, suffering and despair of dying to such vividness that like the characters, one almost feels the need to look away. The story itself is fairly simple - a woman is in the final stages of cancer/tuberculosis and her two sisters and maid take care of her in her final days - but Bergman's unique narrative style and the complexity and depth of his script turn what at first seems a horror show into a profound meditation on faith, love and mortality. Bergman's direction is simply too perfect. The way the film is conceived visually couldn't be more evocative of its themes. The intensity of the color red to convey the hell these characters are living, and the chamber-like, claustrophobic atmosphere it creates is suffocating and exhausting. Sven Nykvist's Oscar-winning cinematography is simply one of the most inventive and unique I've ever seen in a movie. Bergman's narrative strategy is incredibly thoughtful and effective; it's like the scenes flowed into each other, and despite the horror we are to endure, there is such tact, sensitivity, attention to detail and a feeling of intimacy to every scene. It's simply glorious to behold, appreciate and let yourself be taken by the emotions and insights this film has to offer. All four actresses give spectacular performances: Harriet Andersson (Agnes) is searing physical pain personified, Liv Ullmann (Maria) is so nuanced and real in her flight sensuality (one extended scene that is a close-up to her face is astonishing in the incredible nuances of expressiveness and what the character is trying to conceal but can't), Ingrid Thulin (Karin) is chilling to the bone (and that one scene that is about mutilation in a very sensitive place is for sure one I'll never forget) and Kari Sylwan (Anna) is pure warmth, dedication and love. Bergman has a fame for depicting a bleak and pessimistic view of the world, and I won't argue with that, but I don't think his humanism is addressed very often. I had heard so many things about how depressing and horrifying this film is, and it is indeed, but it is not hopeless. Yes, Bergman suggests that the world can a horrible place and the human experience is full of pain, loneliness and cruelty, but he also suggests that if we extend our love to one another and let ourselves be loved, the burden won't be as hard to bare, and that there will be moments that will bring us love, happiness and grace, as Agnes says in her beautiful and haunting soliloquy. Agnes manages to find solace and consolation even though she's living the most excruciating hell because she allows herself to love and be loved, and her confrontation with death won't be as terrifying. Maria and Karin on the other hand, as the film suggests, will have to endure the pain and fear of dying in utter loneliness because they don't allow themselves to be loved and have lost the ability to love as well. The film is also bold and insightful enough to suggest that the most awful of circumstances in which a human being can be is paradoxically what strengthens one's faith and love, therefore sustaining one's existence.A Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death, pain, grief, guilt... and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death is one of those things that no one really likes to talk about. When a family member or loved one is terminally ill, the lives of all that surround the individual change, sometimes forever.This film deals with a terminally ill woman, her devoted servant, and the woman's two sisters, brought together by the tragedy. As the women live through the last days of their dying sister, the superficial layers of each begin to disintegrate, and we eventually see the very core of their being --and it isn't always pretty.Also not pretty are the deathbed scenes. I found them harrowing, painful and frighteningly realistic. No one at the bedside had any sense of the purpose of so much pain -- not even the priest.Bergman uses silence like other directors use explosions. The ticking and chiming of the clock are almost startling as time drags on and on. Everyone waits for the inevitable, and the inevitable takes it time.The cinematography is extraordinary, as is the use of color. Red is used to an almost overwhelming degree, but also used to perfection. When I think of red, several ideas or images come to mind, such as blood, passion, and heat. Each of these are presented in various degrees in this film.The redeeming figure in this film is the servant. Her love for the dying woman is completely unconditional and selfless. It was for her grief that I wept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ingmar Bergman's most personal statements, one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is a film that will strike at least one chord with any viewer on its emotional placement, the almost unflinching (and absolutely masterful) camera technique by Sven Nykvist, and with the characterizations from the four female leads, in-particular the dying Harriet Andersson. This is also a film that will be very hard to stomach for most (it was at times for me), with it's sheer display of constant despair and grief, and the overall state of mind these characters hold. Ullman plays Agnes, marked with Tuberculosis, she lays on her death bed like a zombie writhing in pain for the eventual end, with her two sisters, Maria and Karin, and the servant Anna, at her bedside, though seeming at a distance (except for Anna). Bergman also views Maria and Karin's relationships with themselves and their husbands, both rather brutal (Karin has a scene with a shard of glass that had me gasp). The examination of these roles, and the entire feel of the house, which is always shown as red as blood, make this in the realm of cinematic drama a shocker, and a masterwork to be certain. There's only one aspect of the film that I can criticize: many times in the film Bergman uses a red screen to fade in and fade out, and then again a few seconds later, and this seems to have not much purpose to the symbolic impact since the inside of the house conveys enough that these people are in a metaphorical house of hell already, and the fadings don't add any weight to it. Nevertheless this is one director's great films, a landmark in fact, though this doesn't mean it's quite as accessible as The Seventh Seal or even the epic Fanny and Alexander. This is cinema for those who almost enjoy, paradoxically, their intestines ripped out and stomped on the floor only to find out it was just an unforgettable dream. Swedish movies rarely get this visceral. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first brush with Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a haunting and shattering film experience, as promised.I've never before seen a Bergman film, however, judging by the praise awarded to "Cries and Whispers," I decided to try this one out first. And I couldn't have been more rewarded. The film, even though it clocked in at a short ninety-one minutes, I estimate less than half of those minutes contained dialogue. As Gloria Swanson put it in "Sunset Boulevard," they "had faces." And how they used them! The facial expressions and mannerisms the characters in this film used were breathtaking. Going from Liv Ullman's smug, teasing grin in her flashback scene with the doctor to Ingrid Thulin's anguish-cum-rhapsody in the scene with the broken class (that undoubtedly stays in the minds of all who see the film for one reason or another!) is truly incredible. Each character uses their body language to convey the meaning of their characters and their situations. In fact, I could have watched the film in Swedish without English subtitles and still have known perfectly well what was going on. The dialogue was truly superfluous and unnecessary. Combining the characters' body language with Bergman's masterful use of color to convey the personalities of the characters as well as their environment in general is something that (1) I've scarcely, if ever, seen used in a film before and (2) could not stop marvelling at its brilliance. The performances were top notch. All of the performances by the four leading ladies were exceptional and perfect in every way. The homoeroticism that pervades the film is perfectly captured by the ladies in a manner that is not sexual, but rather something the farthest possible being from sexuality.I do not even need to speak of Sven Nykvist's cinematography beyond that it is perfection incarnate.I am now convinced that Bergman is a master, and I cannot wait to see another of his films! Sure, the film is depressing and certainly is not for those who think that "The Italian Job" is the best film of the year, however, for those who can just watch the relationships of the sisters unfold in all its splendor and anguish, this is truly a work of art rivalling those of any medium.MY RATING: 10/10 (and I don't give tens lightly)HIGHLIGHTS: Liv Ullmann, Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Kari Sylwan, Sven Nykvist's cinematography, Bergman's use of color and his direction in general</fullReview>

In fact, as a master cabinetmaker myself, I see that the craft is overly dramatic, asserting its own craftsmanship. It is not a real piece of furniture so much as an expert dramatization of one.My mother is typical: instead of a useful, beautiful piece, she'll take one that affirms her appreciation for richness any day. That's why this film exists.It is very finely made in all departments. In fact, it is assertive in advertising how finely made it is. Where Tarkovsky would have given a dwelling that has natural depth, this one is almost stagily garish. Where Kurosawa would have framed situations, here we have situations overtly subservient to frames. Where, say, Tennesse Williams (or dozens of others) would take us on a journey through our own soul involving pain, here we have the pain alone with no apparent purpose than to support the richness of the project.What punishment is planned in Bergman's Lutheran Hell for a master who wastes his gift on merely displaying it?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sven Nykvist's expressive, Oscar-winning cinematography is the real star of this grave and painful drama from Sweden, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three sisters at the turn of the century, one of them slowly dying, ruminate on their lives, miring the story in a series of flashbacks. The women (Liv Ullmann--who also plays her mother, Harriet Andersson, and Ingrid Thulin) are merely pawns on Bergman's proverbial chessboard, and their sibling rivalries and contentions are not mounted for the standard showdowns or fireworks (which is a plus for certain audiences). Still, no momentum builds on what Bergman does give us. Ullmann, as the flirtatious Maria, is a sexy presence, yet the film's undercurrent of sexual psychosis is murky and seems unrealized. Film was brought Stateside by Roger Corman, of all people, after Bergman could not get a major U.S. distributor. It's a work of art to many viewers, a trial dressed in blood red to others. ** from ****</fullReview>

It's probably the fact that I lost someone close to me recently and the movie evoked some negative emotions from me so maybe that is actually a good thing. Pain, hate, and judgement serve as the premise for this film, which happens to be my first Bergman experience so I had no real idea of what to expect. The world within the film is cold and dull, a reflection on the movie itself in my opinion. I couldn't get myself to care for the characters whatsoever. I don't think there was one thing I enjoyed during this film. It's just too simple and too slow for my liking, but hell this is a movie about the human condition and when you're following three depressed souls like these you can't exactly go in a different direction than the way this film went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autumn attrition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A single bell rings plaintively over scarlet credits and a dawn view of an estate's verdant courtyard. Inside, a woman lies dying in a scarlet-sheeted bed. Her auburn-haired sister rests on a scarlet chaise lounge, an easy smile on her lips. Time slowly passes on ornate Stockholm grandfather clocks. The screen fades to scarlet. Setting a mesmeric mood from the outset is vital for this, a film about staring inward and confronting the burden of existence.The dying woman is Agnes (Harriet Andersson), whose exterior agony obscures a divine spirit. Maria (Liv Ullmann), the auburn-haired sister, has an easily lovable face and a conditional heart. The juxtaposition of their faces at the film's beginning encapsulates one of Bergman's primary concerns: the inseparable, misleading link between exterior and interior states. Anna (Kari Sylwan), humble, lifelong servant to sisters Agnes, Maria, and imperious Karin (Ingrid Thulin), has a straightforward gaze, an open face, and a wellspring of compassion. She and Agnes form a connection apart from the sisters, as they are both selfless and pious, their souls ripe for grace.Maria and Karin, adrift in a scarlet swirl of memories, are haunted by traumas of the past. Bergman sets up their reminiscences in identical, meditative fashion: close-ups on their half-shadowed faces, their eyes illustrating unbearable thoughts as a collection of hushed voices rise on the soundtrack before the screen fades to scarlet, commencing snapshots of their souls narrated by an omniscient male voice. What they're haunted by is far from the ethereal stuff of dreams, but tangible moments of weakness and dread: Maria's horror at her oblique cruelty at a life-or-death moment and Karin's fear of filling out an unfeeling, meaningless existence that leads her to commit an act of self-mutilation. Their mutual loneliness leads them to one another and a temporary spiritual breakthrough. The offhand cruelty with which this connection is severed is the film's greatest tragedy, which destroys one sister's potential to love and signals an apathetic regression for the other. Twelfth Night, which they've celebrated in their family home since childhood, is their tenuous next encounter, resigning them to a circuitous life of re-treading the past, ghosts in an incestuous shared dwelling.But what of Anna's vision? It's set up exactly as Maria and Karin's memories (sans male narrator to introduce the event), but details a miraculous scenario that's a window into Anna's eternal care-giving nature. Her dream's unreality?shot with calculated zooms and tracks that depart from the entombed staging of the others?casts a modicum of doubt on the veracity of Maria and Karin's memories: did their traumas actually occur or are they merely manifestations of the sisters' interior sickness? If the latter, then the relative materiality, punitive bloodletting, and contained form fascinatingly evoke spiritual attrition, whereas Anna's "soul," with its freer form, generously courts death to help another achieve salvation, thereby exorcising its own repressed scars. Even the eulogizing priest, who prays that Agnes carry the message of human misery to God, can't boast such purity of faith. Only simple, pious Anna has the lightness of spirit to deliver her beloved Agnes into the next world and to carry within her Agnes's words of gratitude for the ephemeral joys of life.With Cries and Whispers, Bergman gave the human soul an illuminating shape and texture, contradicting the notion that his entire vision of human existence was draconian bleakness. In his images of suffering, one encounters not a dead end but a fine light twinkling faintly with hope, a spiritual optimism embodied by Agnes's final, autumnal memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and sometimes an excructiating cinematic experience is just an excruciating cinematic experience. The sets were jarring. There is no story. There is no character development. Beauty, of any type, is sparse. However, there is pain - and lots of it! Is that the mark of a great film - pain without reason, resolution, or purpose? I don't see how that is 'art'.Where is the deep meaning? Or, is there meant to be anything more than pain, suffering, and death? Hopefully there is some great lesson here and I'm just too ignorant to have seen it; otherwise, all those people who hold this movie in high regard must have fallen prey to Art Student Pitfall Number 1: "If you don't like it, understand it, or think it skillful, but it is held in reverent awe by the art establishment, keep discussing it in late night bull sessions with your friends and you're bound to justify it to some vague degree eventually". Why take the time to try to rationalize something this void? Just call it what it is - a pretentious, painful bore - and spend your evening watching Citizen Kane for the tenth time. You're guaranteed to get something new with each viewing.Honestly, if you want to watch Bergman, rent "The Seventh Seal". At least there is one great image in that film; and, the idea of playing chess with Death will keep you and your friends amused into the wee hours of the morning.However, if you insist on watching it, do yourself a favor and heed my advice: take two Coen Bros, and call me in the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's most cheerful work is a powerful exercise in redness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think the previous Bergmans were drenched in depression and hatred of life, you will be surprised by the cheerful nature of this very red film.This wonderfully red movie is about a woman who is dying (surprisingly, not from a suicide attempt) and her sisters and their husbands. There is wretchedness, there is depression, there is crying and whispering (here the movie delivers on its promise), there is a woman masturbating(?) with a piece of broken glass (very, very ARTISTIC scene), there is a fat maid day-dreaming of zombie-like resurrection, and last but not least - yes ? there is a suicide attempt, as well. Only one suicide attempt? Well, yes. You see, Ingmar was in one of his better moods when he wrote the script for this reddish film. Apart from the wounded stomach of the self-stabber, the mental agony pervading the minds of every character, the cut-up vagina (that broken-glass business), and the physical pain of the dying woman - there isn't much misery in "Cries &amp; Whispers". It is an uplifting film about the human spirit. Oh, yes: and the "human condition". Gotta use that term. Always impresses the reader. Yes, the "human condition". Deep stuff. Whenever a drama is made by a European director ? and it happens to be about the "human condition" ? you just KNOW it HAS to be good. Because, after all, we are all human, and we all have conditions. Right? Is that how it works? Sorry, I'm not "deep" and "intelligent" enough to understand the full extent of the complexity that is to be found in a Bergman drama. Will someone explain "human condition" to me? I am so confused by these profound ideas? My tiny mind cannot possibly comprehend the full extent of what Ingmar tries to convey in his red/brown movies. "Cries &amp; Whispers" is so much more than just what appears at the surface. A bunch of dull women shouting at each other? No, it's more than that. It's more? Please explain, someone!How best to describe this powerful drama, this ultimate statement about the "human condition" and all that it entails? Red. Well, red-brown. That is how I see this film. It is reddish and it is brownish. In other words, no green or blue. I am informed by Roger Ebert, a famous gourmet and film-critic, that Bergman sees "the inside of the human soul as a membranous red". Well, "Fffffffascinating!...", as Basil Fawlty would say. So the inside of the human soul is red. We've established that much. Now, what is the inside of Bergman's fans' heads? I'll tell you what: the insides of his fans' heads are full of baloney which they read from various pretentious critics, that glorify Bergman's rather mediocre movies. This, in turn, puts some viewers under pressure to appreciate Bergman's crap more than they normally would. After all, film critics know what they are talking about, right? They finished their movie schools, right? The truth is that even many film critics are under pressure to love Bergman. How can you do that job and not like Bergman? I mean, come on! We can't take you seriously unless you consider him a genius!Back to the movie. There are some truly touching scenes when the fat servant girl takes her breasts out and slaps them on the dying woman's face. Did she do this to comfort her? To please her latent homosexual urges? To please Bergman's urges? Or perhaps she did this so that the movie can have its obligatory "ARTISTIC NUDE SCENE". After all, what pretentious European drama can be the movie monolith that it is if it doesn't have at least one scene of nudity mixed with perversion, all nicely camouflaged as "a message"; whatever meaning those brilliant movie critics attach to it. And where there is "a message" there must be ART, right?However, there is ONE thing that redeems this movie: the tuneful, beautiful Swedish language. Its soft sounds bang ever-so-gently against my ear-drums, making me beg for deafness in all its silent glory.If you are unhappy with Ingmar's movies as they are, which you must be, just google "Vjetropev Bergman Spoofs" and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved Bergman. Have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an expose' on mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" by Ingmar Bergman takes a deep unrelenting look into the very depths of the human persona and picks out what defines us for better or worse. Each character in this film, besides the men whom all form some kind of dispassionate and melancholy homogeneous mixture, is a deep well of emotion and intricacy.Agnes is a deeply devout woman who has lived for years, possibly decades, with an excruciatingly painful terminal illness. Despite this grim fate when she isn't writhing in pain she displays a pleasant, appreciative, and welcoming demeanor overflowing with affection. She even said towards the very end of the movie in a flashback borough back through the recitation of her diary how appreciative she is for the life she's been given, considering a simple day with her two sisters outdoors as the happiest she's ever been.Maria is a childlike, silly girl who consistently displays whimsical and yet empty expressions draped across her face as if they were an accessory. She is extremely deceptive and manipulative, while one initially takes her convincing attempt to kindle a sense of closeness with Karin we later find out with revulsion that this was simply a ploy to get her where she could have some kind of sadistic sense of upper handedness.Karin is a frigid woman who blurts out cruel, yet sometimes accurate assessments of those around her. Even when Agnes has just passed away we don't see the slightest sign of remorse or even distraction. Quite the opposite, in fact she chooses to spend this time going over the families monetary acquisitions and "balance the books", so to speak. Sadly, when she does crack open the door to her heart while speaking with Maria she's swiftly punished with cruel and malicious contempt, joyously displayed by the very person whom she chose to finally open up to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the fact, that I only gave this 6 out of 10 will make quite a few people not liking my review. And I can understand that some people are very into this movie. I would have loved to feel the same way, but although I think it superb (from a technical viewpoint) it didn't do as much as movie itself to me.I guess the recent movie Amer might be one to compare this with, though even that did more to me, even without a coherent plot to follow that this one. One thing is for sure though: This might not be the right choice to start, if you haven't seen any Bergman before. The fact that they had a Bergman retrospective in Berlin was a good way for quite a few people to get their Bergman or rediscover him.Discovering is also a theme in the movie, which might bedazzle or not. Depending on your view of that, it will do either wonders and make you love this or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not slowness of pace that is the problem, but the lack of insight expected by a master of Bergman's calibre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally don't like using 'it has its merits' to describe a film. If it's not a backhanded compliment, a diplomatic way of saying 'it doesn't suck eggs but comes awful close to it', then it's just short of that. But 'it has its merits' is all the good will I can muster for a movie where the liveliest thing about it is the fire-engine red of the walls and drapes. A crushing deadly bore for most of its duration, the movie suddenly jumps to life through grotesque shenanigans somewhat atypical for Bergman before settling back to its catatonic stupor. My problem with it is not slowness of pace. If blockbuster extravaganzas where terrorists hold entire cities at ransom and secret agents battle supervillains in space stations orbiting around Earth need a fast breakneck pace to sustain our interest as they sprawl their way around aerial shots of the Pentagon and Monte Carlo, then it's only fair that narrative time be stretched out to allow us to observe the subtle shades and minutest nuances of human psychology. But Cries and Whispers doesn't earn that slow pace. Bergman keeps his usual soliloquys at a bare minimum but doesn't have anything with which to fill that absence. The scene near the end where the two sisters visit dead Agnes in her deathbed hammers home the same point as the entire first half of the film. And how about the denouement with Agnes' reverie in the garden? Was it meant to be cynical (her last happy memory of peace and tranquility was with people who would show indifference and coldness to her in her waning days) or bittersweet hopeful (small moments of happiness is the best one can expect from life but they're worth all the pain and anguish)? Good acting and cinematography aside, such enduring staples in Bergman's career that would more shine with their absence than their presence, the movie doesn't have a particularly profound insight into human nature to depart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MST3K Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would have been a good movie for "Mystery Science Theater 3000" to take up. After all, if this movie is going to have characters stand around not saying very much, and then have them sit around not saying very much, and then have one of them lie in bed dying of cancer and not saying very much, and then have two sisters talk to each other without giving the audience the benefit of hearing what they are saying, the "MST3K" team might just as well have supplied some witty dialogue.I suppose Ingmar Bergman, while making this movie, said to himself, "Boy, all my movies are profound, but I'm really being profound in this one," and I suppose those people who make up the art house crowd shared in that opinion. I mean, what can be more profound than making a depressing movie about the slow, agonizing death of a cancer victim; a maid who comforts that cancer victim by giving her the benefit of a couple of naked breasts; a woman who cuckolds her husband until he impales himself, who then actually asks her to help him (how exactly?); two sisters teasing us with a little lesbian incest; one of those sisters telling her maid to quit looking at her just before she gets completely naked while the maid looks at her; and that same sister picking up a piece of broken glass and shoving it up her vagina so that she can smear the blood all over her face in front of her husband?As for this last, I thought that after she forced the broken glass up her vagina she was going to invite her husband to have sex with her. Normally, such a twisted thought would never cross my mind, but it seemed like a reasonable expectation at the time. If Bergman had put that in the movie, it really would have been profound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A constant uneasiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I can't say that I've seen many Bergman films, and I don't want to imply that one bad apple ruins a whole bunch of movies, however "Cries and Whispers" leaves much to be desired. The whole film has a very claustrophobic feel to it, and while that may be the feel Bergman intended inducing in the audience, the film is not powerful enough to make me want to come back for more. The majority of the story takes place indoors, and involves only a handful of characters. Deep reds that dominate the color palette of the film only serve to heighten the negative experience of watching this movie, and the uneasiness that ensues continues to nibble on your comfort zone until the film ends. An uneasy feel in a film can be very efficient in driving the audience to disinterest if the filmmaker isn't careful, and that's the case in this film. In some instances Bergman REALLY pushes the boundaries of his audience's tolerance for getting out of their comfort zone, and in this critic's opinion, it's entirely unnecessary. Perhaps if Bergman hadn't made the film so nausea-inducing and filled with drama that failed to advance the plot, he could have more strongly conveyed the theme of appreciation for life and enduring through great suffering. The theme of sibling rivalry plays a big part in this film as well, and though I may be biased due to the fact that for most of my life I was raised an only child (with the exception of when I learned the ups and downs of having a stepbrother my own age), I feel like the petty rivalry between the sisters in the movie only serves to distract from much deeper issues like the nature of suffering and why life is worth living at all. It had the potential for greatness, but ultimately watching "Cries and Whispers" only left me feeling unfulfilled and a bit queasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, and painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adore Bergman, but have to be honest. This is the least enjoyable film by him that I've watched, and it's hard to fathom how highly acclaimed it is.In a nutshell, two sisters (Liv Ullman and Ingrid Thulin) are at the deathbed of a third (Harriet Andersson). Andersson's character is in pain, but the sisters have great difficulty empathizing with her. The three are cold and isolated from one another, and it's only the housemaid (Kari Sylwan) who provides any comfort.Through flashbacks, the film gives insight into their characters. One of these is highly disturbing (stop reading now and avert your gaze if you're squeamish) ? and has Thulin mutilating her genitals and smearing the blood on her face in front of her husband.Some adjectives to describe the film: cold, bleak, slow, depressing...should I go on? It is emotionally honest, yes, but it doesn't ask the big questions about God, death, life, or love ? it just shows us how sad our little existences can be, even when living in luxury as the three sisters do, and how pitiful dying is.It was great to see Harriett Andersson again, 20 years after her first Bergman film, 'Summer with Monika', and she has the movie's best line in the final memory, a happy (and profound) moment on a swing with her sisters: "I wanted to cling to that moment, and I thought?Come what may, this is happiness. I cannot wish for anything better. Now, for a few minutes, I can experience perfection. And I feel profoundly grateful to my life, which gives me so much..." If only there were more of those moments, or philosophical questions raised. As it is, it's too painful to watch or recommend. I have a feeling the 5 Oscar nominations were more a reward for Bergman's films in the 50's and 60's, most of which were genius, and would have me thinking about them for hours afterwards. It's hard to imagine anyone giving 'Cries and Whispers' a high rating wanting to see it again.</fullReview>

It is a highly dramatic work of art. I should notice that I am very rigorous on my rating system: 8/10 is for an excellent film, indeed less than 100 films that I have seem score 9 or higher. So one shouldn't think that I found this film bad, only that it wasn't among my favorites ever.The camera work of this film is excellent and the cinematography looks like something from a late Kubrick film.Highly recommended for fans of art films that have a plot, characters and drama (which some Bergman films lack, such as The Seventh Seal).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I suffer, then I exist ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" tackles one of Bergman's most emblematic subjects: communication, less as a way to express a message but as a vehicle for emotions or a vehicle leading to one's soul. The film is set in a large estate mansion, at the eve of the 20th century. It strikes by a predominance of red, tainted by the virginal white worn by three sisters. The symbolism is so striking that I guess we shouldn't get too far analytically, red refers to the emotions, the pain, the passion, and the very expression of what makes humans living persons (in "Persona", it was only when she walked on broken glasses or when she was threatened by boiling water that Liv Ullman started to talk). Bergman never dissociates life from pain and passion, and the reddish abundance remarkably contrasts with the restrained directing. The mansion is occupied by three sisters: Harriett Anderson is Agnes, dying of cancer, and she projects the ghostly mask of an imminent death so extraordinarily it's hard to think she was the luscious Monika, twenty years before. Liv Ullman and Ingrid Thullin play the two other sisters, Maria and Karin. Maria's youthful beauty and Karin's cold classiness are predictable characteristics from women of their class, and Bergman uses insightful flashbacks to enrich their personalities. Maria, disenchanted by her marriage, openly flirts with David, the doctor (Erland Josephson), the romance is so anticlimactic that it cancels off the first feeling Maria's lively personality inspires and her rejection of a despaired suicidal husband is a blatant display of heartlessness. Karin seems to be the rejected one and in a very hard-to-watch scene, she expresses her hatred toward her husband by mutilating herself with a piece of broken glass and triumphantly licking her lips, with a shocking defying look. "I suffer, then I exist" resonates like Bergman's Cogito. Ignoring compassion, Maria is below suffering; caricaturing it for selfish reasons, Karin is above it. And ironically, despite her agony, Agnes is the closest to what life represents. Yes, she suffers, but her pain is authentic. She makes some of the most realistic and dreadful agonizing sounds I'd never have experienced in my life but as painful as they were for the ears, they also expressed a vivid and ferocious attachment to life, like begging God to end this nightmare. It's like a Christic realization that life is all about feeling and suffering, and more than that, accepting suffering as a part of life and resigning to it. Both Maria and Karin are incapable of that for they are too disillusioned and too blinded by their own egos. And the strike of genius in the writing, to show where the soul's salvation can rely on, is the character of Anna, the round-cheeked maid, played all in nuance and profound humanity by Kary Sylwan. Anna wakes up in the morning, kneels before God, and pray for the soul of her daughter, and after that, she bites into an apple. She embodies the resignation to live, to love those who're present as much as those who were. She's the only one who takes care of Agnes with a maternal affection, putting her head on her bosom, caressing her and providing her the kind of maternal affection, one would need before dying. The toughest soldiers cry to their mommies when they're mortally wounded, anyone would love to have an Anna staring at him with affectionate and motherly eyes to catch the last breath. And what makes Anna so exceptional is that she is the only character, driven by faith and genuine affection, and through her, Bergman strangely accredits a certain positive role to religion. "Cries and Whispers" expresses Bergman's existential dilemma about the mindset that should prevail in life and how it takes its full meaning only facing death. The dilemma is even more puzzling because Bergman gives a chance to Maria and Karin to communicate, without the help of God. Dressed in black, they're mourning Agnes' death and the spirit that was theirs when they were expecting her to die. More lucid then, they comprehend the necessity to overcome the distance, to communicate, before one of them is bed-ridden again. And the miracle almost happens in a scene of authentic poignancy, when they start caressing each other like frail little animals, seeming to discover a whole word within the other's look. No words, except violin music, in one of Bergman's greatest moments, showing that it's never too late to reach a soul.But the film gets back to its initial pessimistic state, after a night vision, when they are incapable to talk to their sister and when the two sisters discuss with their respective husbands whether Anna should stay, or leave, with a little keepsake reminding her of Agnes. In their minds, Agnes became history, and as if they were all drunken by the whole deadly ambiance, the hangover finally passed. Anna refuses the keepsake for she had the most previous thing anyone could have, the conscience of having helped a soul to face pain and death, symbolized by the journal she finds in the drawer, revealing one of the few moments of sheer happiness, Agnes lived. This memory seems to indicate the end of Agnes' torment, her soul probably resting in peace and harmony. Is it heaven? Anna would believe so, as she would certainly believe the same if it was her own death, and she would probably deal with it with a wise serenity. As for us, and maybe Bergman, we'd rather share Anna's existential view than Maria or Karin, who'd probably have more miserable deaths. Some take the suffering as a proof of God's nonexistence, other as the proof of life, then as God's greatest miracle, and the price of that miracle is that we should also accept our mortality. I don't think Bergman supports the belief in God, but believing in nothing is not a better alternative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a very creepy, dark film that was an amazing show for people who like that kind of movie. This movie has a great use of camera work and it truly speaks to me. The use of red throughout the movie added a very dark mood and also a recurring theme: blood. I believe that Bergman was aiming to get this into the audience's minds, and he for sure succeeded. This movie effected me in many ways, especially emotionally. One of the main characters, Agnes, who is suffering from a death causing illness, is stuck at home trying to cope with that illness. Unfortunately, neither of her sisters, Karin and Maria, could help her or really seemed to care to help her. The only person who stepped up to the plate was their maid, Anna. This really effected me because I was surprised that they really weren't trying to help her even though she was their sister. When I watched this film, I was fascinated at the whole storyline and how everything played out. The only thing that I didn't like very much was the ending, but I can't think of any other way of ending it without making the story less powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this movie could have been about or was partly about exploring family relationships and how an anticipated death can make people act. I didn't really get much more out of it than that. I definitely had trouble understanding the overall message it was trying to relay to its audience. Regardless, I can definitely applaud Bergman for provoking extremely heavy emotion. I didn't even fully understand what this movie was about, but left it with the most unsettling and intense feeling. From the music, to the moments of deep silence, to the close up shots, and to the extremely blunt and graphic scenes, Bergman stirs many dense emotions. It created such a heavy and unsettling feeling within me to the point where I felt anxiety during and after the movie. I definitely need to watch it again to try to find more meaning within it, but it's worth watching just for the emotional experience of it. It's amazing how (and proves how) movies can completely consume your emotions.</fullReview>

If there was a positive note that I could take from viewing this movie, is that Bergman does a tremendous job of really rubbing in those brutal moments. Along with disturbing images, we are forced to stare at the soulless faces of the characters due to close-ups that can last minutes at a time. Unfortunately these close-ups result in extremely slow story development, and makes the viewer beg for a disturbing image to pick up the pace.

		<fullReview>"It is early Monday morning and I am in pain."Agnes(Harriet Andersson in a heartbreaking performance) is dying. Its an illness that doesn't hesitate in the infliction of pain. That's part of the reason why CRIES AND WHISPERS is so melancholy. She has two sisters. Maria(Liv Ullmann) and Karin(Ingrid Thulin, nothing short of extraordinary in an extremely difficult part). Anna(Kari Sylwan, whose face is angelic) is her maidservant and intimate, loyal companion.Maria is delicate and refined, sensual and passionate, hard to resist when she makes advances towards a cautious David(Erland Josephson), Agnes' doctor, who has a desire for her yet pulls back, restraining himself. We are privy to an instance where Marie's husband was gone for the night giving her the opportunity to sleep with David, inclement weather the perfect excuse to keep him at the house so she could seduce him. Marie's husband, Joakim(Henning Moritzen), knows his wife is unfaithful; it's present in his demeanor, his eyes. As a result of her adultery, he makes a shocking decision because of the overwhelming sorrow which overtakes him.There's nothing easy(unless you're a sadist)about watching someone die a slow, agonizing death but director Bergman doesn't pull his camera away from it. Like her sisters and Anna, we experience it, must endure the tormenting points where she struggles for air, begging for help, no salve available to ease her suffering. Her torture is physical--Karin's is far worse actually.Karin is a neurotic mess. She's married to a cold, unfeeling man(Georg ?rlin) who dictates himself in an ordered, controlled manner, demanding for his wife to be obedient and subservient to his needs and goals. He's a self-absorbed diplomat who thinks highly of himself, his stature, his supposed importance in the Swedish bourgeoisie. We witness Karin mutilating herself with a piece of broken glass just so she could feel something; it's obvious Karen is caught in this empty void where love is far distant.Look, I perfectly understand why some have a hard time with Bergman's movies. They often deal with cruel characters who mistreat each other and say hurtful comments which come from a dark place which often result in irreparable consequences. A number of Bergman films have these characters who have buried feelings deep inside and soon there's a volcanic eruption of words announcing to their appropriate target what had remained repressed for so long. Agnes wants comfort and peace, but her sisters can not seem to offer it to her, but Anna will without fail. Anna is our emotional center for, out of the three, she's the most caring and honorable, giving all and expecting nothing in return. The other two aren't able to do so and leave the film, after a moment where they appeared to have reconnected, in the same shape they did upon their arrival to Agnes' home. As always, cinematographer Sven Nykvist delivers powerful camera shots of the faces of the principles at the most opportune times when all that lies underneath sneakily surfaces. I imagine those who have lost loved ones to cancer, especially the kind which ate at them methodically, will find CRIES AND WHISPERS to be an excruciating experience. I myself found it a chore to watch Agnes writhing in agony, wanting to look away so badly, yet knowing that it was important to recognize how precious life is and how often I take it for granted. You'd think Maria or Karin had learned something from this experience..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pain, passion, sisterhood, love and death in another Ingmar Bergman masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Bergman's best films along with The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Fanny and Alexander and Persona. Whether it is the most accessible of Bergman's films I am not sure(of his masterpieces I'd say Wild Strawberries and of his films overall probably The Magic Flute), but it perhaps his most emotionally complex film. Bergman's films on the most part have superb direction and thought-provoking screenplays and Cries and Whispers is no exception on both counts, in fact it is one of the finer cases of being so. It is incredibly well made, with luscious cinematography by Sven Nykvist, an unforgettable manor house setting and a red colour scheme that proves just mesmerising. The music is also hauntingly beautiful. Harriet Andersson wrenches the gut as Agnes, while Liv Ullman and Ingrid Thulin are equally as effective. As is Kari Sylwan, whose grief as the peasant maid provides some of the most moving moments of Cries and Whispers. What really distinguishes Cries and Whispers aside from the production values, Bergman's direction and Andersson's performance is the story, which focuses on the failure of love and agony of loss. The family drama is intense, the agony of loss aspect is just harrowing and the use of memories and fantasies help to make the failure of love parts deeply moving. Overall, a masterpiece that is emotionally complex, superbly directed, beautifully acted and made and is moving, intelligent and harrowing in equal bouts. May not be for all tastes, but my advice generally is don't miss it. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some trouble relating to this movie. I have two sisters and I was shocked to see the relationship of the three sisters in the film. It is a bit heartbreaking to see the strain in their relationship and their yearn to connect with each other. I found it surprising that Maria refuses to acknowledge her shared moment with Karin, when she was the one who wanted to be closer. It was sad the way the characters got in the way of themselves. They yearn to connect but refuse to at the same time. Bergman does a wonderful job of exposing each character's essence. It was very heartwarming that Agnes and Anna were able to really connect. In this movie red represents the human soul, I thought this was true for blood. In the scene where Maria's husband hurts himself and the scene where Karin hurts herself, that I really felt the characters were baring their souls in the only way they knew how. They couldn't express themselves emotionally so they did it physically. This film does an excellent job in exposing how lonely people can be and the different ways death can affect people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Bergman's greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the opening shots this film speaks volumes without having to listen to one line of dialogue. One of the great things about Ingmar Bergman's films is that he can tell stories without flooding your ears with explanations. This story is about pain and even though a central character is dying a painful death, it's the inner pain of the other characters that is shattering. Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is the one dying and her two sisters and the maid take care of her in her last hours. As the film continues we learn more about each character through flashbacks as the death of Agnes has made the others come together. Maria (Liv Ullmann) is flirty and more shallow and in her flashback we see her having an affair with David (Erland Josephson) the local doctor. When her husband Joakim (Henning Moritzen) comes home he figures out what is going on and attempts suicide. Instead of helping him, Maria backs away. The other sister is Karin (Ingrid Thulin) who is depressed and self loathing and she is in a loveless marriage to Fredrik (Georg Arlin) who is much older than her. She self mutilates her vagina with a shard of glass to keep her husband from being intimate with her. The maid is Anna (Kari Sylwan) and she truly loves Agnes and she is also religious and the story gives a hint that maybe Anna and Agnes were lovers but this might just be Anna's motherly nature. Agnes finally dies and its through her death that Maria and Karin now must face one another. Something has happened to these siblings but Bergmann doesn't let on what that is. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Towards the end of the film the two sisters let Anna go and tell her that she can take a token of Agnes's memory. She says "No" but at the end we see her with Agnes's journal and reading about a good day in her life. Anna is the only good hearted person in the film and its pure Bergman that this character is treated so callously by the others. Bergman was an agnostic and the treatment of Anna is reminiscent of the ending to Robert Altman's "The Player". In that film Cynthia Stevenson's character was good natured which has no place in Hollywood! Here, Anna is discarded without so much as a thought. But I think Bergman admires Anna. She is a pivotal character to counteract the misery of Maria and Karin. This film won an Academy Award for cinematography and the great Sven Nykvist shot it. The use of colors is very evident throughout this film and red and black are the dominant tones. The walls inside the mansion are red and so are some of the curtains. During the flashback sequences the scene would fade in and out with the color red. Bergman wanted red to symbolize the inside of a bleeding soul. After Agnes's death the characters wear black dresses to mourn and its in striking contrast with the red walls. These shots are beautiful to look at. There is so much to discuss with this film but just let me say that this is the bleakest film that Bergman ever directed. Even more so than in "Persona" which was more dialogue driven. Harrowing story is a must for all that love independent and foreign films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't endorse this movie fully. I'd love to, because I found so much that was wonderful in it. The cinematography was artful, the performances riveting. I will leave the discussions of the women to others: The portrayals of the two husbands, and the doctor, which are at most 10 minutes each, were incredible. The cuckolded husband, the man married to the frigid woman, the doctor attracted and yet repelled by the sensuous Maria. Amazing.For all that, though, I felt let down by the film. Perhaps it is because I don't speak the language, and have to rely on subtitles. Perhaps I lost something by seeing it on the small screen. Perhaps I'm just ignorant. Maybe I'm looking for more than is really there.Either way, I'm just not sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The silence of a Bergman film can tear the flesh right from your body</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman makes the sorts of intellectually challenging films that are almost not allowed anymore. The younger generation is basically taught that the sorts of profound questions that Bergman asks (and Bergman more than any other auteur, for even the most highly respected auteurs, Truffaut, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, shied away from subjects such as Bergman has tackled) are unnecessary. They are taught this because, if they were to willingly examine the emptiness of human existence, they would quickly fail to participate in all the lovely shadows on the cave wall, and then society would go kaput.Truthfully, I have not seen all that many Ingmar Bergman films. This shocked me, too, as I realized this. Before I came to college, I rented his most famous film, The Seventh Seal. Even the uneducated realize upon seeing it that it is one of the best films ever made. Next, probably the next week after I saw The Seventh Seal, I rented his second most famous film: Wild Strawberries. At the time, I did not find it all that interesting. It has been four years since I saw it, and I know I should rent it again, but I remember that I was sure that I understood it when it was over, and that its profundity was slight in comparison with The Seventh Seal. Like I said, I need to see it again. It was some three years later that I saw another Bergman film, Through the Glass Darkly. I was stunned at it, as I was at The Seventh Seal, even if slightly less. And then I saw maybe the greatest film that I ever saw, and it was one of his: Persona, the film that has haunted me for months now.And now comes my fifth Bergman experience: Cries and Whispers. At first, I found it sort of slow, but that did not last for long. Without even realizing it, at about the half-hour point, I was so drawn in that I was experiencing the same pain as was being experienced by the four main characters onscreen. This is a devastating film. Its silence hurts terribly. And sometimes subtle sound effects scrape across your skin like a fork: the clock especially. Also, the whispers, which turn up as the film has faded out and is fading back in. I know for a fact that Criterion is doing a DVD version of this film, and that is great. On a VHS tape, the static is so loud as to drown out the subtleties on the soundtrack. And then there are the cries, which made me want to cry aloud along with the characters. All in all, my understanding of this completely exhilarating and painful film are weak. But in this lies the greatness of such a film that challenges my intellect. I must think hard about this, reading up on it, and hopefully seeing it again. I do not at all mind having to do this. It is much better than the escapism of an everyday film.And if you are reading this comment because you love this movie, may I suggest Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, which was obviously inspired by this film. It is not as great, for it is lighter, but it is a worthwhile followup to the film. Also, William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying, which has a somewhat similar plot. It is about a family's relationship as concerns their dead mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OVERRATED "ART FILM" ALERT: The following film is adored by sophisticated and "with it" film fans. The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.I have seen about 16-18 Bergman films and I would have to say that this just might be the worst one of the lot. Yes, the film is generally well-made--with lovely cinematography and decent acting. BUT, the entire story is just amazingly awful and hard to watch--unless you are into masochism. The story is about a woman dying from the ravages of cancer--complete with crying and extreme bouts of pain. At her side during her final days are her two sisters and her housekeeper (who, it appears has had a lesbian relationship with the dying woman). And during this wait (as well as after her death), they have a lot of flashbacks and fantasies. Some of them are interesting, such as Liv Ullman's flirtations with the family doctor, while others are inexplicably odd--such as the other sister's fantasy involving the mutilation of her genitalia in order to keep her husband (or anyone else) from touching her (complete with a lot of blood). At least I THINK this mutilation scene was a fantasy--at times it is hard to tell. Given these plot elements, I am AMAZED that so many see Bergman as one of our greatest directors!So, if painful deaths from cancer, deep depression, bizarre fantasies and a VERY emotionally blunted script is your idea of fun, give this film a try. If not, then do something a little less painful and just hit yourself in the head with a 2x4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're sick of the current trend of having movies use a mostly teal color palette with orange for the explosions, then this is the movie for you. Ingmar Bergman and his cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, use a palette of red, red, red, red, and red as a backdrop for their story of three sisters in circa-1900 Sweden. Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is dying of cancer, and her two sisters Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann) come to comfort her in her final days. Not that they're much comfort, since the whole family is dysfunctional for reasons that are never clearly delineated. And they all have bizarre sexual hangups.I'm sure I'll be in the minority, but I found that when it comes to dysfunctional families, this movie pales in comparison to Bergman's later Autumn Sonata. There, the characters are real people and it's easy to identify with them. Here, they seem like little more than ciphers standing in for basic human emotions. It doesn't help that the film is grindingly tedious when it isn't being gratuitously creepy (in the creepy old uncle way, not in the horror movie way). What was the point of the "dream" sequence toward the end, anyways? 5/10 for the story, 9/10 for the cinematography, which won Nykvist an Oscar - it's not just the overwhelming use of red that makes the cinematography interesting. Since I think story is worth more than cinematography, at least to me, I give it a six, mainly because it is Bergman and I want to cut him some slack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Cries and Whispers' is a very heavy handed film, but it is also quite brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. With films like 'The Seventh Seal', 'Fanny and Alexander', and 'Wild Strawberries', you would instantly know the type of man Bergman was and what he loved to show on film. You wouldn't say that he was known for romantic comedies or horror, but instead, Bergman had a unique talent to show the ups and downs of life and relationships in the most profound ways. One of Bergman's most raw and grim film was 'Cries and Whispers' from 1972.There have only been a few films or TV shows where I became so entangled in the characters that I felt like I was actually a part of their lives. This is one of those films for me, and I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way as 'Cries and Whispers' has won numerous awards including Oscars. Not only did this film receive critical praise, it also became one of the more financially successful Bergman films of his career and for good reason. I think we can all relate tot his film in some form or fashion, because we all know someone who has suffered from cancer.What Bergman does so well here is that he makes us think about what we would do and say in a terrible situation of seeing a loved one in severe pain, where there is nothing you can do, but watch. 'Cries and Whispers' takes place all inside a luxurious estate in rural Sweden where two sisters Maria (Liv Ullmann) and Karin (Ingrid Thulin) have come home to be with their sister Agnes (Harriet Anderson) who is on her deathbed from cancer. Anna (Kari Sylman), the maid/nurse helps out when she can. Not only does Agnes not have long to live, but she is severe pain throughout the entire film, moaning and screaming in agony as these woman can only look on this sad site.A good doctor (Erland Josephson) visits a couple of times, but can only watch in tears like the rest of the women, as there is nothing he can do. Throughout the film, each woman has flashbacks to their past, which shows us the key moments in their lives that made them who they are today, whether it be a good or bad person. Each sister confronts their past and present, which may not always be in the most gracious of ways, but each of them learn and struggle to re-access their lives for better or worse. All of this takes place as these women watch their beloved sister screaming in pain, which quite frankly is pretty awful to hear.It begs us to determine what we would do in this situation, and how would it influence and impact our lives. When the film is over, you can't help but feel like you have gone through a the death of a loved one as well. Each actress is excellent here, but Harriet Anderson playing Agnes just takes the spotlight. Her screams and moans hit ranges and effects similar to the possessed Regan of 'The Exorcist', and her facial expressions really do sell that we are actually seeing a dying woman in front of us.Sven Kykvist won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1974 for this film. His use of the color red keeps us uneasy throughout, but ends up looking gorgeous and giving us a sense of escape from this household. 'Cries and Whispers' is a very heavy handed film, but it is also quite brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in dying and how others relate to it -- from disgust to selfless love, but I don't find this as impressive as the director himself did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's 1972 film VISKNINGAR OCH ROP (Cries and Whispers) was one of the auteur's major achievements of that decade. In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is visited by her two sisters, the sensual and impulsive Karin (Ingrid Thulin), and the stern and frigid Maria (Liv Ullmann). Though ostensibly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are essentially just waiting for her to die, as they are more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna (Kari Sylwan) to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference (or outright disgust) expressed by Agnes' own family.Bergman had made the transition to colour film with EN PASION of three years earlier, but VISKNINGAR OCH ROP finally exploits its possibilities. Red is ever present on screen, whether in the red wing of the house in which Agnes lies dying, the red transitions between scenes, or the vivid blood that flows in each of the sisters' flashbacks to the decay of their marriages. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, brilliant. And though one doesn't often think of the makeup artist in a Bergman film, whoever worked on this one deserves praise for making such a glamorous actress as Harriet Andersson (still in her late 30s then and quite glamorous) look convincingly decrepit.Bergman considered VISKNINGAR OCH ROP one of his two greatest films, along with 1966's PERSONA. I must confess, however, that I have never ranked it so highly. While PERSONA continues to amaze me on every viewing, VISKNINGAR OCH ROP does tend to exhaust its overt symbolism and interpersonal dynamics right away, and I rarely come back to it. Furthermore, I feel Bergman wove too much of this film out of what had become stock gestures for him, such as incestuous siblings, and a man speaking about the need to trust God when he himself has lost faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a woman (Harriet Andersson) dying of cancer in early twentieth-century Sweden is visited by her two sisters, long-repressed feelings between the siblings rise to the surface.It was for the saturated color and light scheme that cinematographer Sven Nykvist was awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The picture has five nominations in all, including Best Picture, which is quite a feat for a foreign film.Bergman, despite a whole list of great films to his credit, had trouble financing the picture. Ultimately, to save costs, the main actresses and Nykvist gave their salary as a loan and were nominally co-producers. As such, depending on how their contracts were worded, they may have come out far ahead in the process.Most interestingly, the film could not find US distribution because it was (again) deemed to be "not commercial" (which may be fair). Thus, by pure chance, this highly acclaimed picture fell in the lap of Roger Corman, who had just started his own distribution company (New World). Corman paid Bergman $75,000 for it and made $1 million in profit, which no doubt went to finance future Corman projects. This may be the single most artistic film ever associated with Corman, and surely the highest-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film explores existentialism through the physical, emotional, and psychological torture of its characters. When Agnes' two sisters visit the plot thickens as her pain transcends physicality despite the comfort she receives from her maid as all women are forced to confront the shadows that bind them.As one character's pain affects and reflects the others' the director takes the audience on a downward spiral of resentment, hopelessness, and agony. The film's poetic cinematography with it's commendable use of the close-up only heightens the characters' suffering as their beauty contrasts with their exterior and interior reality. Watching this film feels like staring at a well composed painting in motion where each gesture and each moment, whether it be a moment of constant screaming in complete and absolute pain or a moment of silence, sets the viewer in an inevitable state of contemplation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is memorable. The close ups of this film makes this movie. I loved how Bergman portrays each of the sisters problems. The acting and edits in this film makes the movie come alive. When the sister is in pain, just the close ups on the faces really makes the audience feels the pain they go through. Yet it's interesting how the cuts really show the space and distance each of the sisters have for one another. Yet in the ending, the cuts show how the sisters start to slowly mend their relationship with each other. I find some of the scenes a bit disturbing and exteme, such as when the sister decides to hurt herself to not have sex with her spouse. That is a bit extreme, but the movie goes through many extremities. The red that is always shown throughout the film really draws the audience into the film because every time there is a red flash, the audience know it's going to get more intense than before. Overall, it's a movie worth to watch! :) It starts off a bit slow but it starts to pick up, even though it's a sad movie.</fullReview>

I believe that the color red not only symbolizes inferiority of the human soul but also the pain each individual character carried. This film also in a way related to the passion of Christ by Agnes' death leading to redemption to her sisters, and by her maid Anna sort of representing May the mother of Christ. Maria (Agnes' most beautiful sister)wanted more attention from her husband but since she received a little bit of attention she searched for it through the doctor. her other sister wanted to receive less sexual attention from her husband so she made herself bleed to see if he would still want to touch her still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers, directed by Ingmar Bergman, had an uncanny effect on me. The three sisters, Agnes, Karin, and Maria, reminded me of my two sisters and myself but with a vast difference that has made our lives differ from the lives of the three sisters from the film.Like Agnes, my younger sister struggles with an illness. She has cerebral palsy, a condition affecting her nervous system that has resulted in her having a mental disability, seizures, and bowel, vision and dental problems. She is unable to accomplish everyday tasks on her own, whether it's eating, walking, showering or even dressing. Like Agnes, she depends on her loved ones in order to survive. It is remarkable what Agnes and my sister go through everyday, but what blows my mind is how they carry out themselves.Agnes, battling cancer, writes in her diary that she is grateful to her life because it has given her so much. I can't help but feel grateful myself for having the life I have. Sometimes, I do feel like the most unfortunate person in the world, but such a movie eliminates any such feelings. We should always remember that even at our lowest point, someone else might be struggling at an even greater scale.Agnes and my sister have similarities, but one difference between the two is that unlike Agnes, my sister has two sisters that care for her and would do anything to keep her happy. It is unfortunate that Agnes can't seek support from her sisters. No one should go through struggles alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When viewing a film about a woman on her deathbed you would assume you are in for a bumpy ride. And you are, however this film is worth the ride again and again. Without using Walt Disney "feel good" tactics with talking animals and immortal hero's and happily ever afters this film truly gives me understanding and makes me feel good so to speak. Self mutilation and death what a combination. But simply exquisite in the way it is filmed and presented to the viewer. Personally I love a film that gives me a harsh reality, and this film gives you no more and no less which is way I feel it a superior film. By showing some humanity with the maid giving comfort and comparing life, love, stress and setbacks it really gives me a feel good effect but feel good meaning I'm watching life not something with a hug attached to it. Maybe its dark and cynical of me to be deterred from such forms of cinema but its my preference to be presented with raw and pure scenarios even if there's a dash of magic here and there the storyline is raw. I would recommend this film to anyone who shares my passion for such film and tell them that it truly is a masterpiece for what it is.</fullReview>

I found Ingmar Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" enthralling with a charged sexual overtone and a scene, that some may find disturbing. All this entangled with the aspects of all the relationships within this movie is put on high alert of dysfunction. So what is Bergman saying to me? Question the subtext of the things. Don't be so quick to judge. We all maybe or have been in relationships, know someone and or just be a tad dysfunctional ourselves. Without knowing each others stories, let's not be so judgmental.

Cries and Whisper tells the tale of three sisters, Maria,Karin and Agnes. Agnes is on her deathbed from cancer and her sister and her devoted maid Anna are all coping with the situation.Anna herself just recently lose her daughter very young is dealing with this tough situation as well.This sounds like the potential for a chick flick......wrong. This movie is all about the dark twisted experimental of society that we like to avoid.It deals with infidelity, a bit of incest, suicide, denial, religion, and haunting.Bergman does an amazing job of twisting this story into some dark, eerie and not seeing religion as the stereotype holy image. He is very smart and using hint of religion element into the movie without it feeling like sermon.The cinematography of this film is extremely mind-blowing. The crimson transition and the stunning lightning makes this film amazing. It actually won best cinematography that year in the academy awards which is very rare for foreign films.Overall this film is amazing film that good to watch to see dark experimental. The scene with the glass and the blood smear is what take the cake for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These three sisters each had an individual internal struggle when dealing with death. My most liked interactions were between Maria and Karin, as they seemed to bring out the worst in each other. These two women can be considered external polar opposites, yet extremely similar. Both are extremely self-centered but approach this in behaviors which are worlds apart. Maria carries herself as a caregiver who seeks connection, and we soon become aware that she is anything but that. She gives Agnes company, but from a distance. The only sign of love we see directed towards her dying sister is when her, Karin, and the maid, Anna, are bathing her. She becomes comfortable enough to help her get dressed because she is in the company of others. This might mean that she feels the need to present herself as her superficial alter-ego, or that she takes this opportunity because it avoids the one-on-one closeness she would otherwise have alone.Karin, different from Maria, emulates her internal thoughts. She looks cold and is unloving. To an extent, she verbally abuses Maria, calling her worthless and fake. She can't bare the touch of others and chooses to be excluded *SPOILER ALERT* perhaps because of the similar abandonment she felt as a child.*SPOILER ALERT* These two collide in a very interesting way. Maria reaches out to Karin, but is rejected. Karin makes a verbal attack during their dinner and later apologizes. At this point, they seem very close and act like sisters. They relate to each other even more after they both refuse to comfort Agnes after death. In the very end of the movie, we see a change in Karin as she expresses her interest in keeping touch. Maria makes a drastic flip and reacts in a way in which the former Karin would have. They depart the house in a passive aggressive manner, as they arrived. Another interesting connection, is that they leave with their husbands, returning to their "normal" lives. Nothing changes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the film expressed to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I understood from the film was the idea of morality and values. That there is a always the dark side in life that some people go through physically and emotionally. One thing that I really got from the film was about morality the conflict how how people try to appear something they are not. I think in real in life that is one of the biggest issue we have in society people trying to be something they are not. What I also understood was the suffering and oppression in a way people go through. I think real life problems like death is really a difficult situation to go through especially when people go through agony and affliction. The meaning I got from the film was the idea that with death we can't find salvation or redemption to save people's morality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep, Dark, and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Bergman film walks us through a story of 3 sisters who you could argue, may not even be sisters due to their painfully awkward and dysfunctional relationships with one another. One of the sisters is dying from what seems to be a very painful and slow death. There is Agnes,(the sick sister) Karin, (the well off, but seemingly most disturbed) , and Maria (who seems almost soft and naive). I really loved how Bergman was able to convey the true pain of death in this film. It really stuck with me for a long time. I found myself thinking about all the families who deal with these sort of tragedies on a daily basis. I also feel that this film is conveying a method that regardless of the situation if a family has problems that go unresolved they all end up paying for it in the end. There is a lot of use of the color red in this film. Personally I took it as the color of blood and therefor death and pain, obviously in the dying sisters case, but maybe even more so with the family structure. Unfortunately, because it was so sad and dark it did leave me feeling very depressed and questioning what would it be like for myself in that situation. I have really put much more though into my family bonds and relationships since viewing this film. If you are looking for a dark film done excellent this is perfect for you. I hop you enjoy. Disclaimer: I do not recommend watching this film if you are in a dark place emotionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunction At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a fantastic film about that follow themes of the human condition, the face of death, and the meaning of suffering. And in creating these themes, all he needs are four actresses of impeccable acting skill.Ingmar Bergman is a director unlike any other. He comes from the theatre and as a result transfers theatric style images into his movies. In fact, he is known for his wonderful aesthetic close up shots. In these shots, years of a persons life are viewed, as their facial crevices and deep black eyes are intimately exposed relentlessly. Lets begin with the cinematography. Every scene includes three colors; red, black, and white. Red obviously alludes to dominance and force, a characteristic that haunts Karen and Maria as they each hold their own fiery hatred towards each other. The white represents innocence, possibly strictly for the maid who endlessly cares for Agnus as she dies. At the end of the film, though, her innocence is disrespected and she truly realizes the cruelty of the world, as her help and comfort towards Agnus is dismissed as petty and "coming with the job". Lastly, the color black infers death, such as Agnus is enduring through the film, and it sets a bleak resonance in the shots that gives off a gloomy vibe. The acting is utterly impeccable. Hardly does one ever witness so much emotion and character in the faces of Karen and Maria in any film. From their lips, to their wrinkles, to their eyes and bosoms, Karen and Maria only need to be filmed to feed viewers an emotional experience. In fact, Bergman emotionally makes you almost feel suffocated, just as the characters do, as their eyes pierce the camera and their faces fill up the entire screen. You almost wish they would look elsewhere to break the tension, such as in the opening shot where Agnus breathes in pain for nearly three minutes, watching her cry and weep in misery. Bergman utterly invades the every corner of the films space with their beautiful faces that disturb and haunt the viewers in a romantic and torturous way.Lastly, the entire film is shot inside until the last scene where the sisters walk with each other in a beautiful garden. Coming back to the feeling of suffocation, because every scene is inside, not only do the characters yearn to escape and get free, but the viewer, especially myself, yearned for the outside. I almost felt like I needed to leave the theatre because the gloomy indoors and the lacking sunshine was so dampening to the soul that you could be barely breath in. The only air smelt of pain, suffering, and dysfunction, truly infecting the windpipes and crushing your wishes for beautiful air and scenery. Bergman did a fantastic job with this film. He invades viewers comfort zone through magnificent close ups and color schemes. His unflinching actresses display miles of emotion and we are left beaten down and battered after the end of the film. Bergman wants to show us that dysfunction of miscommunication is truly at fault for the death, and that in the face of death, people tend to be cowards and selfish. That suffering is only to show those who do not suffer to change, and change fast, or else the same fate awaits them.If you want to be moved, and disturbed, not by the grotesque, but by the storm of violent emotions, then witness the beautiful masterpiece called "Cries and Whispers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Suffering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that stood out to me in Bergmen's film "Cries and Whispers" was the art direction/production design/wardrobe. The consistent red, white, and black through out each scene immediately gave the feeling that the narrative was going to be dark (gothic) and somewhat unsettling at points. In the beginning I thought that Agnes was going to be the most disturbed or suffering character, but it was as time went on and the truth behind her sisters' lives were revealed, that I realized Agnes was somewhat lucky compared to them, and was escaping from the physical world of human suffering. "Cries and Whispers" definitely kept my stomach in a knot the entire time and it was a relief to see some light at the end of the tunnel with the closing scene of the sisters outside and enjoying one another's company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's Use of Red in Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Bergman's Cries and whispers is widely acknowledged as a great film it is still not a perfect film. I believe the main reason for this is that the "Content" and the "Form" of the film do not rhyme as seamlessly as they do in, lets say, The Seventh Seal. Bergman's use of Red/Crimson as a stylistic theme as background, as some critics have mentioned, is supposed to represent either passion, or the soul. To be sure it is an odd choice of background to contrast with the film's characters' general inability to show their emotions. and perhaps we see it as a viable contrast to the characters behavior; but only after an authoritative critic urged us to view the film through his distorted goggles. However, if we decide to see the film for what it is -as Chekhov recommended writing books- where no explanation is necessary from the author, Bergman's use of Red does not work. At least not as successfully as, lets say, Kubrick's use of Red for the Rape scene in a Clock Work Orange. Bergman once mentioned that he imagines the color of the soul as red, But that maybe one his idiosyncrasies. But personally on viewing the film, one of the central visual metaphors of did not work, But maybe it is just because my soul is purple.</fullReview>

Ironically, when one of us fells ill, we would change-we would become empathetic and full of this selfless concern. Cry's and Whispers help me understand this. As a family, that is dysfunctional, we always find ways to come back together. What struck me the most was the constant reminders of "RED" being displayed throughout the movie.

		<fullReview>Found it creepy, but extraordinary of how convincing the problems and pain the characters felt. Each close up was well done where we're able to see their facial appearance, and yet try wonder about what's going on internally in the problems the characters dealt and wondered about. The color of red is apparent throughout the film, but at times when it isn't shown, there's this relief from the intensity of it all.This film is definitely intense, and though it felt like watching a nightmare, you can't help but take in the few rare loving emotions that are revealed. The actresses all had their own identity and really made each different but yet all shared the same horrors. In a way, the stress that the actresses conveyed seemed to grasp you into it as well. Though intense, the realistic emotions / expressions are worth viewing repeatedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergmen takes you on a emotional joyride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is a truly amazing film that depicts the lives of four different women, each undergoing different degrees of emotional and physical suffering.The director, Ingmar Bergmen, takes a very unique approach to showing the different perspectives of each character. He very effectively utilizes closeups of individual characters in each transition accompanied by the faint sounds of whispering, which sets forward a very eerie and ominous tone throughout the film.One of the first things I noticed while watching this film was Bergmen's use of the color red, which is quite literally found throughout its entirety. The color not only sets the mood, it can also be seen as a representation of the vulnerability of the interior human soul that plays off of the intensity of the characters interactions. On numerous accounts there would be no dialogue going on, but the body language and movements were so well accompanied by the 'red' that what could be said in the scene was easily forgone with our own mental interpretations.It was not difficult to find many parts of the film shocking or disturbing, but I believe that was Bergmen's intent. Every individual in the film shows some form of personal suppression, whether it be physical, emotional, or both. The fact that we clearly see these instances of suppression take place which are later completely voided, (i.e. Karin presenting herself to her husband after having cut herself with glass) weighs a lot more heavily than what is found is most of today's cinema.I found this film to be very gripping and the astounding amount of thought taken into account with every subtle detail made watching this film even more intriguing. Bergmen really took into account the psychological effect that the film's cinematographic style would have on the viewer, especially in regards to the color schemes and subjective viewpoints used in the development of the stories linear plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman proves Swedish power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about getting sucked in...Bergman's film is a roller coaster of mental and visual stimulation for viewers. Following the story of the three sisters and how we as viewers get to see the background stories of each woman pulled me in the further the film progressed. This movie focused on relationships, along with death, and I finished the film thinking about just that. I myself have a sister who I would like to be closer with, so seeing the dysfunction between the characters was almost reassuring to me as an individual. I feel this film targeted the emotions of women more so than men, and made me appreciate the relationship and closeness I have with my own mother. Bergman was famous for his close-ups and how he captures the intensity through the eyes of the characters, and I feel that affected me as a viewer. I started out focused most on the beauty of the actresses, but as you see the close-ups and really see the pain behind the character's eyes, it changes the way you see the rest of the film. I also loved how Bergman took certain colors and images that have an underlying meaning, such as the color red everywhere, and the white dresses at the end, yet it seemed he created a new meaning for each symbol.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among Bergman's masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the greatest of Bergman's works, this film fully marries mind, heart and soul.Intensely beautiful to look at, with red - the color of blood, of death, of passion -everywhere.The performances are astounding. Up to this point in Bergman's career there was often a theatricality even to the truly great Bergman performances, but here the actors always feel exquisitely, heartbreakingly real."Cries and Whispers" also made me realize that Bergman is a director in general experienced as much in the aftershocks and later absorption of seeing his films as in the moment of watching them. Tears came to me an hour after watching the film, not while I was seeing it. It's not the way I'm used to film working, but I've had that experience too many times with Bergman's work for it to be mere coincidence.The exploration of the effects the slow painful death of a 19th century woman on her two sisters and long time maid (and lover?) is the subject, but it is experienced more like a poem than like a story. And the moments of horrific reality (I've never seen on-screen sickness and death portrayed so honestly) and poetic grace and surreal dream images dance together with nary a hitch. A very difficult and painful, but must see film.</fullReview>

This film proposes a lot of philosophical questions such as questioning one's self conscious. This film was also very good in developing the sibling relationship between the sisters. It was also interesting to see that Bergman develops this question of what is meant when the sense of touch comes upon two humans. This film is ambiguous because it can be interpreted in two different ways, but still with the control of only having two different paths. This film also explores of one's sexuality, and the importance of communication, and what it can happen when this lacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repulsion and Desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is interesting in the way it plays with repulsion and desire. The border of the body seems like the border of the self, indicating when a person can go beyond themselves out of love for another. It is a quite bleak view, as even when there is love shown in the film between Agnes, the lamb, and her servant, Anna, there is a quality of repulsion we as viewers are induced to feel so that love seems unreachable.The duality of the character of Maria/the mother makes her a universal figure raising our own issues with Mother. As Maria she is sensual when she takes in the doctor's finger in her mouth, feeding her ego, yet she fears the touch associated with death. She is almost comical in her selfishness, refusing to help her husband who is bleeding from a self-inflicted knife wound; she recoils visibly rather than reaching toward him which would be the expected reaction. It's also interesting how the doctor, who desires her, tears her apart with his words in hate, just as the sister Karin does to her later, as though in desiring too much, one comes to hate that one is so vulnerable and dependent (as with a Mother). The film shows this painful, infantile disappointment of not getting everything one needs. (This is seen at the end when Maria turns away from Karin and does what Karin probably feared most - Maria rejects her when Karin has opened herself up).It is interesting that the film shows the scandalous nature of death - in the scene where Agnes calls (from death) for someone to warm her hands, it's asking for love to overcome the physical repulsion that is a natural response to death. Hence one could read this almost a refusal of faith and God - a desire to believe yet unable to. It is reminiscent of Flaubert's story "St Julian the Hospitaler," where Julian must warm the leper's body with his own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard of the name Igmar Bergman but this was my first film, Cries and Whispers really showed his auteur stylistic approach. I liked how he explores with color such as red, the change can be so important to the mood of the situation for this instance the whole movie. The close ups of the characters seems so real as if the camera was instead a mirror and they were not faking emotion but just really feeling. I liked the repeated half faced close ups of each character it gave the audience the chance to see a glimpse of why they are that way. The scene for example that stood out was when Karin cuts herself, "ouch" was all I can think while watching! But afterward that scene reignited and had a different meaning not just the literal but a symbolic depiction of her failed sad marriage as she repeated yelling "tissue of lies." Bergman did an amazing job, in telling such humanistic feelings to a bit of extreme although anyone that has a family can relate that maybe its not with your immediate but Im sure their are some relatives we can't even mention at the dinner table because of the negative feelings towards them. Great film, although about the death of a sibling, there is hope in Agnes the maid who overall seems to be the most sane and transparent character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman is an amazing director. His use of close-ups and the constant use of color that we see in this film let you understand the film much more. The constant contrast between red and white in the film made me think that it was like a division. The sisters wore white but everything else around them was red. In my film class, we had learned that Bergman used red in this film to be representative of the human soul. Knowing this, I took to mean that we could see the soul of each of these sisters in their surroundings. For me, I thought that perhaps they wore white because it is such an empty color that it was meant for us, the audience, as a distraction, so that we could focus more on their surroundings and on how each of them behaved around each other. It was as if their surroundings were a representation of what they felt inside, and I believe it is true because of the theme of touch in this movie. There is so much giving in the form of touch and it is such an outside form of giving a part of your soul to your surroundings, that we are allowed to understand much more how the sister's surroundings are linked to their souls. However, the most impacting thing about this movie were the close-ups. We had learned in mu film class that Bergman wanted his actors to understand his characters' feelings, not show what they thought the character would look like from what they felt. These close-ups throughout the entire movie let you see that what the characters are going through is real and seeing and being up-close to their faces lets the audience become more immersed in this film. For me, it was movie which made me involve myself emotionally with the characters because I was constantly seeing the characters' emotion close-up to me. It is a movie which gives you many insights and after having watched it twice, I would like to watch it a third and fourth times, just to se what other things I may have missed that give more meaning to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is nothing more than magnificently moving, and extremely mysterious. Red plays an incredibly vital part in this film; it portrays the color of our human soul. And throughout the movie, it is a great transition color from scene to scene..especially when used during the sisters close up moments when they are alone; and the whispers that occur throughout as well. These whispers one may presume are their thoughts, perhaps of guilt or consciousness of surroundings. Bergman's unique style of close ups, is what made this movie so profoundly tranquil?and what made me so attracted to it. But even so, the sophisticated relationships between the sisters and the maid are what set this movie in its pace. "Cries and Whispers" is definitely not an easy film to endure, especially when compared to any other artistic movie?it stands alone. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to explore and try to capture the intimacy between three sisters.</fullReview>

We see three siblings that don't have a very loving relationship and we get to know their problems, one of them,Agnes, is suffering from cancer. Anna, the maid, comes from a different social class than the rest of the characters, and has more reasons to be miserable; however it seems this isn't the case as she seems the most hopeful and faithful. The same applies for Agnes she is suffering a lot due to her sickness but she still gives a very positive air. Touch is important in this film, as we get the sense that touching equals giving.

Now, why not? Well, the relation between the sisters--Karin (Ingrid Thullin), Maria (Liv Ullmann), and Agnes (Harriet Andersson) in this film is distant. As well as, their relations with others. "Cries &amp; Whispers" is one of my first viewing of Bergman's many films. I have to say that this movie has touched my heart in so many ways. Now, I don't have any sisters, but, I do have three younger brothers and after seeing the relationship between the sisters. I had thought of each one of my brothers, and compared my relationship with each one. Throughout the film I felt sympathetic towards each individual, and was reminded that life is too short. That the appreciation, recognition, and love given to an individual in very limited time can lead to what may feel like a life-long time of happiness and peace.</fullReview>

When her health began to deteriorate it was her attendant, Anna, who comforts her while the sisters are having difficulty dealing with it. In the end at the time of Agnes's death, Karin and Maria began to show bitterness and hatred to each other. I find the movie most interesting, especially the use of red in this film because I believe red symbolizes life and posterity. Each of the sisters have a color to describe themselves: Agnes wearing white to describe her purity, even though she was dying; Karin wearing black because of her dark and wretched soul; Maria wearing gray because it was unsure where she was good or evil. The use of closeups of the main characters was important because all but Anna were hearing voices because they had something that they couldn't comprehend while they were helping Agnes.</fullReview>

Ana, being the maid, was there for Agnes when she was in the most pain and who Agnes always called for relief. It saddened me that even at the end of the movie, with the death of one of the sisters, Karin and Maria couldn't get along. I was optimistic when Karin and Maria had a reconnection while touching each other but Marias fear pushed them back away. Agnes wrote that her favorite time was when the three sisters were all together and that also was my favorite part of the movie.

This movie turned out to be a bit too disturbing for me and confusing. This film is about being secretive and dark, but I think for my taste it went a bit too far to the point of just being confused and weirded out. In the film the 3 sisters have a very unusual relationship, they are not there because they want to be there. They are forced to be together by the fact that (Agnes) one of the sisters is dying. The relationship within all three sisters is something that families could relate to, but in the film the relationship was much more intense. The Film had some great dark acting and the plot was interesting, if you are into dark movies then this one is for you.</fullReview>

I thought a lot about the importance of communication and family in this movie. There aren't may bonds closer than sisterhood and these women are at a disconnect with each other. They need to find ways to express themselves in conductive ways to repair their closeness. After Agnes seemingly dies Karin and Maria make up after a fight making it feel like some progress has been made however in the closing scene Maria regards her sister with this see-you-when-I-see-you attitude. Very different from a cookie cutter movie we might see from a Hollywood director. I'm not knocking Hollywood movies, I love em, Cries and Whispers was a nice change-up. Bergman uses the color red to convey the human soul, I feel this was effective because every time I saw the repeated red-washed scene with one side of the actresses faces lit, I felt that I was seeing some sort of special/secret part of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film represents the complexities of dealing with loved ones, in this case sisters. We are presented with an extremely tough situation from the start, with Agnes becoming violently ill and eventually dying a painful death. Throughout the film we are shown in excruciating detail the pain and sorrow that these women each face, and we are forced to endure what they are going through.The film manages to capture the audience through the use of closeups to show subtle hints of the character's emotions. We see a glimpse into each of their lives and what troubles they are going through, as well as the current situation with their dying sister. This is a deep character study of each of the sisters, and even the servant, Anna.The film is a powerful and brutal, while at the same time keeps an elegance and beauty amongst the turmoil and psychological issues that we are forced to deal with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of my fourth and final film Cries and Whispers.This film was on the more disturbing side of the films my classmates and I watched this semester but none the less, a great piece are art. The film has moments in which it physically and mentally shows you pain the characters endure. The sisters in the film have a great dislike for one another but also care for each other. Its very complex their situation. Most of the film in my feelings, have a great sense of depression and sadness. It deals with suffering and loneliness of the soul but you also see that in a strange way bringing the sisters closer together as a result of that. The director Bergan does a great job of balancing those lines. The males in the film fail in providing any comfort to the women in the film. Although the characters in the film all have very different personalities they all have a great deal of agony and pain throughout the film in their own way. Such as, Karins flashback where she self mutilates herself in order to share intimate time with old and husband.I think the art of the film is watching these characters in this complex web of emotions which cripple them into this state of not sure to be happy or cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three sisters and their maid deal with the struggles of each's lives finding comfort in one another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bergman film "Cries and Whispers" is a story about two sisters who watch over, Maria and Karin, and a maid named Anna who watch over their dying sister, Agnes. In the film, Bergman closely examines the relationship of these three sisters and the maid while also dealing with the individual lives and struggles of the emotionally crippled Karin and Maria.Maria, a married woman, hides behind the adultery she commits and is both physically and mentally incapable of handling any sort of confrontation. Karin on the other hand is very reserved and absolutely afraid of opening up or expressing herself to anyone, including her own husband who appears oblivious to her "condition." To get over each's problems, the girls eventually confide in each other in a very emotionally charged moment in the film. Unfortunately, the next day things seem to go back to how they were before, as if Bergman were saying that opening up and touching someone are important first steps, but don't actually seem to solve the deeply rooted problem. Maria on the other hand acknowledges their bonding experience from the night before but is initially shunned by her sister.Anna, the maid, is a character dealing with her own storyline opposite these two sisters. Anna appears to be the only one who is capable of unconditional love and actually provides the most warmth and comfort for Agnes on her deathbed.I personally found Agnes to be the most fascinating character of the bunch. Her ability to take comfort and find happiness in the smallest things such as the stroll through the garden with her sisters at the onset of her illness. Agnes seems to be the only sister who takes complete solace and refuge in the presence of the other two. The final line in the movie, a quote from Agnes' journal, shows her appreciation and love for those around her and for what life has given her, stating she is thankful for the presence of her sisters. I found this particularly bittersweet: it is good to know Agnes felt so good around her sisters but I seriously doubt her sisters ever really reciprocated the love, at least when not in direct contact with her. The question I always have about Agnes is whether she had this profound love and appreciation for love before she got sick, or if this love came because of her cancer diagnosis. I like to think that it was the former, but it is a well known fact that people do tend to feel this empathy towards the end of their lives, or at least, are more comfortable expressing these feelings.Bergman does an absolutely incredible shooting the film, from the angles he choose for the camera to the stylistics with deep tones of red complementing the rest of the rather white and monotonous backdrop. This is a beautiful film that will leave any audience member thinking about life and those closest to them once they finish viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona), I had seeing this title pop up a few times in place, and I knew it was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I watched. Basically, set in the 19th Century, Sweden, Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is dying of cancer and being visited at her isolated mansion by her sisters Karin (BAFTA nominated Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann). As they watch over their health deteriorating sister in the sickbed with servant Anna (Kari Sylwan), we see flashbacks of the two sisters whose lives are full of lies, deceit, self hatred, unsympathetic thoughts, guilt and forbidden love. The end of their sister's life does eventually draw to close, and the death means a funeral, and this brings up long repressed grudge feelings of jealousy, selfishness and bitterness between Karin and Maria to the surface. Also starring Erland Josephson as David the doctor, Georg ?rlin as Karin's husband Fredrik and Henning Moritzen as Maria's husband Joakim. It being in Swedish it might have been slightly hard to follow having to read subtitles at the same time, but the acting was fantastic, the use of colour, costume and camera-work and lighting is superb, it is a fantastic foreign language drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Costume Design and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literally whispers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would call Ingmar Bergman's film, Cries and Whispers, a work of pure art. Sadly, if you are looking into this movie for the classic Hollywood entertainment value, I wouldn't recommend this to you. This film is a cinematic learning experience. Let me explain, in a screen writing class that I took, I learned that a great film would use minimal dialogue and let the actions of the characters tell you the story instead of their words. This film does just that throughout the same film. It also opens up the use of all your senses, specially the sense of touch. You will also see the scenes fade into a red screen since Bergman believed that red symbolized the interior of a persons soul. This film is about the relationship between three sisters that never really got along with each other. When one of the sisters falls sick with cancer, the other two sister are pretty much forced to coexist as their sister lays on her death bed. You see an up close and personal view at how they cope with the situation they are in. You can see how the realistic hunger for greed and wealth makes them act. I would recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate great art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers, You Can Hear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one film that will forever stay with me. From the very beginning, although being void of dialogue for a good while, I was drawn in with anticipation. Bergman invites us to take a gander, if we dare, at the array of emotions that live within the human psyche. The good, the bad and the ugly. He has covered most everything in red, creating the illusion of passion, love and hate, madness, anger and all else that stirs in our souls. In this overly saturated world lives Agnes (Harriet Andersson), a young woman with cancer. Whose screeching yelps of pain are felt at the core, through the screen, defying time and space. Her sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann). As well as the precious Anna (Kari Sylwan), their servant.The sisters have come together, waiting for Agnes to pass. Seemingly caring for her but more like hoping Agnes would hurry up and get it over with already. There is something cold about Karin and Maria. They have lost their ability to love, to feel. Even a simple touch seems to repulse them.In one very disturbing, chilling scene we witness Karin self-mutilate. I found myself cringing at the sight of such horror. Yet, Karin's pleasure gave me a sense of relief at the same time. For it is the only time we see her experience satisfaction, feel something and actually soften.Another scene, that I found beautiful is one between Maria and Dr. (Erland Josephson), where he is observing her face. He goes beyond the physical, it's as if he is seeing her soul. Which has grown cold and bitter. Maria is left to truly see herself, to confront her inner ugliness. Not that she ever truly does.Agnes, in spite of her illness writes in her journal expressing a profound gratefulness for her life, which has given her so much. She speaks of how happy she is to have these moments with her sisters. Perhaps facing death she now realizes what is important. Although, I get the sense that there has always been this warmth in her.We learn that Anna has suffered a tremendous loss, still she remains loving and purehearted. Anna is able to soothe Agnes's pain, even if temporarily. There is an undeniable bond between these two women and it is beautiful to witness. While losing Agnes is inevitable, we are thankful for her.If Karin and Maria show us the darkness that can sometimes creep in and taint the human spirit, Agnes and Anna remind us that we can hold on to the light within us."Cries and Whispers" is aesthetically pleasing, very picturesque. I felt as if I was watching a painting come to life right before my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers- Masterpiece of Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After experiencing one of Bergman's films, "Cries and Whispers" I found Bergman to be an incredible director that takes a rather difficult conceptual task of revealing inner emotions and thoughts to film. I can only imagine how difficult it was to successfully tackle the "negative" elements that make us human beings with feelings and emotions that words an not fully describe. His distinctive style deserves praise for this exceptional achievement of being able to establish sense of "map to the soul" in his film. Through scenes that held long durations of silence and a symbolic red theme twisted my mind into disillusionment and depression towards Agnes' unbearably painful condition of cancer. The strong body language and use of close-ups between the main characters: Agnes, Karin, Maria, and Anna left me utterly emotional. Through the deep theatrical performances of these amazing actresses I felt as if I was able to get a really good sense of who they are through their intensifying acting ability to portray losing control of their sanity as they watch the only respectable person in their eyes struggle to their deathbed before their eyes. Through the beautifully executed cinematography of Sven Nykvist, my eyes saw beyond Agnes'death- and into a complete solitude of her sisters' inability to live an enjoyable life- It was almost as if they were more dead and empty then their own sisters passing. Ultimately, they continue to live but chose to live an empty, basically lifeless existence. Bergman's ending quote "I am so grateful for life and all that it has given me" shows that even though Agnes was the character who suffered the most at least she could die happy and honorably. This film makes you come to realization how life is the ultimate gift to us all- We should all treasure our lives for we never know when fate will take us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking into our human emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers exposes the emotions that we, as humans naturally deal with. Bergman tackles the inevitable thoughts of human existence. He explores the thoughts of death, isolation, relationships and suffering. They're all negative aspects of humanity, but Bergman doesn't shy away from it. Why not? Those thoughts that we have are inevitable and inherent to everyone. It's a part of human nature.Death is never easy to endure. The movie includes a household of three sisters and their maid. We have Agnes, who is terminally ill and suffers on her bed, and eventually dies midway through the movie. Although her sisters witness Agnes's suffering, they are surprisingly unable to support or communicate with Agnes emotionally. Both characters seem to be disgusted by her illness.Karin is unable to show any sort of emotion and despises human touch. Her relationship with her husband and sisters made me feel uneasy as they were full of tension. One of the most shocking scene to me was when Karin used a piece of broken glass to cut her vagina. Expectedly, she seems to somewhat enjoy the pain while she shocks her husband with it. Although Karin was physically in pain, it was another way of her to outlet her emotions without even expressing them. It hurts, but she is able to feel and metaphorically tell how husband how she feels about him. On the other hand, Maria embraces human touch, however without any aspect of humanism. Although she tries to get Karin to embrace her touch, she eventually stabs her at the back. I found her relationship with Karin interesting as the audience was able to see a complex, manipulative, love-hate type of sibling relationship.In contrast, Anna shares a nurturing relationship with Agnes and supports her throughout the horror she endures. Both characters have endured the most pain throughout the movie, yet they are the most sincere and positive characters. Agnes slowly suffers into the death, while Anna has lost her daughter. This made me feel appreciative of their characters as they had the most humanistic qualities, despite what they've been through (unlike Maria and Karin). A symbolic scene of Anna's dream is shown where Agnes is resurrected, however Anna is the only one that embraces her, whereas her sisters reject her.Bergman's extensive use of the colour red set an intense tone throughout the film. I subconsciously felt as if my inner emotions were being penetrated in association with the colour red. I would have felt differently if yellow was being used instead. His use of close up shots and silences were also effective as I felt a sense of raised emotional intensity. I felt the actors' internalization of thoughts and feelings. The human face was extensively used as if it was the soul. The fact that the movie occurred in the house also evoked a distress feeling of claustrophobia, as if the characters felt trapped. While those moments made the movie depressing to watch, I was also able to get a sense of hope. We are juxtaposed with characters of Anna and Agnes versus Maria and Karin, who all have different outlooks on life. Suffering, isolation and death is inevitable in life. If we have a positive outlook, such aspects won't be as difficult to endure, and we will eventually be thankful. We see this with Agnes and Anna, as they endure the most pain, but are still able to bring love and happiness. This message enforced on me as the movie ends with Agnes's closing line: "I am so grateful to life and all that has been given to me". We end the movie not only with sad thoughts, but a sense of hope and appreciation for the preciousness of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality and dream, present and past, and red and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cries and Whispers' begins and ends at the limited place that is a big mansion. Characters go outside only through their remembrances or dreams. As a result, reality and dream, present and past, and red and white represent the title 'Cries and Whispers.' The director shows the audiences characters' individual emotion and lack of communication through close-up angle, lights, and colors. As people know, a film's location is composed by red and white. As the title means, one of these colors might be a color of cries and another color might be a color of whispers. Therefore, the director, Bergman starts a film with the title colored by red and white. Also, this film may have more theatrical and artistic elements than cinematic elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and Desperate Sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" by Bergman was an excellent movie that still lingers in my mind. Watching this film made me feel desperate and left me traumatized by what happened within the movie. It is one of those movies that stays in your mind and just somewhat, stays implanted in your mind.I really enjoyed this film and consider it one of the best works of Bergman. He emphasizes the color red in the film as he uses the color for almost everything, including the transitions using the color of red to fade so that it can help us to transcend into the character. There were many disturbing scenes throughout the movie, for example when Karin, the oldest sister uses the piece of glass to cut herself, was quite disturbing. However, I feel that, that scene showed much more meaning for the audience. I believe that scene was to show her husband what she really thinks of him and that she would rather cut herself than to have sex with him.One thing I really liked about this film is that it showed and made me feel somewhat desperate. It made me eager to know what was going to happen in the next scene and wanting more from the characters. The scene when Maria is desperate to reconcile with her sister Karin made me feel as if I was in Maria's place, feeling desperate with her. It made me connect with her easily as if I was her. When Karin told Maria that she always hated her showed me that sometimes that's what siblings are all about. I, too have a younger sibling and I know exactly what Karin and Maria are going through. It showed me that siblings can hate each other one minute, then reconcile the next, and it is never an ending cycle.This movie left a huge impression to me because I felt that I can connect in many ways within this film. I really enjoyed this film and this is by far my favorite movie from Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance Has no Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real life is not always full of sounds and dialogue. Sometimes the most meaningful things are those which cannot be said or are chosen to not be said. Nowadays movies heavily rely on dialogue and music and seems like a movie is impossible to make without the need of dialogue. In "Cries and Whispers" the first time you will hear actual dialogue is 12 minutes into the movie. It is hard to imagine what interesting things can happen in those starting 12 minutes. Well this is what happens: Brilliance. The acting is the first thing to be recognized. Without dialogue is where you will know who are the true actors. Every character has dimension and you feel as if you were caught in their world of sorrow and deception. The family in this movie can be like any dysfunctional family in real life. Sometimes you have to stand siblings no matter how much you can hate their guts. Almost nothing in this movie is happy. It does show hope but very little of it. We, as the audience get to see the good, noble things people can do and also the almost heartless, cold things people whom we expect to be the most supportive, can do. What is used over and over by Bergman is close-ups on the characters. We see who they truly are on their close-ups and what lies beneath the physical exterior. The movie allows for us to know and see the soul of the character by their past, their fears, their atmosphere. This movie will leave you asking you what death, life and love is. Does it even truly exist? Whatever the answer you come up with this movie has done its job which is make you think things which normally we would not think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and Dysfunction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that Cries and Whispers beautifully explores our innate human needs for touch, intimacy, affection and even deeper our ability to love. Exploring how hard it can be for us to find, especially within our own families. The love for each other can be there but if it isn't communicated it can cause destruction. Bergman's use of close ups and the vibrant color red are clever ways to translate the inner emotions of the sisters that they can't otherwise express. We see so much emotion and feeling in the close ups of their faces, emotion that has nowhere else to go because the dysfunction between these sisters is so great. One sister Maria longs to love, the other Karin is incapable of feeling while the third sister Agnes is on her death bed and can't pass over into the spirit world because she feels so empty and unfulfilled. These three sisters are being held together by a thread, which is none other than the family maid, Anna. Anna has a heart of pure gold that is open and caring without expecting anything in return. Perhaps it's easier for her to love because it isn't her immediate family and she doesn't experience the internal conflicts the sisters face with one another. However, we see that even though Agnes has lost her own little girl, she still remains in good faith and lives her life the best she can. She loves harder than any other character in this movie and is the only one who is fully capable of giving love and compassion to the dying sister. Meanwhile the other two attempt at getting to know one another and loving one another but find it an impossible task. Bergman is covering territory that many films refuse to enter. He explores the inner psyche of each sister in a way where we know what's going on inside of their heads, but they can't possibly reach into each other's. Bergman uncovers the flawed reality of dysfunction within the family and the tragedy of losing our ability to love and communicate with one another. Cries and Whispers is so depressingly honest about our inner nature that its almost comforting knowing that we all experience this kind of dysfunction to some degree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Swedish woman is dying of cancer. The emotional turmoil of her death allows three other women to reconcile their relations and buried emotions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is a deep gaze into the emotional complexity of the human race. Its universal themes of death, life, love, nostalgia, and alienation are what make it so striking. The main character, Agnes, is dying of an unspecified cancer. One of the first things we notice is that not only is she dying, she feels alienated. As the middle of three daughters, she feels rivalry toward her sisters, both of whom are not naturals for empathy. One of them, Maria, is selfish and vain. Karin, the oldest, is traumatized by events in her childhood. She hates physical touch, and believes fate always conspires against her. The redheaded maid, Anna, is sweet, caring and unselfish, but carries the heaviest burden of them all. She lost her child. Even so, she ends up showing more sympathy for Agnes than either of her hardened sisters. This strong character is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.Ingmar Bergman was a firm believer in the power of silence. Much of the dialogue is spoken in soft whispers, evoking the feel of voices from within the soul. Bergman uses magical realism to display the inner world of the soul, where only emotions reign. The film is set in a Swedish mansion, circa 1900, with a red-and-white color scheme inside. Also, fades to red occur frequently. And notably, there is no red in the room where Agnes lies dying in bed. Bergman visualizes the human soul as a softly lit red membrane. Red symbolizes life, vitality, and fertility--I interpreted the membrane as a yonic or womb symbol. Three of the main characters are sisters--birthed from the same womb. The nude female body, in a nonsexual context, represents the emotional tenderness only a woman could provide, and their longing for innocence and childhood. The sisters comfort Agnes by stripping nude and bathing her just hours before her death. Before this, they had checked on Agnes occasionally to check her condition, but they had not opened their hearts to the anguish of a dying woman (both physical and emotional). This genuine moment of softness shows the humanity in her sisters, and suggests that our emotions are what truly make us human, what comprise our souls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is frightening not in the sense of horror, but in the sense of just shockingly horrifying. Seeing this woman dying a painful death which forcefully brings her two sisters home to take care of her and watching the events that take place is shocking. Viewers watch as their relationships are even more damaged after a fake moment of reconciliation. The main aspects of the movie that stuck with me are the ideas of love, caring and morality. These sisters just don't get along even as much as Agnes wants them to, they just can't. At times in the film they try, but it seems like it's only a fake expression showing out of pity or guilt or maybe even compassion for Agnes. But the two sisters just want Agnes to die. They don't want to be there, they don't want to have anything to do with the situation. The fact that they think this though seems to haunt them. The two sisters have their own problems with each other. Karin states that she hates Maria but immediately seeks forgiveness. Maybe she thought that it was not right to act like that to her sister. Maria leads Karin to believe that she wants to become close to her only to distance herself even more. It makes viewers want to know what happened to these women that made them this way. With all these issues the sisters have with each other one asks where is the caring, the love and the morality of these women. Is this a statement to all of humanity or just for this story? The maid Anna is the opposite of the two sisters. She is the one who genuinely cares. Is it because she has suffered herself? The contrast in the two sisters and Anna is amazing and gets viewers to reevaluate their relationships. They think about how they have treated the ones they care for hoping not be seen as one of the sisters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries And Whispers (1972) - Ingmar Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar's "Cries And Whispers" is not just a story about sibling relationships and their pathetic human existence or mortality. A pack of wolves, perhaps, would be better suited for taking care of Karin and Maria's dying Agnes. I believe Ibsen's "Hour Of The Wolf" highly influenced Bergman's decision to brilliantly cast Agnes in her last breathing moments with a wolf-like howling exorcism that eerily penetrates the psyches of Karin and Maria. Agnes is having the last howl, sentencing them to a psychological purgatory for the rest of their breathing lives. Agnes may have suffered the most, but she was the most capable to love, to forgive, and to nurture, even at her hour of demise. Will she be free to rest in peace, or perhaps, are the voices we hear and never see, the lost voice of Agnes, a voice that was never audibly heard with flashbacks of her childhood. Is silence golden? Bergman certainly thinks so, and is definitely in command of this bloody red womb.</fullReview>

He works his film by using raw silence, close-ups and facial expression in order to build tension. By doing so, he creates not only a bond between the two characters in front of the lens, but a bond between each character and yourself. Don't be surprised if, by the end of the movie, you feel yourself experiencing emotions as the film's characters do.

		<shortDescription>The Joy and Pain of Living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Ingmar Bergman shows us the kind of drama that is present in typical, day to day life. This displays a mixture of pain and suffering, as well as kindness and cruelty. It is a story about the last days of a woman named Agnes who is dying of cancer, her two sisters, Karin and Maria, and their maid Anna who is the only one who truly cares for Agnes. Through out the film, Bergman displays the pain that life itself casts on human beings, the joy that simple things in life can bring to some, and takes us through a journey exploring the dark side of ones soul.There is an amazing surreal scene after Agnes dies, where she Agnes comes back to life and requests to see her sisters. Oddly enough, they reject Agnes and refuse to comfort her, so Anna rushes to Agnes' side. Even though this scene is a dream that Anna is having, it does not make the statement any less real. The fact that the sisters will not comfort Agness shows their true colors. Through out the entire movie, they are trying to maintain an appearance of caring, loving sisters, which is the exact opposite of what they truly are inside. In reality they are cold and remorseless women.Unlike Karin, Maria tries to be sneaky with her dark side. She tries to act like a warm, loving sister, longing to rekindle her relationships with Karin who openly despises her. However, in the end she selfish and cold, just like everyone else. Anna proves with her unconditional love to Agnes that she is the only source of true kindness in this movie.The amazing close-ups of the characters faces through out the film are Bergmans way of giving us a deeper view of their souls and showing us the pain that they are masking on the inside. The flashes of the color red through out the film represent the violence and aggressive nature behind these seemingly delicate women. Over all, I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to absolutely any and everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally shocking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From it's opening credits, as the tone rings steadily, to its final shot, "Cries and Whispers" is a masterpiece. The cinematography is gorgeous (especially the use of the color red), and the costumes and sets reflect perfectly the tone and theme of the film. The acting, of course, is what stands out for me. The performances from all four actresses is intensely raw and gripping. You truly feel their pain and suffering and anguish.There are moments in the film when you want to look away about of pure horror. Harriet Andersson plays a dying woman, and she does so with such terror in her eyes and voice that I found myself becoming very tense and disturbed. Her cries and pleas for help and the pain to stop is almost unbearable. Also, Ingrid Thulin as Karin delivers a tormented, almost cruel performance, but also brave in its bluntness and unapologetic demeanor. Liv Ullmann is brilliant as expected, although I found her character to be the least interesting of the four, which isn't necessarily a complaint. Kari Sylwan is very good as Anna, and conveys a thousand emotions and repressed feelings with simple facial expressions and glances. It's a very subdued, understated performance that stands out in the film.Overall, "Cries and Whispers" is one of Bergman's boldest and most effective films, with long tense scenes of silence inter-cut with moments of pure shock and energy. It's a film that will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Drinking Broken Glass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently been re-viewing all of the Bergman films. This has been the hardest to watch. First of all, there is the claustrophobic house with the dying sister. We eventually come to realize why the other sisters are so fearful because Agnes exemplifies their futures. They are two really cold fish who have done nothing with their lives. They have married badly (the husbands are a whole other issue), and they have no future. At least Agnes has been released though her death scene is absolutely gut wrenching. We also have Anna, the loyal servant. In period pieces don't the servants always have the upper hand? She understands much of what is going on. She can't understand why all this pain is allowed. While she can't express her disdain, she feels it. It is Agnes whom she loves because in her death there is more life than in the other two. The camera is amazing in this film, the rooms, the close-ups, the color. One of the most impressive scenes is the mundane dinner scene where Karin's husband, the diplomat, eats fish for about five minutes, while she stares at his tiresome presence. She later cuts herself to avoid sex with him. Maria is the profligate who won't even go for help when her husband, another idiot, stabs himself. He survives. She even flirts with Agnes's doctor after he pronounces Agnes's imminent death. This is quite a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viskningar och rop was a difficult film for me to watch. Although the story was beautifully filmed and told, it affected me on a personal level. I have two sisters and have hidden the fact that am bisexual from them for most of my life. Even though I love them, they often have skewed values. Although I doubt they would be as cold to me if I were dying, I do feel that they would not be comfortable with it at all, possibly even shying away in fear. I see deathas a transformation in which one leaves this life for the next. To me, death is a sacred experience and one in which family and loved ones should come together and feel comfortable, if they haven't been able to do or be so at any other time. I also connected with Agnes' character because she seems to truly value life and people-even if she cannot fully participate-as is more usually the case with those who are dying, while her sisters seem preoccupied with upholding boundaries and facades. I am not sure if Agnes is also the middle sister or not, but if so, that would further explain the complications of the relationships between the sisters and my connection to the film.Aside from the personal connection I have with this film, the issues it deals with are poignant, and the way it is shot brings out that mood. The close-ups demolish what most audiences are used to. Instead of showing the characters with an unattainable flawlessness, the close-ups reveal the indelible mortality and humanity of the characters, showcase their wrinkles, the raw, pink moistness of their tear ducts, the yellow of and cracks in their teeth, the fragility of the veins in their eyes, and the fleshy ridges of their nostrils. The close-ups show what the plot shows: The difficult truth exists beneath the surface of appearances and appears the closer that one gets to an issue or person.This movie delves into something that almost everyone can relate to: the intricacies and horrors of family relationships. It touches upon unhappy marriages, secret relationships, self-mutilation, verbal, psychological and physical abuse, death, and love. It is interesting that the closest person to Agnes is the maid Anna. Theirs is the most "normal" relationship. Ironically, it is also the least acceptable considering that it is a lesbian affair. Bergman seems to criticize the assumed infallibility of more usual relationships. Throughout the madness of the film, the few calm and real moments seem to come when Anna comforts Agnes by touching her, pressing her against her bare chest, and listening to her, even when she comes back to life after the funeral proceedings. The dysfunctional relationships are between man and woman in a lawful marriage. In those relationships there is a gelid hatred which dominates and subordinates the feelings which most would like to attribute to marriage.This film is not for everyone. I've rented this film and have yet to bring myself to watch it again. I love it, but am hesitant because of its intensity. It illustrates just how disconnected we are from each other and ourselves-especially our past. Although we can see it clearly, we cannot touch it and find it difficult to know where to begin to heal from it. We are left with our painful memories and without much knowledge of how to resolve our disconnection from the people we are closest to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman at his finest hour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few comes a film that takes the mind and drives it into a Closter-phobic thrust, fills your mouth with a chalky taste, and sends your heart beating into a caution of impending pain and anguish. It is in Ingmar Berman's 1973 picture, "Cries and Whispers," in which he brings the human condition and emotion alive through the feeling in his viewers. It is the story of two sisters and their maid, who are trapped in a mansion, watching over their dying cancer ridden sister that sends a chilling message about life and love. Filled with many close-ups, stagnant in pose, focused to attention and lead the viewer into their own sense of agony, Igmar Bergman's film follows tragic emotion with such perfect skill.Agnes, dying of cancer, lays still in her bed while her two sisters, Karin and Maria, watch over her to be of aid until her final breath. While in the household, Agnes' faithful maid, Anna, provides the comfort and warmth needed as that of a mother, a fiend and even a sister. Bergman weaves together a film with little dialogue, and perfect visual imagery that is the true mover of such a film. Facial expressions can tell stories through many of Bergman's pictures. Like such is an example in the opening of the picture in which Bergman eyes his shot on Agnes' awakening in such a hideous pain and anguish. Her womb cancer has taken over her feelings to relish her sleep and now in her final numbered days, she lays torn in pain with a sweat that suffers and destroys her enjoyment of her final days. What Bergman and his award winning cinematographer Sven Nykvist have created through this scene is one of the most gut-wrenching depictions of physical distress in motion picture history. No viewer can sit through the entire opening five-minute sequence and not find themselves at paralysis with what is shown. Bergman focuses the entire film of silence and viewer-ship of his actresses and expresses much symbolism in a film that is soaking in it. Where some films fail to create a story while engaging the viewers in an overexposure of metaphorical language, Cries and Whispers wins in multi-dimensions. Thought to be a heavy drama, cries and whispers could stand the test of being categorized in horror. Although not your typical horror of blood and demons, this film resonates like the interior of the soul as something with heart-break, Closter phobia, fear, silence, longing, sexual-disgust, self-mutilation and deception. All in all, it's silence that plays the key role in such a picture. Silence is deadly and it explains how horrible these women have come to be, women of repressed voices, and the message conveyed is that death is the only release from the pain of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that attracts the viewer with a very complex and skillful camera work, and editing; I have never seen such an artistic film based in colors and emotions like this. An almost feminist work that centers its drama in the exploration of the human condition, the suffering and loneliness through the lives of Maria, Karin, their ill sister Agnes, and the maid Ana who takes care of Agnes. The film is quite open to gender issues and sexuality and it gives a different perspective of the world of women, who later on will look down on men such as the case of Karin whose more bizarre act of cutting her own genitals makes her husband be repulsed and driven away from her, or Maria, whose husband kills himself as soon as he knows about Maria's infidelity. (Men fail to understand the women emotions). A powerful film that controls your brain through close-ups, dreams and realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>formalities that limit expression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is a critique of upper-class western society. It shows that all of the little formalities that the upper class have limit your ability to express yourself and connect to those around you. What we would call proper manners or classy behavior really is a system of restrictions on expression and behavior that puts walls between everyone. These rules are endless and yet are the definition of western high society. If you break these rules, you're a troublemaker, a black sheep, an outcast, because you can't act civilly. This creates walls between you and every person you meet, in even the most intimate of relationships, like a between sisters or spouses. Bergman gives us a story of two sisters and how they try (unsuccessfully) to deal with a third sisters impending death while not breaking the seemingly impenetrable wall of proper manners. The wall of formalities over the span of their hole lives becomes so great the it crushes the soul. It was taboo to express anything, and it tears them apart from the inside out. The two sisters become two very different people because of this. One retracts inward, becoming cold, cynical, manipulative, never wanting to even be touched. She would rather cut her vagina with a piece of broken glass than have sex with her husband. The other seems the opposite, seeming carefree, joyful, happy, always touching people. However, her interactions with others never go past the surface facade, and by the end of the film you realize that underneath it all she is even colder than the other sister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bergman's film Cries and Whispers tells the story of three sisters and their internal conflicts. Karen and Maria come to be with their sick sister Agnes, who is on terminally ill. Anna the maid, treats Agnes like a real sister unlike Agnes real sisters who pretend to care. As the story unfolds, the emotions are exposed in close ups, that reveal the truth of each individual. In Cries and Whispers, touch plays a significant role between the sisters and themselves. Karen doesn't want to be touched in any way, Maria wants to touch Karen, and Anna the maid uses touch to help the dying sister, Agnes, to overcome her pain. Throughout the film, the color red is used, in different scenes, the color of the furniture, drapes and walls. Bergman's use of red symbolizes the understanding of the human soul. Bergman directs these women wonderfully to get full emotion in his film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The overall performance of the actors is great in, 'Cries and Whispers'. Each brings their presence to the scenes. Even when there is just silence, true to Bergman's style, the actors tell the audience the story through their being. They are all quite expressive and can convey their thoughts and feelings with out words. Again, true to Bergman style, they use touch, glances and when there are close ups, their faces are full of emotion. We see this when Karin and husband have a quiet dinner together.It is said that talent is difficult to measure or quantify. Yet, one thing that determines a good actor is their consistency. This is seen in, 'Cries and Whispers'. For one, they are true to their character through the film. Secondly, some of the actors in the movie, like Liv Ullman, have been in other Bergman movies. This is evidence that talent is also the consistency an actor can play a wide variety of roles.The actors also do a splendid job of playing conflicting emotions. For example, Karin acts like a part of her wants to be touched by her sister Maria, yet Karin barks, "Don't touch me." This painful contraction is quite complex and she pulls it off realistically. These characters do this back and forth through out the film, and the performance holds together weather they are crying, being vulnerable, or being cold and abrasive.Furthermore, the ensemble works extremely well. They are sensitive to each other and responsive, even if it is very subtle. They embody the characters so well that they seem to belong to the set. They blend in to the English manor house seamlessly.All this has an effect on the audience. When Anne, the housekeeper, is fired from her job, one feels bad for this saint of a women who has done nothing but good for the family. Overall, this movie has various aspects that are great, its hard to focus one just one element. Yet, as for the acting, it was marvelous.</fullReview>

Considering that there are many people in the world that wish to be hugged only and just for one time. The tone of each scene reflects a great sense of loneliness. Sister that are from the same blood, and in fact in could be, and in most culture should be, the closest to one another, are so far away form each other both emotionally and physically.

		<shortDescription>A Sisters' Reunion Leads to an Emotional Rebirth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers, an example of European post-war cinema, is a Swedish film that tells the story of three sisters that struggle with their true emotions over one another. Ingmar Bergman, the writer and director, shares with his viewers the emotional chaos each sister battles with as they are forced to reunite. Agnes, one out of the three sisters, has been diagnosed with cancer and is given a few short days to live. The other two sisters and the maid, Anna, while staying in a Swedish manor, provide moral support at their own personal level. As Agnes suffers from terrible physical agony, the other two sisters suffer intense pain, but through an emotional aspect. The pain the other two sisters experience derives from the loneliness that accompanies their lifestyle by choosing to stay in an unhappy marriage. The grief and solitude that the two sisters live with is projected onto their dying sister as they both try to feel love once again. Anna, the maid, becomes the catalyst for the unconditional love that the dying sister deserves. As Anna provides Agnes with the caring and comfort she needs, the other two sisters are left to wallow in their own self pity. It is during this time that they exhibit brief moments of vulnerability. This, in turn, leads them to finally realize that, if they choose to be loving and caring, they will receive the same in return. The story, despite its disturbing emotional conflict between the three sisters, is one of intense beauty as well as a profound statement on the human condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully haunting film about three sisters, one who is terminally ill, and their maid. The two sisters, Karin and Maria, have come to be with their sick sister, Agnes, during her final days. Although Agnes believes that her sisters have come because they love her, we soon find out that they only came to figure out who will get what when she dies. We also soon see that the sisters, Karin and Maria at least, hate each other. I don't think that Agnes hated her sisters, it seemed as if she truly loved and cherished them, especially whilst she was slowly dying. Yet no one had as strong of a love as Maria had for Agnes. We see the love Anna has for Agnes in the scene where Anna exposes her beasts and holds Agnes close to her in order to calm her pain. The gesture comes across as motherly, and we see Agnes reciprocate her love by how she is calmed by this gesture.The film also gives us small glimpses into the lives of Karin and Maria. Both are married, and neither are happy. Karin suffers through an emotionless and bleak life with a husband for whom appearance seems to be everything. In her small flashback we see just how unhappy, and unstable, her life is as she mutilates herself with a shard of glass. Maria is a slightly different story, although she seems happily married with children, we soon discover that she longs for the family doctor. In her flashback we see her attempting to seduce him once again, it is implied that that have had something in the past, only to be ignored. An important scene takes place when the doctor ask Maria to look at herself in the mirror, he points out to her lines on her face which he attributes to her constant sneers. This scene preps us for the final scene were we see Maria for what she really is. Throughout the movie, she comes across as the most loving and kindhearted of the sisters, yet when she has a heartfelt moment with Karin and finally has her open up to her, she becomes cold and cruel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is quite heart wrenching, but even so, it is now one of my favorites. The four main women carry the movie so believably and wonderfully, I never got bored with the lack of difference in characters. Liv Ullman was fantastically evil and manipulative as Maria, but you still seemed to love her at the same time. Ingrid Thulin as Karin was hauntingly distant as she struggled with her issues with opening up and being close to others. Kari Sylwan was heartbreakingly loyal and loving for Agnes without even being related by blood, and you couldn't help but fall in love with her. And last, Harriet Andersson as Agnes played a women dying and coming to terms with God and her relationships and life. The movie severely makes you open your eyes to your own relationships and what is important in your own life. When you walk away from watching this film, you are definitely not the same person as when you walked into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Liv Ullman is great in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Live Ullman was the true stand out in this film thanks to her turn as the ruthless Maria. Maria was a vicious, callous, for lack of a better word, bitch. Whereas Agnes was dying a rather painful death throughout the majority of the film and can be forgiven for being so delusional and poor Karin was, well, nuts, Maria was the true villain in this film as far as lies and deception go. The entire film, she wants everyone to believe that she is the sweetest of everyone with the most earnest of intentions, however, she turns out to be just the opposite. One of the last scenes of the film that really stood out for me was, after she had forced Karin against her will to open up to her and express her emotions, she simply uses it against her and brushes her off before the two sisters leave the mansion, after Karin comes to her in hopes that there can be some sort of non-formal relationship between the two. I have to give credit to Liv Ullmann, the actress who plays Maria, for making such a delightfully wicked, unpredictable turn during those final minutes. Throughout the entire film, each of the three sisters were trying to express themselves for who they really, genuinely, were, Agnes was a genuinely decent person who seemed to be dealing with her repressed lesbianism, although than is pushed to the background because of her dying. As far as Karin is concerned, the woman was not mentally well, she was married to some old man she was forced to fornicate with on a nightly basis and was full of angst the only way she felt she could express herself was to mutilate her genitals. Despite her insanity, Karin desperately wanted to connect with someone or something, she just didn't know how, which I found gave the character a great deal of empathy. It was Maria though who was in control of her emotions the whole time, from the moment she appears on screen, asleep or not. Even in her flashbacks, she had a cold control to her. After her husband suspects, rightfully, that she is having an affair with the doctor, he tries to absurdly kill himself, and her reaction is priceless. Cold detachment at it's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" is an extremely emotional film that emphasizes touch to express the sisters' character and feelings. Personally, I've never seen so many close-ups, not to mention, the long-takes. It is important to not take the flashbacks at face value. The flashbacks are very subjective and have metaphorical undertones, which I don't fully understand.On another note, Bergman did a fantastic job at creating one of the most disturbing scenes that I have ever witnessed. Anyone who is reading this can probably infer that I'm talking about the scene when Karin inserts a piece of glass into her vagina and then welcomes her husband to their routine night of sex. Bergman took me to my limit with that scene. If he would've shown anything more graphic then the audience probably wouldn't have been able to handle it. We can all thank Bergman for his restraint. Although difficult to watch, the scene is critical to unraveling Karin's character. Obviously her husband doesn't understand her, so Karin is left to drastic measures to demonstrate how she feels. Karin seemed to have an eerie sense of pleasure amidst all of her pain and blood, and it makes the audience wonder how has the lack of affection and touch in Karin's life influenced her psyche and emotions.Bergman's brings the question of "why don't we touch?" to the table. As humans, touch makes us vulnerable. Bergman's film illustrates how touch is used to communicate. Maria tries to touch Karin in the film but Karin is shocked by it. Then, when the two finally have an intimate moment, Bergman cuts the sound out to show that their affection for one another doesn't quite make sense. It distorts the feelings and the audience doesn't know whether the sisters actually feel affectionate towards one another.Agnes is perhaps the only redeemable character because her touch is pure. Her touch is motherly towards Agnes when Agnes' sisters don't want to be around her. Furthermore, Agnes' sisters don't display any signs of love when Agnes' comes back to life momentarily in Anna's dream sequence. The dream sequence explains the movie in the nutshell and accurately portrays each character.This is a very provocative and challenging movie, but worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very delicate and expressive movie by Bergman. The sensitive approach to the life of these women brings up subjects that are often ignored by the majority of people while here you will see the opposite. From cheating to self mutilation, the scenes all happen within a house where two sisters are visiting a third one who is very, very sick. It is amazing how the time plays a big role is this movie and how well it is represented by the tick of the clock. Clocks are everywhere, if not on walls and ticking, on the close shots of the characters and their silent expressions of agony and pain. It amazed me how intimate the movie was in a way where the whole movie talked about not more than 4 days in the house but also how much was going on the life of each one of the sisters and the maid. Maria is the younger and prettiest sister, whom is married and cheats on her husband, who tries to kill himself unsuccessfully. Karin is the other sister who is also married and unhappy. Her way of showing her pain and lack of general satisfaction is by self mutilation. Meanwhile she repeats the expression "tissue of lies", that can refer to how they have to keep their image and look like they are happy with their marriage and about life in general when in fact she has little to none experience with love whatsoever. On the attempt made by Maria to get closer to her, she blows it saying she never liked her. Not even Agnes, the sick sister was able to touch her heart. Bergman makes it very easy to feel deep inside the pain each one of these women is going though. The passage through scenes is also very remarkable with fades of blood red combined with silent and meaningful close ups. Unhappy marriages and lack the lack of love among sisters and family members is something that might be more normal than we think but for sure hidden behind tissues of lies and appearances that have to be kept in front of society. Another woman that's probably the most pure at heart among the others in the house is Anna, the servant. Anna has been working for the family for a long time and she took care of Agnes throughout her sickness offering her love, care and warmth. Anna is a great balance being an outsider and an insider in the story acting like a connector between the audience and the messed up values of the family. Bergman brilliantly makes that balance between the evilness of Maria and Karin and the good heart of Anna and Agnes to make the story so real and touching for the viewer. The constant fades to blood red and the red walls and lack of furniture makes the whole environment seem like an empty river of blood where their souls keep on swimming and agonizing without really getting anywhere. It feels like they are too small if compared to the whole system that is society and where they grew up on as for they are condemned to live in this unhappy world of theirs and they must adjust to it. That makes me think about how many similar careless and loveless family members there are out there and how their lives are reduced to appearances. Great and sensitive work by Bergman that will make your heart ache, if you have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Cries and Whispers", by Ingmar Bergman is about pain, loneliness, and death. It's a film that deals with suffering but also with the warmth of life.In the beginning of the film, we see a close up shot of a clock. The ticking clock is a recurring motif in the movie that might symbolize running out of time, or life coming to an end. Then we see Agnes who wakes up and seems to be in excruciating pain. She is suffering from terminal cancer in its final stages. Agnes lives with her maid Anna on her parent's property. Both of her sisters Karin and Maria are visiting to support her in her last few days.During most of the movie, we see flashbacks of the three sisters and their family life. The film doesn't offer a lot of explanations but we find out that Agnes is alone and her two sisters are unhappily married.The four women are very different from each other. Karin is the rational one who is portrayed as cold and doesn't like human touch; Maria is the sensual one and seems to be in love with her body. Agnes seems to be right in the middle. She appears to be the connection of rationality and sensuality.Anna the maid is very quiet during the whole movie but she is always present and ready to offer her help. Towards the end of the movie, when Anna is let go by the family, she is offered to take one of Agnes's possessions. She rejects the offer and tells the family that she doesn't want anything. This shows that Anna acted out of pure human solidarity and never expected any kind of reward. If Karin represents rationality, Maria sensuality and Agnes the sensitive soul, then Anna stands for humanity.Out of the three sisters Agnes seems to be the one, who despite of her illness or maybe because of it comes to a better understanding of life. Anna, who secretly kept Agnes's diary, reads a passage at the end of the film which is illustrated in the last scene. We see the four women take a walk in the park in white dresses. This image ties in with the beginning of the film. The circle closes and we hear Agnes' voice say that all pain has disappeared and that she feels gratitude to have lived such a rich life."Cries &amp; Whispers" is a very touching and visually stylish movie with riveting performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death, pain, sadness--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very haunting. Bergman used the color red to show pain, blood, and the soul. The clocks in the house kind of reminds you of how empty the place is and the film itself was very quiet, despite Agnes's screaming in pain. I, myself did not really enjoy this movie even though the film was well made. I do not enjoy watching depressing movies. I think the world is already depressing enough. I understand that Bergman's take on this film is not only to show how sad the movie is, he also showed us the unconditional love that Anna had for Agnes. Bergman also showed us how Karin and Maria dealt with their own demons. I think Karin inserting a broken glass in her vagina was a way for her to feel something, and to show her husband that she was alive. The most memorable scene for me was when Agnes died. She died in a way that she almost died for her sisters sins and they way she died, she almost looked like she was crucified, her arms wide open like Jesus on the cross. She also resurrected like Christ. A scene when Agnes fell and Anna held her the way Mary held Jesus as he was taken down from the cross. I think it's a way Bergman showing the audience how Agnes suffered by having similarity to the suffering of Christ.---This film is not for everyone, but you will appreciate it when you watch it with open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i bought almost every movie from Bergman, but just at a certain time i could watch one of them. so from all the movies i have from him i just watched till now 4 masterpieces (seventh seal, fanny and Alexander, wild strawberries, persona) and now i took the time to watch cries and whispers. for me it was sometimes a real horror movie i had to starring on. i was not able to look at some important sequences. the title is program. everything else is doing in the same way. the whole movie contains more or less just one color which is red. then there is the black of the clothes and just in one dream sequence a white. the whole movie is so deep you can not imagine. the sound is minimal, the dialog too, each breath by the actors let you be speechless. wild strawberries is almost a happy movie by seeing this one. it's a hypnotic one, which leaves you quite alone after seeing it. a truly masterpiece in every aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bergman was envious of what he would term 'natural film makers' siting Tarkovsky and Kurasawa.However, Cries and Whispers, Scenes from a Marriage (the complete TV miniseries not the film, Shame, Persona, The Passion of Anna and Face to Face (once again the TV miniseries rather than the cinema release)seen collectively is a truly harrowing somewhat auto-surgical experience. Yes of course there were other wonders...The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Virgin Spring, Smiles on a Summer Night but none of these have haunted me as Cries and Whispers still does 20 years after my first viewing..confined within an austere womb this painfully re cognitive dream piece has moments of devastating power...The acting by the women is of course sublime...Has any other director demanded so much self revelation as Bergman does here and elsewhere through his distinctive oeuvre...enjoy the pain</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hard not to be shaken after watching C&amp;W. Yes its an "art" film and I was suspicious of what I was supposed to see and whether I was too dumb to see it anyway. Certainly the red, claustrophobic and suffocating house was a metaphor for internal things, e.g. I was thinking this place must be around the corner from the the House of Usher. Sexual repression is an overwhelming and stifling theme. I can't see why some people dismiss the overtones of lesbianism: Anna partially undresses and appears to offer a breast to dying Anna, who never married. Maria, after "foreplay", attempts to give Karin a full kiss on the lips. Guys are either cold, cuckolds, controlling or indifferent - certainly not comforting in any form or manner.It doesn't matter. Its just a great film. Anyone who has NOT witnessed someone dying of cancer can't fully appreciate the horror of the death scenes, right down to the wretched sound of the breathing and the death rattle. The character of Karin has been described as, at best, extremely neurotic but I think that Bergman truly intended to depict her as borderline -if not clinically- insane. I'm surprised that few critics don't feature the fact that Maria appears to be a/the survivor. Maria was -according to Karin- mother's favorite and though she suffers greatly through Agnes' ordeal, her last scene depicts her as reentering the world without significant damage.I'll have to watch the film again as I need to learn more about Agnes and Anna. In C&amp;W the squeaky wheels get the grease. Poor Agnes and Anna, who appreciate life to some degree, are almost overwhelmed by the schemes and anxieties of Maria and Karin. I must also find out if Bergman commented extensively on his film.</fullReview>

I think that makes me think this film has a simple story with powerful details.I like the simple style. because it lasts for long time. The style makes more strong and fresh today, even the film was made long time ago.It is simple, but not easy to understand. I think the film was treated as art. that means it contains many perspective to see, and the view can change every time you see.To me, It is really hard to find a simple good film because many directors don't know what they are doing. Bergman knew he was doing because he used same actors in his film, so they communicated well.This movie was well balanced on everything. I would like to see the movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is about a woman dying of cancer, Agnes, her two sisters who watch over her, Maria and Karin, and their maid, Anna. It is a powerful, character driven film about the relationship of these three sisters (or lack there of) and their struggle to communicate. It's about the difficulty in letting yourself be touched by others, and the vulnerability that comes from opening yourself up.Maria and Karin are emotionally crippled characters; Maria is an adulteress who hides behind her flirtations and is unable to handle any sort of confrontation and Karin is a sadomasochist who is completely unable to express herself. They are different and alienated sisters who have not had any real communication since they were children. Even after a night of bonding and talking heart to heart, things seem to go back to the way they were before, as if Bergman were saying that opening up and touching (both emotionally and physically) are important first steps, but don't seem to actually solve anything in the long run by themselves.Anna is a character in contrast to these two sisters. She seems to be the only one who is capable of unconditional love and provides the most warmth and comfort for Agnes as she is dying, despite the fact that she has arguably suffered the most from loss in her life.I found Agnes to be the most interesting character. She took pleasure in the littlest things in life, such as a stroll through the garden with her sisters at the onset of her illness or later simply gazing out the window when she has the strength. She seems to be the only sister who takes complete solace and refuge in the presence of the other two (I sometimes got the feeling that Maria and Karin wanted Agnes to die a bit faster). The final line in the movie, a quote from Agnes' journal, shows her appreciation and love for those around her and for what life has given her, stating she is thankful for the presence of her sisters. I found this particularly bittersweet: it is good to know Agnes felt so good around her sisters but I seriously doubt her sisters ever really felt the same about her. The question I always have about Agnes is whether she had this profound love and appreciation for love before she got sick, or if this love came because she got sick. I like to think that it was the former (based, for instance, on the priest's words about her) but people do tend to feel this towards the end of their lives more. Most likely, it is a combination of the two.The film is beautifully shot, with deep tones of red complementing the rest of the rather white and monotonous backdrop. The film is beautiful and will leave you thinking about life and meaning and love and alienation as only a Bergman film can. A very powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is a masterpiece of cinematography and atmosphere, two of the most important elements of a movie. Unlike most of Ingmar Bergman's films, Cries and Whispers uses saturated colour, the turn-of-the-century rural Swedish mansion being primarily crimson, a symbol of guilt, sin and anger, blood and sex, as well as the characters' struggle with courage and sacrifice. The time period seems insignificant to the story, except that it endows the film with a quiet, insulatedly domestic feeling.A dying woman is overseen by her sisters as she deteriorates and her pain grows. Both worry and disgust vie for control of the sisters' emotions, as they seem incapable of empathy. Liv Ullmann is, as always, incredible, but Ingrid Thulin stands out even more than her. She is so emotional and provocative. The only comfort and solace comes from her maid, played with a crushing tenderness by Kari Sylwan.As is a telling characteristic of Bergman's, logic of symbolism is applied to emotional pain, and though we look at some scenes such as the sisters retreating from their dying sister as she grasps for their hands, each repelling in their own ways, in a more detached and intellectual way, there are scenes such as the final one, which shows Harriet Andersson's face, juxtaposed with her voices, juxtaposed with all that has happened, which draw deep feelings from us as the final taste left in one's mouth as the film closes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply disturbing and haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's Cries &amp; Whispers is a story of death, real death and the walking dead, as epitomized by three sisters: Agnes (Harriet Andersson), Maria (Liv Ullmann) and Karin (Ingrid Thulin). At the turn of the century in Sweden, Maria and Karin come to visit their dying sister Agnes, who is in terrible pain from what is probably cancer. Agnes has perhaps a fantasy idea of her sisters, as the last scene tells us. In truth, Agnes is the only one capable of feeling pain; her sisters really don't want to be part of her dying process and are there out of obligation. Only the maid Anna is there to hold Agnes, to touch her, and to love her.Maria's affair hurt her marriage to the sensitive Joakim, and when he stabbed himself and begged for help, she just stood and looked at him. (Evidently he lives, though.) Karin hates her cold husband and what she does to keep him away from her is one of the most shocking scenes in the history of film.We're not told what childhood trauma, what "tissue of lies" of which Karin speaks that has driven these women to lack compassion or empathy; we know only that Maria was her mother's favorite. We don't know anything about the father. There is a homoerotic undertone to Karin's relationship with Maria, which Karin seems to both want and reject.The cinematography in Cries &amp; Whispers in glorious, from the vivid red that is used to punctuate scenes, to the women's surrounds. In one startling scene that resembles a painting, the women sit in different parts of the room -- Maria in white, staring out the window which is framed by red drapes; Karin in gray at the piano, and on a sofa in the back, a dejected Anna. Each is lost in thought; they are miles apart.Later, as Anna reads Agnes' diary, Agnes recalls a walk the three sisters took along with Anna when they first arrived, the three sisters in crisp white with white umbrellas, Anna by their side. Stunning.The overall coldness of the family is downright icy as they talk about Anna at the end. Maria and Karin are unlikeable characters, and one has no sympathy for them. The only sympathy engendered is for Anna's ability to love and accept love in return and for Agnes' horrible suffering. Her suffering, however, ends. Her sisters' suffering will be infinite.A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is most defiantly Scandinavian. Bergman, himself Swedish, draws on Scandinavian influences such as the modernist playwright Henrik Ibsen. Cries and Whispers is very "Ibsen- esque" in that it deals with turmoil within a family and the issues of morality surrounding it. The film deals with the relationship between a women dying of cancer, her two sisters, and her maid. The two healthy sisters are constantly distracted by their own quarrels to truly care for their sister, and the fact that the two may just be ready for their sister to die. Thus, it is left for the maid to take care of the sick sister, and she does so with more care than either of healthy sisters. This allows for an examination of the moral responsibilities of what it means to be a family. Though Cries and Whispers is excellent in its content, like an Ibsen play, it can be very slow. It is slow enough that the pace can become off-putting in the age of reality T.V. and instant gratification.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Effect of Emotions through Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I want to compliment the outstanding performances of all the women in this film. Being that they were all significant characters, each one had their own story. Their acting skills were unquestionably remarkable, placing each one all on the same boat. It was as if their energy was fed right off one another. Aside from a great cast, I felt Cries and Whispers was effective to me because as the youngest daughter of three in my family, I felt as if I related closely to how these sisters reacted to one another. It made me realize why, we as human beings act a certain way and how hard it is for many people to express how they feel with words. Rarely in the film, you hear anyone say the words ''I love you.'' The women do not say it to their husbands nor to their family members. I believe it has a lot to do with the upbringing of one. In Agnes' childhood past, the audience learns that growing up, she felt very lonely because her mother had favored Maria, who resembles the mother's physical appearance and personality. The only time one sees Agnes and her mother reach out to one another is when they share a moment of understanding just by looking their each other and touching faces, they both felt a sudden emptiness within one another. Maria, the youngest of the the three sisters, is the flirtatious one, who has a hard time dealing with death. She usually runs away instead of facing it. In the scene where her husbands stabs himself in the chest because of her infidelity, he calls her to help him, realizing he does not want to die, but instead of reaching out to him, she freaks out and walks away. I found it fascinating how Agnes was very pleasant during her last days of life. She appreciated nature and the little things that her sisters and Anna did for her. Whether it was combing her hair gently or reading her a story, those were things that fulfilled her life. When Agnes pushed back the hands on the clock, it represented how much she wanted to hold on to time. It showed how much she wanted the time to stop because she knew the value of second would never come back. The maid, Anna, is a young, grateful, and loving person who had lost her only child, but devoted her most of her life to Agnes and treated her with great care. She not only did her job as a maid, but she was a long lasting friend of Agnes. She would hold her carefully on her breasts and kissed her as if she had never been loved more. Unfortunately, Karin and Maria did not give Anna the save love nor did they respect her as a person. Even after Agnes passed, the sisters and their husbands decided to let her stay at the house at most. In the end, Anna received something more valuable, Agnes' most prized possession, her diary. In the scene where Anna seems to be in a dream and hears Agnes after she had already passed, I realized that Agnes was calling desperately for her sisters to be there for her and help her move on to her afterlife, but not once did she call Anna. Karin comes to Agnes' room but refuses to hold her because she claims she never loved Agnes. Maria nearly forces herself to come close to Agnes but quickly pulls away once they touch. I could imagine how that may be heartbreaking for Anna.When the priest comes to pray for Agnes, he says that her faith was stronger than his and he shed a tear. This part made me realize that this man was not perfect and he was also seeking answers for the many questions he had about life. He felt that out of all people to suffer, Agnes was very pure and graceful, therefore it did not make sense for God to take her away and make her go through much suffering.Karin's facial expressions could scare the living life of any human being. Many times she would show formality towards her family and almost no remorse. She has problems with anyone getting to know her and touching her. I think Karin was the hardest one to understand because she did was very uptight and was very stubborn. She takes too much pride in herself to have to apologize to anyone. At one point Maria reaches out to Karin about becoming friends and embracing one another, but Karin does not respond back, struggling between living her life the way it is or giving their friendship a chance. The vulnerability is revealed in each women as the story unfolds.These sisters were torn between death and communicating what they felt in the interior at the same time. It was almost as if they rather have Agnes die than show compassion. Bergman himself had experience a lot with faith, using that as one of the themes in Cries and Whispers and also in his other films later on. He was very capable of opening his actors to certain emotions. These characters were so vivid and authentic, one might wonder if the actor themselves had once felt this empty.At the end of the film, Agnes' memory of her sisters flashed back to the time all three sisters and Anna came out to the swings. The audience can not hear what they were talking about but they all looked happy and there was laughter that made that moment worth decades of isolation and neglect from one another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: may contain spoilers. One of Bergman's saddest and depressing films. The film is a true eye opener in terms of exceptional cinematography and production design. The interior of the house is red -- which symbolizes the inside of a soul. The color red was an ideal pick for the tone of this film. The character development is fantastic. When Bergman introduces each sister -- it feels as if there is something more to them. Another words, the three sisters are filled with secrets. Secrets which include betrayal and quite possible cheating. It is intriguing to see the three sisters struggle with their lives. Even though the sisters are rich, neither of them are happy. Overall, it is a must see psychological drama filled with a variety of unstable emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments of the subjective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is a film that carries extreme power and one that is likely to touch you deeply. The plot is roughly as follows; Two sisters are placed in the same situation by the third sister (Agnus) who is dying from an anonymous terminal illness. However, although in the same circumstances, these two sisters are separated by a world of personal malcontent and neurotic suffering. The symbolic traumas of their past experiences are revealed to us through narrative flashbacks, and the isolation of these people is graphically reiterated by the cold pale light of Autumn seeping in through the windows. The inability of the sisters to come to terms with their own whispering guilt forces them into solitary suffering and destroys intimacy between them. They are unable to provide the love that their dying third sister so desperately needs, just as they are unable to love themselves. Bergman allows us to feel the desperation for the mitigation of Agnus' suffering, and the longing we feel to offer her what she is crying for is personified by the servant (Anna) who in this respect comes to represent our entry into the film. She is removed from direct interference in the action because of her position, and her main participation in the story is mostly one of marginal observation, therefore mirroring the audiences own involvement. Although she is no blood relation, she offers Agnes what the audience longs to, consolation. At times Anna becomes synonymous with the emotional involvement of the audience, alleviating both Agnus' suffering and also ours each time she offers her help. It seems here that guilt is the anxiety that 'whispers' in the solitude, and that love is the voice that 'cries' for an answer. The film is encapsulated in vibrant red rooms, which by Bergman's own description, are the representation of the interior of the soul. Cries and Whispers is not a film that easily offers itself to critical assessment because of its deep immersion in the emotional and intuitive unconscious. For this reason one may find it difficult (at least rationally) to summarize in terms of its morality or meaning, however convenient these descriptions are to our sense of orientation. It may be described as a film that focuses on the suffering of life as compared to that of life before death; a film that matches dying agony with living agony and every shading in between, including loss of human contact and empathy. Bergman's own description of the film is just as arbitrary, 'it is a film about one who loves becoming the only real life and real life becoming an illusion'. Like many of Bergman's films, death takes place in this picture both physically and metaphorically. Certainly the nature of this piece means that, like any piece of art, it will always be open to personal subjective perception and will leave each viewer to their own efforts at assimilation. The last comment the film provides, amidst the inexorable procession of time, seems to be 'Was life worth the suffering of death?'</fullReview>

When I finally found on a rent store, I was amazed, because I was willing to see if the movie would mark me so profoundly. The result: yes, dude, it really marked me, very deeply. It's so hard to describe how you feel seeing it, it's a sensation that you must feel for yourself. There aren't words enough to describe the sensation, you kind of feel a little disturbed. It's incredible to notice how Bergman's works say so much without words, using just images. This one show his hability perfectly. If you still haven't seen it, look for it as soon as possible.

		<shortDescription>as deep as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Igmar Bergman describes his 1973 masterpiece Cries and Whispers as "an exploration of the soul". It sure is, in a profoundly moving and haunting way. It is set in a very surreal mansion with red walls, floors and curtains. The story concerns two sisters and a servant taking care of their other dying sister. We see scenes from each characters life. Bergman manages to express insight concerning human experience and behavior simply by showing two people interacting. He does this with a combination of acting, lighting, camera work, movement, writing and direction. It is always incredible to take in the work of someone who had mastered his or her art form. I think the single most incredible performance I have ever seen is by Harriet Andersson, who plays the sick sister in the bed. I guarantee you've never seen anything like this. This film stirs up strange and disturbingly beautiful feelings ?it is definitely not for everyone. Bergman addresses taboos but uses them as tools to get deeper into subjects like tenderness, hatred and death. He really explores the most profound questions in life with Cries and Whispers.If you get the Criterion DVD make sure and watch the hour-long interview with Bergman: it is extraordinary candid, honest and deeeeeeep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's bleak examination into the despair of life and the loneliness of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second most striking feature of Cries and Whispers (1972) is its use of silence. It is within these prolonged moments of images robbed of sound that Bergman's clearly establishes a sense of tortured claustrophobia, and the idea of characters disconnected - not only from their friends and family - but also from themselves. This is something that is apparent from most of Bergman's work stretching as far back as The Faith Trilogy (1961-1963); however, the use of silence here is much more notable, not only for its element of deconstructing the natural rhythm that we would normal expect from film, but in the way in which it establishes a mood of trapped and tortured suffocation that will permeate the very core of the film's central identity.It is within this silence that Bergman allows his claustrophobic chamber piece about death, decay and the breakdown of communication to unfold, knowing full well that any brief release of emotion - any spilled secret or slip of the mask - will resonate throughout the house and throughout this distant, enigmatic family. As a result, the silence of Cries and Whispers is cold and uncomfortable; prolonged to the point of almost absurdity as we spend the first few minutes of the film hoping and waiting for someone to speak, some sound beyond that of the distant ticking clock and all its mocking allusions to time and life slowly slipping away to break through and offer some sort of respite from the strangulating despair that Bergman has so carefully created. It is ironic of course that the sound that does finally break this impenetrable wall of silence is not a note of hope or of joy, but is instead a scream of pain and anguish; the first suffering cry before the inevitable unravelling of thoughts, feelings and deceits.It is no surprise that Bergman chose to this title, since it is the combination of sounds and silence, the spaces between words that say so much more than conventional dialog ever could. This goes further towards maintaining that incredibly numbing atmosphere filled with cold, sickness, illness and disease; a painful world where the death rattle choke of Harriet Andersson speaks volumes, not only about her own character, but of the feelings of the other three women who tend to her draconian-like deathbed. As is often the case with Bergman, the drama here is localised mostly to a single location, in this case a large family manor in the pastoral Swedish countryside, where characters congregate in some kind of seclusion, plagued by the many sinful, unspoken and embarrassing secrets that seem to permeate from the guilt and despair of these three very different women. It is this sense of inner pain that embodies the house with a shocking red hue, offering the colour or blood, the colour of sickness, the colour of rage. This brings us to the first most striking feature of Cries and Whispers; the incredible use of colour.The continual image of white-clad figures against a backdrop of piercing deep red is near iconic within Bergman's career, with the film even fading to red during key moments to further stress the idea of characters being swallowed up by this thick, acrid stench of death, which clings to the walls of this house that traps secrets with no sense of escape. This combined with Bergman's extraordinary use of close-ups and physical composition creates an experience that is all the more rewarding. The performances of the four female leads, Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Kari Sylwan and Liv Ullman are all without a doubt fantastic, with each character representing a separate element that in some way goes towards the creation of a single being. Needless to say this is perhaps one of the weightiest, most downbeat films ever made, even if the last scene does suggest some kind of spiritual transcendence.Regardless, the journey there is such a shattering one, that some viewers are bound to be a put-off, with that continually cold and clinical atmosphere, coupled with the notions of death, depression and bitter disappointment so very central to the plot, making this a film that rewards on an intellectual level, but certainly requires work. With this in mind, Cries and Whispers certainly isn't a film for everyone. It's a slow grind into a very murky pool of shattered lives and bitter desperation; where shots are drawn out without any major cuts or coverage, creating a sense of prolonging that mirrors that of Agnes's terrible condition. Nonetheless, it remains a bold artistic statement from a filmmaker then at the height of his creative prowess; certainly not my favourite Bergman film, but still one that is very much worth experiencing at least once.</fullReview>

This is probably the most depressing film I've ever seen and the way Bergman brings on this sadness is quite unique. The beautiful use of red throughout the film adds another dimension and the cinematography is remarkable. The real standout is the performance by Anderson, which should have won her an Oscar. Her dying moments are more disturbing than those certain scenes in The Exorcist, which was up for Best Picture the same year. This certainly isn't a film I'll want to watch often but it was very moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Masterpiece by a masterful filmmaker..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the countryside somewhere in Sweden during the 18th century there is a splendid country manor. On the surface it all looks very conspicuous, but when the doors are opened and one feels it's killing atmosphere, hears the ticking clocks and sees the dominant color of red, a cryptic aura emerges. The country manors owner Agnes who has been lying in bed for quite some time struggling with cancer have recently gotten a visit from her two sisters Karen and Maria who has come to watch over her until see takes her last breath. Karen who lives in a platonic marriage seems unmoved by her sister's fatal condition, and her bitter attitude towards her sister Maria seems to have far deeper reasons than she expresses. Maria cries her sorrowful tears when she is with Agnes, but as soon as she is by herself she wanders into her passionate past memories of her lover David. With desperate cries and painful shouts, Agnes tries to achieve her sisters affection, but the only person who seems to be able to give her the love she so tenderly needs is her considerate maid Anna. Ingmar Bergman says in his book "Images" (1991) that he in a dream had a clear vision of four women dressed in white. Dreams are central in this psychological drama which can be described as a spiritual nightmare in which four women in white have bewildered themselves in their own tortured souls. The films leading motive is the prominent color red that symbolizes the human soul. It's remarkable effect is much due to Sven Nykvist's mesmerizing cinematography which is a visual highlight in cinema history. The image of the buxom maid sitting on the bed with Agnes on her lap as if she was her own child is so painfully beautiful that one could have thought it was a painting from Vincent Van Gogh or Michelangelo Buonarroti. This isolated chamber-piece can at times feel like one is being caught somewhere between life and death. The films shifting atmosphere and ways of provoking reactions is largely a result of the actresses inviolable performances. Swedish actress Harriet Anderson gives the performance of her life as the dying Agnes and in the flashback-scenes Ingmar Bergman shows the viewers a cheerfulness and warmth that stands in contrast to the films present time. Pain, guilt, denial, self-punishment, nostalgia, longing and death are well explored themes in this ascetic requiem where the well-chosen classic music is performed by composers Johan Sebastian Bach and Frederic Chopin. It may seem as if this is the film where Ingmar Bergman takes his final confrontation with his demons and releases himself from all restrains. In his search for the innermost truths of the soul he probably reached as far as he ever could have come in "Cries and Whispers". A revealing though fictional portrayal of the human soul and a masterpiece by a masterful filmmaker and a masterful cinematographer which is revering for it's cinematic aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great deal of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are like old friends. This is not one of them. The film tells a story of a woman dying of cancer, kept company in her last days by her two sisters and devoted female servant. Aside from the suffering of the dying woman, which is just plain grim, the emotional content is found in the interaction of the other two sisters, Liv Ullman and Ingrid Thulin. These two women, each with their own set of emotional baggage, alternately attack and console each other, ultimately accomplishing very little in the way of reconciliation. I place Cries and Whispers near the bottom of the dozen or so Bergman films that I watch from time to time. Not a good place to start your Bergman. Try Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries or even Winter Light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and Painful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is at times a genuinely painful experience to watch. This film deals with loneliness, despair and emotional isolation. It depicts quite a devastating picture of a family situation in crises because people just can't communicate with each other.The story tells of a dying woman, in terrible pain, who lives in a house with her two sisters (neither of whom seem to like her much) and her maid (who seems to be the only one who cares about her).The film is very visually stylish, with bright reds and whites predominating. In fact, major scene changes are not indicated by the conventional fades to black, but by fades to red. Bergman uses a lot of tight close ups of his actresses faces so the viewer has nowhere to hide from the naked emotions.The acting is superb from all four of the main actresses. This film is very slow moving and is very heavy going. It's recommended to Bergman fans but if you're new to Bergman, films like "Seventh Seal" are much more accessible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a beautiful agonizing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and whispers is about three sisters and a servant Anna caring for their long time sick sister. The film is very emotional in its depiction of certain death. It is a thoroughly bleak film, with a course line of wickedness, revealed as the film progresses. The characters are superbly drawn and can be interpreted in different ways. How they are portrayed on the screen and how the other characters perceive them. Making the viewer wonder who these characters really are. Very subtle, not much dialogue, though the feelings are conveyed superbly.With little script, the film keeps up its sombre mood with an impressive performance from Harriet Andersson as the bed sick Agnes. Her performance is perfect. The pain that she is feeling and the longing for some emotion and love is sincere and saddening.The end of the film is something of a surprise. Our beliefs of characters are built up and the first impressions seem shattered as we discover more truth.The film is very nicely shot with some attractive general viewpoints and spectacular, extensive lighting. Shards of light with fog rolling by and example. Their are a lot of closeups and closeup two shots which work particularly well also.To conclude I say that this is a very humane film with a special grasp of human grace and the pain of a slow death. Watch it and be amazed, though don't be surprised to feel your eyes prickling by the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it must be good, I guess. I usually feel reverence toward Mr. Bergman's films and I will probably always feel he's among the top two or three directors in history. But I could not find myself appreciating or admiring this film. For one thing, the continual and seemingly senseless use of red was very distracting and off-putting to me, and struck me as pretentious "artiness," a sophomoric self-indulgence completely out of character for Bergman. There seemed also to be an annoying indecision whether to present the piece as a filmed stage play or as a conventional movie. And the utterly cold emotional content didn't help make the film accessible to me.For those reasons and because I do admire Bergman's work enormously, I decline to vote on this one. Maybe I'm just really missing something. I don't feel competent to judge this work. But I do know I'm in no hurry to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply terrifying and amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it has been said before, this cinematic masterpiece and experience is about a group of three sisters and their house keeper. The sister Agnes is dying of cancer and her sisters Karin and Maria pretend to care for her and the maid Anna truly shows how family bonds can be the weakest. Anna is truly a compassionante woman who wants to relieve Agnes from the excruciating pain she is going through. While Agnes is slowly dying in her bed and keeping track of memories and feelings, her sisters deal with their isolation and their own problems. Karin, who I think might be the oldest daughter, seems very cold and distant. But once we start hearing her thoughts and her memories. They show you why she is so distant and hard, it shows how she deals with her pain. Karen Thulin gives one of the most powerful performances I have ever seen on screen. She delivers the famous mutilation scene with such honesty and the viewer can't help but feel terrified when faced with her "problems." Liv Ullman gives an equally amazing performance as Maria. Maria is given the cliche as the sympathetic sister. The viewer learns that Maria is a purely shallow person who uses her "sympathetic attitude" to manipulate people. Then there is the maid Anna. She gives one of the most fascinating performances I have seen. She also gives the most touching scenes in the entire film. In the end, Anna is left alone in the house that is now empty. Agnes has died and the sisters and their husbands have left. Maria and Karin both think that Anna should at least be allowed to stay in the house a few more months till she finds work and she should be allowed to keep a "relic" in memory of Agnes and all the hardwork and devotion she gave to her. Anna says she wants nothing, but once everyone is gone. Anna pulls out her keepsake and her memory of Agnes. She pulls out Agnes's journal and begins to read it. It then goes to a flashback of the sisters and Anna in a happier time. As Anna reads the passage we catch our last glimpse of Agnes alive and happy. It is one of the most haunting scenes ever on screen. Another truly amazing scene is the dream sequence. When Liv Ullman begins to freak out and screams, it is truly terrifying in a unspeakable way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't endorse this movie fully. I'd love to, because I found so much that was wonderful in it. The cinematography was artful, the performances riveting. I will leave the discussions of the women to others: The portrayals of the two husbands, and the doctor, which are at most 10 minutes each, were incredible. The cuckolded husband, the man married to the frigid woman, the doctor attracted and yet repelled by the sensuous Maria. Amazing.For all that, though, I felt let down by the film. Perhaps it is because I don't speak the language, and have to rely on subtitles. Perhaps I lost something by seeing it on the small screen. Perhaps I'm just ignorant.

I guess it had some shock value at the time. Revisiting it forty years later, I find it boring, shallow and fatally lacking in humor. Filled with talk and solemn posturing that ultimately leads nowhere, the final flashback scene is scant reward for all the Sturm und Drang that preceded it. I even think Sven Nykvist's acclaimed cinematography looks dated. There are numerous clumsy zooms, the painterly tableaux look self-conscious and forced, and the fades to red were done eight years previously by Robert Burks for Alfred Hitchcock's "Marnie." Viewers would have to be as masochistic as Ingrid Thulin's character to enjoy this pretentious gabfest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesser Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries And Whispers, (Viskningar Och Rop) a 1972 film of Ingmar Bergman's, which was consistently and highly lauded around the world, upon its release, is not a great film, nor anywhere the masterpiece that it's claimed to be. That said, it's not a bad film, merely an interesting and lesser one from his oeuvre that is laced with some very odd moments, some really bad moments, and some cringingly self-conscious moments that show Bergman at his auteur and poseur worst, far in excess, even, of his much better 1966 self-conscious opus film Persona. Having long been a Woody Allen fan one can see manifest Bergmanian influences in such Allen films as Interiors and Another Woman. This is not necessarily a good thing, since this film often bogs down in its artsy preciousness, and determination to try to wring every bit of melodrama out of the slightest human actions. At his worst, Bergman hammers his viewers over the head with rather puerile and obvious symbolism, such as the insistence of the color red and blood, which haunts the mansion's dcor, and is used as filmic dissolves, in this film which basically recounts the death of an early 20th Century Swedish rich woman, Agnes (Harriet Andersson), as her two sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullman- who also plays the sisters' mother in flashbacks) bicker over what is to become of her and the huge estate they inherited. Bergman's multi-linear narrative approach, while interesting, does little to serve the film's real story, nor create audience empathy for the characters.It is a very despairing film, and bleaker than the usual Bergmanian dourness. Nothing much happens, except that Agnes slowly suffocates to death because of a cancer, presumably in her lungs, and the two other sisters go mad, and rage and bicker at each other. Even worse, is that there is great psychological violence in the two healthy sisters' marriages?. The core of the film, however, is Bergman's overweening symbolism, for it is so obvious, and the main characters simply act in such over the top, grandiose ways that no one in real life would, that the viewer is forced to find non-rational motivations for them- i.e.- what does the director mean with this rather than why would the character do this? In that sense, this film is pure artifice, and not organic in any sense. Sylwan, as Anna, especially, basically just sleepwalks through her almost horror film level performance. The cinematography of Sven Nykvist, and the use of red to make the film almost all hallucinatory, is outstanding, and in this regard the technical mastery of film that is exhibited overcomes, if only slightly, the film's many flaws. It's no surprise that Cries and Whispers won the first of two Best Cinematography Oscars for Nyqvist (the other was for Bergman's later Fanny And Alexander). Allen's own Interiors was a much better film, for it mediated its bleakness with truly deep and meaningful conversations, not just highly stylized and baroque monologues, as Bergman indulges in. Yet, later Allen films pushed this dual envelope even further, in his novels as films, such as Manhattan, Stardust Memories, Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, and Husbands And Wives.Cries And Whispers, by contrast, is one dimensional, void of character development, empathy, and a compelling storyline, and it plays almost as a pre-PC PC screed about how females need to bond lest become as impotent as the males in their lives. In the end, only dead Agnes has peace, and that peace is merely a memory or delusion. Yes, bleak describes this film, and it is even more so when one considers how Bergman hermetically seals off his characters from the audience, thus recapitulating the characters' detachment from each other by our own from them. While this might be technically devious, even brilliant and defensible, it simply goes too much against basic storytelling technique. Martin Scorsese portrayed inner loneliness and impotence much better in his 1984 film, The King Of Comedy, giving the viewer both a sense of the main character's frustrations, and allowing the audience to empathize with that impotence, rather than feel it along with him. Here, pain is merely an end to itself, and the viewer simply does not care, for we never know what brought the sisters to this state, are never let inside their lives, and are given no reason to desire exploration. A better title would have been The Glass Menagerie, for that's what all the characters are: transparent, fragile, and small. But, Tennessee Williams took that one, and his is a much better zoo of the human soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bergman at his best."Cries and Whispers" vies with "Persona" in my esteem as the best film Ingmar Bergman gave us. In this one, a group of sisters gathers at a country house to care for (or rather avoid caring for) one of them, who is dying of consumption. It falls to the dying sister's maid to step in and embrace this poor pitiful creature in her final days. This is an emotionally devastating film, with a death scene that is intensely hard to watch and seems to go on forever. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist makes brilliant use of the color photography, which put me in mind of the way Powell and Pressburger or Douglas Sirk used the medium back in the day.Profoundly affecting. Perhaps not the kind of film I would want to see often, but one I'm glad I at least have seen once.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" is one of the most painful experience one is liable to have at the movies (if not the most painful). Yet in the end there is a feeling of overwhelming pride at having confronted the darkest depths of the human soul and come out triumphant and unharmed. This is truly a great movie, both emotionally powerful and technically masterful. It is, in my opinion, Bergman's career best, and comes closer than any film to expressing his own inner pain and disgust. Few films bear the mark of their makers, and even fewer bear their feelings. "Cries and Whispers" is a towering achievement, and one of the best films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's most powerful work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a woman dying of cancer in early twentieth-century Sweden is visited by her two sisters, long-repressed feelings between the siblings rise to the surface. In Sweden, dying of cancer Agnes is visited in her home by her sisters Karin and Maria. As Agnes' condition gets worse and the pain becomes more difficult, many feelings and emotions such fear and hatred inhabit the sisters, who are incapable of sympathy, and Agnes' only company and peace comes from her maid Anna. As death approaches closer, long repressed feelings of hatred, resentment and dishonesty cause jealousy, selfishness, and bitterness between the sisters that bubbles to the surface. Roger Ebert said that, "To see it is to touch the extremes of human feeling. It is so personal, so penetrating of privacy; we almost want to look away." Cries and Whispers can be difficult at times to watch but it is accurate in portraying the many repressed feelings that siblings might have. The movie is profoundly deep and disturbing at the same time and in my opinion is Bergman's most powerful work. I like the theme of each sisters memories being brought up, maybe this shows the viewer that when someone else's life is going awry we immediately think of our own troubles, maybe the movie shows us that we are all capable of our own selfishness from time to time. Cries and Whispers is a powerful and disturbing film that is also honest at the same time.</fullReview>

What surprises me about this film is how dysfunctional and repressed most of the family members are around each other. The sisters look back upon their failed marriages and attempts at proving themselves to each other, all the while the dying sister tells them to just try and reconcile, yet they are ultimately unable to do so. What was so intriguing to me about this film was the fact that it showed you that sometimes tragedy can't heal the wounds and rifts that form in relationships, and that denial can prove more powerful than understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers the 1974 movie that won the Oscar for Best Cinematography by Ingmar Bergman is a beautifully filmed movie that tackles the ever so difficult question of death. Agnes , the main character is an upper class women dying of cancer. Her two sisters which are also very well off in the upper-class seem to be divided by their social divisions which separate them. Anges who is constantly in a lot of pain seems to be something the sisters want to forget about. Instead of dealing with her death they often try to forget about it by sending the maid Anna to deal with Anges. Anges and Anna develop a close intimate relationship in which there bond seems inseprateable. Through their relationship Anna is able to find peace within her life unlike the other two sisters who ocntue to quarralell over small things. In a way this Bergman film spoke to me saying that it is not necessarily those who have the most material things who have the most in life, and that we as people often let grudges hold us back from enjoying the company of others. By the time we do its too late death is near.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tragic story of a dysfunctional family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful and touching movie!It shows three estranged sisters who come together when one of them is dying of cancer. The other two sisters struggle to comfort her, trying to overcome their differences and the fact that they had grown apart. Their relationship and being together is very awkward, and it is only their maid, Anna, who is able to comfort Agnes and truly embrace and mourn her death. After her death, Agnes shortly returns as a ghost and reveals that all she wishes from her family is love and care, but flashbacks of the family members reveal the problems each one of them is dealing with, which tragically make it impossible for them to really come closer. Maria, the youngest, remembers her failed marriage; Agnes remembers how she was envious of her youngest sister to be so close to their mother while she remained distant to her; and Karin struggles with the memory of a dysfunctional marriage and self-harm.While being together, the sisters do not manage to get past their conflicts with each other, and though they each reveal that they would love to be closer to each other, their differences and pasts in a way only move them further away from each other with every failed attempt. The tragic moment at the end is when we get to hear what Agnes wrote in her diary: that having her sisters with her is happiness, and she couldn't wish for anything better; that she feels profoundly grateful to her life.This movie is heartbreaking in its portrait of the life of three sisters: each of them has experienced so much pain, and there is so much regret between them - but they never talk about it, all those feelings remain unsaid between them, and therefor so much that they secretly long for remains undone.For me, the beauty of this movie was also the depiction and story of the three sisters. Each character in this beautiful movie has a different personality, as can be found in every single family. Agnes longed for a closer relationship to her mother but had to watch her youngest sister get the affection of their mother that she longed for when she was small. Now she is in agony, and this is only intensified by her faltering attempts at reconciling her sisters. Maria is the more bubbly character in the family, it is easier for her to express herself, but she is very emotional, and also indecisive. My favorite character is Karin. She is portrayed as a very strong and rather cold and repressed woman, not saying what she feels very easily. She is very detached and one feels like she is putting up a lot of defenses. She may come across as the most unlikeable of the three sisters, the least loving. But throughout the movie, we learn to understand that she is not cold at all. In fact, she longs to be touched. But she cannot handle physical contact, because she was deeply hurt and she went through a lot, she was so deeply hurt that she did self-harm. Karin was my favorite character in the movie. We have a lot of similarities, and I could find myself in her the most: finding it hard to express one's feelings; craving to open up to someone and allowing someone to come closer, but having been too hurt and being scared of being hurt again - in a way - finding it hard to trust anybody after having been hurt by somebody one trusted; and using self-harm as a way of expressing what one couldn't say?This movie is a beautiful depiction of what you really find in a family. It is no glorification of family, but maybe in fact the bare and naked truth: dysfunctional relationships and the pain that comes with it, and the regret that comes with not saying things you would have loved to say, that maybe could have changed things.A truly deep and moving, beautiful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genius of Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman's 1972 film "Cries and Whispers" was one of the auteur's major achievements of that decade. In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes is visited by her two sisters:the sensual and impulsive Karin,and the stern and cold Maria. Though supposedly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are much more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It ultimately falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference or outright disgust expressed by Agnes' own family. Bergman wonderfully expresses the aspects of death, loneliness, and difficulty of being alive in his film. The constant use of red color throughout the film demonstrates the influence of the human soul in everyday life. Sven Nykvist's masterful cinematography is evident in the numerous closeups and shots that take place in the scenes of the film. In this film, the audience is allowed to fully grasp the meaning of the subject portrayed and reflect upon it themselves. In fact, one can even question his or her own identity upon seeing this film. "Cries and Whispers" will forever stay as a cinematic classic and a dramatically thought-provoking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What strikes me most about this film is how some characters can be so cold towards each other, despite the fact that they are related. I guess for me it is so surprising because I am very close with my own family. What is really interesting though is how Agnes' two sisters cannot seem to communicate their feelings towards each other. This is interesting for me because at those points in the movie I felt a deep connection with the characters because sometimes it is very difficult to communicate emotions.What makes this film so great is how it depicts the difficulty both sisters have communicating. I believe that we have all felt like that at one point or another in our lives, with that deep want to do something, but the inability to do so.</fullReview>

Another thing that made me like this movie is that I could relate to it and identify with the actresses in a sense that I also had a loss, an aunt that died of the same disease the sick actor had in the movie. Every time a scene would show the sick woman, would really get to me and although I would really hold it in to not get emotional I just couldn't, which is one thing I didn't like about the movie that it made me cry.

		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is a very dark, brooding, and disturbing film that shouldn't be take on lightly. Cries and Whispers opens your mind and soul and that's you into a emotional and spiritual ride. The process of dying is not only the last stage we go through in this life, but often the most traumatic. For most people, death takes time. To be sure, there are some who expire suddenly and unexpectedly, but, in general, death is gradual. And, during those last days, the dying individuals will experience moments of great clarity revealing transcendent beauty, and times of bleakness staring into eternity. Ultimately, no matter how many friends and loved ones we may have by our side, the last step must be undertaken alone. Cries and Whispers concerns the death of Agnes a young woman who has been stricken with some form of cancer. When the film opens, the disease is greedily eating away at her insides, causing moments of tremendous agony. At times, she can barely breathe. On other occasions, she awakens from sleep crying out in pain, begging for surcease. There are respites, as well - times when she can find passing enjoyment in simple things, like a walk outside or a sip of water. During her last days, she is cared for by her faithful maid, Anna and her sisters, Karin and Maria like many powerful films, Cries and Whispers can be difficult to endure. I cannot conceive of anyone watching this film as light entertainment. However, one can infer from his films that he is envious of those whose simple faith allows them to accept the existence of a better afterlife, rather than constantly puzzling over the uncertainty. This is evident in Cries and Whispers, where Anna, the individual with the deepest, most pure faith, is the kindest and most serene of the characters. Despite having lost her only child, she is gentle and accepting, not frigid like Karin or vain like Maria. Dreamlike and surreal, this movie impacts directly upon the soul, not the mind. e sisters keep their distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perception of Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who has lost my grandparents from my dad's side in 2010, death as always been one of the most important thoughts that cross my mind. In Bergman's "Cries and Whispers", it gives a new meaning to death. One doesn't want to face the unfortunate event of the death of a family member. The days my grandparents died seemed only yesterday to me. I am able to recount every moment of those sad days. I can still recall the speech I ave at my grandfather's funeral. Death to me is an idea of the end of physical life but not life itself. In "Cries and Whispers" the sisters that are involved are of high class and wealth. The broad story is how the two sisters react to the dying hours of one of their sisters. We all know that to watch the passing of a close family member is difficult but the way the sisters go about it is strange. To not spoil the movie, I will not go in great detail. But this movie shows the importance of family staying strong and being there for support. When my dad's parents passed away, the following months I tried to comfort my father as much as possible. Every Sunday my father and I go to the cemetery where my grandparents are buried. The time there is not easy, but the love we have for each other helps us get through it. In "Cries and Whispers" you do not get that sense of togetherness which is so crucial in life. People may have their problems, and family members can argue with one another. This is natural, but in such cases that is given in the movie, being together and comforting each other is so important. This movie opens one eyes to the importance of family, the tough moment of seeing a family member leave you in front of your eyes. Love your family and show it and tell them it every day of your life. Any moment can be our last, but when that moment comes, it will not be as sad and difficult to manage with. Love and togetherness is what gets a family through difficult events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true demonstration of the inner love and hatred within a human's soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true demonstration of the inner love and hatred within a human's soul that shows the viewer a story portrayed around three sisters that are different in every aspect. Director Ingmar Bergman shows us the loneliness, alienation, and tough love that we humans create for each other. As the film begins, Agnes, is dying at the tip of her bed, while her other two sisters by the names of Maria and Karin, are found in a self centered turmoil if hatred for one another, while giving a sense of love within that hatred. As Agnes becomes increasingly worse as the movie continues, these two sisters completely forget the sole purpose as to why they are in one house together, to be with their sister Agnes. We see a person who balances this environment, as Anna, the maid/caretaker for Agnes, is shown to come from a different social class, to portray a sense of humility and nobility. As the film continues, Bergman shows us his masterpiece work as he enables the close up shots to give us that inner connection that the characters are experiencing. And because of this, we are able to see the true demonstration of our human soul, as he also instills red shots thru the camera dimming from scene to scene. A wonderful way to setup the context of questioning ourselves on whether there is another life, and possibly another way to change this sense of loneliness that we as humans always tend to feel.Overall a wonderful film to reflect on and question our understanding of love and hatred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding and Not as Depressing as one might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of these experiences. One can't adopt a mindset of the Bergman way by just diving into a foray of his content in this film. It seems as though the well versed people, especially those who seen it in 1972, seen what Bergman was tackling here. On the ground, it seems as though we should identify with these human beings, keeping in mind that Bergman doesn't even understand or identify with them either; he tells us this with that psychic lens by image exponent Sven Nykvist, who is perhaps the best cinematographer of the 70's during a time when cinema was changing its form as far as politics and fantasy were concerned.The narrative of the film is bleak as anything. Not surprisingly Kubrick would take his toll on the baroque period in my personal favourite of his "Barry Lyndon" (based on the William Makepeace Thackeray novel) and then Kurosawa would adapt King Lear a decade later in "Ran". But these two aforementioned films weren't as deep and as gritty and ultimate as this film. I remember in my review of "Persona" that I gushed over its melding of character, its bound on our reality and its breaking through the forth wall. A nonconformist film and one of the greatest experiences I had ever undergone; it was not just beautiful, it was sincere, and because it was pure Bergman and Nykvist, it seemed as though there would be no rival on film. He then brings out his period drama... Everything came full throttle.When one watches "Cries and Whispers" they are mesmerised by the reversible colour, the pantheistic symbols and the lacklustre, yet surprisingly compelling dynamic of the relationship of three sisters and a maid. I always wonder when watching this film, how can this be enticing? Well, simply put, the illusion and disillusioned and the distance and intimacy make this another Bergman triumph. Some say that of "Scenes from a Marriage" being his most personal, but even Bergman said this film was like an actual dream he had, even so much as saying "The film could not be thought of in Black and White. There was too much colour". It was an exceptional example of photography in film. This was the film that has now influenced me to use photography in more avant garde ways.So what does it need to sustain this with? The backing repertoire of actresses (akin to Persona). Bibi Andersonn refused to do the role of any of the women, thinking it would be imprudent if she was involved. Bergman, being the visionary, that he was still tried to co-erce her, but to no avail. Instead hiring Ingrid Thulin, Liv Ullman (Persona), Harriet Andersson (Summer with Monika) and Karl Sylwan take centre stage. Agnes (Harriet) is cancer stricken and is near to death. Her life flashes past her, with her dismissive sisters Maria and Karin, who cannot get any close or near to her. The maid Anna treats her as if she was a child in her bed ridden state.In the prelude, Bergman decidedly took some exterior shots and some shots of clocks and so on for he wanted to ground us in the film. Its silence can be liberating and in many ways Bergman is, once again, codifying his cinematic techniques and subverting the conventions of some of them. Most films have a soundtrack in it and yet the chief soundtrack in this film is the quiet sounds of dialogue exchanges and the sound of a pendulum and tick tock. Throughout we look at the life of Maria, Agnes' sister, who philanders with David, the doctor, basically to vent her sexual ways. One scene, which I won't spoil, shows this as Ullman's wonderful acting goes against the words being said. It's the visual with words being subordinate to the story. Karin, the other sister, represses her feelings and ultimately during her sister's untimely death, unceremoniously confesses them to ultimately recanting them. The film builds on the static character (the centrepiece) who happens to be Agnes, an insignificant character, who eventually passes on in the most disconcerting of ways. Bergman's idea of distance and silence to noise and closeness is astutely looked at when Maria and Karin grow close with the truth of their own selves - she's sulky and childish and Karin is an apologist and, in my opinion, deceitful. Eventually when they grow close, Bergman soars in a soundtrack that washes everything away from the surface so that he creates a certain distance with his essential audience. It's one of the most enchanting elements of the filmic experience. I can't describe what kind of a bittersweet feeling I felt from this minimalistic film. I felt as though the receptive of what ever truth of what they sought, ultimately came at a price. Some will not like this film; for others it might colour their actual emotions about death. This was when I really felt, in Marshall Mcluhan's words, that "The Medium is the Message". Some masters like Trauffaut, Bertoluccio and Dreyer are able to embed their own influence on their work in one of the most subtle ways, Bergman seems to actually have a message that can be legible even without looking too far into it, which makes this an accessible masterpiece and one of the most sumptuous films ever made. I agree with Allen when he said that you come away feeling exhilarated because you feel like you're in the presence of great art rather than a depressing experience. Yes "Wild Strawberries" and any other are undeniably going to get received with warmer reception, but if it wasn't for the decorative beauty of the milieu imbued with the dour and off putting feeling of what transpires, it probably wouldn't rank that high for me. He has ample films to pick and choose - some don't even know his earlier films like "Prison" and "Summer Interlude", which happened to be a Godard favourite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers is film in its own genre by Ingmar Bergman. It's a story about a family of sisters living in their brilliant Swedish mansion, caring for their dying sister. That may sound simple but in the film, there are some horribly excruciating and cringing moments that could leave you longing to leave the room for a breath of fresh air. Aside from the incredible visualizations and strong elaboration of the colour red, the story is one that you won't forget. Bergman's technique takes advantages of our minds to portray the inner secrets of this family. Agnes is the bedridden sister, afflicted with suffering, we watch her slowly crumble day by day. Her sister's, Karin and Maria and their made, Anna, fight very hard to accommodate her needs. Whilst caring for Agnes, we see the two sisters cross swords which likely originates from their dysfunctional background and unpleasant childhood. These sisters have never been much too close, nor have had the ability to communicate love as you'd expect a normal family to be able to do so. Although Agnes' sisters are present, she only longs for the comfort and warmth of her longterm maid, Anna. We watch the family struggle to break away from the years of emotional detachment. This is an extremely cynical film about a family of stubborn sisters. Not a whole lot happens in Cries and Whispers, in fact, there isn't too much dialogue either, it's mainly the art of filmmaking that Bergman exposes to us. Cries and Whispers will stick with you, if you're looking for something scary, dark and horror-like, this movie isn't for you. This movie is beautifully disturbing, Bergman has succeeded once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film with marvelous power of expression. Outstanding art direction, very ascetic sets were every single object has its own purpose (it is almost like a set created out of props and only props). The color palette is also amazing: high contrast black and white with bright red. Phenomenally acted and photographed. Just the visual side makes it strong enough to watch it. The story behind it is very intense and bold as well. There are couple scene which will stay for a long time in my memory: the opening scene (incredibly acted and directed), Karen cutting herself... Karen and Maria having a conversation (muted sound) and one of the most beautiful scenes in a movie- Anna holding Agnes, the both have closed eyes and look so peaceful. Some scene where just right on the edge when I felt I should not be part of it. I should not watch such a intimate moments. Suffering, humiliation, lack of love and understanding made me feel emotionally overwhelmed. I am sure that after watching this movie we all feel like examining closely our relationships, not only with siblings but with other people in general. One of my favorites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ambiguous, Yet Beautifully Affecting Piece of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first shots of ominous ticking clocks to the tragic closing words of Harriet Andersson's Agnes, Cries and Whispers is a grueling, psychologically-debilitating drama of profoundly affecting power. Written and directed by master filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, the film centers around the lives of Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann), two women brought together through the sickness eating away at the last remaining days of their sister's life. This sister, played by Bergman-regular Harriet Andersson, is perhaps one of the most tragic characters ever committed to celluloid, due mostly to Andersson's bravura performance. Several scenes show Agnes gasping loudly for breath, and the noises, which are not too far off from being growls or croaks, are excruciating at times to listen to. In even the most seemingly simple of stares, a deep underlying pain can be seen behind those shimmering eyes. So detailed are these scenes of Agnes' suffering, that one can't help but marvel at the sheer precision involved in capturing such realism on camera. This realism, which is central to all Bergman films, is just as prevalent in the interactions between Karin and Maria, which form the center of the story. Through the conversations of Karin and Maria, we are able to catch glimpses into their damaged psyches. Several flashbacks reveal some rather unnerving scenes in the history of these two sisters, which helps us to understand why they are so cold and distant. One of the beautiful things about this film is the sparse use of dialogue. As is typical of a Bergman film, the cinematography is brilliant and able to convey, mostly through close-ups, a tense atmosphere that grips the viewer and causes one to become acutely aware of even the slightest flicker of a facial muscle. The use of the color red throughout the film only adds to its ominous nature.Cries and Whispers does perhaps have a fault, however. Due to the often ambiguous conversations between the two sisters, the film seems to stop short of fully opening up the audience to the true nature of the sisters' personalities. One can't help but feel distanced from the feelings and experiences of the sisters, which, in turn, causes the viewer to lack any sort of genuine compassion for either of them. Where the simple look of suffering in the eyes of Agnes is enough to strongly elicit such feelings, the self-centered nature and good health of the sisters does not allow for their troubled stares to reach the same level of effect. Though we are shown snippets of their past, by the end of the movie we still do not truly know either of these women. They feel more like acquaintances than central characters we are heavily invested in. But then, perhaps, that is Bergman's point. Perhaps he is trying to give us a sort of outsider's look into the inside world of these two women. We view them as if from behind the keyhole. We catch bits of conversation rooted in the history these two women have together, but as people on the outside, we do not have the privilege of knowing the full meaning, or every intimate detail to their lives. After all, can one truly get a full picture of someone's character without experiencing life from inside that person's own body? So while I still feel being presented with a fuller understanding of Karin and Maria could have benefited the film, Cries and Whispers still stands, on the sheer power of its hauntingly real acting and emotional atmosphere, as a true work of cinematic art. The ending alone is perhaps one of the most perfect I have ever seen- the beauty and near-irony of Agnes' words concludes the movie with an existential message that leaves the viewer in a state of ambivalence. This is, without a doubt, one of Bergman's finest and most fully-realized films, and its impact only continues to grow the more it lingers on the mind for days, weeks, and even months after viewing. To me, this film stands right up there with Persona, The Seventh Seal, and Wild Strawberries.</fullReview>

I don't want to say that I enjoyed watching this movie because it just makes you feel depressed in the way that it deals with such heavy subjects. The way it's shot with these classic Bergman close ups and the emotions the amazing actors leave you with is exactly as depressing as the story itself, you're really thrown into the story and it does feel like you were there were it's all taking place. I'm truly amazed of how well the movie expresses emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bergman Masterpiece - Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Cries and Whispers significantly different than many sister movies that deal with death would be the fantastic line of actresses who deal with their own personal problems in an emotional roller coaster ride. Maria, Karin, Agnes, and Anna play their parts well. Rather than having a mainstream good ending and Agnes becoming miraculously cured, it faces a more realistic approach to any real life situation. It seems this film fits more of an everyday life event in someone's life rather than a fabricated life event in a character's life in a movie and that what makes this particularly interesting. Bergman makes us think about major questions in our lives such as death or the thought of dying. He states it clearly in this movie. While many might think about death as discomforting and pure sadness, I find death as a way where someone can find peace and happiness in the afterlife. In my mind, I'm not scared to die, but the only thing will sadden me would be my family and friends. The use of the close-up was also impactful through out the entire movie displaying real life emotions from the actresses faces. I loved the addition of whispers in the film giving us the individual thoughts of each and every character making them much more fully fleshed out. With all that said, Bergman gave us a Masterpiece to remind us all on how important our lives are and notifying us the implications of death. It can affect you or not depending on your stand point on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cries and Whispers" is a phenomenal film by director Ingmar Bergman, in collaboration with legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The film deals with the surrounding events of a dying woman, Agnes (played by Harriet Andersson). Her two sisters Karin and Maria (Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullman respectively) are thrown together in their sister's estate at the last dying moments of her terminal illness.Ingmar Bergman made this movie while in an experimental period of his life. He extensively utilizes the color red throughout the film to create a symbolic meaning on many different levels. Perhaps one of the most meaningful interpretations is of blood and how it connects people together. Also the most memorable scene that will stick with you after watching this film involves blood, but in a more objective way.The film centers around four characters, the three sisters and the house maid, Anna (Kari Sylwan), all which seems to be famished for closeness and touch. However, it is only Agnes and Anna that appears to be able to express these feelings and their relationship is a heart-robbing one. In contrast, the relationship between Karin and Maria is very complicated. We get to know that Maria was favored by their mother and this envy stays with her sister all her life. Karin seems to almost interpret her sister's attempts to gain some emotional comfort between them two as something sexual. While Maria is just trying to satisfy both of their starvation for touch. The catharsis of their final confrontation is a mighty powerful one, and masterfully deals with the sometimes so contradictory relationship that exists between two siblings.There is a hint of an underlying tone of skepticism towards religion present. In a scene when Anna prays and in a way thanks the great lord for that he has bereft her of her child, she quickly starts to eat a red apple once she is done praying. This act entails to a somewhat mocking message. Even though she prays to the God she marks that she is not in need of him. Later in the film we see a priest that is strongly questioning the good lord's actions when he prays for a recently deceased, a very powerful scene let me tell you that.Ingmar Bergman does successfully capture in this film a cavalcade of emotions, conflicts, and humanity, which is all over the spectrum. I believe that it would be difficult to find someone that would not be moved, in one way or another, by this masterpiece. This is not one of his more complicated movies, and it is far from a boring one as well. The camera-work from Sven Nykvist that generated an Oscar for Best Cinematography does not steal any of the film's influence, but rather adds to the holistic experience that makes this piece of art excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deep film, Evoking Deeper Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and whispers is about three sisters, and a servant Anna caring for their long time sick sister. The lighting and choice of colors is able to represent actual emotions and instances where one can actually feel the 'soul' of the character with the use of various deep colors (Blood Red). These visuals are amazing, truly giving the audience a better sense of the emotions being felt. Dark blacks contrasted with vibrant whites, not only does the color give more meaning to the film, but adds meaning where no communication is taking place, and meaning is still understood. It is a very emotionally draining movie, perhaps the most difficult movie I personally have ever seen. Being in a film class and seeing emotional movies about war and humanity, notably Klimav's, "Come and See," I feel as though Bergman's movie was able to capture nothing I have seen on film before. The film felt like a deafening cry from one's soul, witnessing how truly evil and selfish a person can truly be. Realizing that their are less fortunate people who although long for, and deserve the love and affection needed from family members and loved ones, that sometimes people just don't have the pleasure of receiving. The two sisters (Maria and Karin) depicted in the movie can easily be juxtaposed with the maid Anna. Anna is a loving, compassionate person who deeply cares about the dying sister Agnes. Anna is the most human and motherly when compared to the other two sisters in the movie. The strong difference in character remind the audience that the human spirit can be beautiful but also ugly.The story although unfortunate, sends a riveting and powerful message to all those who want to listen. If we can acknowledge our mistakes and want to change and better ourselves, it is never to late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first of Bergman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CRIES AND WHISPERS was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman in 1972. This was my first taste of Bergman and my first response is, wow! This movie continues to haunt me. Bergman was in his experimental phase at this point of his career. He was taking chances psychologically within the realm of his art. I eagerly waited for the movie to begin and as it started the screen was red with the credits in white and the sounds from a xylophone could be heard. A beautiful shot of the woods is the first visual and a bird can be heard cawing in the distance. This segues into the sounds of ticking clocks and bells. There is a woman sleeping in a big house, another woman lye alone in bed. She is breathing heavy and looks to be in terrible agony. This continues as the clock tics. In spite of her pain the woman gets out of bed and writes in her diary. Here is my first understanding of this woman. All that can be heard are the physical sounds of the world around them. This continues for twelve minutes with no dialogue. It was so intense and disturbing. I wasn't sure what I was in for but I was glued. This unconventional approach of using such an extreme long silence was ingenious. Bergman experimented and trusted his audience to grasp the power of understanding without dialogue. His close ups captured the subtext within the actors characters. "It's written all over your face" is the appropriate phrase. The use of color plays a significant part of the story. Psychologically the red represents the womb. There is a great shot of all the sisters in the bedroom wearing pure white nightgowns representing them as naked in a womb. The red walls and red carpeting completed this feeling. Incredible Bergman!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I suffer great disaster because I have a body. When I have no body, what disaster can there be?" ? Lao Tzu "We begin in voluptuousness and the madness of carnal desire, we end in the dissolution of all our parts and the musty stench of corpses." ? Schopenhauer Air wheezes out of her lungs, her dying gasps reverberating throughout a home dominated by hellish reds. Three women watch as her organs collapse. The first is a Christian woman, caring, compassionate, her bosoms providing some warmth. The others are the victim's sisters, who join the deathwatch but show little concern. They go through the motions, pay lip-service, offer false hope, but it's a charade that tortures them as much as the cancer which devours their sister.Like most of director Ingmar Bergman's films, "Cries and Whispers" deals with the existential horror of life without faith. Here the anti-Christian revolt has infected Europe's learned class, leaving behind tortured figures lost in a post-faith world. Faced with this void, Bergman's women turn to bitterness, despair, narcissism and self-mutilation. One, realising that her body can arouse only pain, distress and revulsion, even goes so far as to cut her sexual organs. "It's a tissue of lies," she says, referring to both her marriage and her prison house of flesh. A flesh which promises pleasure and procreation, but which she knows is always plotting its next betrayal.Ingmar Bergman once refused his father's dying request for audience on the grounds of a torturous childhood. As his father withered away, Bergman refused to see him one last time, citing the fact that his father, a Lutheran priest, was anti-Semitic and dogmatically Christian. It's thus a surprise that "Cries and Whispers" portrays its Christian character in a rather favourable light.Of course, Bergman is not advocating Christianity. His film packed with haunting shots of time pieces, their amplified ticking an ironic counterpoint to the secret purpose of clocks (to manage and contain time ? humanity's defence against an overwhelming opponent), Bergman clearly realises that it is a fear of annihilation which leads to men denying their mortality and running instead toward the watery pleasures of forgetfulness, intoxication, accumulation and a blind belief in magical forms of salvation.No, what "Cries" is really doing is expressing respect and contempt for both the uncaring sisters and the Christian woman in equal measure. The Christian woman may be naive, but Bergman forces us to bear witness to the horrifying alternatives to her kindness. He dramatises the power of unkindness and the toll despair and hate takes on those who exercise it and on those upon whom it is exercised. The film's point: a love born of mutual suffering presents the only alternative to the post-faith world's existential crises. The cries of despair and the whispers of hate carry so much power that only compassion can provide shelter.Ironically, Bergman's act of embracing both the Christian woman's benevolence (whilst rejecting her delusions) and the sisters' awareness of death (whilst rejecting their apathy), is itself the kind of careful juggling act advocated by some early Christians. "He who has learned how to die, has unlearned how to be a slave," wrote Renaissance scholar Michel de Montaigne, a view echoed by early mystics, who believed that denying our mortality constitutes a kind of self-hatred, human beings enslaved by their unconscious desires to flee themselves.True Christianity, then, is about nothing less than getting ready to die. It is a kind of rigorous training for death, a kind of death in life which places little value on longevity, desire or possessions. Even the perverted Christianity of today forgets that it is, at its core, a religion of death. Christ puts death to death and it is in his dying for mankind's sins that Christians are reborn into life. To be Christian, then, is to think of nothing else but death; salvation via mortality. In which case, and this is the question that Kierkegaard would ask eighteen centuries later: how many so called Christians are really Christian?Schopenhauer is perhaps the philosopher who said the most about death. He insisted that existence is really some sort of mistake, and that "Life is an expiation of the crime of being born." He reasoned that if the purpose of human life is not suffering, then human beings are ill adapted to its true purpose, as affliction and pain are everywhere. Along these lines Albert Camus once wrote "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide". But Schopenhauer swiftly rejected suicide. For Schopenhauer, we do not really Will but are willed by an unconscious agency over which we have no power (see Godard's "Hail Mary"). The problem with suicide, then, is that it maintains the illusion of willfulness. For Schopenhauer, the only possible escape was a life of asceticism, which cinema's other big name religious directors, namely Dreyer, Rossellini, Bunuel, Tarkovsky, Pasolini and Bresson, often delved into. Ironically, most of these directors were or became atheists.Incidentally, "Cries" was released the same year as "The Exorcist" (also featuring Bergman regular, Max Von Sydow). Both films feature bed-ridden female characters becoming vessels for something so unimaginably horrible that it tests the devotion of their loved ones. But "The Exorcist", for all its horrors, is ultimately a rather pro-Christian bogeyman tale, its attacks on the priests of science, psychiatry and modern inquiry diluted by a bevy of scare tactics designed to bolster a faith in God. Bergman does the opposite.9/10 ? Masterpiece.</fullReview>

The opening scene was truly a test of emotional tolerance as you observe Anna's expressions of agonizing pain in a excruciatingly time-binding fashion. Bergman further expands the emo vibe through his use of dark lighting and sad rich women who hate their lives. I think the most ironic part of the story is that the woman dying of agonizing pain is likely the only one that ever felt a moment of happiness. Meanwhile the desperate housewives despise each other and feel mental agony comparable to Anna's physical from simply spending time together. While I myself will likely never watch this movie again, any aspiring directors interested in making the audience literally feel the pain that that is being experienced on screen may want to study it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a first time viewer of a Bergman feature, I enjoyed familiarizing myself with his distinctive film techniques including his use of the daunting silence, abundant mirrors, shadows, and the intrusive close ups. This film explores the pains and suffering related to death, as well as the conflicts and the corruptions within family members; especially the two older sisters. For a great length of the movie, I found myself questioning which sister I hated more. It wasn't until the end, when Maria, the manipulative middle sister took advantage of her position and snubbed her older sister Karen, that I was able to reach a decision. I found Maria's manners the most unforgiving. As the dishonesty and greed of these vindictive sisters unfold, we come to appreciate Anna, the innocent, loyal servant who shows genuine concerns for Agnes, the dying sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Cinematic Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingmar Bergman proves the finest drama is found in the everyday simplicity of life in this remarkable movie about suffering, pain, kindness and cruelty. 'Cries And Whispers' is a very straightforward story about the last days of the dying Agnes and the two sisters who stay with her until the end, Karin and Maria, and the maid Anna, the only one who really cares for Agnes. Out of this Bergman finds material for a shattering portrait of the human condition, especially the darker side of the soul.Harriet Andersson conveys all the pain and misery of a woman slowly dying from cancer in he role as Agnes; she has almost no lines in the movie but expresses her feelings fantastically through body language and her face; she'll convince anyone the pain she's suffering is real and inhuman. Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann play two very distinctive sisters who are carelessly waiting for her to die. Through flashbacks we're given insights into their lives ? the scene where Karin cuts her vagina with a glass and smears her face with blood is simultaneously amazing and disturbing! ? but what happens in the actual narrative is fantastic enough in itself. There's a surreal scene where the dead Agnes returns to life and calls for her sisters, and they reject her so the maid Anna has to comfort her; this alone says all about them. Under their appearances of caring sisters they're actually cold, remorseless people. Karin's more straightforward in this aspect, but Maria's hypocrisy is finally shattered here: she appears as a very understanding, loving woman who wants to restart relationships with Karin who hates her, but in the end she's just as cold as everyone else in the movie. Liv Ullmann is brilliant in her role, especially in the scene where her doctor lover, David (played by the remarkable Erland Josephson) exposes her true character to her with cruel honesty. Kari Swylan plays Anna, the only source of kindness in this movie: her intimate scenes with Agnes are heart-warming! The movie takes place entirely inside a 19th century mansion, except for a few flashbacks which take place outside in the garden. It's a claustrophobic atmosphere, made more suffocating by Sven Nykvist's cinematography ? whether his or Bergman's choice, the movie is drowned in a deep, omnipresent red: it appears on the walls, the dresses, food, doors, and constantly contrasted with either black or white. I have yet to understand any deeper meaning in this, but it's an impressive, beautiful visual effect! 'Cries And Whispers' is a remarkable experience, a careful study of the human soul in pain, of loneliness, of the breakdown of relationships, and kindness in the most unexpected situations. It's a fascinating cinematic feast with impressive characterisation and dialogue, or just the insupportable silence for long minutes; and I loved every minute! Cinema should always aspire to this perfection and beauty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cries and Whispers in Three Hundred Words (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bergman's Cries and Whispers is less a narrative and more of a portrait, a cross-section of three women affected by a fourth woman's cancer. That simple plot is the loose underlying structure of a multifaceted film that explores each woman indirectly through her introspective fantasy. Our attitudes toward the characters are based almost solely on these sequences because we have little else to go upon; much of the dialogue is otherwise stark. These dreamlike extrapolations unfold throughout the film, the first touching, the second unnerving and the third hopeful. Each woman is naked, pitted against the unforgiving camera's eye as we enter her unconsciousness.Frequent close-ups invite the viewer not to stare passively but to actively study the subject's face to ascertain the hidden meaning in the contours.The cancerous woman's death itself is made more horrific through the presence of sound, which is extremely effective as most of the film is otherwise relatively silent. Her screaming and writhing become etched not only in our eyes but also our ears as both a physical and aural intensity. A full hour and fifteen minutes in, a somber violin is introduced, taking place of the two sister's dialogue. One is perhaps so enraptured by Bergman's unrepressed red color scheme that one does not notice the lack of music. Rather, it is this near flat-line of the audio track that we were subconsciously listening to.Nyquist's shots hold for such duration that we cannot help but admire the story's unhurried pace and the beautiful cinematography with its imperfect camera movements that illustrate it. The camera breathes as it moves, never mechanical but flowing as if a literal extension of Nyquist's body. This is simply true beauty, a triumph for Bergman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>convincing as sisters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off seeing this movie for a long time. I knew the story was about a woman dying and how it affects the people closest to her, which didn't sound appealing. Also I had read some of the comments here and many didn't think it told the story effectively. Recently, though, I saw the dvd on sale and decided to buy it. After seeing it I realized that everything I thought I knew about this film was wrong. This film is really not about death at all which dismisses most of the criticisms about how the story is told. It is really about the dying woman's sisters and how they mascarade as people they aren't. One sister, Karin, seems very formal, cold, and uncaring while the other, Maria, seems emotional and passionate. Only through the subtle performances and use of flashbacks do we suspect the the characters are not who they seem. While I was watching the film one small incidental detail kept bugging me. I wondered how could these two women who seem so very different be sisters? But then there is a moment at the end where Karin lovingly mentions a moment of unusual tenderness and Maria responds to it in such a cold and cruel manner that it suddenly becomes obvious that sisters are not so different. Underneath Karin's formal demeanor, she desperately wants have the passion Maria displays. At the same time we realize that Maria's passion is merely a tool she uses to manipulate others and underneath she is every bit as heartless as Karin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It suggests Chekhov's THREE SISTERS rewritten by the Strindberg of THE GHOST SONATA: one sister, dying of cancer(Harriet Andersson) is visited by two sisters--a vapid but beautifulslattern (Liv Ullmann) and a pinched, frigid wife (Ingrid Thulin).Humanity is represented by Anna, the dying woman's fleshy, true-believing, endlessly loving maid.The movie is organized around a series of dissolves to redframes; and indeed, the interiors of the dying woman's manse areall in shades of what Bergman calls "membranous red"--theinterior of a soul, or a womb, or both at once. Despite theschematism of the script, CRIES AND WHISPERS has an almostone-of-a-kind power because of Bergman's concentration onfaces, on improvised scenes of tactility (a tender person caressinga frightened, pent-up person's face), and on giving each characterone hair-on-back-of-neck-raising freakout scene. (The title isperhaps the most literal of Bergman's career.) The imagesdeliberately recall the creepy "erotic" Edvard Munch of the "RedVirginia Creeper," but the Munch that seems to have impressedBergman the most is the famous one, the one now representedon dorm-room walls and blow-up dolls: the Scream. He builds awhole movie like a ziggurat ramping up to that image.For the staginess of Bergman's effects, they are resolutelypowerful. And he has probably the women in the world likeliest togive him exactly what he wanted and then some. Their anguishedfaces, and hands, reaching out, sliding over skin, yearning forwarmth--that near-indecent intimacy is what viewers will take awayfrom CRIES AND WHISPERS,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have the opportunity to see this movie in Swedish, only in French. But when I first saw this movie it moved me so I was on the edge of tears. This movie is really original, not much like an Hollywood movie. Indeed the action is not visual but suggested. The character's deep feelings and psychology are revealed throughout the film, in a both soft and strong way. Silence is maybe the most important character of the movie. It makes the spectator quite ill at ease sometimes, on purpose. It helps the spectator thinking about what the characters may feel, sharing their experience, allowing them to be omniscient in the character's mind. Suggestion is far stronger than explanation, that's why I believe every single person will see this movie differently. If you don't sink in the movie in the beginning then you're more likely to get bored, but if you do you'll get the opportunity to think about what makes worth an human life. It's the kind of movie that's good to see again after a few years, to get another interpretation of it. This movie is also a must-see for those who are interested in the rebirth of Nordic cinema (Lars von Triers and co, film makers following the Dogma 95...). As it is really visible in "Festen", Bergman is definitely one of their sources of inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to begin this review by saying that this film is heavily flawed, by any standard. It does not seem to follow any structural system and seem to just jump between ideas of how to present a story.Having said this I still feel that Cries and Whispers aka Viskningar och rop is a great film. I get the parts of unsettling atmosphere and it works great. The story also takes brief character studies of some extreme moments in a characters life and tries to show the double morality of the time this film is set. It's a cold film that merely points out a few yet powerful details of the lives of four women.The film is also among the best photographed films ever and it rightfully won the Oscar, I have to say that and the structural idea behind is is also quite good but now back to the flaws. The most noticeable is closeups of the womens faces which sometimes appears both before and after a story/flashback and sometimes only before, sometimes it even appears twice before their story and this seriously damages the films structure.Another this I feel that Bergman messed up is the opening, about 10 minutes in almost total silence, a great idea if the pictures had been more powerful or if there had been some sort of relief which I can see he tried to achieve with the clock among others. This part was badly fitted with the rest of the piece and though it's not a direct flaw it's one of the ruining factors of the film.As earlier said it's quite powerful and many if not most of the separate scenes are genius and this saves most of the film but I have to say that out of the 10 Bergman films I have seen, this is his worst, it's a great film but his worst, at least structurally.If you're not as concerned with the structural value of films as I am though you will most probably love it beyond beliefs. I wish I were you in that certain situation cause this film most certainly has a lot to love in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On his book 'Images', Bergman says that the first evocation of 'cries and whispers' was four women white-dressed, and all the situation around the women was composed by association of ideas. This film it's an oniric temptation, a continue game of images that represent unconscious ideas actually re-presented on Agnes's death. Suffering of flesh it's not different from psychological pain, because Bergman has the elements to articulate with so fine texture the most strong moments, for example the final scene, the remembrance of one of Agnes happy days, a postcard from death, or Karin's segment of selfish mutilation, so jouissance that would be a crime thought only as a pain...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When theater and movies collides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few directors are in the same level as Bergman: Genius. This film is one of his most remarkable works and the cast of characters is simply superb. The plot is very simple: two sisters (Maria and Karin) are in town to attend the final days of the oldest sister (Agnes). Anna, the maid that had been beside Agnes side for 15 years is the closest person in her life. Between these four characters (magnificent interpreted by Liv Ullman (Maria), Ingrid Thullin (Karin), Harriet Andersson (Agnes) and Kari Sylwan (Anna, the woman that appears in the front page of the movie)) the film present shocking scenes where reality and imagination are confused with dreams, desires and passions.Besides the excellent direction and performance of these four actresses, another element is the extraordinary photograph of Sven Nykvist and the choreography (including costume design). The movie is rich for visual elements, where red is the most important color during the film, contrasting with black and white costumes. Bergman has said that he is more a theater person than a filming director. Cries and Whispers have a lot of theater elements, but the Swedish film maker has found out the perfect synchronicity between cinema and theater. He takes advantage of both arts and the result is totally amazing. Another directors like Peter Greenaway (refer to "Prospero's book" or "The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover") had attempted to do the same with different results. The difference, I think is geniality. Bergman is a natural and one of the best director's ever.Other key element of this film is the use of dreams. Only directors like Tarkovski (the best in this area), Bu?uel or Kurosawa have the ability to manage dreams and surrealism on screen with maestry. In fact the best sequence occurs during one Anna's dream. We can see the death sister calling for Anna. Then there are some bizarre conversations between Agnes, Anna and the other two sisters. Beautiful scene. Bergman's obsession with religion and death is present one more time. In this occasion he uses some elements of his prior film "The seventh seal": in the closing sequence we can see the four main characters sharing a happy moment in the forest. Agnes then thinks by her self: "I would like to keep this moment forever, this is happiness". In the same way the knight (performed by Max Von Sydow) makes the same consideration when he shares the wild strawberries with the actors. Another similarity is the quest for life (in this case death) meaning. Anna asks to Agnes (when she is already death) what is beyond death, what else is there? No answer. In the seventh seal the main plot is the search of that answer with same results. Talking about dreams, each character has some hidden feelings that are expressed during surrealistic sequences. Some times is difficult to identify reality from fantasy, but in each case, in each moment of the movie is easy to realize the deepest fears, desires and emotions.Finally is fear to mention the cast of women gathered in this film. With exception of Bibi Andersson (The seventh seal, The passion of Anna, Wild strawberries, Persona, The devil's eyes ), Bergman chose his favorite actresses: Hariett Andresson (Cries and Whispers, Summer with Monika, Sunset of a clown, Fanny and Alexander), Liv Ullman (Persona, Cries and Whispers, Face to Face, Autumn sonata, The Passion of Ana, The serpent's egg) who had a relation and a daughter with him and Ingrid Thullin (The ritual, Wild strawberries, The hour of the wolf, The silence, Cries and Whispers, The magician). The result on the screen is obvious. The three of them knew perfectly Bergman's work, they knew the strange scenes he used to shoot and they knew the complexity of the characters, but they did a perfect work. They moved with freedom along the set, they know where the camera was and they did something that is extremely difficult: A lot of sequences are filmed in close up and they delivered the most extraordinary expressions and emotions I ever seen in a movie. Bergman knew that, and used actresses with enough capacity to do it. Besides that, he included in an important role a relatively unknown actress, Kari Sylwan. Her background before this film consisted in three movies in the late 50's (two of them uncredited). But she made a perfect job. She involved her character with the other talented three actresses and she was at the same level. In fact one of the most remarkable scenes occurred when she has a breast naked, holding death Agness in her arms. After Cries and Whispers she made another movie with Bergman (Face to Face) and then she disappears from movie industry. But she always be in my mind for this performance.I strongly recommend this picture for everyone to enjoy one of the most powerful, personal and shocking films by Bergman (and probably ever).</fullReview>

It would've been a lot cooler to see the original language version, even though Bergman himself supervised the dubbed version. Granted, the oh-I'm-so-clever camerawork by Sven Kyyekvist and the -oh-so-daring fade to red instead of fade to black can be giggle inducing, the film was a knock-out. And, the ending..

		<shortDescription>A painful film about the pain of human coldness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is for me a film about human coldness and the fruitless search for physical warmth and intimacy. Each character in her own way searches for human contact, and responds to the absence of this contact in a specific manner.Agnes' deficit of warmth emanates from her relationship with an emotionally absent mother, who preferred Maria. Having been ill for at least 12 years, she has not developed intimate relationships outside of the family, and her only ties are with her sisters (as seemingly expressed in the final scene on the swing). Even in death, her lack of intimate contact prevents her from finding peace, and she reaches out to her sisters for that intimacy, without success.Maria fills the intimacy gap with promiscuity and a facade of warmth, and by breaking down other's barriers (in particular Karin's, and with a failed second attempt at the doctor, who sees through her disguise). She is revealed in the end as manipulative and cold, as the facade is removed, having destroyed Karin's defenses and then leaving her naked and unprotected ("What a shame" she says, when Karin finally, and this time understandably, withdraws from her kiss).Karin is unable to experience any form of warmth, to the extent that she experiences physical contact (not just sexual contact) as literally painful, and finds pleasure in physical pain to a greater extent than physical intimate contact. She uses her iciness as a weapon, too, as does Maria, as seen by her sadistic smile and the rubbing of the blood on her mouth to the horror of her husband. She is the only character who seems to develop and progress during the course of the movie, having finally allowed herself to become defenseless and emotionally naked at the pleading of Maria. However, her risk-taking and vulnerability are simply abused by Maria, and Karin is ultimately left abused for her troubles. By the way, Karin's apparent development during the course of the film is in any event incomplete ? she remains incapable of showing any compassion to Agnes on Agnes' return from the dead, though she is honest about her reasons for withdrawing ("I don't love you").Anna appears on the surface to be the only compassionate character, but in fact she too is struggling with the dilemma of human contact and how to obtain and preserve it. Her own daughter died as a child and she clearly uses Agnes as a substitute infant (allowing her to suckle at her breast, even in death). Her willingness to physically comfort Agnes in death, despite the repulsiveness (the decomposing hands) is an indication of how far Anna will go to secure intimacy, and this intimacy is thus as pathological as all of the other manifestations in the film.The irony of the final scene on the swing is painful: Agnes' perception at that time was that she enjoyed the closeness and love of her sisters, which she experienced as a joy of living. In fact, as becomes clear on her death and especially after her death and her return to 'life', the sisters in fact have no sense of closeness towards her, but merely a sense of duty.The pervasive use of rich hues of red is symbolic of the elusive warmth, and this is the final irony: warmth and passion surrounds all of the characters in the house, but it remains external to each character. They walk through and past it, never in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First scene:the camera searches the house,a luxury one,we hear a clock ticking.And then Agnes,in her bed ,sleeping peacefully.We watch her awakening,we see her face grimace with pain.The respite is over:cancer is always here,stalking her .Visually,it's harrowing.With Agnes,to help her cope with her terrible fate,three women:Agnes's two sisters and a servant.The four actresses are a fabulous quartet,you cannot tell which one is the best,they are all accomplished thespians. Death is the main topic of Bergman's movie.It's not the only one as further acquaintance shows.Agnes's cries are heart-wrenching and may be too much for some spectators.But is there another way of showing the naked death,the pointless sufferings and a God who does not heed your call?The priest is helpless,muttering his prayers and praising Agnes after her death.The sisters seem to feel for the sick person,they pamper her and they read her "mister Pickwick". After Agnes 's death,the movie takes a sudden turn ,becoming supernatural:the dead woman calls her sisters,but ,selfishness or fear,they turn their back on her.Only the humble servant will have pity on her poor mistress.Then Bergman reveals us the true nature of the two sisters:they hate each others,for a while,it seemed that they felt drawn together by the common misfortune,but their futile problems,their greed and their contempt for the servant whom they treat like a dog before leaving the mansion with their husbands.They hurry to leave this house which represents not only Agnes's death,but the certainty of their own death. The last pictures are a relief for the audience:a flashback,showing the sisters and the servant,walking in the park on a sunny day,Agnes in voice-over.All these endearing,treasured memories,do they survive? Remember in "wild strawberries" the old teacher realizing that his childhood memories were much more than honors.In both movies,they are luminous,glaring,and help us to make it through the night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BORING - a total waste of time - intellectually absent - but occasionally pretty...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cries and Whispers was self-indulgent, slow, and full of meaningless symbolism. The interesting cinematography and good acting does not begin to compensate for the fact that Cries and Whispers is boring beyond belief. It was depressing as well but I expected no less from Bergman. It wasn't the fact that it was a sad movie that made it so utterly devoid of worth. I am a liberal person and I believe in freedom of artistic expression but this movie has made me rethink all that. It should be banned for wasting the time of everyone who watches it. I have no idea what kind of masochist would put themselves through this hour and a half of pure boredom - it feels like YEARS. The characters were not believable, there was no discernible plot, the mixed up time was more confusing than artistic...ughThis is undoubtedly one of the most boring films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...did i have to watch this thing? Paint a house red, put 3 or 4 women in a room talking nonsense all the time, focus the camera in front of a woman's face for 10 minutes, ....and the result is this cinematic monstrosity "directed" by the "genius" Bergman. As usual, the master(?) gives us a lesson about the power of love , forgiveness, the meaning of life and bla bla bla. Once again, his visual style is poor, flat and totally uninteresting (obviously, many idiots and film snobs will call this "minimalistic"), but it's not (Bresson's films are). The "dialogues" sound pretentious, solemn, and completely ridiculous; i don't know how people talk in Sweden, and frankly, i don't give a damn, but these dialogues sound so unrealistic that they could have been used in a film about aliens. It's very obvious that my ignorance and lack of sensibility doesn't allow me to admire this "work of art"(?), but i honestly prefer not to....and i sincerely pity all the people who consider this rubbish a masterpiece. Which leads us to the next question: WHO WAS A BETTER DIRECTOR? INGMAR BERGMAN OR ED WOOD????? I'll go for Eddie. PLEASE,AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE, if you want something really artistic, then try Bu?uel, Tarkovsky or Bresson, etc, but not this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated Bergman - Autumn Sonata is better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being familiar with Bergman's chamber films, I was eager to see them. I had seen 'The Seventh Seal' when I was a teenager, but had never seen his films past 1969. I just watched this film on DVD the other week. I must say I was fairly disappointed. It's a beautiful film no doubt, but there's a lot of ambiguity in this film. Karin's masochism stands out in this respect. I read several other reviews on this board (most of them take a superlative attitude about it), and something struck me: They can't explain the film on a thematic level; all they talk about is how visceral the film is. This film simply doesn't play enough cards. Last night, I finished watching 'Autumn Sonata'. I thought this was superior to 'Cries and Whispers' simply because there's more going on (certainly between the characters!). I think the people who love this film are mainly Bergman fanatics who feel he can do no wrong. I had a friend who was a Kubrick fan, but this director has his limitations as well... Wake up people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Seventh Seal which is one of my favorite films, at least in the top three, but I was a bit disappointed by this. The first half was really boring a lot of a women in bed dying in pain screaming and her two sisters and maid attending to her, then after she dies the two sisters pasts are briefly illuminated, their pasts involving affairs, suicidal husbands, and a self mutilated vagina. Then one of the sisters decides she wants to have a relationship with the other and thinks they should be honest and become close with each other, at which point the other sister confesses how she has always hated her and everyone in general, but especially her. Then their is a weird dream sequence, at least I think thats what it is, where the sister who died is in her death bed asking for people to stay with her, and only the maid(the meek) isn't horrified or hateful enough to stay with her dead or not. It ends with the dead sisters memory of a day where she decided the most perfect moment life could offer was just sitting with her two sisters in a swing. It was good if your above all else a patient film viewer(most aren't), but I cant say I really enjoyed it, I watched it thinking this is interesting I appreciate what is happening, but I don't think I would watch it again. That being said, some of the images offered here once seen cannot be unseen, and I would be lying if I were to say some moments don't still come back to me with a slight chill. It is definitely a film of quality, as has been most of my experience with Bergman, however this with this particular experience once is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably the best movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I so this movie before ten years and after watching couple 1000's of other movies I still do believe that this is the biggest movie ever made, because it is closest to the basic idea of film making.Sven Nikwist's beautiful photography, Bergman's theatrical skills transposed on the screen , tremendous knowledge of storytelling in the good tradition of Scandinavian writers(Strindberg,Ibsen, Hamsun), deep psychological , introspective journey through the endless labyrinth of human characters, Jungian racurs of some common questions of existence, and above all, great lyrical outburst, avalanche of strong feelings which overwhelmingly confront us with the most important questions of our being.I know that all this sounds scary for something what should be just 90 minutes of relaxing time after a hard day of work, but this is just something different, a movie which choose us to watch and not just to be watched</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kept my attention, but nothing spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second movie I've seen directed by Ingmar Bergman (the other being The Seventh Seal), and the second time I've been a little underwhelmed. Cries And Whispers looks at the cold relationship between three sisters, and how they come together (or really apart) as one of them slowly dies. Much symbolism is used (the constant fading to red) as we see how each sister is involved in an unsatisfying relationship, and how they deal with their situations differently. I just couldn't find myself caring much for any of these characters, as we received only small snippets of what could cause them to behave in the manner in which they did. Director Bergman obviously believes in the "less is more" principle, and I agree, but here less is just less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman's classic is one of the ultimate foreign experiences!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Persona" is the greatest Ingmar Bergman film, I believe, but the amazing director has also created the dying marriage and eternal bond of "Scenes from a Marriage", the religion-questioning "The Seventh Seal", the ultimate mother-daughter film "Autumn Sonata", the reminiscense of "Wild Strawberries", and finally the masterful "Cries and Whispers". "Cries and Whispers" is one of the scariest films ever made. It is not horror, but its characters are cold and insipid as the story studies death, love, sex, and self-destruction.The film stars Harriet Anderson as one of three sisters and the most earthly of all. Liv Ullman is the flirtacious sister and Ingrid Thulin, the emotionally-closed one. Inga Gill plays the maid who nurses Anderson while the other two sisters float around in their pathetic worlds.The movie is great because it is so human. It is audacious and explorative and one of Ingmar Bergman's greatest works of art.Oh, did I mention that Sven Nykvist is the god of cinematography (the title also belongs to Vittorio Storaro.)**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell so much in love with this movie that I'm learning Swedish.This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many. The acting is breathtaking, the plot is heart-wrenching and corrupting, and all in all this movie is the finest masterpiece ever made in film history.That's all I need to say- that's all I can say. No words can describe its excellence. You really have to see it to understand.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bergman tells the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is life: plain, harsh and pure, as perhaps only Bergman could present it. We are presented with four women: three sisters, one of whom is dying, and a maid, who is tending to the latter. There is Karin, cold, remote and rational; Maria, seemingly childish; pious Agnes, who is dying; and Anna, the simple, humble maid. Each stands before us, almost as if on trial, amid hushed whispering, before we glimpse a significant episode from their past.The narrative unfolds in layers, and part of the action takes place at the level of the subconscious. The performances are simply stunning, especially Ulmann, as are the photography and accompanying soundtrack. There are few sequences in contemporary cinema as stirring and haunting as the priest reciting his prayers, the anguished screams of the sisters, and, of course, Anna's mute acceptance of her fate.While examining some of his favorite themes such as emotional and spiritual isolation, human suffering and divine grace, Bergman dares to ask questions to which the insightful viewer will know only too well to look for answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conversation with a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say I am a fan of Ingmar Bergman would probably be a gross understatement.Cries and Whispers, the director's 1972 masterpiece, a visceral and intriguing mediation on death and afterlife, family loyalty and feminine mystery is, without hesitation, my favorite film of all time. The art direction, script, cinematography, costumes and direction just really fulfill my cinematic taste buds. Combine these elements with the once in a lifetime, largely female ensemble and it all adds up perfectly.Playing sisters Maria and Karin who keep watch over their dying sister, Bergman greats Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin generate such heated emotion and subtlety in their characters, adding to the film's ethereal and haunting qualities. As the pained, desperate and deathly Agnes, Harriet Andersson gives arguably, the most triumphant, nuanced and fully realized performance of her nearly sixty year career.Andersson was in Berlin, taking part in the Berlinale's Retrospective on "Traumfrauen", or "dream girls, literally (Andersson claimed it was not possible for her to be included with such a group of glamor girls as she didn't like getting up at four or five am to sit in the make up and hairdresser's chairs. Too much work to look like that, she said). She introduced a print of Bergman's 1952 classic, Sommaren mitt Monika (The Summer with Monika), an adaptation that launched her career, made her an international sex symbol and put a defining spin on Sweden as far as the world viewed the country at the time. On the eve of her 75th birthday, looking spry and lovely wearing flashy gold sneakers with fur, Ms. Andersson sat down with a small crowd at the Berlin Film Museum and talked about her career, her affiliation with Bergman and what she has learned as an actress.Biographer Jan Lumhold began the discussion with questions about her first film with Bergman, which was also the beginning of a short sexual affair between the two. Andersson said she was terrified of working with the director as she had heard so many horror stories from other actors about his process. She did say that he usually only insisted on one or two takes, no more than three ever, on any film. She also said that to make actors do any more than that is cruel. She cited a nameless director who made her do upwards of twenty takes, when she finally asked him what exactly he wanted, the director had no answer other than "I need some extra material for the editing room". A clearly disgusted Andersson remarked "we are not dogs..." Andersson commented that her work on Through a Glass Darkly almost did not happen. She said it was the only time she considered not going to work. She was newly married with a baby when Bergman sent her the script, asking her to play a schizophrenic. The actress turned him down flat despite her curiosity being piqued by the brilliant script. She called this time of her "the saddest". Bergman convinced her to visit a mental hospital to talk to the doctors, to see if she could find a way to play the character. She thought the idea of people who are very disturbed and sick but not having visible tell-tale signs to be a very challenging and interesting acting prospect and quickly changed her mind, saying "it's very difficult to say 'No' to Ingmar Bergman". Through a Glass Darkly went on to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1961, immediately following his 1960 win for The Virgin Spring.I was able to ask the actress the question I had been dying to since meeting her the night before at the showing of Monika, where I was actually able to tell her that her work and this film have been so important to me as a film lover: What was the extent of your preparation for playing Agnes in Cries and Whispers, physical and emotional? Andersson's insights into the film and the making of the film was something I will always value. She said, with a clear fondness and sadness, that she borrowed heavily for the role of the dying woman by dredging up memories of her father, who had a slow, horrible death from cancer. She said that watching him go through that was the basis for her entire performance. She said she did not diet at all for the part to achieve her look, which was actually realized more through make up than an actual physical transformation, though she said that for once Bergman told her to stay up late and not get any sleep, which was very opposite of his usual instructions. She said that she almost lost her lips because of the make up used to create her mouth sores. The corrosive mixture that was to go on her face ate through the cup it was mixed in! She said that as an actor, you must have discipline in your work and remember that it is a job, which helped her get through the wrenching performance and deliver what needed to be done. She also said there was pressure because funding was almost impossible to secure (as she put it, "who wants to see a film about three sisters, one dying, one promiscuous and one who puts glass up her Va-guy-Na"). She said she knew what the stakes were, so it made the performance come out more easily.Someone in the audience asked about having room to improvise whilst working with Bergman and she said there never was any need to ad lib because his scripts were literally always perfect, there was no need for embellishment. She also said that Bergman was always open to the possibility of adding things. Lumhold pointed out that every role Bergman gave her was written specifically for her, with the exception of Monika, which was first a novel. Andersson said she was never surprised or shocked at the director's sometimes incendiary scripts.</fullReview>
