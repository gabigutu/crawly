		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Thrillers Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jaws' is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film. 'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character. That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this movie scares you to the point where you can't go back into the water, then Spielberg has done job well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is a movie the I grew up with, it's like the first real horror film I ever watched. What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the "Indianapolis" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! "We're gonna need a bigger boat!" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never forget the first time I saw Jaws. I was glued to the seat from start to finish. I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz. He has never been better.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average fish story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely regarded as the film that began the "summer movie blockbuster era", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams). One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of "aquaphobia" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the "less is more" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Accidental Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My title refers to the serendipitous failure of the mechanical shark to function as planned. Steven admits this is a whole different movie than the one he planned. Because the mechanical shark broke, all the time, he was forced to use Hitchcock's techniques that Ridley used as well in ALIEN. You see a little more the shark as the movie progresses; he uses your imagination, just like in ALIEN, to supply the effects he couldn't with the broken shark. Steven himself admits that this worked out much better though the studio was furious with him at the time. Look, this is why Steven is such an overrated filmmaker; look at the rest of his works, all overrated and faded with time CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and E.T. to cite a couple. The only other true classic in his canon is SCHINDLER'S LIST. The entire rest of the catalog is just awful including SUGARLAND EXPRESS and the overrated DUEL. It is not an accident that this immortal classic is an accidental masterpiece. It is not the film Steven wanted to make; he did not know it but the shark breaking was the best piece of luck that ever befell him.The script and the Hitchcockian suspense done with understatement, as I said, is why the film is so great. You add three of the best actors of the 20th century Shaw, Scheider and Dreyfuss and this is what you get. Young people, the opening attack on Chrissy was so graphic, my friend and several people, ran out of the cinema at high speed to vomit. You have no idea how that effected people in 1975; this was probably, up to that time, the most graphic gory depiction of violence in a film. What so many reviewers miss is the incredible humor of the film. The quaint fishing town and its locals is a source of never ending jokes about how goofy they were. Steven said he had the screenwriter deliberately lighten the movie because the rest is so unrelentingly grim. He did a great job; the clashes between Hooper and Quint are hilarious. The humor is the deepest of any Spielberg film even his unfunny disaster 1941. The film starts and never stops to catch its breath. It is all go go go. The only breathers are well written humorous or moving scenes like where Quint tells the terrifying story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. What a scene, now we see Quint as he as always been, trying to get back his shipmates one shark at a time. This is some of the best acting you will ever see in a movie; the performances give the film a depth that is so absent in the awful sequels. The photography is legendary with the trademark Spielberg comet up in the sky. Look, however it happened, this is an undeniable masterpiece; it is the only film that will survive him. All his other films are fading fast but not this one. You have to watch it to believe it. Everything works here: script, pacing, acting, photography and suspense. One of the greatest films ever put up on a movie screen. In 1975, my audience gave it a three minute standing ovation. It deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the film, "Jaws" I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean...literally! Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg at the top of his game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: **** out of ****. Steven Spielberg is one of the best American directors working today. He has made many films that have been hailed as classics. Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the "Quintessential Spielberg Film." Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws. The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective. Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support. People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal. I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me. If these films dont surpass Jaws, then it is definitely Spielberg's best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a thrill-ride of suspense that continues to deliver the goods to the audience 25 years later. The plot is somewhat thin: a large shark is terrorizing the tourists at the local beach. However, with that said Steven Spielberg's direction is amazing. The young director (only 28 at the time) showed unlimited potential that would only increase with age. A great accomplishment that could have been a multi-million dollar bust. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man eating shark is terrorising the holiday island of Amity. Police chief Martin Brody, shark hunter Quint and marine biologist Matt Hooper set sail in the hope of killing the great white monster.Jaws is responsible for many things, it's responsible for propelling director Steven Spielberg's career into the stratosphere, it was responsible for a downturn in the package holiday trade, and it was responsible for shaping the summer blockbuster release practise's. There are many other things which one doesn't need to bore you with, it's just true to say that Jaws is firmly ensconced in movie history, if one hasn't seen it then one surely knows about it, it is, even today, part of popular culture.But is it any good? Is it worthy of a long standing reputation as one of the greatest monster movies of all time? Hell yes it is, one or two easily overlooked flaws aside, it busted the box office {world wide} and tapped into a primal fear that resides in the majority of mankind, the unseen that resides in the sea.Jaws sets out its marker right from the start with a truly shocking and attention grabbing opening sequence, from then on in Spielberg {learning from Hitchcock for sure} tweaks the tension to have the audience living on their nerves, even as character building {by way of Brody's family arc} sedates the pace, we just know that it's all relative to an extension of fear and terror that is around the next corner. After the first victims remains are found Brody glances out at the ocean, Spielberg perfectly framing the shot to say so much that we are about to be witness to. Jolts and shocks pop up from time to time to help build the unease whilst Spielberg makes the audience wait before we even see what it is that so coldly and efficiently destroys man, and then the claustrophobic switch as our brave protagonists are out at sea on Quint's boat, unaware that the giant menace is now hunting them, eyes as black as death itself.So many great scenes linger for all time in the memory, the entrance of Quint is a hum dinger, a mournful widow reducing Brody to a stunned realism, the Indianappolis monologue, the bigger boat! Just some of the reasons why I personally love cinema so much. The score from John Williams is as effective as any for the genre and Robert Hoyt's sound team's work furthers the dread unfolding. The cast are superb and uniformly excellent, casting aside technical problems {and genuine resentment at times} to portray this story with verve and genuine depth of feeling. Yet Roy Scheider {Brody}, Robert Shaw {Quint} and Richard Dreyfuss {Hooper} were from from original choices, Charlton Heston was wanted for the role of Brody, Sterling Hayden and Lee Marvin were both mooted for Quint, and John Voight was Spielberg's preferred choice for Hooper, whilst Jaws author {and co screen writer here} Peter Benchley was heading for the top by asking for Newman, Redford and McQueen!! Imagine that!Still it all turned out well in the end because Jaws stands the test of time as one of the best films of its type to have ever been made. No amount of complaining about continuity and a rough looking mechanical shark will ever dim its appeal, even as I revisited it recently for the hundredth time I still got tingles all over my body, file it along side King Kong in the pantheon of Monster Masterpieces, 10/10 always, now go enjoy your dip in the ocean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made film which efficiently manipulate its elements of suspense and horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with a shot of a group of teenagers enjoying a campfire out on Amity beach... A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim... The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them... In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water... When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene... Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island... But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches... Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) tries with his town officials to convince the insecure police chief to file the incident as a 'boating accident.' Brody reluctantly agrees, but later regrets his decision after few more fatal incidents... The shark has claimed Amity Island as his territory...Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric old shark killer, offers to kill the menacing Great White Shark for ten thousand dollars... Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), an arrogant young oceanographer, proves that the giant shark that killed Christine Watkins is still on the loose... 'They caught a shark. Not the shark,' he determines... and predicts future outbursts of attack activity in the area...Brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life-and-death hunt... They go after the monstrous creature with rifles and poison pistols... They try to tire him, slowing him down with coiled ropes and barrels... They fight him with everything, harpoons, poles, gaffs and compressed air tanks...Shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II... Scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating... His line to Quint ('You're going to need a bigger boat.") suggests a specific cause...Dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it... Spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart-stopping scenes wonderfully engaging... His grasp for sustaining the feeling of terror comes not only from what we see, but from what we're afraid we're going to see... He uses an imposing classical score to prepare the audience for something really scary that is about to show up... With every breath, every thought, heart beat and movement, the realism of the increasing menace is present from the opening to the end... And believe me, we are never allowed the relief of looking away from the screen?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while the right talented people are at the right place together and come up with a masterpiece. "Jaws" is definitely one of those movies, that is thanks to the amazing cast and the crew the classic masterpiece that it is today.Let's face it, the story is dumb and silly and in a way very average. Spielberg magically turns the silly story into a tense exciting thriller with brilliant dialogue and classic scene's. Mark my words, "Jaws" is a movie that will never be considered outdated.Everything in the movie works so well! The acting, the dialogue, the tension, the typical Spielberg humor, the music, everything! It's hard to name just one thing why this movie is such a masterpiece. It is the mix of everything combined that makes the movie work. Probably my favorite thing about the movie would be the dialogue, they are very raw and performed well by the perfect cast. Another thing of course would be the music and I'm not just talking about the main theme but about the entire musical score in general.The cast is great but they are mainly great together. All of the Scheider/Shaw/Dreyfuss scene's are like three ingredients thrown together and the end result of it is pure gold.And than Bruce the shark. Yes, he really looks believable even now days.A real classic masterpiece that launched Spielberg's career10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was about 8 years old. And what I remember most about it, is thinking that I had found the most frightening film that I had ever seen. When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ). To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming. I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life. Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break. Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me. " Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? " I asked them. Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.Jaws is perfect on every level of film making. It has incredibly well developed characters, so well that we feel their fears and their bravado when we are supposed to. The direction is some of the best I have ever seen. We are but marionettes in Spielberg's fingers. When he wants us to feel, he pulls our strings and masterfully we feel scared or horrified or even amused. A perfect example of this is the killing of the Kinter kid, the second death of the movie.The scene starts off shortly after Chrissie Watkins is killed. There are people playing on the beach and in the water. Brody ( the police chief ) is sitting tentatively watching things intently. He hears screams from a young girl. But of course they are playful screams. Then we see a man playing fetch the stick with his dog. Finally we meet Alex Kinter. He goes out on his raft into the water. Then we see the shots from under water. It's as if something is approaching. We're really not sure if we are being teased here or not. But then we see a stick floating in the water and the man calling out for his dog. But he is not there. Then we see more kids splashing and then we cut to a shot approaching the Kinter boy on his raft from under water. And the music. And then...... well, we all know what happens. Now that is a director masterfully manipulating us.Jaws stands up to and surpasses any film these days that is considered brilliant and it surpasses anything that came before it. This film should have cleaned up at the Oscars. After all, what film is remembered more? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ( a very good film ) or Jaws? The answer is quite clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far from being a monster movie, this is a realistic and gritty example of a town which relies on summer trade having its beaches invaded by a dangerous shark. There are genuinely suspenseful sequences, a first-rate soundtrack and believable people. The character development of the three men in the boat shows there's a lot more to this film than just a rubber fin. I'd recommend this and Jaws 2 to any fan of drama/thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: A police chief of a popular summer retreat island finds the tourist season in jeopardy when a great white shark attacks. With the mayor pressuring him to keep the beaches open for financial reasons, he teams up with a marine scientist and a certifiable fisherman to hunt the beast. My Take: Is there a better horror film out there? I say no. This movie has it all, jumps, tears, laughter, and (most importantly) tension. Spielberg proved out of the gate that he knows where all of your strings are and that he can pluck any single one at will. What makes this film so incredible isn't the shark at all. It's the people. They are real three dimensional characters who share our fears and feelings. A simple example being when one mother walks up, slaps the police chief and sobs, "My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that." Recommendation: I would also recommend Spielberg's made for T.V. movie Duel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know what some of you may think, the shark looks fake, sure it does, but put yourself into the shoes of a movie-goer in the summer of 1975.Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, not because of it's technical achievement at the time being, but because how Steven Spielberg, frankly took a far-fetched idea and made it scary. Jaws has a simple story of a twenty-five foot great white shark terrorizing civilians of Amity Island. Eventually, the town's chief of police(Roy Scheider), a marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman(Robert Shaw) are tasked to taking down the shark. The film was known for have technical difficulties with the animatronic shark, but that was a blessing in disguise. Because of this, Spielberg manages to create tension and fear among the audience because you don't see the shark at all. Leaving your imagination to do all the work. The opening scene is downright terrifying hearing the woman screaming in agony, being dragged around by a shark we cannot see. Also the use of barrels was a stroke of genus by Spielberg and his team as it implied that the shark was near or present. What really makes this film work are the three leads. They share an impeccable chemistry between each other. Brody is a paranoid police chief, effectively portrayed by the great Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss is hilarious as the wisecracking marine biologist Matt Hooper, who frequently butt heads with the rough and tough fisherman Quint, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Shaw. The three leads make these character believable and so the audience can go on a real journey with them. I cannot see this film without Steven Spielberg. In the end he put all this together, with no script, no crew, technical malfunctions, and scrutiny. How Spielberg managed to pull this movie off under massive pressure is beyond me. It's a testament on how great he is. Give credit to the writers Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, and uncredited writer Howard Sackler for providing the film's story and sharp dialog. Who can also forget the incredible score by John Williams. Outstanding. Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, and the start of the blockbuster trend. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant build up to a very disappointing conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching parts of Jaws when I was much younger and finding some scenes scary. For a long time, I've been wanting to watch the full movie and now that I have, I can tell you one thing. This movie hasn't aged that well.When you look at other timeless classics such as Star Wars, Spielberg's Indiana Jones, Alien, E.T and so on, they certainly have aged very well and still are certainly watchable and can either be feared or called "epic" Unfortunately, the same cannot go for Jaws, at least in my belief.As I was watching this movie, I was so impressed with the first half of the movie, the build up where a few people get killed and they attempt to close all beaches that I couldn't wait for the final part of the movie. The first half contained everything a movie needs; great buildup to a movie. Remember, the Empire Strikes Back. We watched 90 minutes of build up before the Luke vs Vader duel. Remember Helm's Deep from Lord of the Rings? We had a lot of build up to the final battle. Same went for Return of the King; the first half of the movie was all build up to the epic conclusion. The problem with Jaws for me is that the first half gets me so excited to see how everything will conclude that once it did, it was thoroughly disappointing.What I meant with "It hasn't aged well" is that by now, the shark really looks pretty bad and unrealistic. However, we can appreciate all the trouble Spielberg went to get the shark to come onto the big screen back in '75. Also, the acting is good and the story is good but another little issue is that John Williams' soundtrack to the movie doesn't add much tone anymore.Maybe I over hyped the movie but the ending seemed so sudden. When Hooper finally goes underwater to see the shark, there was only 10 minutes of the movie left. Also, back then, this movie may have been an absolute masterpiece and true horror but now, the story of a shark killing people is kind of stupid. That isn't to necessarily say I found it stupid. I didn't. But its another example of why this movie hasn't aged all that well. Whilst Hooper and Brody are good characters, Quint isn't necessarily the same.Jaws may be regarded as a cult classic but whilst this movie is great in its first half the final half of the movie to me is a massive let down and extremely slow. Disappointing movie unfortunately for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who'd have thought that such a simple idea could be a film of such amazing impact, even decades later. It is a testament to Spielberg's directing abilities that this film still creates deep seated phobias in those that watch it!Essentially a remake of Duel except with a shark replacing the truck this is a lesson in suspense for directors. With special effects now the audience tend to see everything in glorious colour - not much is left to the imagination. With Jaws we only see the fin, movements under water or the impact of the attack - the shark remains hidden until the end. This is the best option as it is very rubbery looking, but it also heightens the tension as the unknown moves under water to attack us.Roy Scheider is excellent as Chief Brody with great support from Dreyfuss and Shaw. The chemistry between the Dreyfuss and Scheider is perfect and Shaw is as tetchy as he needs to be. The dialogue is spot on in many scenes and has become part of the common knowledge of the world - being spoofed in films included Lethal Weapon 3, Chasing Amy to name two.Later remade as Jurassic Park (!) this is a classic piece of tension. Ignore the rubber shark effects towards the end and sit back and marvel at what a master director can do with a simple story and basic effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen a re-release of this back in 2012 this is one interesting shark film that sparked off the shark film craze! Martin Brody the sheriff a small island town of Amity off of New England investigates numerous shark attacks in the water after a young girl goes skinny dipping in the sea &amp; get's attack by an unknown 'killing machine'! It's only until they discover bites marks on a whale that they discover it could be something far worse, a Great White Shark! He &amp; 2 other guys go in search for the shark &amp; to kill it!The film itself was great for it's time. Considering I myself wasn't around then I think it is a unique film all round! The suspense was also great in this film too teasing the audience until 3/4 of the way into the film! It's definitely one of those edge of your seat films admittingly, though in all honesty I have seen better shark films, like Shark Night 3D or Bait 3D which were both epic films, though Jaws is just as great!The kills were OK, not to my standards but OK for a film of this calibre. The ending part was truly great, (Though not as epic as Jaws 2's ending) it was still a great way for the shark to get killed off!I overall, thought this was a great film, not the best I have seen but a true classic! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I STILL have trouble with the deep-end of the pool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was VERY young when I saw this movie. I'm thankful for that for two reasons: there is NO WAY I could watch it again now without some therapy so I'll be able to keep enjoying water sports, and also because that was a time that movies need not be ultra-primo CGI to be "impressive". This just scares the crap right out of you on its own.I remember hearing later that this movie unintentionally led to the hunting of Great Whites at a shocking level, which (if true) is horrible. As a surfer, spending days in an ocean Great White-free would be great, not having to worry about what's lurking about in my vicinity, and if it sees me as a juicy snack food. I have to say that the danger man-eating sharks pose to - well, man, is not a new concept and didn't start with this movie. So if a Hollywood movie made people suddenly afraid that sharks are a somehow new invention and needed their numbers suddenly controlled, I can't help but say how horribly sad that is - mostly for the sharks, but also for the people that let movies rile them up like that.- On a side note, I've heard of new(er) inventions that can keep a shark basically uninterested in you. Or at the very least, keep your limbs intact should the unthinkable happen. Sign me up! That being said, whatever my mother was thinking letting me watch this at such a young age (or ever, for that matter), especially with our frequent family trips to the beach, I have actually hoped for some kind of way that I could mentally block Jaws - at least on beach days. I'm actually thankful to have endured Jellyfish stings because Jellyfish don't friggin' eat you.I remember this being a good and captivating movie, and likely the first "horror" movie I'd ever seen, sans ghosts; made up of real creatures and actual, possible events. It got the "horror" classification from me because I was terrified, just TERRIFIED, and came close so many times to needing to leave the theater if for nothing else than a change of pants. Good G-d. No demon from the front gates of hell could have an effect on me like one of these creatures.My summers were never the same, even with all my childhood friends in my pool with me, in crystal clear water. The deep end was, without a doubt, off-limits for me. Had our household had only a bathtub but no shower, I would have had to be the dirtiest kid on our block to ever exist - we're talking Charlie Brown's smelly buddy level - because bathtubs were ruined for me too! For the record, it wasn't until years later that I learned how to surf. How or why, I ever managed to turn that idea into a reality bewilders me to this day, even though I love to surf. I'd have to say prescribed anti-anxiety pills may have helped the mental process though (the balance part, not so much). Waiting for a wave can be nerve-wracking. I'm good at it now, but I'll likely always have mini-panic attacks every time I think about the fact that my legs are dangling off a board into water that I can't see into past a few inches (the Pacific is murky). And seeing a dolphin in the distance? Forget about it.Need a visual into what has haunted me now my whole life? All I need to say is this: the cover of the movie. Just LOOK AT THAT THING! That swimming woman? she looks Barbie-sized compared to Jaws.This is without a doubt a scary movie - but never say you haven't been warned! I recommend it, but NOT if you ever want to have peaceful thoughts about that swim you want to take tomorrow, or ever again at any time for the rest of your life.If he's reading this - you are a talented, talented man, Steven Spielberg. Kudos to you. But I will never forgive you for scaring me like that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most inspired piece of casting in the movie is the use of Richard Dreyfuss as the oceanographer. He made this film soon after playing the driven, scheming, overwhelmingly ambitious title character in "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz," and the nice kid, college-bound, in "American Graffiti." Here he looks properly young, engaging, and scholarly, and introduces the technical material about sharks in a way that reinforces our elemental fear of them. Which brings us to the shark itself. Some of the footage in the film is of an actual great white shark. The rest uses a mechanical shark patterned on the real thing. The illusion is complete. We see the shark close up, we look in its relentless eye, and it just plain feels like a shark. "Jaws" is a great adventure movie of the kind we don't get very often any more. It's clean-cut adventure, without the gratuitous violence of so many action pictures. It has the necessary amount of blood and guts to work -- but none extra. And it's one hell of a good story, brilliantly told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JAWS was rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies and the recipient of an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Roy Scheider is wonderful as cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a coastal island town. The screenplay is tight and well-written. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary star in Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller based on the novel. This takes place on a resort island, Amity and begins with a young girl falling victim to a great white killer shark. Soon, the shark kills again and starts terrorizing the residents on the beaches. Police chief, Martin Brody (Scheider) tries to keep them out of the water and stop the shark with help from a fisherman, Quint (Shaw) and marine biologist, Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss). Gary plays Martin's wife, Ellen who is also the mother of their 2 children. This classic paved the way for many killer shark/creatures in the water imitations. It's definitely one of Spielberg's best with a great cast and unforgettable score by John Williams that I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine that, if "Bruce" (the name given to the mechanical shark by Spielberg) had worked as he had envisioned, this movie may have become another low-grade horror flick. Instead, it's more than halfway through the film before the creature appears in full view of the audience.Until then, only William's haunting score is there to warn you of the approaching danger as people get picked off one by one in the surf. It also allows sufficient time to develop each of the main characters: Brody, the city-boy cop trying to deal with small-town politics, Hooper, the oceanographer who also thinks about the scientific possibilities, Vaughn, the slick mayor who turns a blind eye to the problem in favor of the business people that put him in office, and Quint, the hunter who will solve the island's problem for a handsome fee.The movie only gets better in the second half as Quint becomes a modern Ahab, who looks upon the shark as an adversary and pledges to rid the seas of this great white terror without much thought of this daunting challenge or its significant consequences. Meanwhile, Brody and Hooper now face two problems: the menacing shark, who seems to be toying with them, and Quint, who has no problem taking them down with him should it come to that conclusion.Having grown up on the water, had I seen this film as a young boy, I may have thought twice about dangling my hand over the side of the boat or diving off the town docks. The horror genre is usually synonymous with bad cinema but, on the rare occasion, some unforgettable classics are created and the first of this series (the only one worth watching or owning) is such an example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summer, the most profitable time for multiplex theatres and CGI-explosions factories, has become synonymous with (arguably) soulless outings of artless money-making. With remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, franchises, and cinematic universes taking over our local cinemas each mid-year, it's easy to forget that this whole business started with the troubled production of Jaws. Spielberg's coming-out party stands-out 40 years later as a timeless piece of pure capital-F Filmmaking that surpasses most, if not all, that it influenced. With spectacular characters and thrilling scares, it still makes audiences pause before getting in the water. The modern-day leviathan tale of a tourist town dependent on out-of-towners for their economy (sound familiar, Panama City?) terrorized by a giant shark on July 4th is celebrating its 40th year of keeping audiences dry. The zeitgeist moments are wonderful (jumping mechanical sharks, "you're gonna need a bigger boat"), but those thrills are matched by the timelessly human characters and dialogue. Spielberg grounds the excitement in enough reality to keep us engaged, specifically in the three men at the center. Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw have incomparable chemistry, playing some of the most endearing individuals in movie history. Sure, the mechanics of the shark itself are somewhat antiquated but that's to be expected. I can only imagine what we will think of the effects in Jurassic World in 2055. The immutability of the personality in Jaws is what has kept us returning to it decade after decade. This Independence Day, celebrate your national freedom by enjoying one of the greatest popcorn films of all time?just make sure you go to the beach first.</fullReview>

There isn't a hero or funny guy they are all just normal people hunting a shark. You can relate to the characters and feel for them. For the time the effects are wonderful and the scenery is amazing. Some scenes are gruesome but the thing that makes the film better is the haunting, iconic soundtrack. It just lifts the film from good to greatness.

Director Steven Spielberg was pushed to his artistic innovative limits because of his malfunctioning mechanical shark and this film is better for it. The thrills are stronger and the build up to the reveal of the shark is pulse pounding."We're gonna need a bigger boat" - best reveal ever!At the heart of this is the three lead actors.

		<shortDescription>An archaic fear becomes a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is widely known to many people all over the world. Even though they haven't actually seen the film or seen it completely. Why is that? It is because Jaws has left an image on the cultural collective mind. It is an image of the fear of the unknown that lingers in the dark (waters) and waits to come up and swallow up man. An archaic image of fear that is buried deep inside of mankind and was portrayed by cultures at all times: giant serpents living in lakes, the spirits of ancestors in the woods with the Native Americans, demons, ghosts etc. The very first victim scene where Chrissie is attacked from under the water shows this archaic fear clearly and has become an icon for the movie itself, similar movies, commercial spots, t-shirts, etc.Most people in the Western civilization cannot jump into the ocean anymore without having at least a glimpse of JAWS in mind. The archaic fear has got a new clear image of a Great White Shark. If someone makes these sounds "dun-dun-dun-dun" almost everybody has immediately the same pictures in mind of a menacing shark approaching. This film is a masterpiece in making, acting and scoring.Young Spielberg may have had more luck and balls than real knowledge and life long experience in making this movie. CEOs at Universal got very angry about him but still had confidence in him. Of course he didn't invent this genre and this didn't came out of nothing. Predecessors like Creature from the Black Lagoon, Revenge of the Creature, Moby Dick, 20.000 Leagues Under the Sea have prepared this field. And Spielberg and John Williams borrowed a lot from them, especially Creature from the Black Lagoon, where we find the same musical theme "dun-dun" twenty years before Jaws. But in the end it is what it is and the audience decides whether they like a movie or not - for Jaws generations have considered it a masterpiece and inspiration for following directors.So why do so many new movies about sharks suck? In my opinion they do because they concentrate on the shark, not on the story or archaic fear. That's what Spielberg did, concentrate on the story and fear, having all the trouble with the mechanic shark he had no other choice either. Maybe there is an unwritten law shining through: great difficulties on set make great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: On the shores of a quaint northeast town, a gigantic man-eating shark is causing police chief, Martin Brody, some major issues. The mayor is breathing down his neck not to close the beaches because of upcoming summer profits on the 4th of July weekend. Thus, a team made up of the police chief, an oceanographer, and a deep sea fisherman is set to go after the ferocious great white shark. Review: When the film Jaws came out, the film became a massive hit and was highly praised by audiences and critics alike. Nowadays, it almost seems that Jaws is becoming under-appreciated and not taken a granted for. There's a lot to like about Jaws but it makes sense to start out at the beginning, when the lovely skinny dipping bombshell, happens to be the first victim to the ruthless sea beast. The panic in her eyes felt real and this kill immediately hooks the viewer into the movie. The music in this scene, by John Williams isn't necessarily catchy or explosive, but it's perfect for the underwater shark perspective, when approaching the swimmers. The film is steered, no pun intended, but the three high-profile actors, Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Schneider was fantastic, seemingly a normal everyday person, while on the other hand, Robert Shaw played an eccentric, beloved shark hunter sensationally. In the latter half of the film, when only these three characters are shown throughout, are easily the best parts of Jaws. Shaw gives great line, after great line and the special effects for the shark improve in each underwater scene. It's only when the shark is seen above water to be a little fake. Each Spielberg film I see of his is different than the rest, since I feel he has no agenda and no style to filmmaking. He's an unique director that put together a marvelous, transcendent film, Jaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's masterful horror film provokes the senses and is still effective 40 years later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason we're so damn scared of sharks lurking in the water is because of one man: Steven Spielberg. His most iconic film revolves around a killer shark terrorizing a local town in California. With classic music and the unaware presence and location of the mighty beast, Spielberg has truly crafted a terrorizing film. "Jaws" is not only a classic film, it's the begging of a major fear in nature. Sharks are deadly creatures, there's no doubt, but the initial fear of these majestic creatures started once the "dun dun dun" music and the mysterious camera view from the sharks perspective hit the screen in the 70's. Every horror filmmaker should learn from this film. Instead of pouring boodles of blood constantly and showing gratuitous guts and bodies being mutilated (which is pretty much all you get in horror film,s these days), Stevey makes your mind scared, and it's his subtlety that messes you with and makes you jump from your couch. We only see Jaws for about five minutes on screen. Yet he scares us throughout. We don't know what the heck we're dealing with, that's why we get scared. We don't know where he is in the water or who he will strike next. The direction that leads us into fear of the unknown is why this is a classic. Steven Spielberg made his legendary work likable due to not only his masterful use of horror, but his cutting edge visual effects. Once we do see Jaws, it's a sight to be reckoned with. Nowadays we're so use to magnificent special effects that this would seem like nothing. But from a 1975 perspective, this is mind- blowing. Steven Spielberg's classic tale of horror and the relationship between man and nature is a film you really must see to call yourself a true movie fanatic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films that has won so many awards that it's hard to keep up with them. For example, it won two Academy Awards for "Best Sound" and "Best Film Editing". It was also nominated for an Academy Award for "Best Picture" and while it didn't win on that particular night it later did win a Golden Globe award for "Best Motion Picture-Drama". Likewise, Richard Dreyfuss won a BAFTA award for his performance as the oceanographer named "Matt Hooper". And there were other awards and nominations as well. In all it was quite impressive. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, this is definitely one that I can recommend to all but the very young and faint-hearted. Although there isn't much gore, graphic language or nudity it still has enough drama and suspense to keep a person's interest throughout most of the movie. Personally, while I thought the special effects were more than adequate for that specific time period, I still would have preferred a bit more gore to make it seem even more realistic. Additionally, I thought some of the film got a bit bogged down by the dialogue-especially while the three main characters, "Sheriff Brody" (Roy Schieder), "Captain Quint" (Robert Shaw) and the afore-mentioned "Matt Hooper" were at sea waiting for the shark to appear. Even so this was a very good movie and as proof of that one need only look at the number of sequels, clones and similar movies which have been spawned (no pun intended) due to it. Definitely above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As most know by now, Jaws is an excellent film about our favorite great white shark terrorizing poor Amity and the locals. The main characters are unforgettable, especially Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint and most of the top notch dialogue is terrific. Naturally, the most memorable lines revolve around Quint's legendary story about how they "delivered the bomb" considering how many of the men were killed by sharks. Anyway, the real star of Jaws is Bruce the shark, and how Spielberg keeps it hidden from us before we see the actual beast. This is better than any silly CGI knock off could be considering this is from the summer of 1975. This is one of movies, like Goodfellas, that I make sure to catch at least a few times per year, no matter the season. It never bores me, thanks to perfect and flawless film-making and legendary performances, scenes, and atmosphere throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quarter of a century on, this remains Spielberg's most perfectly accomplished film, at once poetic and fiercely efficient, without a trace of the mawkishness, and latterly preachiness, that has marred much of what he has done since. The disastrous watershed of `Star Wars' and the dumbed-down 80s lay ahead. `Jaws' marks the final flowering of the mass-market Hollywood genre movie as high art.Like the best of the Westerns, this film resonates with the myths of the Old World. It is Homeric in form: the internecine squabbling on land in the film's first half is the `Iliad'; the testing of Brody at sea in the second part, the `Odyssey'. (`Show me the way to go home', he sings in his cups.) The great shark is the monster threatening the community that, like Theseus or Oedipus, Brody must sally forth to slay, testing and discovering himself in the process. There is something of Athenian tragedy, too, in the veiled and grieving mother who curses Brody at the dockside. Every hometown in America had its Mrs Kintner during Vietnam, and the guilt of that war ? barely past when `Jaws' was made ? is surely the film's deeply coded subject-matter. `Amity, as you know, means friendship', intones the corrupt mayor, a small-town Nixon with a taste for horrendous polyester sports-jackets; yet its good burghers collude in the sacrifice of their children for the sake of a quiet life and an honest buck, and ? as in Ibsen's `Enemy of the People' ? disown the decent citizen who tries to blow the whistle. In a sense, Amity/America has conjured the predator into being. Quint's grisly yarn (scripted, it is said, by an uncredited John Milius) of the wreck of the USS `Indianapolis' ? the film has a kind of out-of-body experience at this point ? implies that this is Nature's revenge for the sin of Hiroshima (`Anyway, we delivered the Bomb'); as if the shark, cheated of full atonement in 1945, had followed this ancient mariner home, claiming him as a final (superbly gruesome) canape before sinking forever into the deep.The film is framed by the clanging of a bell upon the waters, first in the stillness of night, finally in the light of day. Rarely has the space immediately in front of the lens been so effectively used to create a sense of depth and subjectivity ? often, a face in extreme close-up filling one edge of the Panavision frame, almost breaking forward from the plane of the screen. We watch the boat set sail, ominously framed by a shark's bleached jawbone in the window of Quint's boathouse; the camera glides forward, through the jagged O, after the departing vessel, as if reaching out to call it back; the next shot, eerily and perfectly picking up the flow of that movement, is a direct reverse ? we look back from the boat, over Brody's shoulder and following his gaze, at same window, receding in the distance (our last sight of land until the credits roll), the jawbone just discernible as a tiny ghostly shape behind the pane. Far out at sea, Quint's haunting tale told, the shark attacks in the darkness before dawn; Brody scrambles onto deck, fumbling to load his revolver, his face lurching towards the camera, then turning aside in a moment of stillness while, in the sky behind, we glimpse, for a fraction of a second, the low diagonal streak of a chance meteor, a foreboding of disaster and a sign of grace.This is film-making of the very first order, effortlessly transcending its commerciality and genre, luminous with pity, fear and wonder. `Jaws' has featured in every `ten best' list this viewer has ever scribbled on a tablecloth. Time has not wearied it. See it again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Possibly the Best Monster Movie of All-time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is, and probably will always be, the film in which truly defines a blockbuster. Of course unlike many modern day blockbusters, Jaws had something more than just action and suspense; it was chock full of likable, three-dimensional characters, and it had this magical touch that could simply be explained if one only looks to the film's director, Steven Spielberg.The premise of Jaws is one that if you were simply told about as opposed to seeing it, you would probably laugh your head off. I mean how could you make a film about a gigantic great white shark preying on the inhabitants of a beachside town a serious and engaging movie? Well Mr. Spielberg knew how. First he made the smart decision to make all of the characters in the film three-dimensional, then he cast terrific actors to pull off the magnificent roles. Robert Shaw truly shines as Quint, but Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are no slouches either. Of course where Spielberg's true mastery comes through was in his decision to not show the shark until the movie was almost over. Yeah you'd see a fin here and a tail there, but the full shark was never exposed until the end. This made the film feel more tense and threatening, because lets face it, the mechanical shark looks pretty fake. Still, applying the classic Hitchcockian principal of the viewer is more afraid of what they don't see, Spielberg was able to craft a film that still stands tall as one of the best films of all-time.When one gets off the amusement park ride which is the film Jaws, you feel as if you just went on one of the most thrilling rides of your life. For this reason alone Jaws is one of my favorite films.I give Jaws a perfect 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes Steven Spielberg one of cinema's best directors is his unique ability to consistently inject character development into all of his films, regardless of what genre they are categorized in. Jaws provides the perfect showcase for his talent. The movie transcends its B-movie roots due to the high quality of the performances. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw not only deliver refined, three-dimensional performances, but have terrific chemistry together. Jaws could very well contain the best ensemble acting ever - it rivals The Godfather and 12 Angry Men.That Jaws is a first-rate thriller as well, makes it a film to be treasured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is redundant to write something outlining the fact that JAWS is a brilliant film. There is nothing that can be said at this point that hasn't already been said. People have written about the rubber shark. Everyone knows that the shark's name is Bruce. Everyone knows that it was named after Spielberg's lawyer. Everyone knows that the shark didn't work all the time. Everyone knows that Dreyfuss and Shaw didn't get along. The list goes on... Still, for some reason, this movie inspires people, myself included, to write, write, and write. More importantly, it inspires us to read, read, and read. We need to know that we're not all crazy for loving this movie. We need to know that we can sit there and heave a collective sigh of relief, of comfort, when we watch it. We need to know that there are others like us who love this movie on every level. It touches us. We are Chief Brody when we're scared. We get excited in a very geeky way over things we love like Hooper. We all have moments of bravado like Quint and we're happy to know that he gets scared too. Most of all- we love sharks. We can't help it. This movie is brilliant. There is not a single thing that you could do to it that would make it better. They haven't created an award with a broad enough scope that would be appropriate for this movie to win. It's an action movie, a horror movie, a buddy movie, a drama; it is everything. It is why we go to movies. If you have not seen this movie then stop what you are doing. I don't care if you are delivering a baby- it can wait. You can not go any further in your life without seeing JAWS. If you've seen it before- finish delivering the baby... then go watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing like a good 'Man vs. Beast' story to get you fired up. Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' in 1963 and the Stephen King inspired 'Cujo' in 1983 are a couple of the best examples that come to mind when thinking about this genre in cinema. In between, young director Steven Spielberg brought us his second feature film, based on a book of the same name and it just happened to be about a beast terrorizing a community and the men who go out to destroy it. The book was a best seller almost a year and was turned into one of, if not the best film about 'Man vs. Beast.' Now over 30 years old, it still packs a wallop and is as entertaining and engaging as it ever was.Pros: Great performances from a first rate cast. Frightening and graphic attack scenes. Beautifully shot, above and under water. Exceptional direction by Spielberg who does a great job of creating and maintaining suspense. Well-paced. Breathtaking filming location. Not that the opposite is a bad thing, but unlike a lot of other horror films before and in the decades after, this is more grounded in reality, which is nice sometimes. A good score, including the now classic main theme. Impressive special effects.Cons: In some shots near the end the shark looks very fake.Final thoughts: Forget the sequels and countless imitations, this is the king of killer shark movies! It's also a reminder of a better time in the horror genre, when filmmakers didn't use buckets of gore to shock and terrify audiences. A film that has stood the test of time.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

I got home after midnight to find the police from the 105th precinct waiting with my Mom on my stoop...I was grounded for the next month. I got smart though...I sneaked out to see it 15-20 more times...during the day.I have most likely watched this movie more than 500-600 times over the past 25 years ( since I got my first VCR ) It never gets old to me. I can recite every line including the background characters at a moments notice. There are so many reasons why this is a great movie ( got robbed at the Oscars ), but I have a question for Mr.Spielberg?? ... The scene with "holiday roast" a. you have 20 feet of dock b. you have 25 feet of chain &amp; c. you have 25 feet ( 3 tons of 'em )of shark. Here's my ?? The man is swimming for his life ( "take my word, Charlie. Don't look back! Swim Charlie ! Swim!!" ) The dock is chasing him. To get that full torque the chain would have to be fully extended.

		<fullReview>According to his own recollection, novelist Peter Benchley stated he considered his story involving a huge shark attacking beach swimmers several years before the movie. When the book came out, Steven Spielberg first thought it would make for a good scary movie. That was before he became aware of all the technical problems involved. At one point he hated the project and anything having to do with it. To his credit, he finished the difficult film and it became a true Classic in it's own right. The actual story is based on the 1916 account of New Jersey beach goers being attacked and devoured by a real life shark. It is no surprise, when you see the film "Jaws" be prepared for some unexpected shock scenes. There are several which if you're seeing it in the dark room, at night or alone, you'll find yourself seeking company, comfort or a large weapon. To my way of thinking, it is the actors who imbue the film with such artistic reality, they cause audiences to re-consider going swimming in the ocean. Spielberg did an excellent job in finding Roy Scheider to play, land loving Police Chief Martin Brody. Robert Shaw is superb as Quint and his ' USS Indianapolis story' makes for mental horror. Youthful newcomer Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Matt Hooper, the 'professional' shark expert. Murray Hamilton plays the fiscally stubborn Mayor Larry Vaughn. Together the cast add their personal signature to this incredible film and place it on the shelves of the finest movies ever made. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A defining moment in film history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a filmmaker and you've made what turned out to be a "summer blockbuster" since the summer of 1975, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Steven Spielberg. "Jaws" is not only an amazing film in pretty much every way(OK, the shark is phony looking, but it's not like they had CGI or Stan Winston), it is the movie that redefined the way movies are marketed, not mention it raised the bar for filmmakers everywhere. "Jaws" could easily have been a mess, what with the budgetary constraints, uncooperative islanders, bad weather, untried methods and relative inexperience of it's director. It could've been remembered as one of movie history's greatest blunders, or worse, not remembered at all. Steven Spielberg, however, chose talent over star power and the power of suggestion over shock value and gave us a masterpiece, not just of horror and adventure, but of true human-factor driven movie magic. It's not the shark that makes "Jaws" great, though it serves it's purpose just fine. It's the characters. It's the knowledge that, this isn't some alien planet or time long past or yet to come. It could be anytime, anywhere, anyone(assuming that you live near the ocean). Sharks are real and the events described in "Jaws" are not at all far removed from reality(i.e. - New Jersey, 1916, the Mattewan Creek incident, Rodney Fox, Henry Bource, etc). We've seen the startling images of massive great white sharks leaping from the water at 30 mph to rend some unsuspecting seal into shreds of torn flesh and shattered bone. We've seen the scars of the survivors. Aside from that, we've all felt out of our element, up against things we don't understand and fear, just like Chief Brody. Many of us have felt the drive to fight and win, regardless of the cost to ourselves or others, like Quint. Some of us have rushed into danger, brimming with confidence and know-how, only to be defeated by something too big or powerful for our skills, like Hooper. "Jaws" is a very human tale, giant carnivorous fish aside. There is also the technical aspect of "Jaws". Verna Fields' masterful, Academy Award winning editing, cutting in all the right places to heighten the tension or magnify the emotions. There is the incredible, unforgettable and oft-imitated score by the great John Williams. His massive, pounding shark theme is forever linked, not just to sharks, but to the dread of what's beneath you, unseen, ready, waiting and hungry. Then, of course there is Spielberg himself, giving us images of naked flesh from below, unaware of the unseen beast stalking from below. Images of children playing as one of their own is torn asunder in massive jaws, no pun intended(well, maybe...). The image of that fin, cleaving water like a blade cleaves meat, moving towards a helpless victim. Spielberg waited, giving us teasing glimpses of his behemoth so that when it is fully revealed, our imaginations are already primed and giving us our own ideas of what the monster looks like. It is both a joy and a jolt when the titular beast breaks the surface before Brody, scaring at least two years off of his life. "Jaws" is a great film, pure and simple. It is funny, exciting and frightening, all at once. It is a standard by which others should be measured. I assure you, though, if you wish to stand up next to this masterpiece, you'll need a bigger boat.</fullReview>

An early performance by Richard Dreyfuss and '70s star Roy Scheider round out the cast. Steven Speilberg takes the American tradition of fun at the beach and turns it into a classic horror tale of Man vs Nature. For extra points, watch it the night before a planned outing to the shore.

		<shortDescription>A horror film I actually like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most horror films are just brutal or disgusting, with the whole movie just consisting of people being brutally attacked by the horrifying creatures. "Jaws" is an enormous exception. In this film, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) who refuses to close down a New England beach over 4th of July weekend due to a recent shark attack. After more attacks, he, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the owner of a boat (Robert Shaw) set out to destroy the shark. The shark is not even really seen for over an hour into the film, making the concept of a shark rather than the shark the source of the horror, a sense of brilliance not found in most horror movies. Also, the film revolves more around the characters and the decisions they must make to deal with the situation, which really brings about a more interesting aspect of the film. Audiences don't want a film to dwell on the horrifying objects that can't communicate; they want to expand on characters and people. That's what makes this such a great film. It's intense, a bit scary, and has little bits of humor throughout that make it fun to watch. The ending proves to be a bit too intense for me, so I don't feel it's absolutely perfect, but very close.**** out of ****</fullReview>

This is the kind of movie that Hollywood no longer makes, CAN no longer make and no longer wants to make. It's a movie with a story, devoid of any computerized special effects, depending entirely on the actors to bring the script to life. This movie is so effective that it has become an cinematic icon. The images from this movie have been incorporated into American culture. The impact of this movie on the public has been profound, enduring and unquestionable.

I would go to bed and wrap myself in my duvet (somehow that made me feel safer - the reason why now escapes me). Only one other film that i saw as a child had this effect on me and that was Alien (i could never get passed the face-hugger leaping on to John Hurt's face). Although i realise how amazing this movie is, and can still thoroughly enjoy watching it (the scene on the boat with Richard Dreyfus, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw comparing scars is pure genius), i do think that for a new audience it must appear a mystery as to why it was ever considered scary. Even its rating has been lowered for today's youth.To be honest the special effects which seemed so terrifying now look quite comical (The ending, when the shark flops on to the boat and chomps Robert shaw, looks kind of like a giant grey rubber dildo). The story and Cast stand the test of time well, but the truth is, there is nothing here to scare the modern audience.All that said, i can't think of a modern day equivalent thats even close to being as good as this was in its day.Still a classic 9/10</fullReview>

It is, in my opinion, the best film of our time.Let me illustrate this.- It is so beautifully constructed. Trimmed of all fat, it contains no superfluous love interests, no "messages", no grand statements. It merely, and masterfully, sets out to tell a riveting story of a shark that terrorizes a seaside town and their efforts to destroy it.- The script and dialogue are so rich. This film is choc-a-block with memorable scenes and quotable dialogue:"You're gonna need a bigger boat""This was no boating accident..!"The scene where Brody's son mimicks him at the dinner table."He hates the water. They have a name for it..." "Drowning""He's gone under the boat, he's gone under the boat"The head popping out of the hole in the hull."Pippet, Pippet!""Smile, you son of a..!"The USS Indianapolis speechComparing scars"I'll find him for three, I'll catch him and kill him for TEN!"I could go on for ever. I defy anyone to watch it and not find a scene that stays with them forever. It should be in the top ten. It saddens me that it appears in the lowly 130's.

Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss are excellent in the film. This was the highest grossing picture of 1975. This movie won three Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music Score and Best Sound Editing. This picture was also nominated for Best Picture.The First DVD from Universal. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong:DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound). DVD Extras are an One Hour Documentary (Which it was originally two hours on the 1995 Laserdisc), Trivia Game, Deleted Scenes and more.The Second DVD for the 30th Anniversary Edition from Universal. DVD has the same anamorphic Widescreen transfer from the previous DVD. DVD also has the DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and the original Mono soundtracks. DVD contains the original 1995 two hour documentary from the Laserdisc Edition.

The new DVD doesn't have the some of the features from the previous 2000 edition. But this new edition should keep fans of "Jaws" happy. One of Spielberg's best films. This is also one of the best popcorn movies ever made. Panavision. (*****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't alive when this film first was released. I wasn't there to witness the hysteria that followed in its wake. By the time, I was born it was already well-established in Western culture (and had spawned three atrocious sequels). Only films like Star Wars can match this movie for sheer cultural impact. Even today, over thirty years after it's original release, when people think of sharks, they think of Jaws.Perhaps much of this owes to its realistic fright factor. Jaws reached people in a way very few films have because it seemed oh-so-plausible and, more importantly, it made people wonder 'Could that happen to me?'.But let's look past the social impact of Jaws and at the film itself as a piece of entertainment/art.I sat down and watched Jaws the other day. I didn't mean to. Somebody else was watching it, I came in and decided to sit down and watch a few minutes. I stayed for the rest of the film, loving every minute. That quality- that watchability (if that is a word)- is one of the things that make Jaws great and helps it to stand out even from its illustrious brethren in the IMDb top 250.Some films, like Jaws, are fantastic. However, not all fantastic films are instantly and consistently watchable like Jaws. For example, Shawshank Redemption is a top movie but its not the sort of film you can sit down and watch at any time. Jaws is a top movie and you can sit down, watch it from start to finish and enjoy yourself no matter how many times you've seen it before.What specifically makes Jaws good then? First off, the story- a small island community heavily reliant on the tourist trade finds itself menaced by a man-eating shark. Simple but effective.The main character, Sheriff Brody (superbly played by Roy Schneider), is tasked with managing this crisis. However, he is continually hindered in his efforts by the Mayor (and other locals) who are adamant the rising body count should be no impediment to the summer trade that is their lifeblood.Eventually, Brody calls in marine biologist Matt Hooper (another great performance, this time by Richard Dreyfuss) who helps him convince the Mayor (with the help of the growing number of dead) that there is a real danger to the island in the form of a great white shark. In a bid to end Jaws' reign of terror, they hire grizzled shark hunter/fisherman Quint- a brilliant character brilliantly portrayed by, in my opinion, the standout star of this film, Robert Shaw- and together, the three go off to hunt for the eponymous villain.This triad of superb characters played by sublime actors is key to Jaws' triumph as a movie. The second half of the movie is simply these three men in a boat but with their chemistry (admittedly aided by a very strong script and good direction) who needs breathtaking scenery, romance, mind-blowing special effects (though I have no qualms with what is essentially a prop, I know people think the shark looks crap) and the like? I think the proof of the pudding- and perhaps one of my favourite scenes in all of cinematic history- is the scene where the three heroes are comparing scars. I have two reasons for saying this.One, it shows the growing bond of respect between the two seamen in Quint and Hooper who, despite their differing methods and upbringings, find common ground and good laughs in the wounds they have suffered in their travels. At the same time, poor old landlubber and mild mannered Brody only has his appendix scar to reflect on- which is masterfully shown in a subtle piece of acting/directing.Two, I think that Quint's 'Indiannapolis' speech is the best I have ever seen. Robert Shaw's impeccable delivery (plus the reaction of his allies)and the script itself help make this moment my favourite in the entire film. It's worth buying the DVD for this scene alone- believe me.I've eaten up a lot of words with my worship of the characters and that particular scene but don't go thinking that's all there is to this film. There are other great elements- there's plenty of action, adventure and thrills and spills. The only thing that's missing is a needlessly tacked on romance- yay! As for themes and messages, Jaws has plenty of them too. You have man's struggle against nature, the value of money over life, Quint's Ahab-esquire obsession with gaining revenge for his fallen comrades and even the 'ever present in every Spielberg film' sub-story involving fatherhood.As you may have guessed, I can't rate this film highly enough. If you've never seen it, you are missing out. Pure gold- 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply the greatest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is the greatest movie ever made, but what do you expect from the greatest director to ever sit behind a camera. Jaws should have won best picture and Spielberg should have won best director because Jaws was better than any other movie made in 1975 by miles and than any other movie EVER made. In my opinion Spielberg should have won several Oscar's before he finally won it in 1993 for Schindler's list. ET should have won best picture and director and close encounters should have won some major Oscar's too. Also Indiana Jones and raiders of the lost ark and last crusade were better than any movie made the same year they were made, so he deserved some more credit than he got for those. Jaws has everything you need. It has three brilliant actors who do an excellent job, especially Robert Shaw, its scary, jumpy, tense, funny , edge of seat excitement, and believe me once you see it you will never feel the same going into the water again, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time classic, still frightening viewers 30 years on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie began it all. It is a pinnacle benchmark for other movies to come. It launched Steven Spielberg's career, terrified audiences around the world with amazing acting, a pounding musical score and most of all unbearable suspense. Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), lives on Amity island and is living a rather relaxed life as chief of police. But all of a sudden, a killer shark invades the waters of Amity and its up to Brody to stop the predator. Richard Dreyfuss plays Matt Hooper, a marine biologist and Robert Shaw sea experienced fisherman Quint. It still carries all the power it did back then in 1975 and i seriously do recommend you seeing this if you haven't, and if you have, watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, 33 years later, I've seen the movie that reminded us to not go in the water...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a movie for the ages. It's an example of what happens when the right people come together for the right reasons, for the right movie.Firstly, author Peter Benchley co-wrote the screenplay (the screenplay itself is adapted from his own novel of the same name) that became one of the new, classic scary-stories of our time: a huge great white shark is terrorizing the residents of a small New England beach community. Amity Police Chief Brody (the recently departed Roy Scheider), marine expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and grizzled shark hunter Quint (the late Robert Shaw) are the heroic three who volunteer to have a climatic showdown with this man-eating menace appropriate described as mother nature's ultimate killing machine.I should make it clear that for years I was never one of this movie's biggest fans. So I just kind of avoided it - the theme just didn't appeal to me, since I've never been afraid to go swimming at the beach. But guess what? "Jaws" is the classic adventure-horror of our times, and I am now amongst one of its many, many fans. A lot of things are classic about this movie - it's pointless to even describe them here.Also, I'm sure there are a number of scientific inaccuracies about the true nature of sharks (the recently departed shark hunter who inspired "Quint" always said he felt sorry for the shark in this movie) and whether or not they are truly something to fear - but, you know what? - it's Hollywood, they always win. And I'm also sure that the liberties with sharks were liberties well-taken for the sake of dramatic potential: This movie did its job in scaring the living daylights out of a lot of people.Most importantly, other than serving up great scares, suspense and adventure, "Jaws" is responsible for starting the career of Hollywood director Steven Spielberg. "Jaws" was his claim to fame; it's also the movie credited for starting the summer blockbuster phenomenon (this currently ranks pretty high amongst one of the highest-grossing movies of all time), and spawning three sequels and countless imitators. Spielberg would go on to do great things in his career, long after "Jaws," and he still continues to do great things to do this day because of this movie. It's probably one of my favorite movies of his and one of my favorite movies of all time."Jaws" is a movie not likely to ever go away any time soon. That is part of its appeal: its ability to remain an important piece of cinema and a pop culture phenomenon that continues to genuinely frighten us even 33 years after its release. And that is also the mark of a truly great film. It's a powerful example of what film-making can really do when the right people are involved in the right movie, for the right reasons.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is one of the best films ever made and probably one of the greates blockbusters also. The dialouge for this movie is excellent and my favorite actor in this film, Robert Shaw, is so memorable and timeless. The shark scenes were so creepy and brilliant it just can't ever be missed. The scariest scene throughout the whole film is the scene where they go scuba diving and see a man's head that pops out from a fisherman boat. That was totally freaky and got me goosebumps. There were no flaws in this movie except some corny acting but still it was 1975 film and the 70's films have the best movies anyways. I highly recommend this film if your a big shark fan. Also keep out of waters!Hedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Love to prove that wouldn't you? Get your picture in the National Geographic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to start my review of "Jaws" is to just get right to it and say that this film is one of the greatest movies ever made. I love this movie, and that is that. Located somewhere in the northeast, the fictional town of Amity is run by a bureaucratic city council that has tunnel vision with nothing but the bottom line of dollars and cents in mind. The deputy is lost in his mind and the sheriff is one Martin Brody, a man who hates the water but lives on an island. "It's only an island if you look at it from a boat" Brody says. Amity also has a shark problem. A 25 ft long Great White shark has just staked a claim off the coastal waters of the island, and the shark has decided to feed on hapless beach goers.Sheriff Brody wants to shut the beaches down until the matter can be resolved with the proper shark experts, but the mayor and city council fear that shutting the beaches down will impact the vital summer tourist economy of Amity. It doesn't matter how many people get devoured by the shark, the people in charge don't want to lose their summer dollars. The beaches must remain open and Brody is in a constant volleying act between the suits that run Amity and the shark itself. This film is what I consider to be one of the first "modern" movies. It was made in 1975 and it simply feels much more modern then anything that came before it. Filled with one liners, this is an action movie that predates the current action flick genre. The plot is fantastic and the acting is excellent. But not only did this film have a well oiled story that was tightly directed, and an esteemed cast of actors, but the film had such a profound impact on pop culture that will be timeless. Jaws is loaded with quotable fun lines that resonates and stays with you: "You yell barracuda and everyone says 'hunh, what'?. You yell SHARK, and we got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July"."We're gonna need a bigger boat"."That's one bad hat Harry"."I don't think you're going to understand this problem until it swims up and bites you in the ASS!" The line I quoted for my summary heading is probably my favorite, just because it adds insight into the mentality of the sleaze bag mayor of Amity. Mayor Vaughn is out to protect the financial interests of his town and he views the brash young oceanographer Matt Hooper as someone who has arrived in Amity with nothing but his own rich boy interests working for him . Hooper couldn't possibly be here to do anything but lobby himself for a possible National Graphic cover could he? The notion that Hooper would want to help Brody protect the people of Amity doesn't even seem to cross Vaugh's mind. No Hooper must be here to be a glory hound and nothing else. Such is the mindset of the bureaucrats that run Amity. The mechanical shark in Jaws (nickamed "Bruce") reportedly would not work very well for director Steven Spielberg, subsequently Spielberg resorted to point of view shots to achieve the terror he desired. This was an inspired piece of genius, far better then actually seeing the shark. The shark later is represented by an assortment of different floating objects, from dock piers, yellow keg barrels, and of course it's own dorsal tail fin. We don't always see the animal, but we are convinced it is there. When we finally do see the shark towards the end of the picture, it doesn't matter that it looks fake as hell, it's real within the context of the movie and that's all that matters. Probably the aspect of this film is bringing together three different characters to take part in the journey of man vs. nature. Brody is the level headed family man, Hooper is the intellectual college grad, and Quint is the gruff old seamen with his own vendetta against sharks. Perhaps the single best moment of the movie is near the end when the shark has 3 barrels attached to him but still won't drown, the engine of the ship is burnt out and Quint calmly comes out and throws a couple of life preservers to Brody and Hooper. Quint however does not put HIS life preserver on (because of his own creepy tale with sharks). Quint knows very well what sharks can do to a man and this moment all 3 men realize the ship is sinking and they are running out of options. Just a fantastically shot and brilliantly acted moment. I was born on July 3rd of the year this film was released, and every 4th of July it has become a habit of mine to watch this film. Watch this film, and don't hold the mechanical shark against it, I promise you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It left a generation of schoolkids afraid to go into a swimming pool, let alone back into the water. Wunderkind Spielberg's story is all the scarier for hardly ever showing the Great White that is most of the characters' nemesis Spielberg was still in his twenties when he signed up to direct the shark movie that would transform his career - and Hollywood itself. The production was notoriously chaotic yet, with the help of a major marketing campaign, Jaws became the biggest box office success ever, until the release of Star Wars the next year. The cast is top-notch. Scheider is police chief Brody, a hydrophobe taking up his new posting on Amity Island off America's East Coast. His buddies in battling the killer fish are rich-kid ichthyologist Hooper (Dreyfuss) and maverick fisherman Quint (Shaw). The film has political undertones - it is marked by a post-Watergate distrust of authority - but also owes a debt in its theme of self and mutual reliance to those twin classic 50s westerns of contrasting political colours: High Noon and Rio Bravo.John William's great and justly revered score is instantly evocative of the film and its power to terrify, and there are several stand-out shock moments and wonderfully sustained suspense scenes. But the film's real master stroke - keeping the monster unseen for as long as possible - was, ironically, forced on the production by the refusal of the various mechanical sharks to function on demand.</fullReview>

Great acting by all involved, well filmed as well - plenty of action to watch on the screen and not just with the shark attacks - lots of character interactions that fun and sometimes intense to watch. The story is good as well - for a horror movie it's really good.I still enjoy watching this movie - I remember it from my childhood so it's a part of my growing years of watching movies.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's original blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the fictional New England resort island of Amity tourism is the main industry and each summer the beaches are backed with people hoping to swim in its beautiful waters? the last thing the authorities want is news that a shark has killed somebody. When I girl disappears at sea it is first assumed she just drowned but when her body is found the Island's new Police Chief, Martin Brody, wants to close the beaches but the mayor is determined to keep them open and pressures the local doctor to certify that she was killed by a boat? a second death, just off a crowded beach, causes a major panic and the mother of the victim offers a three thousand dollar reward to whoever catches the shark. This attracts everybody with a boat but doesn't impress local fisherman Quint, who demands $10,000, or shark expert Matt Hooper, who Brody invited to the island. After further deaths Brody, Quint and Hooper set of in Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt down the great white shark that has been terrorising the island. Once they find the shark it becomes clear that catching it will not be easy.This iconic film has certainly stood the test of time and is as gripping as ever. The story is relatively simple without any real twists and that is one of its strengths. It is very much a film of two halves; the first land based as Brody tries to get the town authorities to take the shark seriously and the second out at sea as Brody, Quint and Hooper hunt down the shark. These three, brilliantly played by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss respectively, are great characters and the scenes between then on the boat are a delight; sometimes tense, sometimes funny and, when Quint tells the story of what happened when the USS Indianapolis was sunk positively chilling. The shark effects are pretty impressive, only in the final scenes does in took a bit rubbery; of course it helps that we aren't shown too much of the shark early on. The music, by John Williams, is great? not just the famous 'shark theme' but also the other music. There are plenty of scary moments throughout the film; some at least as frightening as horror films largely because of its familiar setting and the fact that even though shark attacks are rare we all know that they do occasionally happen. Overall this is a great film that can be enjoyed by most people? if you don't mind a few scares. It is a must see for anybody who enjoys classic movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have no buttons on my shirt anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 9 or 10 when I saw this movie for the first time. My mom wouldn't take me to it at the theater. She said it was to scary for me at the time. Good parenting. I believe it was 1977 or 1978 Jaws was on HBO and my parents where going out to dinner. My neighbor Dwight came over to watch. When they got home a few hours later they found 2 terrified young boys. I think I pooped my pants and had bitten off every button on my shirt from pure fear. I never have been that scared my entire life.Now I am older, but still love this movie. I know the shark kinda looks dumb with today's computer special effects. But it looked plenty real enough to a 9 year old with no buttons on his shirt.The movie was an introduction to Spielberg. It had great acting, storytelling, character development and was brilliantly directed and written. The thing we expect from him, and why I love most of his movies. My favorite scene of all time is when they are below deck and telling their scar stories, and Quinn wins with his USS Indy story. He was so horrifying telling that.I still see my friend Dwight from time to time. Over a beer we still talk about the night we watched JAWS. He gives me hell today for biting off all my buttons. But this movie was more to me then that, it piqued my intelligence. How many movies can say that. Now I got a masters in History and love studying about WWII. I love shark week on the discovery channel. The best week of TV every year. I wish I would have taken up marine biology, but hard when you live in Wisconsin.Great movies spark emotion. JAWS brought me to the most scariest place I have ever been. JAWS brought out pure fear in me. A great emotion. But it also molded me and my interests. How many movies have done that for you? This is why JAWS is my favorite movie of all time. And why i watch it every chance I see it on. A 10 for me is too low of a score. I give it a 20.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action films simply do not compare to movies like this. Jaws is subtle, clever and at times hilarious, and unlike most blockbusters does not rely on special effects and trifling acts of sensationalism to sell. The film is about a killer shark, but for the first half of the film we do not see her - this is what makes the film great - we are able instead to concentrate on the way humans react to this unseen force. The scheming town mayor is an accurate satire on the self-important local busy-body who thinks only of the financial ruin the shark could cause. Don't miss the on going duels between the rich college boy Hooper and the working class hero Quint - it is here where some of the best dialogue appears. The first half of the film is so good one almost forgets about the shark as a physical entity, more of an abstract notion which is only conceived by the way the islanders behave. The second half is where all the action happens as far as seeing the shark up close and personal.Excellent performances from the three leads (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss) guide us from a powerful beginning through to an adrenaline rush climax. Its not surprising to note that Spielberg's favorite scene from the film is not an effects moment nor an adrenaline rush sequence but a character scene as Quint (Shaw) talks about the USS Indianapolis incident. This scene, among others elevates the film to a height seldom equalled in other films. The claustrophobic isolation of Quint's creaky fishing boat sets the scene for a final stand off between man and man-eater. The three make an ill-fitting team and it's clear from the outset who's going to come off worse. When the final pay-off comes, it's every bit the result of two hours of carefully racked-up tension, and enough to leave the viewer heaving a sigh of relief when it's over.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feedback for The Jaws(1975)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always rejoiced watching the movie The Jaws (1975). It is very nerve wracking to watch The Jaws. I appreciate the work done. Every minute catches the eyes of the production that something is going to happen. Truly touched my nerves, and sometimes I was in tears. The direction is stupendous. The Jaws as the name implies, a thriller can't supersede any Shark movie. I marveled at the glimpse of the way the shark attacks it's prey. The predator reminds me of the food chain. The food chain is significant because the shark feeds on human beings. It leaves the spectator heart-broken and maybe in tears. However, then the conscious reminds us that the big fish will feed on it's inferior. This is yet another symbol that the superior will dominate over the inferior and no matter what has been said that showing others as inferior is only for the cowards, juxtaposes many beliefs. Hence, in reality the superior is really a superior. The vicious circle that the stronger will hunt for the weaker continues. I am humbled to write a review for the movie. It is honorable to be a part of the review for The Jaws (1975). I have rated it ten on ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and gentlemen, INTRODUCING... Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>by no means a light-hearted family bonding movie of survival however. It's an outright claw and scramble your way to safety, every man for yourself - I guess we have to work together now bloodbath. This ride gets down to brass tacks right away. No build up. You are off on the first hill full speed ahead."Jaws". humph. Jaws. Wrong title for this movie. The name of this film should be "Mayor Larry Vaughn the B!@#$%d". To me - what's the shark? The pinnacle of natural organic breeding that happened to spawn one of the biggest sharks on the planet. That's like anthropomorphizing a volcano and calling the film "Lava Hands". That mayor single-handedly murdered at least 5 poor innocent folks just to keep his little tourist town revenue stream up. But, like real life - I don't see jails for the likes of this guy. Sadly - in the end - we don't see him out on the boat, taking up arms, and dying trying to right things in the progress. Classic. Now that's real! Now, you would think these kinds of plot devices and over all story arc to not be a Spielberg trope or standby, odd - well, that's because this movie is actually based on a popular book released barely over a year prior; and after Steve processed it, add an timeless Mr. Williams - and bam. It's an instant classic movie.The pacing in this film overall, and dating still stands up well to time. It has believable characters, the actors mesh well, and it has far more than it's share of horror aspects cemented in place. Horror? This is a horror movie? Oh, bet your ass it is - when you think about it, it's actually worse. This damn thing could be out there right now, stalking swimmers - ready to "swallow whole" the next hapless poor soul. It's a 25+', 3 ton, hunting, stalking, never-sleeping, murder machine.. and you cant see it until it's right up on ya. Oh, and by the way, bullets loose their kinetic energy after less feet in water than you realize. So good luck.What's best overall about this film? IT IS PG. No kidding. This film had more gore than half the rated R horror films in the last 15 years, and it has legs, arms shooting off. It has people being eaten alive, bitten in half, and desperation at ridiculously stressful moments. It has FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. But - no swearing. Thank god! This might just be something you couldn't show at church. That's something I forget to mention about yesterday's film, Poltergeist... another Spielberg film - PG. No kidding there - faces ripped off, parents smoking pot with kids in the house, mom getting raped by a entity... but no swearing. Whew! This film, a first in it's series is a classic Hollywood example of starting a franchise after a clear ending - simply due to the overwhelming success. While it's not the first killer "believable" animal horror film, it's definitely one of the earliest that comes to mind in your average horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fate's a funny thing. Originally 'Jaws' was going to reveal much more of its sharp-toothed predator, front and center, rather than lurking in the murky depths. Quite by accident, the slightly heavier than expected shark prop remained submerged beneath the surface instead of bobbing along on the waves, snapping for all to see. As a result, this honest mistake turned what could have been a shlocky creature feature into a nail-biting Hitchcockian thriller, as a Great White stalks the small seaside community of Amity. In fact, many of its greatest cinematic moments are born from the unseen menace - mostly represented by the yellow barrels tethered to the shark and floating ominously in the ocean, which become much scarier than any '70s-era model or CGI shark that could be conjured up.Throw in a few jump-out-of-your-seat shocks and a creeping sense of paranoia throughout, courtesy of Harry's bad hat and the iconic dun-DUN-dun-DUN-dun- dun-dun-dun music of John Williams, and you have a recipe for suspense - and success. As the highest grossing film of its time, 'Jaws' put Spielberg on the map, capturing sterling performances by Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw as the shark-hunter, Quint. Unforgettably, Quint's epic monologue about the USS Indianapolis stands out in memory as a classic scene in film history - both haunting and entrancing, installing a lingering feeling of dread as we await the final confrontation with our finned antagonist. And if you like your dialogue pithier, then just wait for Sheriff Brody's snappy yet equally memorable one-liner at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws - A Film Ahead of its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Jaws is certainly unlike any film I have seen before. Though I have seen it before viewing it in this class, it was a refresher on how ahead of its time it really was. With everything from the special effects to the sound effects to the believable props, it convinces the audience they should be on the lookout for sharks the next time they are in the ocean (even though it rarely happens in real life). Though this film is classified as adventure, drama, and thriller, I think it should be classified as more of a thriller than anything else. I say this purely because of the scenes where people are swimming in the ocean and have no idea there is a shark creeping up on them. This causes the audience to feel "thrilled" and scared for the victim but they cannot do anything about it. These scenes kind of reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Even though the plots are completely different, both films portray the fact that the worst things can happen to us when we are most vulnerable. Whether it is in the shower, when we are sleeping, or trying to enjoy vacation, these films make some of us afraid to go through with every day tasks even though we should not be. Aside from the plot, I am impressed with how the film took off. For example, I cannot imagine going to a public pool and not hearing a kid sneak up on his/her friend while humming the Jaws "first victim" tune. To this day, people are still making Jaws references and that truly shows how big of an impact it made on history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you hear the name Steven Spielberg, a few excellent films come to mind: Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, and last but most definitely not least Jaws. Jaws has been captivating audiences since it's release in 1975, the film has survived the test of time for a few reasons; for instance the structure of a strong cast. The film is lead by Roy Scheider who does a spectacular job of telling the story of lead character Chief Martin Brody, he is able to use his emotion in the film to tell the audience that there is more than what meets the eye of Chief Brody. The other shining light acting wise in this film is the star Richard Dreyfuss and his portrayal of Matt Hooper; Dreyfuss truly establishes himself as a top tier actor in this film even though it isn't a film where he has the lead role. Dreyfuss exhibits something that is truly difficult to show, and that is believable body language throughout the film, which is what separates high-caliber acting from just average acting. The acting itself isn't the only thing to carry this film into greatness, the score of this film is what truly brings this film into fruition. The score by John Williams is iconic in a way itself.The score for Jaws is a score that will live on in film history as it is the perfect culmination of story telling and emotion inducing. Everyone recognizes the suspenseful music that goes on throughout the film, and it tells two stories one of the story of the main character, the Shark, and then one of the victims; it portrays the shark as an unstoppable force and it creates an atmosphere which is overpowering to us humans that aren't so relentless. What makes this film truly stand out is the subject manner in the film. Jaws brings out the wrath of one of mother nature's children and causes the fear that is generated from this film to be real; it does something many films have tried to do and some films are still trying to do and it creates a real fear using real-world monsters. Jaws is and will continue to be a contributing factor in the history of film for all these reasons and solidifies the thriller genre as a very important one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I can do anything I want, I am the Chief of police." Says Chief Brody on the shark terror running through his town. An instant classic directed by Steven Spielberg in 1975 engaging everyone that watches this film. This film exhibits teamwork, conflict, and greed, which really sets the stage for, films in the future. Starting with two people that were asking themselves this very question of ethics or money? Two very popular things that are still going on in today's world. Almost every decision in business today revolves around that and we saw the Chief want to look out for the betterment of the people whereas his counterpart the mayor was concerned with money and greed. It leaves the audience to pick a side, which many of us do throughout the film and stick to it. We root for one or the other and hope their way goes right. Spielberg, keeps the audience guessing until the very end, while the events are unfolding we do not know until the end how this story will play out is the mark of a good film. In many of today's films we see the men vs. nature conflict- this is one of the films that broke into the scene and really hit a home run with it. Almost every major film deals with a monster, animal, or some creature and this is a true Dave vs. Goliath story. When it comes to Jaws vs. Chief Brody's team it is an instant thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes Jaws a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" is such a great classic for many reasons. It is more than just a an over dramatized shark film, it has substance and cinematic elements that make it a truly great and lasting classic. What makes "Jaws" so engaging is the fact that it is packed full of suspense.The film starts off strong with it's opening scene and first attack. The audience already knows something bad is going to happen to the skinny dipping woman due to the film's initial focus, however, the most wonderful part of it all is that the shark is not shown at all in this scene. The feeling of suspense was solely gained from the terrifying silence, the vast openness of the dark ocean, and the incredibly vulnerable shots of the girls legs dangling from underneath the water. The fact that the monster is not shown right away builds suspense in the film to such a high level, providing a fear of the unknown that affects the viewers for much of the film. Another huge factor of Jaws that provides suspense is the theme song. Each scene that shark was in the theme song was also present, which forces the viewers to correlate the song with danger. The song itself builds up by starting slower and increasing in speed, which creates a sense of suspense along with the other elements within a given scene. Overall, Jaws is such a classic film due to its innovation in the creation of suspense in film. Spielberg did an amazing job creating suspense for the viewers through several elements including sound and visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTJaws is a great movie for its time. Stephen Spielberg builds suspense in a way like no other. Given the tile of the movie and trailers you pretty much know what the movie is about. In the beginning of the movie there is an underscore of suspenseful music and underwater shots that move threw people's legs as they are swimming in the ocean implying that there is shark coming to attack, though the shark is never revealed. Not only does the music build suspense but not revealing the shark does as well. There are two incidences where the shark attacks but is not seen. That keep the audience on their toes wanting to see the shark making the reveal of the shark epic. The music isn't the only thing that built up the suspense. The use of shot reverse shot between the chief and the ocean made you worry that shark was going to strike again. Also, in the second half of the movie, where the tree guys were hunting the shark, silence and the openness of the big ocean and the one boat was the key to the suspense of the film. The audience knows the shark would show up but not when because of the silence. This movie also shows character development. The chief for example hated the water in the beginning of the movie but is the one to defeat the shark in the end. After being on the boat together for a while, the three guys developed a relationship. Hooper and Broddy already had a friendship going, but weren't too fond of Quint. It was nice to see the relationship and trust eventually grow over time. This suspenseful movie is fun to watch not just because it keeps the audience on their toes, but because of the beauty of the beach and water and the great special effects of the shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar yet different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's 1975 film, Jaws, became an instant classic. The movie's graceful yet powerful way of dancing between the boundaries of horror, thriller, and action are what make the film so impactive, even 40 years later. Contrary to most horror films that introduce us to dark dimensions of supernatural creatures and apocalyptic worlds, Jaws, draws us deeper into the frightening reality of everyday life. The killer shark in Jaws is both similar and different than most other horror monsters. Unlike demonic spirits and infected zombies, the monster in Jaws is much more realistic and believable. The film's ever present lurking threat is what gives the film that familiar sense of eerie that conventionalizes it as a horror film, while it's elements of ordinary set it apart. The film's endearing characteristics of an average American man trying to keep his children and community safe contrast against the frighteningly dark realities of what lies beneath the water; the idea that what we cannot control is what often haunts us. Spielberg's use of camera, often switching between shots of chaotic waves and peaceful beach houses, offers a perfectly pieced view of destructiveness versus safety. The everyday terror of the film is transcended through those shots of opposing forces, recreating the familiar fear that danger can exist even in the most beautiful places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Blend of Cinema and Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1975, is considered a Hollywood classic that transcends generations of movie lovers. From the film's dynamic soundtrack to the blood-tinged beach, Jaws set the standard for shark thrillers and created a genre that recognized the appeal of this predator bound to the ocean. The soundtrack alone is recognized within two notes. When John Williams created the iconic score, it set hearts pounding and determined the arrival of the man-eating Great White. The audience sees themselves in Chief Brody, a man who strives to protect his family, his community, and the unsuspecting public from the predatory shark lurking in the shallows. Spielberg allows the audience to experience the turmoil in Brody's mind as he faces opposition from city council members. We feel Brody's terror with each shark attack and how powerless he feels against it. We sense his desperation as he hires Quint, the strange fisherman with a tragic past, to slay the beast ravaging the island. As Brody sets aside his fear of the ocean, the audience joins his quest to comb the ocean for the killer with a determination that has us on the edge of our seats. With every close call, near miss, and shot fired, the audience is drawn deeper and deeper into the hunt for Jaws. From the opening credits, Williams builds our suspense with each note, as Spielberg constructs each shot to create a seamless narrative and a cinematic experience that is not easily forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very happy accident in the shape of a killer shark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is a happy accident. For what must have been a hellish production, Spielberg's first box office megahit came together in spite of itself. Here was a movie that by all accounts should have been a disaster. It was based on a clunky, overwritten pulp novel; the plot was thin; it was being directed by a young film director best known for a TV movie; It starred a broken mechanical shark that had so much downtime that it only appears on the screen for ten minutes.Jaws did best by what it did least. Spielberg became a master in allowing our emotions and our imaginations to meet the movie halfway, and that inspiration was born out of the fact that for much of the movie we never see the shark. If we did, we'd grow tired of seeing it and the urgency of the story wouldn't be so strong. Much of what we see of the shark comes from other points of view. The opening scene, featuring a shark attack of a young woman, never shows the shark but it exists in our brains. And yet, we aren't on the shore, we're in the water with this girl as if we're swimming a few feet away. That's the power of this movie. Later, when Alex Kintner is killed, we see blood, we see the raft, and we see the attack out on the horizon behind the other swimmers. Was that a tail? Was that the shark? Was it the kid? What's happening? This movie works best on our expectations.One of my favorite shots takes place in the middle of the film, during the fourth of July holiday when the local sheriff has tried to warn the county officials that opening the beaches for the holiday is likely to be a disaster. It is. A man in a boat is killed while the sheriff's son is injured. The boy is unconscious and is dragged ashore by some other swimmers. The way the moment is shot, the camera follows and for just a split second we aren't sure if the kid still has feet or if they've been bitten off.Those kinds of visual tricks create moments that intrigue us. If we saw the attacks, if we were present, the movie would lose us. Those are the tricks that kept the audience coming back over and over.There is a lot of downtime in Jaws away from the shark. How many shark attacks can we handle in two hours? That time is filled with the human characters that fit the situation like a glove. We meet Brody (Roy Scheider) a city boy, a new sheriff in Martha's Vinyard whose come up from New York and hates the water. We meet an Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a wealthy know-it-all who knows sharks inside and out both from his passion and from books. We meet the town's mayor whose understandable denial of the situation is born on the fact that the town needs revenue from the tourists. There's Brody's wife, every bit her husband's equal, a woman who cares about her husband and children but is more than just a token wife. I treasure the moment when they're alone and she casually flirts with her husband: "Wanna get drunk and fool around?" Even the smaller roles seem to have meat on them. This is one of those great movies, like The Godfather, in which the supporting players and the extras seem to have been cast because of their memorable faces. They don't seem like actors, they seem like real people who just wandered in front of the camera.And then there's Quint, played in a magnificent performance by the late Robert Shaw as a latter-day Captain Ahab, whose beef with the shark is decades old and laid out in an intricate story so mesmerizing that we hang on his every word. He escaped a shark attack years ago, but many of his Navy buddies did not. Now, he wants a shark this shark and he's ready to wreck his own boat to get it. We see him with fire in his eyes, running his boat to the extreme and even smashing the radio to keep Brody from called in "a bigger boat." He's really what drives the movie's third act, running on a pulverizing blind obsession that eventually consumes him.Without human interaction Jaws would fall on its face. This could have been just a monster movie whose only destination might have been late night television. Shark attack stories are hard to tell. How many shark movies have been a success before or after Jaws? Even the sequels decline sharply in quality after this (none involved Spielberg). Jaws 2 was entertaining but basically unnecessary. Jaws 3D was a silly excuse for 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge? . . . . ick! To experience the film now, four decades later, is to understand how movies have changed, and what changes Jaws created. Along with Star Wars two years later, it would forever turn the industry on its head. After the new breed of young directors took over Hollywood in the late 60s, the movies were a times of dark subject matter and filmmaking on a personal level. This was the era of personal filmmaking from which emerged talents like Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen and of course, Spielberg himself. Jaws and Star Wars put that era to bed.Spielberg's filmography is a tapestry of some of the greatest works of popular American culture from the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. The enduring legacy of Jaws was created, as I said, as the result of a very happy accident that came in the shape of a killer shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New age horror film, bleeds fear throughout audience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is a known name in the film industry, though it wasn't until after 1975 and the release of Jaws, was he a house-hold name. The intensity of the film is kept up through the entire length, until the very end. The homely town of Amity, which means friendship, is a summer town that survives off the tourists who come and enjoy their beautiful beaches until late September. To create such a horrific film, the director had to establish great exposition for the story, and the homelier the family, the better. Mr. and Mrs. Sheriff Brody, and their two boys are new to town, helping celebrate their first summer in such an attractive area. Establishing the main characters are outsiders, helps the audience understand the severity of the attacks and the danger that can come from not acting sensibly during this high- traffic season. The mystery of the shark is what keeps the senses high, even the shark expert is astounded at the discovery. Spielberg's use of open space, and overcrowding shows the chaos thoroughly through the film. The crowded beaches, give a sense of entrapment, while the open water gives a space for the unknown to strike fear within the citizens of Amity. Each characters plays an important role, the supportive wife of the Sheriff who is only doing his job, but trying to save as many as he can. The role of the mayor is important, because of his defiance, but near the end, he realizes his kids play on those beaches too, leading to a change of heart. Hooper's intelligence on the subject leads him to be one of the most reliable characters, spouting facts and threats, left and right. His certainty and his own fear creates the atmosphere Spielberg's audience is waiting for. This film is a masterpiece before, and after it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies of all time, Steven Spielberg has created another masterpiece with his terrifying ocean thriller, Jaws. Scary and tense throughout the entire movie, this is how a true horror movie should be. The movie builds up its villain perfectly without throwing all of its cards on the table too early, which then makes the reveal so much more harrowing and intense. Spielberg takes a great, if not potentially real, storyline and spins it in a way that makes his characters shine just as much as the shark itself. The characters are strong &amp; memorable, and add excitement to each scene as we watch them bond together while hunting the maneater. Jaws is so effective that it actually has sparked real life fear in the hearts of millions who are now overly cautious about going into the open water. You know when a movie has the ability to strike actual fear into people's lives, that the movie itself is something special, Jaws is no different. Jaws is one of the greatest movies of all time, from its fantastic acting to a terrifying theme song, this is a movie for the ages!A Must See!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and Iconic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws, now an iconic American film, was a film built around the premise of suspense. Why was the film so successful? What separated this film from other scary movies from the 70's &amp; why are we still talking about it in 2016? To begin with, the soundtrack of the film utilizes an escalating trombone to instill tense, dramatic, and suspenseful moments in the film and counter it with silence, another tool of suspense, to build to those moments through emotion before the action starts. Throughout the film they utilize the technique of matching eye lines across cuts to form continuity and the illusion that these two separate images are looking into each other's eyes. Most notably this is seen in the opening scene with the kids on the beach. The guy is in one cut looking to the right, in the next cut the girl is looking to the left of the screen. This implies eye contact between these two characters, a method used commonly in film making nowadays. Lighting was also used effectively for continuity purposes in Jaws, using the angle of light to indicate that people are in different sides of the room in different shots, primarily in the cabin of the ship at night when the men are out hunting the shark. In fact, certain shots of individuals faces make this movie stand out because of the effect they have. In one of the first few scenes with the character of Brody the camera moves with Brody as he walks through crowds of people along the dock. We're following him because he is the main character, &amp; the use of the camera like this shows the audience this in a subtle way. Close ups of people's faces can also do a number of things as are shown in this film. They can make you wonder what the character is thinking and bring you inside their head, or they can bring you, the viewer into the scene, creating a feeling of intensity or shock. Intensity is created when close shots are taken in the water during the shark attacks bringing you into the moment. Shock is found in the close up of the woman's face staring straight at the camera when she sees a fin in the water. Because of the close up, as a viewer, you can relate to her emotions and feel the shock for yourself. In one of the many beach scenes close ups and wide range shots are used to show our main character Brody viewing the water beyond the people who are close in the shot. A quick zoom occurs on Brody's face when he sees the shark, giving us a similar sense of realization as we watch. Techniques like this bring us viewers into the story and make it relevant to our own lives because we can relate to the emotions we are feeling on screen. Close ups aren't the only thing that make Jaws an effective and timeless film. As I had previously mentioned, lighting plays a role as well. Silhouettes and shadows lend an eerie and otherworldly, even dangerous, quality to the scenes. You're never shown everything. Shots were taken from beneath the surface of the water up at swimmers implying the perspective of a sea creature. These shots add to the suspenseful element because paired with the soundtrack of the film you start suspecting that something will come from that depth you are looking at the swimmer from. The same techniques are used in slasher movies when the camera approaches the unsuspecting victim from behind. You don't see the attacker but you know they are there. When the lights flicker and go out in the cabin of the boat near the end of the film the scene then cuts to low lit silhouettes bringing the story from the somewhat lighthearted sense of camaraderie with the men singing together to the dark realization that a shark is hunting them down (and vice versa). The shark itself is mostly portrayed through things being pulled through the water. The ominous presence of the shark can be attributed to the fact that the shark itself is not seen (at least not fully) for a large portion of the film. Its movement is implied through the dragging of these objects. The viewer doesn't need to see the shark to know it is there. When the line on the fishing boat starts being pulled, little by little, you know the shark is responsible and that something in the scene is about to happen. There is so much to discuss about Jaws and why it stands out, the scene of the nails on the chalkboard disturbing chaos and making even the audience uncomfortable, the boat setting out through the image of shark jaws to remind you what they are setting out to, or even how Hooper and Brody's reaching shore in the closing scene imply a happy ending, because honestly Jaws is filled with so many scenes and well used techniques to warrant its recognition. It is suspenseful and daring, as well as comical and overall entertaining. The film brings you in as a viewer to feel a part of the story, as any great film should be able to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is directed by Steven Spielberg, has a screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, is based on the novel by Peter Benchley, has music by John Williams and stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton.The peace and beauty of Amity Island is shattered when the remains of a young woman are found washed up on the beach. An examination of her injuries show that she was killed in a shark attack.Police Chief Martin Brody(Roy Scheider)wants to close the beaches and order the public not to swim in the ocean. The Mayor (Murray Hamilton)can only think about the money the town won't get from their summer visitors if the beach is closed. He insists there is no problem and the beaches remain open. After several more people are killed Brody and shark expert Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)hire local fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw)to take them to sea, find the shark and kill it.The first half of the film is a horror, it contains some of the scariest and chilling scenes you'll ever see, especially the estuary attack and the opening scene. The second half is a thriller and considering the horrific content is actually very funny in places because of the banter and rivalry between Quint and Hooper. The three men bond and are completely committed to catching the shark and killing it. There are similarities in this section with Moby Dick, Quint is obsessed to the point of madness with catching this shark, his Indianapolis speech hints at his hidden trauma, he is afraid of sharks because of that incident and that is why he hunts them.The film keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and is scary and suspenseful. John Williams score is chilling and the entire cast are excellent especially Shaw, his Indianapolis monologue is a scene that is just as powerful and haunting the one hundredth time you see it as it was the first time, one of his very best performances.The shark attacks are terrifying and creepy because less is more, we don't see the shark apart from brief glimpses which allows us to imagine how big it is and how it's attacking the victim. The famous scene where the shark scares Brody at the stern of the Orca still startles no matter how many times you see it.Spielberg more than proved his talent as a director with this film. It was a huge hit on release and many people who've seen this over the years have been terrified of going into the sea because they might be attacked. Ironically the author Peter Benchley spent the rest of his life trying to undo the negative attitudes towards sharks that were caused in some part because of his book and the film.This film has three sequels which are all terrible. The second Jaws film has it's moments but is pretty bad, the other two are atrocious and should be avoided at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws succeeds in many ways, none more important than pure storytelling brilliance. I believe this is missing in so much of today's cinema. Everything seems rushed in modern films, and when a film does get back to the roots of telling a proper story (this takes time) people complain that it is too slow.Let's take the way Spielberg sets up the beach scene for example. There was one to two minutes of establishing beach-goer shots. If this film was made today I believe 80-90% of that would be removed to "speed up" the story and we would be left with a single establishing shot of the water/beach then jump right into the scene. Instead we are treated to a montage of real people enjoying their day at the beach. This sets the realism of the scene; it does not feel like a film set with paid extras walking in their choreographed patterns given to them moments before "Action!" The town feels like a real place with real people dealing with a simple, yet serious, situation and it is done masterfully. I wish films today were still made with this kind of passion and integrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Not Director Steven Spielberg's Most Overrated Movie, that would be "E.T." (1982). But it is Certainly Overrated. Overwhelmed by the Popularity and Zeitgeist of the Whole Thing, It was Certainly a Blockbuster and Cultural Phenomenon in 1975.A Slickly Made and Innovative Movie for its Time, Spielberg had Enough Clout and Money to Experiment with the Genre and was a Creative Talent that Crafted a Different Look and Feel to the Film that Helped Make the Movie a Slightly Offbeat Experience. John Williams Haunting Score Helped.But the Movie has Some Things that are Far From Perfect and Keeps it from Becoming a Masterpiece that So Many Claim. In the First Act, Spielberg Borrows from Howard Hawks and Includes a lot of Over Talking that is Just as Clunky as When Hawks Kept Pushing that bit of Pretension on Audiences.The Second Act is Corny at Times with Roy Scheider's Chief Brody Character Channeling Every Teen Sci-Fi from the Fifties Trying to Convince His "Elders" that there Really is a "Monster on the Loose", and When Robert Shaw's Over the Top "Old Salt" Shows Up, the Camp becomes Quite Silly at Times.The Third Act Suffers Mostly from Mechanics of the Shark Kind. When the Shark Jumps on the Boat, Suspension of Disbelief Goes Out the Window. But the Movie is Entertaining and it has Become One of Those Band Wagons that Everyone wants to Jump On for Fear of Being Left Behind. Objectively, it's a Fine Film, Better than Average, and Deserves Credit for the Now Famous Tapping of that Middle Class Angst that the Director is Well Known for Exploiting. Spielberg is a Craftsman, a Playful Filmmaker with Great Talent and an Ability to Know What the People Want and Gives it to Them in Heavy Doses.Jaws was His First Film of the Sort, and He has Never Really Changed and Strayed Only Occasionally from what Might be Called Populist Entertainment Rather than High-Art. At the Former, He is the Master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws has to be one of the best films released in the 1970's. It is scary, suspenseful and funny. The thing I like about this movie is the fact that the shark is not shown for most of the film. When the shark is shown, for most of the film you only see the dorsal fin and tail fin. That is what makes this film so good. The musical score was excellent. Hearing that music when the shark is about to attack always sent chills down my spine. That is what makes a good horror film. When I saw the shark full frontal, I was like, oh my god, this is very creepy. Robert Shaw was phenomenal as the crude fisherman quint. It made me sad when he died a horrible, painful bloody death. I especially like the line "Your gonna need a bigger boat". That just cracks me up. If you like killer shark movies, I recommend Jaws. This movie is a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Spielberg's best, but very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually avoided this movie when I was a little kid, I loved going into the ocean whenever I went to the beach, so I didn't want that ruined for me. However, when I got older, I finally decided watch it in full. Now of course Jaws is known for being the first film to ever make over 100 million dollars, and starting the summer blockbuster. So I respect the film for that, but is it good? Yeah, I think it's pretty great.Now it's not perfect though, it isn't my favorite Steven Spielberg movie as it is for most people. For one, while I like the main trio, the rest of the cast are kind of forgettable. Brody's wife, the mayor, the kids, their all good, but the reason everyone likes this film is for the main three. You will have to stretch your suspension of disbelief a little far near the end. I can handle not being slowed down by three barrels, but jumping up onto a boat is a little silly. And the film, while still great, has defienently aged. Some of the effects are dated, and of course now we know that sharks usually won't attack people.But is this movie scary, yes it is. It succeeds in not only scaring you in the movie, but after the movie. Imagine your in water at night, all alone, and you suddenly feel something touch your leg. How scary would that be. The first scene is pretty hard to watch, and the film shows guts by killing a kid. The three main characters are great, they're funny, likable, have great chemistry, and I didn't want to see them die. Although Quint did get a little aggrivating with the whole "no radio" crap. And this is one of the few adabtations that is actually better than the book it is based on. Getting rid of plot points that didn't need to be there. And while I complained about some of the special effects being dated, most of them still look really good. And the fact that they don't show the shark often actually helps the movie.Jaws isn't my favorite Spielberg movie, but it's still a really great film. It's scary, funny, has a trio of great characters, and of course, started the summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 15 years old and it took decades before I could go into the ocean any further than just my ankles. I had never been exposed to any kind of violence as a kid, and when I saw a man get eaten alive, I almost had an anxiety attack. Kids are different now. That kind of thing is no big deal to them. When I watch this movie as an adult, I see it differently. The biggest difference I noticed was that when the mother on the beach realized it was her son that did not come out of the water, my heart broke for her. In my opinion, this movie has lost nothing in the 36 years since its release....it's still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very irritated that I can not watch the same movie that I saw in the theater in 1975 because scenes were deleted when the movie hit the home video market. Even the 30th Anniversary edition has the deleted scenes not back in the movie but outside of the movie in a series of clips. If it was good enough to make it the big screen, it should be good enough to be in the home video versions. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed!Anyone purchasing this movie will therefore get a chopped up version of the original. That is a disgrace to the movie and a way to rip consumers off. It is extremely cheesy to remove scenes after the movie leaves the theater. If the movie is longer that way, who cares. You have this thing called a pause button if you need to use the bathroom while watching the movie. It is the great advantage about home video.</fullReview>

I admit this is my first time seeing this, and I'm not that amazed as people say this movie makes you be.The first hour is not that interesting and nothing much really happens. Just a bunch of old people talking and talking. The movie actually isn't interesting until you finally see the sea monster. The actors do their jobs very well, but the writer could have made it with more action; that's one thing that ruined it for me.Spielberg's direction is great, but "Jaws" is not changing anybody's life; it's just pure entertainment with the ending we wanted to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic, memorable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just amazing, the casting, the director, and all the crew that made it possible, for Spielberg's early work, it was still one of his best, this film is about a shark wandering into the shallow, warm waters of Amity Island, a somewhat isolated Island and feasting on the unexpected and unprepared islanders of Amity Island. As you can guess, the Shark will attack people, this movie brings lots of tension and action, for a movie from 1975 it was amazing and the shark looked very realistic, my favourite character was easily Quint, the expert fisherman who was loved and iconic, he seems a fearless, invincible man, lovable and funny. They unfortunately had another crack at remaking a Jaws film, but the other three, yes three! Never met up to the standards of the first one. 9/10, see this film, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking Intense thriller of the seventies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jaws' is an unusual and admirable thriller directed by Steven Spielberg. Adapted from the best seller by Peter Benchley.A shark terrorises the island community of Amity. This is a director's film and has an originality in the strong story telling style in which it is shot. The opening scene is one of the most terrifying sequences that the cinema has ever produced.It is as though Hitchcock has handed on the baton to Spielberg challenging him to create something new. The performance by Robert Shaw as Quint the Ahab like shark hunter is superb - it is a large performance with beautifully subtle moments i.e his clocking the fishing line's movement and his rapid change from raucous singing and embracing of camaraderie to a chillingly effective account of him being on the crew of the U.S.S Indianopolis when it went down.He is ably supported by Roy Scheider as Chief Brodie who brings a quiet authority to all his scenes and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper who is the comic relief- and this film is one where it is desperately needed. The film is a triumph because Spielberg was brave and relentless in his approach to the making of it .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually when I review a movie that's even older than myself, I tend to put myself into a 'retro'-mode. I'll usually think things like, well, those special effects, acting, plot,... were ridiculous, but they were awesome for that day and age. No need to do that here. Jaws is so good and universal, it could have easily been made today and be a hit. The fear of sharks, the agenda to keep a beach running for tourist money versus some vague allegations of a shark threat, the psychology, it still stands today. Not only did this movie catapult Spielberg to fame, it started a genre of its own (the shark movie), and was even responsible for the real-life shark phobia we still experience today. If you still haven't seen it, go ahead and watch it. You'll still enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece; a summer blockbuster that is also somewhat groundbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often considered to be the ultimate summer blockbuster, Jaws (1975) goes even further than that; standing as a truly radical and exciting piece of film-making, rich in character, action, energy and technique; and filled with some truly iconic moments that have endured throughout the subsequent thirty-five years and still retain the power and ability to shock and excite the audience in more than equal measures. For me, it's an example of almost perfect film-making, setting the template for many of Spielberg's greatest films in terms of structure, presentation and impact; with that opening sequence grabbing our attention with a swift combination of alluring sexuality giving way to full-blown horror and dread; further whetting our appetite just enough to make us persevere with the eventual scenes of dialog and exposition that immediately follow. Here, Spielberg is also able to suggest the kind of danger lurking ahead, creating a sense of suspense for the audience that will pay off in the final third of the film, where we find non-stop action, drama and pure character dynamics.Much has already been written about the sharp vibrancy of the story and the slow build up to the eventual revelation of the event that triggers the narrative and sends us headlong into that four-way battle of wits that dominates the film's final act; with the screenwriters taking an obvious leaf from Hitchcock - and in particular, The Birds (1963) - with that idea of a small, seemingly idyllic island community being terrorised by an ecological, naturalistic horror that is never fully explained (and remains all the more terrifying for it). It remains that perfect combination of script, direction, casting and hook; in this case the frightening and iconic score of John Williams, which benefits from a two-note simplicity in keeping with the rest of the film, and the basic idea of an unseen, unstoppable evil, waiting in the most innocuous place of all... the sea! Spielberg's confident approach to a cinema of this scale, even at such an early point in his career, is already apparent; with the problems behind the scenes actually being used to the benefit of the film, turning something that could have been a fairly obvious maritime disaster movie with a fake rubber shark and producing a film that was slightly more enigmatic, character driven and open to interpretation.For example, you can clearly read metaphorical interpretations into the portrayal of the shark and how it affects this community; bringing out the quiet desperation of the islanders and the corruption of its town officials who just want to keep the money rolling in, regardless of the cost; are of which are fairly prevalent when we think of the film in the 70's context, post-Watergate/post-Vietnam. However, the film isn't limited to political subtext, with the action, characters and deft handling of narrative momentum all adding to the overall great viewing experience; with the director's truly heroic command of framing, shot structure and tight use of editing to make the most out of the film's few genuinely affecting shock scenes. It's also more violent than the PG rating would suggest, with Spielberg once again getting away with the kind of brutality that would have condemned a less popular filmmaker; something that we can also see in the violence of Saving Private Ryan (1999) and the more recent Munich (2005).It's odd to consider now that Spielberg was, despite his success, always thought of as a lesser talent compared to the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and Bogdanovich; his style and influences too populist to appeal to serious cineasts and his films apparently too lightweight to be compared to the similarly great likes of The Last Picture Show (1971), The Conversation (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976). With this in mind, it's surprising to see that Spielberg is now the most interesting, exciting and edgy director of his generation; still as populist and business-minded as ever, but taking great risks with films like the emotionally complicated A.I. (2001), the low-key and minimalist (of the not entirely successful) The Terminal (2004) and the vitriolic and oddly reflective Munich; as mentioned above. Obviously, he is a great filmmaker - as those particular films and many more will attest - however, for me, Jaws is something of his masterpiece; made all the more impressive for the fact that it was produced at the very beginning of his career and was only his third feature-length film as director.</fullReview>

The dynamic trio of Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss allows us to access laughter, terror, love and every emotion possible which is often hard to do in a thriller like this. The Effects are excellent with a shark that looked realistic enough for me! Some people have criticised it and said that it would be better if done by CG but as in the case of Spielberg's other masterpiece E.T sometimes creating the actual model itself brings the best out of actors. But for me what was personally responsible for most of the film's success was the chilling score which becomes the voice and character of the shark. A well deserved Oscar for John Williams.</fullReview>

And while it wasn't his first, it was certainly Steven Spielberg's first large budget, and his first hit, propelling his career into the mega-success he is today...and with good reason.This work captured the fear of every movie goer for a decade. The atmosphere generated herein is downright Hitchcockian in essence, while the story is compellingly dead on for how a small business-minded town would handle this situation. The dialog is superb, and the performances are above par for this type of movie.This work went a long way towards re-legitimizing the horror genre among the average movie-goer and critics, alike.Although it IS a bit dated now, it still ranks up there in the highest echelon of creature features, right alongside Alien, Predator, and the old Universal Horrors.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie of its kind. Not the thriller genre. But Man Vs. Animal. Where people face natural things doing what they do. The thing that makes Jaws so good is that it doesn't just focus on the Shark and them hunting it in the water for 2 hours. The movie has a great script from Peter Benchley (also author of Jaws). Which does focus on other things such as having the protagonist be a man fearing the water setting sail onto a boat to kill a man eating shark. And the characters are all well rounded. They have many faces shown by the actors especially in Richard Dreyfuss's potrail of Hooper. The pacing of this film keeps its suspense going throughout the movie using the classic score by John Williams to inform or surprise use when not being used. And not showing the shark until 3/4s through the movie added more suspense. The film is very well directed and acted which is its major strong points. In my opinion for what the film is trying to achieve it is perfect in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Jaws SPOILERS* When a young woman, Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backline) is killed while swimming in the sea that surrounds the quiet island of Amity, Sheriff Martin Brody (Riy Scheider) suspects a shark, and wants to close the beaches.The greedy town mayor (Murray Hamilton), though, decides not to, and another person, young Alex Kintner (Jeffrey Voorhees) is eaten.A shark is caught, but when a third person (Ted Grossman) dies because of shark bites, it's clear it wasn't the right one.So Brody, along with 'sharkologist' Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and tough fisher Quint (Robert Shaw) embarks on a mission to find and kill the shark (played by a prop shark called 'Bruce') before it kills any more people.Based upon a book by Peter Benchley, 'Jaws' is probably the movie with the most impressive soundtrack (everybody remembers the 'dun-dun-dundundundundundundundundundun' and associates it with looming danger) and one of the scariest 'shark' movies, if not THE scariest.Steven Spielberg creates another classic, right after his spectacular debut with 'Duel' (notice that the shark's death groan is the same that was made by the dying truck at the end of that movie).The acting is appropriate, and the mood is never broken; but don't watch this before going to the beach...Jaws: 9/10.</fullReview>

However, when the camera is positioned behind her to show the viewer Brody's expression, her veil is perfectly still. When the camera goes back to viewing her face, the veil is blowing around again. The movie is one of my favorites of all time. I think it is important to point out that in the original book Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. If you know this, the relationship almost seems implied in the scene where Hooper comes over for dinner. I have often wondered if this was on purpose when filmed.

		<shortDescription>There's something going on under the surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This review discusses the ending of the film.Jaws is virtually goreless, and we don't see the shark at all until almost an hour has gone by, and yet watching this film remains one of the most terrifying ways anyone can ever spend two hours. What sells it isn't the big toothy beast with the fins, but the people who have to deal with its presence.Jaws is set in Amity Island, a self-consciously idyllic tourist resort around the July 4th holiday. The beauty of the setting, shot to resemble the wonderful summer breaks we all think we experienced, is crucial to a film that hinges on the sense of contrast. The monster is horrific but this horror is set in stark opposition to the carefully-constructed carefree bliss of Amity, and that makes it all the harder to get to grips with ? there is no retreat, nowhere that people can go to unwind because perfection has a killer lurking just out of sight. The cynical, paranoid chief Brody (Roy Scheider) has to endure the unimportant domestic quibbles of the town's bovine population, a stumbling block preventing him from giving full attention to the real problem. This sense of contrast and the frustration it fosters is never illustrated more effectively than the scene where old Harry (Alfred Wilde) sits in front of him, blocking his view of the sea just before the shark attacks.This being the era of burgeoning postmodernism, Amity's idyll is wholly artificial, a construct by the cynical and greedy mayor (Murray Hamilton) and various local businesses that depend on summer tourists for the economy of the town, and who value the dollar far more than human life. The shameless capitalism is best seen in the journalist Meadows, who wants to downplay the story of Alex Kitner's death and then highlight the captured tiger shark, which realistically is highly unlikely to be the real culprit but, more importantly, is a perfect excuse to keep the beaches open. As Mayor Vaughn impedes Brody at every turn, putting people in danger, the tension of the film mounts. This, and the film's lack of any real red herrings (perhaps the shark ate them) contribute to the forced removal of any sense of false security. In its place is just a sense of permanent, knuckle-gnawing uncertainty. Things come to a head in the only way they can ? the heartless businessmen have pushed their luck as far as they can the result is spectacular, fatal and very, very public.And so into the second half, where Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled seaman Quint (Robert Shaw) ? who looks like instead of being born he just came walking out of the sea one day ? set out in a ludicrously ill-equipped floating shed called the Orca to find and kill the shark. The levels of fear diminish slightly, but the tension is maintained in the tiny, claustrophobic environment as personalities clash. The Ahab mk II that is Quint has nothing but disdain for the educated Hooper, whom he perceives to be an ivory-tower intellectual whose dedication to academia is no substitute for his own practical experience; Brody meanwhile is a cowardly landlubber who is best suited to the menial tasks like chumming and tying knots. Any distinctions between characters are soundly mocked by the threat they face ? a soulless killer that can't be understood, rationalised or empathised with. It simply kills, because that's all that's in its nature. Meanwhile, Quint's famous monologue about the U.S.S. Indianapolis, delivered by a breathtakingly intense Shaw, shows that the characters themselves have more to them that meets the eye.So it is that the pale-faced intellectual ("been counting money all your life" sneers Quint at one point) proves his worth by choosing to enter the water with the creature, the hard-nosed working man's strength comes to nothing as the shark gobbles him up, and the coward saves the day. This isn't done in a trite "finding the courage" kind of way, but simply because there are no other options left. It's that or get eaten, and as such the complexities of the characters fall under the might of the shark's sheer indiscrimination and simplicity. He's no less of a landlubber, and consequently all the more a hero, and Jaws is all the more a classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A contemporary viewing of 'Jaws' is quite a nostalgic experience, taking one back to the days when men were men (and fishermen smashed up their radio equipment, just to prove it), the killing of an endangered species was considered a suitable subject for heroic endeavour, and Steven Spielberg could make movies not weighed down by sentimentality or moralising. Although not quite as brutally effective as his earlier 'Duel', 'Jaws' is still a fine, minimalist thriller based on a very simple idea (namely, "big shark"), notable also for the absence of a single obvious hero (all three human protagonists have flaws). On the downside, John Williams' famous score is a little proscriptive at times, and although the shark is very frightening, the man versus shark fight is realised with only partial success: one never quite believes that all participants are in the same environment. Nonetheless, this is still an entertaining and scary movie, deserving its reputation as a classic of its type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a fast-food lunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you love the water?Given director Steven Spielberg's predilection for calling his more sensational films 'fast-food movies', anyone approaching Jaws for the first time might feel an extra reason for combining horror and camp humour in their advance thoughts. There is always a fairground attraction element in revisiting old scary movies. Jumping out of our seats is combined with a know-all feeling that the special effects are somewhat dated. But as there is much more to Jaws than a rather unrealistic model shark, it still has plenty of power to thrill.The basic story is simple enough. A killer shark threatens a popular beach resort and people are slow to believe it for fear of lost revenue. Spielberg notches up the emotional tension with a range of equally iconic characters, deft camera work and an ominous music by John Williams. The memorable leitmotif - low thumping staccato notes like a heart pounding too quickly - announces the approach of the shark so effectively that the sound scares us half to death even before any visual sighting.The three main characters, Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as rational scientist Matt Hooper, and Robert Shaw's grizzled man-of-the-sea Quint, offer three very different personalities with different emotional trigger points. The deft editing produces constant mood switching that keeps us on the edge of our seats for all of them, plus some puppy dogs and a young-and-beautiful surf set to pull in anyone not moved by the more high-minded heroes. A severed arm is discovered on the beach in a warm community context. Our nerdy policeman is visibly upset.These superb performances are supported by inventive camera-work. Look out for the moment when Dreyfuss, getting a shoulder-rub from his wife, witnesses a shark attack on the beach. The camera tracks forward while zooming back so Dreyfuss' image stays constant but the perspective changes suddenly - it's as if the background closes behind him. This disorientating effect (famously used by Hitchcock in Vertigo) prepares us with stomach-churning anticipation for a glimpse of the shark.Together with The Exorcist and Star Wars, Jaws heralded the advent of the modern blockbuster. Released on multiple screens without the usual word-of-mouth advertising, going to see them became a cultural necessity. Jaws is a well-made, nuanced, gamble of a film that paid off handsomely and also assured Spielberg's future. The era it heralded also, unfortunately, opened the floodgates for much less worthy films.Many years on, Jaws still has the power to thrill - and perhaps make you think twice when going skinny-dipping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because thats how much this movie affected. I've always believed that truly scary movies leave horrified FOREVER. The only movies that have done this are Jaws, Texas Chain Saw Massacre (orignal), and It. The only problem with the others is that they don't have the production values, acting, and script (and in It's case, an ending.).That being said, I would like to say that this is my all-time favorite movie. This is my Star Wars, Star Trek, and LOTR wrapped into one. Back to the movie. The first thing to comment on is that the shark, though not real looking, still looks amazing. No shark has looked as good as Bruce. The Closest thing to compare to Bruce is the Deep Blue Sea sharks, but they are still miles behind Bruce.This movie also beats out all other shark movies as far as acting. You can't 24/7 shark attack flick with non stop action, though that would be sweet. The cast all does outstanding, especially Robert Shaw. His performance is so close to a modern day Ahab. I still get shivers whenever I hear the USS Indianapolis speech.And of course, there is John Williams brilliant score. There is the basic duh dun, but I'm going to go a little further than that. The truly great thing about the score is how the tempo matches the pace.Like I said, this is my favorite movie. If you're one those people who doesn't think this movie is terrifying, then go watch Boogeyman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg said (and still say) that "Jaws" was the most difficult movie he ever had to make. We, poor mortal moviegoers, can't really approve this assertion, but we'll take it as true.However, if this statement is really true, then we can say if this hard-working job was rewarding or not. Fortunately for Spielberg, his shark nightmarish project became one of the most glorious movies of its kind and a landmark in Hollywood history.That kind of hellish shooting mood was also felt by Francis Ford Coppola during the making of "Apocalypse Now" and there again, we can see that it was rewarding. But just imagine if "Godzilla" makers said that their movie was a difficult one to make..."Jaws" is a very particular film. Not only in its story, but especially on the legacy it gives to the whole film industry. It was the first movie to break the nine-digit profit (and thus becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time), the one that established summertime as the dominant period of the year for cinema and one of the greatest "high concept" films of all time."Jaws" has a very simple story and relatively simple characters. But it succeeds, simply because it doesn't try to force itself to become more interesting. It stays simple and the natural flow takes on.The synopsis could be summarized with these six little words: "A shark attacks a coastal town." This shark, a dangerous Great White as we learn, tries to get a meal from the local swimmers and it terrorizes the little summer town. With the profitable season rolling in and the big national holiday approaching, the mayor doesn't want to get the beaches closed but as a near-fatality involves the son of police chief Brody (Roy Scheider), things get more and more serious.This first part of the movie is good. Very good, actually. But it's only a curtain-raiser for the really interesting part which is the hunt for this devil-sent shark on the ocean.The three passengers are: Brody, oceanographer Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and experienced mariner and former WWII soldier Quint (Robert Shaw). The triangle interaction between them and the shark hunt are the only elements that we need in order to get the great show we want.Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw offer performances which are among their personal best ones. Scheider, as Chief Brody, shows that he is a skillful police officer but that he has a great fear of water. Dreyfuss is the near-nerd and he is very convincing.Shaw is perhaps the best of the three. He plays his role of fisherman with solid professionalism and his jargon can only give more credibility. But it's his two monologues which moves him above the other characters. First, he introduces himself to the other citizens in town and he sets the table for his later appearance. Second, his unforgettable speech about his dramatic experience aboard the USS Indianapolis ("We delivered the bomb") and the tragedies of the soldiers who died attacked by sharks is unarguably fascinating and it ranks as one of the greatest monologues ever delivered by any character in any modern movie.Other than the three major characters, "Jaws" impresses with its pre-ILM special effects. The mechanical shark (nicknamed "Bruce") looks so real that we forget its artificial nature. More impressive, we can feel its personality by its cruel attacks on weak humans and on Quint's boat and also by its empty black eyes.The underwater camera shooting of the swimmers' legs, accompanied by John Williams' Oscar-winning cello score, is already legendary. This is the kind of shot that is repetitive but surprisingly never spoils the suspense. On the contrary, watching the legs approaching from the camera with the tempo speeding up is exhilarating and frightening.I don't like that the shark be killed with a bottle of compressed air, but it provides some great elements anyway. The visual shooting of the shark 'explosion' is impeccable, but it's the music that hooked me. Instead of hearing a triumphing fanfare of trumpets, drums and flutes, we find ourselves listening to a sad succession of falling piano notes, which gives the impression that the shark's death is tearful instead of happy and resolving.At only 29, Spielberg showed what kind of path he would take with "Jaws" for the rest of his career and the famed shark movie remains one of its greatest thrilling rides, as well as the very definition of contemporary commercial cinema.But in a sense, even if it's a supremely good movie, there's some kind of bitterness in its legacy. "Jaws" showed to the world that cinema was not only an artistic mean, but also a very efficient money-making business. This is sad, because it opened the doors for a new generation of filmmakers, driven by the attract of money and totally uninterested in the artistic side of movie-making. And this reflects Spielberg's entire career.But everybody has its own opinion. This is mine and I share it. But it is still possible that commercially-successful flicks become loved gems by critics as well as spectators. "Jaws" is one of them. And only Spielberg's vision was good enough to support the movie's ambitions. Just look at the sequels...To finish, here's a suggestion. If you go to the beach, bring a cello. You could get much attention...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nail-biting, edge of your seat thriller from director Steven Spielberg which became a phenomenon. A small, peaceful New England coastal town is suddenly rocked when local beach inhabitants fall victim to unprecedented shark attacks. The only way to bring peace to their once idyllic little community is for the town sheriff (Scheider), a seasoned shark expert (Shaw), and an intelligent young scientist (Dreyfuss) to join forces and hunt down the dreaded beast themselves. A simple story is made more than worthwhile by an impeccable cast, steady, sure-handed direction, pulse-pounding action scenes, and one of the most memorable scores of all time! An old-fashioned classic and timeless favorite that still makes people afraid to go into the water. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Never Been To The Ocean, And After This Film I Have No Plans To Go To The Ocean(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSOf course this isn't a Holiday film, but I just felt like commenting on it. To tell you the truth, I was never really scared of sharks. Because of Steven Spielberg and Peter Benchley (RIP), I am terrified of them. I keep on having recurring nightmares of a twenty foot long shark suddenly jumping out of the water and grabbing my foot and dragging me under violently. Grotesque, isn't it? Anyway, back to the film. I love this film. It is one of the first films Steven Spielberg directed, and it is one of his best. However, I like Raiders of the Lost Ark a bit better.A lot of people know the plot, but just in case here it is. A savage great white shark is attacking people of Amity Island. It first brutally kills a girl in a terrifying beginning. Then a young boy is killed in front of everyone on the beach. Why no one rescued him is anybody's guess. Anyway, a man named Quint offers to catch the shark, but because of his high price he can't. Then on the Fourth of July, wait that's a Holiday, the shark kills a man and almost kills Chief Martin Brody's son. Then Quint, Brody, and Marine Biologist Hooper go on Quint's boat and set out to kill the shark. Out in the ocean the shark rams the boat and it starts to sink. Quint is eaten and Hooper is nowhere in sight. Brody blows up the shark with a gun and a air-tank. Hooper then comes back and Brody and Hooper swim safely to shore.Overall, this is a fantastic film that any fan of thrillers or horror or Spielberg will enjoy. There is one really scary scene I'd like to point out. When Hooper is searching a sunken boat underwater, all of a sudden a head pops out of the boat. What makes it so terrifying is that Hooper's reaction is so shocked and the music is perfect. I'd also like to say that John William's score is one of the best scores in history. It's perfect for this film and it so simple. Anyway, I'd really recommend this film.9/10Recommended Films: Jaws Two, Open Water, and The Deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, scary, dramatic and catchy; A real classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favorites, Jaws, is a legendary trend-setting classic. The movie may be full of factual errors, but unless you are going to sit and analyze every second and write down a scientific comment, you shouldn't care. Just sit back and relax in a comfortable sofa with a bowl of well-salted popcorn and let the movie roll. That is with no doubt one of my personal Friday evening pastimes. I must have seen the movie at least something like thirty time by now, and it is just as good every time.This movie makes you laugh, makes you jump to the roof, makes you bite your nails and makes you sit on the edge of your seat with your eyes wide open. Some scenes must have been really scary to see in a cinema once it came. 'Course, I wasn't born then, but the movie holds its position still today. It will be remembered as a trend-setting horror adventure. With great direction from Mr. Spielberg, a thick and robust production from gentlemen David Brown Richard D. Zanuck, coloring script from the guy who wrote the book, Peter Benchley, and superb acting from mainly Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Those two make their characters shine and gives them a lot of personality. They simply put their mind, soul and heart into the work. Crikey, did I forget to give credit to Roy Scheider? Well, yes. But to be honest, he don't deserve as much credit as Dreyfuss and Shaw. He is really boring and don't add anything to his character. I wouldn't be sad if they would have him replaced with somebody with a little more color. Actually, Roy Scheider is a real bore who lowers the general impression. But don't be alarmed now, the general impression is high as heavens. Not even some robot could lower it that much.This movie is a landmark, a legend, a horror classic, a masterpiece, and it will always be remembered as that. Too bad the sequels had to be the way they became (don't need words for them, really).An immortal classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be my all-time favourite movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I call myself a movie buff, but I'd never seen Jaws up until a few months ago. I'd always put myself off of seeing it and I'm not sure why, I just never found the right time to start watching it. Eventually, I thought I had to see it and I purchased the 30th Anniversary Edition DVD.I was literally "blown out of the water." Why had I waited so long to see this film? Everything about it is perfect - characters, dialogue, special effects, action, setting, everything! I hate myself for waiting to see Jaws, as I've seen thousands of movies and never considered that this could become my all-time favourite.Everybody knows the plot, so I won't get into it, but the entire story is told magically, thanks to Steven Spielberg and his crew. I am a traditionalist when it comes to film (classic stories, characters and endings) and Jaws delivers everything I could ever want from a film. The pacing is perfect and I cannot fault it at all.The music by John Williams is now legendary, but it really is much more than the classic "Jaws" theme that people recognise today. The entire soundtrack is both thrilling and wonderful, especially towards the end as the final battle ensues. Williams establishes himself as the best composer of all time with his score, here.The acting is perfect. For the film that reeks "Summer Blockbuster", you probably wouldn't expect the acting to be anything special, but everybody gives memorable performances (especially Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw) - and anyway, we shouldn't forget that this is the "original" summer blockbuster.Overall, I cannot say anything bad about Jaws. It is a remarkable film with some of the greatest characters ever committed to film. The story is inventive and glorious, and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. I know what kind of film Jaws wanted to be, but it turned out to be so much more - Steven Spielberg really is the world's greatest director. His ability to turn (what could of been) quite a mundane story into an epic tale of good versus evil is simply amazing. Oh, and I can't forget the magnificent ending - seriously, it's the best ending ever committed to cinema.Jaws could be my all-time favourite movie, and even if it isn't, it's pretty darn close. See it - you won't be let down.(5/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essential shark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police ,played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert ,played by Richard Dreyfuss, who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they? So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint ,played by Robert Shaw, who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.If you haven't seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing. Just be sure to go on that beach trip BEFORE watching the film, trust me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really had an impact on my life! I use to live in Duxbury as a young child at the time my father decided to take me and my little brother to see. We heard the scary music and when the shark came around..my brother and I were under the seats of the movie patrons in front of us screaming and crying while my father laughed away thinking it was the greatest time in his life. Anyways...I use to love the water living in Duxbury Massachusetts...I still do! But I had to overcome the fear of the water thru the years and acquired a great interest in sharks. It made me more smart of our oceanic surroundings in New England. I've visited Martha's Vineyard for the JawsFest of 05 and was able to get up close to different points of interest of the movie. I'm 35 years old today....5 at the time of the release of the movie. Even though the movie was quite a scare for me in the younger years...it brings back good memories of growing up near the water with my little brother...the good ones. I love the beach, the water and boating and fishing.This movie did change the way many people look at the ocean now and how much time they spend at the beaches actually "swimming". So it sent people away from the beaches to get involved in other outdoor activities.But anyways...James Cameron is now producing a remake!

		<fullReview>The films influence on the blockbuster movies of today is well documented, Spielberg youthfulness to the style and the mise en scene is a breath of fresh air from other films of the period. Its cinematic style provides much of the films horror and this included with the Jaws theme tune makes the movie a massive film worth a watch or two, but ht watcher must beware this film didn't make the blockbuster it only added to the film industry. The use of music within the fabric of the film also makes the film intensity magnify to a degree rarely seen in films of this vintage. The films overall success at the box office gave the film a $100 million dollar return, a figure which broke all previous records. The characters within the films and the way in which they are allowed within the confines of the fame to explore the dynamics of the characters persona gives the films a brilliant energy, from improvised rhymes to little sea diddys produces a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was a huge success in the Box Office, 2 years before Star Wars past it's record.The story is about a regular beach that's never had any serious accidents. Every 4th of July tourists of all kinds would come here.Little do they know is that there's a shark among the waters.A 25 footer weighing 3 tons. It's an ultimate killing machine in the waters. Those who are swimming in the ocean won't be so lucky.After 3 attacks, the city mayor demanded a shark hunt. The ones who volunteer are a police lifeguard, a shark expert, and Quint an expert in fishing. These 3 unlikely characters will be spending the next few days at sea trying to hunt down the shark and kill it.Jaws will change the way you think of Great White sharks, and it may give you the fear of swimming in the ocean. It's a worthy thriller movie with a lot of good stuff you'd expect from Spielberg.It's worth seeing by renting or buying it or borrowing it from a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a very good movie. I don't think it's a great one. If one is going to have contemporary monster, you can go two routes. You can bring in the supernatural element and give it powers beyond those of mortal men (sorry Superman), or you can make it a natural danger, where it plays by the rules that nature sets up. This shark appears to have a personal agenda, and it's at that point, the move loses me a bit. Granted there are really fun performances by Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider. They are such caricatures. The byplay between them works quite well. I did feel at times they did little to protect themselves and that was disappointing. You can be the soldier of fortune, but don't just walk in front of the cannon. There is suspense, and that shark is really frightening. What is done with the camera is the true star of the film. The shots of the swimmers' legs from under the water is true genius. And, of course, if you ever want to teach someone the importance of a musical score for a movie, you need go no farther. My kids gave me the anniversary edition of this for my birthday. I need to take a look at it again. It's certainly a formidable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much-lauded classic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent combination of both action and drama, directed by Steven Spielberg with enthusiasm and flair, "Jaws" is an intriguing and successful cinematic masterpiece. It is one of those movies it is very difficult to write a review about, as so much has been written by now about the film's considerable merits.Set in the coastal island town of Amity, he film begins with a gently teasing sequence in which a skinny-dipping young girl is seized and dragged underwater by a mysterious sinister prescence. Her remains are washed up on the shore the following day. The local police chief Brody(Roy Scheider) registers the death as a shark attack. Much to his frustration, the authorities refuse to acknowledge the existence of the shark. As Amity is a tourist town, the council are afraid of the impact it might have on the summer season, the source of the town's income. When they cannot the existence of the beast lurking off their beaches any longer, they hire the police chief, a mainland ichthyologist Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and a salty local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt and kill the shark....It is a well-known fact by now that the technical aspects of the film came about largely through necessity and lack of the kind of technology that is easily available now. As a result, Spielberg did not show the shark for much of the film's first act, preferring to emphasise it's prescence through POV camera shots and John Williams pounding score. Without CGI, the producers had to build a 25-foot shark replica. It's easy to scoff at how fake it looks, but of all the models used in the "Jaws" movies this is easily the most convincing.The film is well-staged and edited throughout. The shark attack scenes are very carefully played and built up and a minimum of gore is used. The dialogue scenes never drag, but slowly linger on certain characters allowing their flaws and idiosyncracies to show. The final hour in particular is brilliantly staged, weaving in character development with the ever-impending threat of the shark.The script departs significantly from the Peter Benchley novel on which it's based. This is especially true of the man vs. shark final hour, the very action-movie ending upsetting the author so much he had to be thrown off the set. Other than that, dialogue is well-written coming naturally while simultaneously developing the characters. A key scene in this respect is Quint's eerily told USS Indianapolis monologue.The performances are all first-rate. Scheider is a find as the down-to-earth Everyman hero Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss gives a brilliantly nervy performance as scientist Hooper. Stealing the film from both these two fine actors are Murray Hamilton as the town's greedy spin-doctor Mayor and Robert Shaw as likeable, but in the end embittered and bloodthirsty Quint.A standout classic film, one which it's three sequels hadn't a hope in hell of equalling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Williams score was one of the spookiest sounds that I have ever heard. No wonder that this movie cleared the beaches when it came out in the summer of 1975. Steven Spielburg has directed so many fine films, but this is his finest. He knew how to make a first class thriller just like Alfred Hitchcock did. Spielburg did such a wonderful job with Jaws because when you think about it, you didn't really see that much blood and gore and you did not see the shark until almost the end of the film. Steve shied away from using bloody special effects the way that so many directors of these cheap slasher films do today and I think that made it a better movie. He just used things like the spooky music to make you hide your eyes in fright in anticipation of what might happen. This is one of the few films that is better then the book. Roy Schider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfus make a dynamite trio. They do such a wonderful job that it is hard to tell who steals the show from who. When you think about it, they have to carry the last half of the movie all by themselves and they do it so well. I read that Shaw and Dreyfus didn't like each other during the filming, but that made it even better. I do not know if people realize this, but that speech about the USS Indianapolis that Quint makes is based on fact. There really was such a ship and Robert Shaw (who was an accomplished writer and playwright) insisted on writing this himself. He should have gotten an Oscar for this amazing soliloquy who gives. The USS Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser that delivered the uranium for the atomic bomb to the island of Tinian. On the way back, it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. There were 1,196 men on the ship, based on the accounts survivors gave after they were rescued, it is estimated as many as 400 may have gone down with it. The men were in the water for five days before they were finally rescued! By some sort of SNAFU, no one reported the ship as missing and they were found only by accident. After all that time, only 316 came out alive and about 100 of the casualties had been eaten by sharks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Interesting Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as the shark suspense is key to "Jaws," I've always been intrigued by the relationships among the three men who go to sea to kill the shark: Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and Quint (Robert Shaw.)Each man is at odds with the other two. Chief Brody, who is scared and useless on the open sea, is at odds with salty seafarer Quint and brainy shark expert Hooper. Rich kid Hooper is at odds with working class heroes Chief Brody and Quint. And the crazed Quint is at odds with the sane Chief Brody and Hooper. Since each man lacks something the other two have, there is constant tension among them -- both comic and dramatic -- even as they must band together to stop the killer great white from killing them.I saw this with a giant crowd in the summer of '75 -- and went down to the beach after the matinee. EVERYBODY was thinking about that movie. Everybody. A great movie -- and a better "movie going memory" of a long time ago.</fullReview>

A movie like this is so good because the audience can really transport themselves into it and become lost in it, maximizing the entertainment value of the movie. I completely lose it whenever I watch Quint's speech about the USS Indianapolis, because Shaw is so convincing in conveying the pain his character feels when recounting the horrific ordeal of the ship's crew. He immediately becomes humanized, rather than just being "that crazy old Ahab-type fellow."True, the book was a great work of literature, and there were quite a few liberties taken in the transition from page to screen, but that was necessary. Anyone who has read the book will tell you that there were things that needed to be omitted, and things that had to be altered. Hey, even Peter Benchley himself felt things needed to be changed for the adaptation, so he took the task himself. And that's why the film works just as well as the book - the same man was able to take one masterpiece and change just enough so that it became another masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember how old I was when I first saw this movie. I lived in Oceanside, Cali at the time. So we were right there by the beach. We used to go all the time. I was never a swimmer but I loved to get in the water.After this movie came out I never stepped foot in the water again lol. This movie is a classic. After I saw this movie, I had to run to the library to get every book I could on sharks. Not only great white sharks but all kinds. The rest of the movies in the Jaws series were pretty far fetched, as was this one in alot of ways. It is a classic though and it is in alot of our hearts. It did change the way alot of people felt about going into the ocean though.</fullReview>

Quint, played by Robert Shaw, is and always will be my favourite movie character. His description of his days in WWII is popcorn perfection.

		<shortDescription>The art of bending the mind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few directors can make a movie without showing the reason for terror until late. It is the art of making the audience build up a vision of what they think it is, and then suprising them with something totally different. Alfred Hitchcock used building up for suspense, only to have nothing happen, and when it seemed as though nothing would happen, something does! Same for "Signs" with Mel Gibson."Jaws" is one of the Crown Jewels of suspense. The shark isn't fully seen until the majority of the killings have happened. And the music... What a great theme! Peter Benchley hit it big with his novel, but the movie is what truly made him famous. Steven Spielberg remains to be one of the best all-time directors. And you gotta love Robert Shaw's portrayal of Quint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay out of the water...watch Jaws instead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was about 7 years old, I watched this movie (along with Annie...what a combination!) almost every day...over and over again. I was absolutely fascinated and captivated. That summer we went camping and at first I had no problems going into the ocean. Nothing was going to keep me from swimming...and certainly no shark! Well, that is until news spread that a guy had caught a shark while fishing from the pier. Granted, it was just a baby shark, but that didn't matter to me. As far as I was concerned, Jaws had a baby and I was NOT going in that water again! Many years have passed since I was seven, but this movie has lost none of its charm for me (not even in the hundreds of times I viewed it). The sprinkles of humor still make me laugh, I still love to hate Quint, and I still find that shark absolutely thrilling. Over the years Jaws has lost very little of its awe or fear; and even in today's overwhelming special effects, Jaws still can hold its own. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can look beyond todays CG and other special effects and simply enjoy this movie for what it is and for its ability to make you think twice before swimming in the ocean again. A truly fantastic movie earning 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese has said that he remembers movies vividly from a period when he hit puberty....back then it was Brando and Bogart, not bad a period in films. I remember Jaws quite well as I saw it when I was 14 and right in the middle of the puberty blues. I watch it now and it still evokes the same fears I had in 1973, my favorite scenes are still the same. This is a classic because it hits on our most basic fears and insecurities. Lovers of scary movies love the rush of being frightened. It is a personal challenge to see if we can handle it. I am a horrible swimmer, so staying out of the water became easier after this one. Spielberg created a masterpiece despite the challenges of working with a mechanical shark. The suspense builds scene after scene, even though we don't even see the shark early on. The movie is just plain scary and this is moving making at its absolute best!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definately the best movie ever about a killer shark...Jaws is set in a resort town and is of course about a shark terrorizing said town. All the actors in this one do a great job, but the person who does the best job is Robert Shaw who plays a shark hunter. Roy Shieder plays a sheriff of the town and Richard Dreyfuss plays a marine biologist of sorts. There is great tension throughout the movie and some good comedy here and there as well. The shark attack scenes are pretty good too, especially the one when you see the shark go for the one guy after the kids boat is tipped over. The first part of the movie is the town, and the second is the boat scenes and them tracking the shark. The movie though could have had at least one more shark attack though, as I think they go off to hunt it to fast. Though the interplay between the three main characters is at its best in the boat scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest cinematic thrillers ever made! A monstrous Great White shark invades a New England coastal resort, munching on bathers until the local sherriff (Roy Scheider), an icthiologist (Richard Dreyfuss)and a salty old fisherman (Robert Shaw) sail out into the ocean to destroy it. Boasts great performances, direction, photography, editing and a rousing music score by John Williams. The shark, though obviously fake at times, is still one of the most terrifying movie monsters ever, far scarier and more convincing than the computer generated sharks of DEEP BLUE SEA, or even the Tyranosaurus of Spielberg's own JURASSIC SHOW. A classic. MCA Video's DVD edition is superb except for a few mind-boggling changes to the soundtrack, including a less creepy whale song during the dinner scene, and a more subdued sound effect when the shark crashes through the side of the boat. Other than that, a must-have for any movie fan.</fullReview>

There are so many shots in which pan-and-scan destroys the effect of Spielberg's composition that seeing it in widescreen is like watching a completely different (and better) film. This is especially true if you're one of those anti-letterboxing types who actually *prefers* full-frame movies on TV. All the theoretical talk about the "director's vision" may leave you cold, but if you can watch both versions of *Jaws* and not understand why widescreen is better, then I frankly don't see why you bother to watch movies at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is one of the best shark movies ever created and it is my absolute favorite movie of the 1970s. It is also a big hit at the box office in 1975. A police chief (Roy Scheider), a sailor (Robert Shaw), and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) were riding on the boat, called the Orca, to kill the giant great white shark, that had eaten some people on the beach in Amity Island. "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" won the Best Picture Oscar over this movie and "Dog Day Afternoon". The fact is that this movie is rated PG. It should have been rated PG-13 because of the violence in it and it is not a movie for younger kids to watch. But, it is a cinematic masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>It's not just 'the best shark film!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing people call Jaws `the best shark film ever made' is like calling Princess Di `the best-looking parent of Prince William!' It's factual, but it's certainly darning it with faint praise! (And, other than its sub-par sequels, WERE there any other `shark' movies???)That aside, Jaws is one of those films that started out fairly high in my estimation and continues to climb as years go by. I was actually a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it at the theatre as a 12-year-old. This was simply because it had been the most-hyped movie of all time, up till then. I don't know WHAT I was expecting, but certainly more than a motion picture could ever provide!Later, I admitted that it was a quite good film. After college cinema class, I had to admit that it was especially well-made. As an adult, I came to consider it one of my favorite films. Finally, today, I can look back and call it one of Hollywood's finer moments. I would rate Jaws among the best 3-4 films made since 1970, and, as a recent reviewer called it, `the grand-daddy' of the action/adventure genre. (It was also the first true summer blockbuster!)So much more than a tale of a man-eating shark, Jaws captures the small-town, tourist economy that thrives on visitors. The fictitious Amity is perfectly depicted and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) is the perfect representative of this mindset. Not a bad guy, just a harried local official, mindful that the community's lifeblood depends on the brief beach season, he is out of his element when that same blood begins gushing up on the pristine white beaches. I won't go into deep details; others have already covered the key points. The then-unknown cast sparkles, the script is magnificent-especially the tremendous USS Indianapolis scene, which adds SO MUCH to the depth of the characters and also reinforces the peril that they are about to face, and the cinematography is outstanding. The live shark footage from Australia, combined with a few limited close-ups of `Bruce,' is a deft touch. Of course, John Williams' music helps make it what it is, too.Little human touches, like the youngest Brody boy imitating his father's every movement at the kitchen table, make the film much more than an everyday horror/adventure flick. Another favorite moment that always makes me chuckle out loud is when Michael (Chris Rebello) is in his new rowboat. Brody (Roy Schneider) harshly orders him out of the boat. Mrs. Brody (Lorraine Gary) scolds Brody for his actions (actually making him change his mind), only to see the painting in the book he was holding, of a shark ramming its snout through a wooden rowboat &amp; scream `Did you HEAR your father? Get OUT of that boat!' :o)There's even a built-in trivia question: `What's ironic about the title?' Answer: `It's about a shark and sharks HAVE no jaws!' Food for thought?er?excuse me?poor choice of words, there, under the circumstances! ;o)This is a must-see, if anyone has somehow missed it.</fullReview>

In the film, it is called Amity island, the place where a new england police chief finds out about a huge white shark near the beaches. Although he worries about what could happen, he dosen't want to close the beaches during the summer vacation. (the summers on M.V. are still crowded to date!) After a young boy is killed by the ferocious shark, a scientist comes to the island to help determine the fact if the shark exists, and or it's whereabouts. After a while, a shark hunter helps them both, by taking them out on his boat, and having a final showdown with the shark. The movie stars Roy Sheider, Richard Dryfess, and Robert Shaw. Another person to look for in the great classic is my father. he was captured on film while he was still working on the Steamship Authority. (he's the shadowy figure on the left pushing the door to the steamship open.) In conclusion, it is a must see film for anyone who likes sci fi, action horror. the classic was made a series, having the second, and last jaws films on marthas vineyard. i recommend this movie over all the other jaws films, even though the second one was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're gonna need a bigger boat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** (spoilers) When Steven Spielberg was only 27 years old, a young-and-coming director, he read Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, JAWS. He read it over and over again, and finally came to the conclusion that a good movie could be made about this suspenseful book.The words "Good movie" in that sentence could be the understatement of the decade. Spielberg's 1975 suspense thriller, JAWS, is respected as one of the best movies of its genre ever to be made. It boasts a great cast, with Roy Scheider as Amity Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a young ichthyologist who comes to help out Amity with the shark problems it has, and Robert Shaw as Quint, a crazy old sailor who has been in one battle too many. Lorraine Gary co-stars as Brody's worrier wife Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as Amity's mayor who seems to care more about the economy of the summer resort more than the safety of the citizens.JAWS starts out simple enough. A young woman is killed in the water one morning, and Chief Brody reluctantly accepts Mayor Larry Vaughn's decision to keep the beaches open. But then the tables turn on him. When there is another attack, drastic measures are taken as the beaches are reluctantly closed by Vaughn, and many fisherman are sent to kill the shark. The fisherman do catch a man-eating tiger shark, but Matt Hooper declares that it is not the shark and proves it when he and Brody do an autopsy and find no remains of the second victim, who would still be in the shark's stomach even after a day or so. When Hooper finds a great white shark tooth in the hull of a wrecked fishing boat (then drops it when he finds something else in the hull of the boat), he declares that a Great White Shark is living off the shore of Amity Island. Mayor Vaughn won't hear of it, however, and states that the beaches will be open for the fourth of July. When there is yet another attack, Brody decides to take matters into his own hands and pay a fisherman named Quint $10,000 to catch and kill the shark. Quint decides to take Brody and Hooper along for the ride.Then comes the second half of JAWS, which takes place entirely on Quint's vessel, the ORCA. When a feeble attempt at catching the shark on hook and line fails, Quint decides to take on a different tactic. When he sees that the shark is 25 feet long and over 6,000 pounds, he decides to stick a barrel in the shark to wear him down and bring him to the surface. After one barrel, though, the shark goes under the water, and the three-man crew settle down for dinner.The next scene includes one of the longest, most memorable speeches in movie history, as Quint tells Brody and Hooper about his days on the U.S.S Indianapolis. He decribes that 1,100 soliders went into the water, but only 316 came out, as the rest either drowned or were killed by sharks, and he the crew were only rescued sfter five long days of waiting in the water. The speech tells the audience how Quint became a crazy old fisherman and why he hunts sharks for a living.After Quint's speech, the shark attacks the ORCA, which leads to the engines being slightly damaged, lights going out, and water getting everywhere. The next morning, Quint and Hooper see that the barrel is up, and try to snag it, but then the shark runs away as Brody tries to make a distress phone call to the Coast Guard. Quint stops him, however, and he then puts another two barrels into the shark. When the barrels surface, the shark gets revenge by filling the ORCA's engines even more with salt water, though Quint manages to get a third barrel into it. But as the ORCA starts to sink, everything seems hopeless.However, Hooper propses a strategy to Quint; getting into his "anti-shark cage" and trying to stab the shark with a poisonous pole in the water. To Hooper's dismay, however, he loses the pole and flees from the cage for his life as the shark rips it apart.As the shark surfaces and sinks the stern of the ORCA, Quint accidently slides down the deck and is bitten in half in a horrifying scene that shows the shark coming back to finish the job from his Indianapolis days thirty years eariler.The only person left to possibly be able to fight the shark is Brody, who is able to throw one of Hooper's "explodable" oxygen tanks into the shark's mouth, then grab Quint's M-1 rifle and take shots at the shark's mouth from the mast, trying to hit the tank. On his sixth shot, he penetrates the steel tank and blows up the shark in a scene that many people in theaters cheered on. When Hooper surfaces, he and Brody kick their way toward Amity and safely arrive, with the shark dead.It's a great story, and was also very powerfully acted. Shaw, who actually also wrote the Indianapolis speech, was easily the best actor in the movie, and I think he should have won Best Actor even over the likes of Jack Nicholson in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Not to be counted out, Scheider filled in the slot of Chief Brody admirably, and the final scene where he kills the shark is amazing.I did find two flaws in JAWS, however. First off is the big one: the shark itself. Spielberg did a great job to edit out most of the scenes with the shark in it, but there were still some scenes that showed the shark as not being very good. It actually kind of looks like it's made out of rubber, and I'm not kidding. In the scene where it launches itself onto the stern of the ORCA, it looks like one of those bathtub sharks that a 3-year-old plays with, so I think the shark could have been better, even though it was only 1975, and they didn't have great special effects back then.The last flaw isn't nearly as big, and only really bad movie critics would point it out, but I thought I had to anyway. When Brody kills the shark, he shoots an oxygen tank that is lodged in its mouth, and it explodes. That isn't very realistic-though if that situation really did occur, shooting the tank MIGHT kill the shark anyway. But there wouldn't be an explosion. Quoting Spielberg, "People have believed what I've done for the past two hours. I think they'll believe what I'll show them in the last five minutes".Despite these minor flaws, JAWS was a great movie, easily one of the best of the 1970s, and it deserves to be recognized as it is today. Oh, and as for the Oscars: ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST was good and all, but give JAWS a break; it deserved at least one of the five major Oscar Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY well done flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly great movie. The idea that something so simple as a shark can terrorize an entire community and drive the citizens to such drastic measures is pure genius. For the JAWS guru, it's really about more than a shark that swims around and eats people; it is a perfect machine, too cunning in its natural instincts to make a decision between good and evil; in the shark's mind, there is only food. The fact that it can so easily outwit some of the most skilled men is fascinating and at the same time terrifying. Even without the plot, this is still a fantastic movie. The cinematography is excellent (anyone who remembers the head popping out of the boat can attest to that), and the use of camera angles instead of actually showing the shark (until the last few scenes) is a brilliant idea.The acting was one of the best uses of method acting since Bogey left the screen,which worked out quite well. One of the best examples of this can be seen in Robert Shaw's account of the sinking of the Indianapolis, which was mostly ad-libbed. Also, before JAWS, there were not any good movies (generally) that came out in the summer; JAWS was the first of the summer blockbusters, bringing in almost $260,000,000 in its first year. With its great plot, bang-up acting and terrific cinematography, this flick is definitly one of the essentials for any avid moviewatcher's repertoire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely this film must rate as one of the best horror movies of all time. The cinematography was excellent and tantalizing views from the shark's perspective and glimpses in the first half of the film combined with that score by John Williams resulted in a movie which was titillating in its horror. The theme is quintessentially "Shark"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up in a town where they set shark nets at our most popular beaches, that still fail to keep all sharks out, you develop a healthy respect for those fish. So it's only natural to watch Jaws.Once more they played Jaws on TV and once more I watched it through it's entirety. This is such a great movie! You can empathise with Brody and Hooper, as well as the Quint-as-Ahab character.The only thing that dates this movie are the bad clothes and hairstyles.No movie since has come close for the right mixture of humour, suspense, chills and thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Released in the summer of 1975</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only 11 years old when I saw this film and it gave me a awareness of water safety I have never known. And from there it gave a whole new meaning about the creatures of the deep and their contact with them when you're in the water and what to do if they come your way. This movie serves as a reminder of the dangers that are out there on our beaches these days especially with the recently attacks on people.That movie was "Jaws". Released in the summer of 1975 and this was the movie that gave theatregoers the term "summer blockbuster" long before the onslaught of George Lucas' spacesaga would invade theatres two years later. This would go on to be the #1 boxoffice draw during that year and eventually received an Oscar nomination for its musical score from composer John Williams.Since this is based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same title(who would go on to put two other novels out based on monster sea creatures as well including "The Deep"-which was made into a movie starring Nick Nolte in 1977,and "The Beast"-which was made into a TV-movie about a giant killer squid)and it is about a killer shark who wrecks havoc on a seaside community in Massachusetts during a July the 4th activity fest.About the movie,what is there to say? First off,you have the elements of a good suspense thriller(which director Steven Spielburg takes cues from Alfred Hitchcock for suspenseful techniques),and one hell of an action/horror flick that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat because you'll never know what to expect next. "Jaws" was one scary movie and to this day it still holds that effect. Steven Spielburg's first foray into suspense garnered him status and praise as a director and he still has that in some of movies he does turned out(from the breathtaking sequences in "Close Encounters","Raiders Of The Lost Ark", "E.T.",to his latest projects "Minority Report"and others).This is the first. A Grand Classic from the golden age of 70's cimema. Kudos to Roy Scheider(Brody),Robert Shaw(Quint),Richard Dreyfuss(Harper),and Lorraine Gary for making it happen. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How amazingly griping this film is. i saw the cover of this movie in a blockbuster when i was 6 or 7 and it practically called me to it. and i begged my mom to rent if for me. she saw it as a teen when it first came out and it terrified her and she didn't want to...but i won. she said i would be sorry...and i kinda was.it was absolutely terrifying! i couldn't sleep that night. i haven't been able to go in the ocean beyond knee deep since.here's my review (possible SPOILERS) first of all, a lot of people complain that you don't see the shark until over an hour and a half into the movie. well if you know anything about horror films you'll notice that it rises the feeling of fear in people when they don't see the "monster" that takes the fun away from your imagination. i think it helps the film be a better film. (it wasn't even planed) Robert, Roy, and Richard are all fabulous. Murray is great too. some people don't understand why there was more attention on the people rather than the shark. the big fight over what to do about the shark and saving the town's money shows just how arrogant and selfish people can be in that situation. i don't know what it's like to own a business, but if i was in their position i would gladly close the beach for a few days instead of promoting it, just so people can be attack then have no business at all. and the struggles between the three main characters are very realistic. poor Brody is the new police chief and has to deal with EVERYONES problems and fights to do what's in everybody's best interest. Mat Hooper, the scientist, is treated like S*** because he's richer and educated and they don't want to admit that he's right. Quinn does have that captain Abraham from Moby Dick going on but it isn't the same. he suffered a major shark attack during the war and wants revenge. the best element in the movie is the score. chills you right to the bone. who needs to see the shark when they start to play that music. i do consider this a classic because i have to watch it a few times a year at least. only classics do that to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Jaws is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's five best films. Expert cinematography, well-chosen cast, and John William's infamous ominous score make this a feature you'll find either hokey or horrifying. I found it the latter. Roy Scheider is excellent as police chief/father and no one can possible replace Robert Shaw as Quint. All his mannerisms and actions seem 100% suited for a grizzled shark hunter like him. Probably some of the most gruesome deaths ever on celluloid. Watch this and never swim again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The all-time classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is, quite simply, my favourite movie, of any genre, of all time. A true blockbuster, it brought a new kind of fear to the movie-goer, and director Steven Spielberg holds us spellbound with masterly sleight of hand throughout the glorious two hours.My own feelings are that "Jaws" should have been a pure-and-simple one-off. After all, how do you top a classic like that? It was questionable, at best, to bring out the first sequel in 1978, although it passes as watchable. The third in the series in 1983 was poor, and the last, in 1987, was quite laughable. I cannot make my mind up as to whether these sequels devalue the classic original, or merely serve to remind us of the first film's greatness. But there is no doubt that after 1975, the series had lost its bite (pun most definitely intended).Finally, I can thoroughly recommend watching the film on DVD. If you haven't experienced this, do yourself a big favour and invest in one. Then, to add to the effect, use headphones, darken the room and enjoy the brilliant combination of John Williams' superb score and Spielberg's chilling opening scene. I have been watching this movie for 27 years and still love it every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The First time I saw this movie (about 8 Years ago) On my 7th Birthday Eve, My Dad rented this movie so we could watch it at night. I was terrified! I didn't find Child's play scary even though I viewed it while I was 5, Leprechaun wasn't scary either (Viewed at age 8), but this was FREAKY! I was always fascinated by Sharks,(and scared of them!) So, this movie scared me silly! Now, 8 years later (I'm 15 now), I once again viewed the movie on DVD. The first scene had great atmosphere and suspense as the girl went swimmming alone and her boyfriend was drunk on the beach. She swims out into the night, then she suddenly Jerks to the left and the right and then under the water. Shark attacks follow and the Mayor refuses to close the beaches because of the 4th of July Celebrations. I thought that was incredibly stupid of him and kept mentally ushering the Mayor to "Go In the Water! Go In the Water!" and to the Shark "Eat the Mayor! Eat the Mayor!" Great Movie! Classic in points of Horror and Atmosphere. My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pauline Kael herself reported that she laughed hysterically throughout "Jaws", and one can certainly see why: on one of its levels it functions as a parody of "monstrous nature run amok" movies. But Spielberg here has borrowed much from Hitchcock's "The Birds", which was certainly more than simply demonstrative of how powerful nature can be (although that is surely one of its thousand thematic strands), and so it almost necessarily transcends that parody. Self-reflexively misogynistic and heroically, brazenly homoerotic, Spielberg--who even this early clearly had a sort of Hitchcockian, choice-by-infintismal-choice intuitive control on the set--proves himself nor for the first nor last time to be much more ideologically complicated and rich an artist than many reactionarily "leftist" critics would like to believe.

		<fullReview>I've seen Jaws a couple of times but it never wears out. That's always anindication for a good movie. I'd also go as far to say that Jaws is as much a perfect movie as you will ever see. Acting, Story, Score, Direction.This one's got it all. People who complain that it's not believable should ask themselves why they go to the movies in the first place. Why bother to watch Star Wars or Indiana Jones or the Matrix. Because those movies allow you to escape the real world for a few hours and take you to another place where you don't ask if it's plausible or not. Jaws does the same thing. And in my opinion it does it better than any other movie I have yet seen. So many movies touch you, makeyou cry, scare you, make you laugh. But Jaws not only scares you it scars you for the rest of your life. I'm 28 years old now, I first saw Jaws when I was seven or eight, and I will never ever forget it. Now I jump out of planes as a skydiver, I jump off buildings as a bungee jumper, I race cars in my free time, but not a million horses will get me into the open sea again. Show me another movie that can do that to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let me fool you, Jaws is not a bad movie, in fact it is very technically well made. The acting is good, the score is perfect, and the premise is interesting. Most of all, it really does change the way you think about the water. I, for one, can never again swim in the ocean without hearing John Williams' score in my head and imagining a dorsal fin just off to my left...ugh. But why is that so special? Whoever thought about camping the same way after Friday the 13th, who thought about answering the phone alone after Scream, and picking up strangers after The Hitcher? Yes, it makes you afraid to go into the water, but it IS a film about a killer shark, so shouldn't it do that anyways? Any director could have made you afraid of a shark, who isn't? People act like they were never afraid of anything in the ocean until they saw this movie. Like they never heard of a shark until this. Hello, it was 1975, people were swimming in the sea millions of years before the movie, and yes, they were all afraid of sharks. All Jaws did was bring your attention to it more. Personally when the shark was not eating, I was really bored. Sure, the characters were fine, but I wanted more action. What I get is the three main actors hunting the shark forever (it seemed like that long) on a boat and getting on each others' nerves. Not one of the greatest films of all time. Slow paced, dull, and downright uninteresting except when the shark attacks. I watched it once, but I wouldn't watch it again. Not unless I was really bored. WAY overrated and illogical (sharks don't feed on humans as a food source) and I can't believe it's so popular. WHAT is it about this movie?</fullReview>

The death scenes especaly Quint's were grusome (at least they were at the time, it's no Nightmare/Halloween 2/Jason gore fest). The acting is superb, Roy scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss should have all won gold, Dreyfuss for supporting and Scheider And Shaw as a tie for best. The later is unlikely I know but hey that's my opinion. There are some who even think (i.e. Me and My Father) that Dreyfuss won for Goodbye Girl (in which he also delivers a great performance) because the Academy felt they should have given it to him for Jaws. You especaly won't want to miss the Orca scene(s), perhaps the greatest in movie history. To get the full impact, if you can watch it on a big screen at the beach, close to the fourth of July is even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an awesome movie. After all this time has past it is still the best of its kind. I always thought that the black, emotionless eyes on the shark were its scariest features, aside from its huge jaws. This is my favorite Steven Spielberg movie. I liked the way that Steven Spielberg only showed the shark actually eating a person, and it was the most bloody and horrific scene in the whole movie. Spielberg's directing tactics really show in this movie, like the way you could see through the shark's point of view.I liked pretty much all of the characters in this movie, but most of all, I liked Robert Shaw as Quint. He was the best character, partly because he was so insane. He is like Captain Ahab, and Jaws is like Moby Dick. I also liked Roy Sheider as the reluctant hero, and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper, who was basically the comedy sidekick, but still a great character. All of them made 'Jaws' not only terrifying, but also a good character development movie.Of course the best scenes are the very last scenes, which have gone from suspenseful to really suspenseful. My only regret is that so many God awful sequels had to be made. Those are some of the worst movies ever made. 'Jaws', though, is one of my favorite movies. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great man against nature, intense ride, because this is the best of its kind. Jaws is still a timeless classic, and it always will be. 10/10</fullReview>

I was thinking of buying the DVD and I did and I was happy that I bought it. I love this movie because Steven Spielberg directed that movie and Roy Scheider stars in it too. He's a great actor.

		<fullReview>Not many films have the power to keep me in suspense everytime I watch them. JAWS is one of the few that does. I've seen it countless times, and I still find myself captured by the suspenseful each time. A terrific lead cast (Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw) highlight Spielberg's intense ride of a great white shark menacing a small East Coast island community during the Fourth of July holiday. Spielberg does a great job of capturing the small town island life before moving things to the claustrophobic setting of a lone ship at sea. Thanks to on-set mechanical problems, "Bruce" the shark (as he was called during filming, named after Spielberg's lawyer at the time) is kept hidden from the audience for much of the movie, making his first appearance in the film a moment that shocks not only Scheider's police chief Brody, but the audience as well.The interplay between the three lead stars is what makes the film interesting, though we end up not really knowing a whole lot about Brody and Dreyfus's Matt Hooper. Shaw's Quint, by far, delivers the most intriguing backstory, telling the two men about his time on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a story that is both exciting and (thanks to John Williams' music) haunting at the same time. The scenes in which the men are attempting to capture the shark are exciting and suspenseful, culminating in the final attack that sees Brody as the only one left to take care of things, and he does so in a truely ingenious way.Through the whole film we're drawn in by these characters and come to connect with them. We care about what happens to them, and that's what a good movie should do. Along with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, this is my favorite Spielberg movie that I still consider one of his absolute best. And knowing all the problems they encountered in getting it made, it's really a miracle that it turned out as fantastic as it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a movie fan (if not why are you here?) then Jaws requires no introduction or explanation. The plot has been rehashed many times in mostly inferior films, but even after my umpteenth viewing it still seems fresh. The acting is brilliant with Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw creating exciting, funny and scary scenes with ease - these guys make acting look effortless. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also deserve a mention as Ellen Brody and Mayor Vaughn. Both perform brilliantly.The film still looks great and despite the dated special effects, it holds together really well. The soundtrack is excellent and contains one of the most recognizable movie themes ever. Despite the fact that I was disappointed with the extras offered on the DVD (no commentary, pathetically inadequate out-takes) it's definitely worth owning as you'll watch this movie again and again. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of folks have written favorable reviews of this film and they're absolutely right.I would like to comment, however, on what for me was the greatest experience I ever had at the movies. "Jaws" played for over 6 months at the same theater during it's initial run in 1975. This was before the era of 3,000 screen saturation openings at large megaplexes. Word of mouth really built up about this film and I knew that I had to see it.The Golf Mill Theater in Niles, IL was the place to go and I went on a Saturday night with a high school date. It was the wildest, loudest movie audience I had ever experienced. The men yelled, the women screamed and people were hiding behind the seats. A teenage girl sitting near me sobbed hysterically every time we heard John Williams' shark theme. Women were grabbing onto guys they didn't even know and I think I broke the armrest of my chair. You should have seen all those rocking seats fly back when that shark leaped out of the water.When the film was over the audience stayed in their seats and applauded the credits. It was an incredible and exhausting two hours. This was a time of large, single screen movie houses that would seat over 1,000 people and I believe every one of those chairs was occupied that night. It was as rowdy as any sporting event and there was a real thrill in seeing that we all had the same reaction to this fine film.We had no idea who this young director was and we didn't really care at the time. "Jaws" was the movie to see that summer and people were lining up around the block to get in.Whenever I hear a critic or columnist describe some action movie as a "rollercoaster" I'm always a little dubious. I rode the best in the summer of '75. Thank you, Mr Speilberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's timeless introduction and all round classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film that genuinely scared the pants off me. But it is also saddening, to realize that it is because of this film, that sharks now are on the endangered list. But enough philosophy. From the opening scene which has to be one of the most effective in movie history to the final battle between Brody and the beast,the tension never stops. Thats what separates it from the other lesser monster films and earned Spielberg the right to become one of Hollywood's most powerful directors. But just as important is John Williams, whose score would have to be as well known as the American National Anthem.This was the score that allowed his genius to continue with The Star Wars Series and to dismiss it, is just wrong. Overall the sequels(although I did enjoy 2) just couldn't compete with the relentless suspense or pulse pounding power that everyone (from Spielberg to Scheider)were able to project into this monster flick, which created a new breed of monster film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely great! I just watched it again recently, after I hadn't seen it in several years. And it does get better every time you see it. The three lead actors are brilliant in their roles. Their interactions with one another makes "Jaws" more than just a story about a shark. The way each man is a foil to the other two makes for a very interesting story, and it's great to see how they all feel about each other at the end, after their incredible adventure. "Jaws" is a classic movie that has to be seen by everyone at least once. And trust me, it gets better each time you see it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws, like The Godfather, spawned many copycat movies after it. It is unfortunate that The "Jaws" series only contains one good film, the original. I think that they should sell the original by itself and sell the rest of the half-assed Jaws films by themselves. Jaws is certainly one of the most incredible films of all time.There are few movies that have chemistry of this magnitude. I can't imagine anyone else in the roles played by Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss. I think my favorite aspect of the movie was how it resembled Moby Dick in the modern era. You have your politicians worried about the town's economy, the young zealot from the oceanographic institute with all of his high tech gear, and mixed in with the new, you've got Captain Quint: an good old-fashioned fisherman whose got more trophies on his wall than Teddy Roosevelt.This film has never gotten boring.</fullReview>

Robert Shaw could not have been better. Roy Sheider and Richard Dryfuss were equally outstanding. They just dont make em' like this anymore. No movie has ever equalled the downright hysteria that this 'Jaws' created back in the Summer of 75'.....If a bigger blockbuster comes along---I hope I'm around to see it. Some movies may have grossed more $ dollars than "Jaws" since its release--but dont forget....it only cost $1 to see it back then ! I give 'JAWS' a 9.5----or nine stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Jaws and Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to write a review of Jaws because it would be almost impossible to write more good things about this movie as all my colleagues and other film buffs have done; I'm just want to give my point of view about the Spielberg's film, comparating Jaws and Saving Private Ryan. I'll give you some points to think about it:- These two films starts with a very impressive and scaring scene (Chrissie's death and the Omaha Beach sequence)- They've got two main monologues, which make you move; the Indianapolis story and the Captain Miller's monologue about his life as High School Teacher.- Spielberg prefers to show the impressive things using his characters, I mean, when Hendricks found Chrissie's hand, we see his face full of horror before watching the hand; in the same way, Captain Miller's slow motion sequences shows his point of view of the war horror.- In Jaws, the starrings prepare a cage to hunt the shark; it's a unvoiced scene, you just hear the great William's music; in Saving Private Ryan, when the characters are in Rammel, they prepare traps for the Germans; Spielberg doesn't use any dialogue in that scene, just William's music. If you pay attention, you'll find these two scenes very similar not only as a film but as a music film.- Spielberg uses a lot of graphical violence, something he hasn't used since Jaws - despite Schindler's List, that I don't find as graphical as Jaws or Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was released three years before I was born, but as I watch it even now in 2001, I don't notice that the Mayor's car on the ferry is a mid-seventies model, or Hooper's long curly hair or even the period-specific clothing. What I see is a film that could just as easily been released in 1999 for all the viewer is concerned.The cinematography and acting are exceptional. I'm sure most of the reviews of this film have been good and this will simply be yet another compliment, but hey, when it's good, it's good! Forget the sequels, they only detract.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with a few small flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slickly made suspense with effective attack scenes, good acting and characterisation.When viewed today, in the politically-correct 2000s, what seems bizarre in this film is the mercenary attitude of many of the characters. Few of the characters seem to experience the horror and dread that viewers of the film would probably be feeling. At worst they are in denial and are shown to be more worried about the financial effect if the beaches are closed than the actual deaths that have occurred. In all we see very little of the effects the deaths have had on others.The direction is mostly very good, with lots of great camerawork. One minor irritation is Spielberg's insistence on slotting in some brief comedy asides, and then repeating them in case we didn't get it the first time.SPOILER: The jetty scene is humorous and suspenseful at the same time. Unfortunately the awkward dubbed-in repeat of the whiny "Can I go home now?" is not funny and sounds out of place given that the fishermen would likely be in shock (not to mention cold) after the near-death experience in the water. There are a couple of other instances of this occurring in the film.I also thought the film was let down by the ending. The final few scenes seemed a bit rushed after the huge amount of running time devoted to showing the three hunters aboard the boat in the final third of the film. It's like they filmed all these great dialogue scenes and then thought "Oooops, we'd better end all this quickly". After long lives spent surviving sharks, it is like everyone realises how long the film is getting and so suddenly the characters are falling over themselves to lose their footing on deck or go for a swim and become shark food. As it is the ending seems very rushed and implausible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a superb masterpiece of film-making. Released in 1975, this film about a 25-ft. great white shark terrorizing tourists at a summer resort town, went on to become the first summer blockbuster. Adapted from Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, and directed by Steven Spielberg, "Jaws" is classic entertainment, as well as a pop-culture icon. Excellent and believable performances from Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss, along with the score by John Williams, make this an enjoyable film from start to finish. With very intense scenes woven with creative camerawork, this film will continue to captivate and frighten many more generations to come. You must see this if you haven't. You'll be glad you did. My rating: 11 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Jaws and I still go in the ocean even though I've seen this movie about a hundred times. I love watching JAWs. It's probably Spielberg's best film to date, sorry Schindler's List, E.T., and Saving Private Ryan. This movie does not leave you with any bad feelings. The movie is first entertaining from beginning to end and it is well-done. I love Roy Scheider in his role as the water phobic police chief, Lorraine Gary as his wife, Murray Hamilton who I always mistake for Hal Holbrook as the Mayor of Amity, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter, and Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert. Anyway, there are great moments in the film like when Chief Brody catches his young son imitating him at the dining room table and asks him for kiss and Mrs. Brody watching with a cup in hand. It's those moments of pure magic that make you want to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Horror Film and a Cultural Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no more instantly recognizable phrase of movie music. None. The low repetitive, tension building bass violin. No other movie has also so massively created paranioa. This movie ranks with The Godfather for shaping forever the public's perception of its central theme.The shark is not shown in this movie until about 2/3 of the way in and that is central to its horror. The ultimate enemy is the one you cannot see and cannot predict. This movie also lets you inside the sharks pysche, for lack of a better term, when oceanographer Dreyfuss gives his speech on the shark being "the perfect engine". A nonhuman villian is described in terms that we can understand and completely fear.There is a lot of small town hokeyness to this film. Robert Shaw is a little over the top (but great) and there is the perfunctory subplot of the mayor who doesn't want the beach closed in peak season. But is all works in the context of this groundbreaking, edgy film, which at the time, was the #1 grossing film of all time.I give the strongest recommendation to this film as a great piece of horror, but also as a view of the work of a young Speilberg. Required viewing for all movie fans - one of the best films ever made. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Phantom Menace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that struck me upon watching `Jaws' again recently was how little we see the shark. I remembered the shark being in this movie much more, and killing many more people, but the actual film is different. Instead, the film relies much more on suspense than on shock ? you know the shark is out there, but you don't know where he is or when he will appear. It makes the time he does appear than much more powerful.There's a lesson to be learned here, filmmakers: less is more. The anticipation of the event is much more powerful than the event itself. Hitchcock understood that; Spielberg understands it (or did back when he made `Jaws,' not too sure anymore). A movie need not move from shock to shock, from special effect to stunt; if there is a story, it will have legs of its own. `Jaws' works because it plays on our fear of the unknown, of being eaten alive, of the deep water and what might be down there. It's real fear, much more personal and chilling than any werewolf or vampire because we know there are such things in the oceans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it. For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975. This was a big deal to an eleven-year-old kid. I doubt if he remembers, but I always will. Just like I'll remember how I wouldn't swim in the neighborhood pool for the rest of that summer after watching this Spielberg classic. I also recall the precedence that this film set in the horror genre by opening the movie with a scene in which the monster claims a victim. This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning. `You can't do that' he exclaimed, `you have to have clues leading up to creature, then something happens!' Even at that age I realized that this was shaking things up. Soon a slew of nature vs. man flicks inundated the market and each had a creature (be it grizzly bear, piranha, etc) start the movie off with a violent episode. Of course this is a fantastic scare-flick, but the reason it has stood the test of time (and the shame of ersatz sequels) is that is more than a frightening movie. The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed. From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to. Not to mention the clever nuances (during the scar-comparing badinage Brody slightly lifts his shirt and glances at a scar that you can tell he wants to mention, but obviously decides not to-and this leaves the moment more fulfilling by what is not said) and the side bars (the implied conflict between Brody and his wife and their current residence, the disparity between Hooper and Quint, etc) that add verisimilitude to the work. Also adroitly included are adumbrations such as the `Welcome to Amity' sign, and Quint sailing by with a large grin as the fisherman hang the tiger shark up thinking they have caught the beast in question (we share this irony with Quint and it's very enjoyable) as well as quick scenes (the overweight lady heading into the water) that we like as we watch the movie but don't remember when later on we try to explain why we like this film so much. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic of the 1970's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** A Superb Horror Classic! It is hard to find something wrong with this film. Personally, I would classify it as a suspense thriller, because of the reality factor of a great white shark that has got to be exterminated. A horror involves inconceivable creatures from beyond like FREDDY in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or DRACULA.JAWS awakens a fear in all of us that is familiar ( perhaps that explains the popularity of the film) which is further accentuated by that spine-chilling musical score when the shark is about to attack. Perhaps this is only my imagination, but you won't see smiles on people's faces when they see JAWS, because they recognise the familiar fear of standing waist-deep in water or paddling with a surfboard without really knowing the territory beneath them.This is of course where DEEP BLUE SEA fails terribly. People actually laugh at DBS, because they know they are in for something like: Shark meets Frankenstein versus Alien on the set of THE ABYSS with crappy computer graphics.SPOILER WARNINGIf I'm forced to find something wrong with JAWS then there would be this one scene where the shark leaps out of the water and actually bumps against the backside of Quint's boat with its stomach. It is a very short scene in the last 20 minutes of the film, but the `mechanical man-made' shark is very clear in this scene.Quint was also a tough character, but why did the shark had to devour him? In my opinion he should have lived.SPOILER ENDNevertheless, JAWS is the Classic shark horror of all times!9 out of 10.</fullReview>

There is a island beach community that is expecting tourist season anhd Sheriff Brody must dispell rumors of shark attacks. Along with the help of a young shark expert and an old crusty shark hunter they go out for the most scary adventure on the water. I sure know Jaws made me affraid to swim in the water.

		<fullReview>The most thrilling and most suspenseful scene I have ever seen in my 18 years of movie-watching is the scene in "Jaws" where the fisherman is pulled into water by "the great fish" and is struggling to get out of the water before the broken dock comes within twenty feet of him. The shot where the dock turns around is one of the only times I actually find myself biting my nails. This film contains some of the best ideas ever concieved. I saw it first when I was seven and I have never gone out more than five feet into the ocean. It's suspense is masterful and the only thing that has enough class to come close to it is the shower scene of "Psycho". One of my favorites and the true American summer classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many will fail to realize that the strongest character of all throughout the film was Quint, which probably didn't survive in the movie simply because Spielberg isn't like him (he stated so indirectly in "Saving Private Ryan", when he identified himself with the low-life pathetic coward Upham).Quint wasn't just any fisherman.A real human being, with anger, fear and regrets, he is THE ONLY character that gave this movie the depth that only history, world-changing events and/or a man's past can give.He is possibly the least "spielberg-looking" character of all (watch more Spielberg movies for reference), and it comes as no surprise when he steals every single scene he's in.Quint, with his colorful personality, did tons more for the film than any of the others could have. You take away that character, and the film loses a lot.Also, although probably not true, sometimes I wonder if the fact of Robert Shaw not being an american had anything to do with his disregard as an oscar nominee in this film, for his portrayal of Quint.Without Quint, this movie wouldn't even be half of what it became.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally I watched this film as a nipper, it's probably the only film that after watching it again as the adult i`ve turned into I cant find fault with. In fact the film impresses me more with each viewing.The acting, directing, dialogue and camerawork (who can forget that scene when the camera zooms towards Scheider on the beach, whilst also pulling focus to see the disturbed look on his face as a swimmer is about to be chomped) are all superb. The fact that you never actually see the shark until the final sequences heightens the sense of tension throughout the film. Also the relationships between Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss characters are enduring to watch.So I guess you'd say I liked this film, and you'd be right. To me it's an all time classic that's passed the test of time.Unfortunately the studio decided to cash in and make some appalling sequels, which you should avoid like swimming in shark-infected waters with an open wound.Classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film; Best Picture of 1975</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Jaws is a film I don't think I'll ever grow tired of. This is one of the most thrilling action films ever made. And what better place to set a thriller than on the water. The characters in Jaws are unlike your "typical action stars"; they have emotions and are geniunely human. The cinematography and script are also both outstanding. John Williams' score is perhaps his best work and Jaws itself is a well-crafted, somewhat believable antagonist. Pretty much everything in this film works and Spielberg has several themes represented throughout, family being one of them, as it is a strong point in many of Spielberg's works. And I also believe that this film is better and should have beaten out One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for Best Picture of 1975 at Oscar time. Either way, don't miss this one, a near classic that is a memorable film experience.Won three Oscars including Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Sound and Best Editing (1975).****1/2 /5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Summer Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is the ultimate summer film, although if you are heading to the beach you may not want to view it! Now 25 years later, the special effects are a little dated, but the story and the acting are still superb. The trio of Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfus carry out excellent performances in their roles, bringing the characters from the book to life with style. The build up of the panic at the shore town of Amity and the exceptional musical score by John Williams make this one of Spielberg's most memorable films to date. The sequels never captured the glory and suspense of this first film. This film has had a lasting impact on our culture and on future films of this genre. It kept me out of the ocean for most of my childhood, and still makes me look twice at the surf before entering...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rollercoaster ride with a great cast.A rocket ride launched by Steven Spielberg himself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is simply the kind of film that wraps around us,making us at times feel vulnerable and at times,hyped up with fear and excitement.A movie with hardly any special effects(Oh, yeah!There was the mechanical shark that was built by production designer Joe Alves.)The film which was adapted by Peter Benchley's best selling novel delivers to the fullest and 'till this day,is still considered one of the best films ever made and was the first to break the one hundred million dollar mark,creating the box office trend.Roy Scheider is Chief Brody who must save a community from the savage undersea killer.Roy Scheider could probably be called the first Sigourney Weaver.Teaming up with Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw,The movie becomes so tense that at times we forget that this is just a movie.Winner of three academy awards including John William's superb heart pounding classic score,"Jaws" was the "Jurassic Park" of 1975."Jaws" could use a theatrical rerelease.Even though a 25th anniversary edition was released on VHS and DVD,we would think that Universal would have the sense to rerelease this film to a new generation.They already rereleased "The Exorcist" and they are also thinking of rereleasing "Superman:The Movie"."E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial" already has a target rerelease date for March,2002.So why not "Jaws".I would love to see a rerelease of "Jaws",even though I have seen the film over a million times.Steven Spielberg should have been recognized by the academy for directing this classic."Jaws" took a big bite out of our wallets and was well worth it."Jaws" is definitely one of the most memorable films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Greatest!!!! Truly a masterpiece of film making, and should be held in everybody's list of favourite's. The film is rich in both realism and excitement, with not a bad performance in sight, and some of the greatest put on film. Robert Shaw is truly brilliant as the hard-bitten sailor Quint. The two piece story line (first the shark attacks and the fight to put more effort into a hunt, and then the three heroes out at sea against the shark and the elements) is perfect for never losing the attention of the viewers. In case I haven't quite got my opinion across................. I like this film quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-Concept Goes Swimming-The Importance of JAWS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attending film school for four years I had the opportunity to view several different kinds of films. There was always one film however that I always retreated to when it came to writing papers and class discussions, and that, is JAWS. JAWS has been my favorite film since I was a youngster, and it wasn't until NYU Film School that I learned the true significance of the film. JAWS may very well be considered the originator of what we know today as the "high-concept" film. In director Steven Spielberg's words, a high-concept film is one in which you can describe the whole plot and theme in less than 25 words. If you can do that, then you have a hit film. While up to this time, films generally opened in the major venues first (New York and Los Angeles), and gradually opened in more and more locations, the premiere of JAWS led to what is known as saturation opening. JAWS opened in approximately 400 theaters the weekend of July 4th, 1975. This strategy worked very well for JAWS, which grossed $7 million in its opening weekend. What also helped in the success in JAWS was the media, in TV and print form. One image dominated posters, newspapers and magazines at the time of JAWS' release, and that image featured a naked woman swimming along the surface as a huge phallic shark rises up towards her. The image was accompanied by various different tag lines, but realistically, it didn't matter what the it said-the complete image of a shark, teeth agape, rising up towards a beautiful young woman had a lasting effect on whomever saw the ad. As powerful as the print images were, music played a huge role in the promotion of JAWS. On the radio and television, composer John Williams' now-legendary "JAWS theme" was heard for the first time. The film ran throughout the summer of '75, breaking every box-office record and becoming the number one moneymaker of all time, only to be eventually ousted from that coveted spot by another Spielberg picture, E.T. In an age of overly-inflated movie ticket prices and multiple viewings, JAWS, the first high concept film that redefined and resurged a lagging Hollywood film industry back in the '70s, remains in the top twenty profit-making films of all time, and also this writer's favorite film. Thank you for the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original monster movie, and the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAWS is simply an awesome movie to watch. Forget all the intellectual claims that it reinvented the Hollywood blockbuster, and invented the summer smash - it's a damn good movie. Spielberg, against all odds, persisted in his quest to make a monster movie that satisfies every angle of viewing. We are perfectly in touch with the characters and their motives, and his ability to make a rubber shark 25 years ago that still scares you is simply amazing.However Spielberg has often said that JAWS would not have been half the success it was if it wasn't for the score, and he is absolutely right. John Williams had his finest moment to date when he sat down at the piano and decided to make a main theme from 3 notes. Although it would be a crime to dismiss the score as variations on a 3-note theme. The action cues are amazing, and the recently released soundtrack is a must for every film-music buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg at his very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time a the age of six. I wish I hadn't, because it spoilt my holidays on the beach...Spielberg seems to be the only director of a JAWS-movie who understands how to make his movie scary. I mean very scary, and not laughable as the sequels are.How did he succeed in that? Because he didn't do any more than show us what we are and have always been afraid of: that there is something in the water that can attack us at any time. And we don't get to know much more than Brody (the chief of police) about the shark, and that's why we can fully identify with him: When Brody is looking in a book about sharks what these animals look like and how they attack, we look with him over his shoulder, as fascinated as he is; When Brody is uncomfortable sitting on the beach (being a guard, knowing there may be a shark around), we are.Spielberg keeps his story simple, but very effective. I couldn't find a single weakness in the entire movie, although I have seen it about 15 times or so. The first part of the movie is a lesson in how to build up tension; the second part is a fascinating 'Duel' (referring to Spielbergs debut, which is about as good as 'Jaws') between the shark and the three men. Although they don't seem to be the perfect trio to fight the shark, I think they are the best to appear in this film. At least, I can't imagine who would have played the roles of Brody, Quint and Hooper better than Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss did. Especially Robert Shaw (my favourite actor) is fantastic: I have never seen a more adorable macho than Quint. What a pity that this great actor died in 1978. I almost forgot to mention the terrifying music: couldn't have been better for 'Jaws', the ultimate horror film and my personal favourite.</fullReview>

There is just so much packed into this film it merits being seen time and time again.Peter Benchley tried many times to recapture the success of Jaws in his writings but this was the masterpiece where his often rambling novel was honed down to a superb exciting screenplay.

		<fullReview>This is classic Speilberg prior to diverting to family films. Growing up as a surfer in Australia, this is not the type of film that I would expect to be attracted to. However, the masterful suspense and tension draw me back time and time again. Not only is the mis-en-scene raw and unpolished but it is at the same time slick in only the way directors seem to be able to accomplish in their youth. Under no circumstances watch this film whilst on holidays at the beach or you won't go in the water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie Jaws is. Even today, it ranks as one of the all time greats. I'm certain if this movie was just released for the first time today, it would still be one of the all time money makers.Spielberg does everything right with this film, from its casting to script. The shark isn't even seen until halfway through the film. Never has a movie used music so well (even more so than Psycho or Halloween). I defy you to name a movie whose music is more synonymous with it than the Jaws theme is with this film. You don't realize you haven't seen the shark through the first couple attacks because the music is the shark. This film is very compatible with Spielberg's Duel. In fact, if you have a DVD player, you must buy the DVD. The documentary that comes with the film is a must for any fan. Spielberg's commentary is excellent (I love the dinosaur "roar" during the demise of both the Duel truck and the Jaws shark).As a scary film, few are better. As a film to watch simply for directorial technique, this is one of the best. So many films have stolen from this one, from "Orca" to "Godzilla" (the US version) to a plethora of others. Personally, I'd like to see Spielberg tackle another film in the thriller genre.If you're one of the few people in the world who haven't seen Jaws, get it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sea movies ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its hilarious how the age classication in movies has changed over the years.I remember when JAWS first came out, it received the most restricted age classification, (here in Portugal, and im sure everywhere). I was about 6 or 7 years at the time, and i remember that you only could get in to see this movie, if you were older than 18, (like in ALIEN). Anyone younger than 19 wasnt allowed in the theater, ( i remember watching people with their ID cards, buying tickets). Each time i looked at that JAWS poster i got extremely curious, but i knew that i would be real afraid of watching it.How things change. Now we look at JAWS and im sure now that its re-released in DVD for its 25th aniversary, with a 15 certificate, only because its the politicaly correct classification, because if it wasnt for that i bet it would get a PG certificate at the most, such is the lightness of those now famous gore scenes that seemed too creepy so many adult people back in the 70s.I dont know if there is anyone on this movie-planet that hasnt seen JAWS yet, but im speaking for those very few of you, who are still afraid. JAWS its NOT an horror movie, its an ADVENTURE movie set at sea !JAWS has less gore than any INDIANA JONES !In fact, i remember how disappointed i got ,when i saw it for the first time. After all those horror expectations from when i was a kid, JAWS turned out to be a very regular light adventure movie instead. I even thought i watched a cutted version of the movie, because i was expecting to see people getting eaten to pieces on screen and it was nothing like that. Instead of a gore movie, i got an adventure with great, positive and funny characters. Hey, i could have watched this movie when i was a kid and not get much frightened ! :-)After my inital "disappointment", i watched JAWS plenty of other times, and each time it grew on me a little more. Perhaps because i love the sea and this remains one of the best sea movies of all time. Right now what i find trully amazing in JAWS is the way in which fools the viewer into thinking he has seen more violence and gore than what actualy shows. To me this is the great achievment in this picture. I read somewhere that Spielbergs initial intention was to show lots more of the shark, but he had no budget and the rubber shark looked fake, so he decided to create suspanse instead of visuals.Thank all gods that this movie was made in the 70s, because if it was today, im sure it would only become another hollywood blockbuster filled with special effects, and a big pretty computer generated shark chewing on everybody. In fact i guess Spielberg did this modern "JAWS", its called " JURASSIC PARK" and "LOST WORLD", which are a pretty good example of how lots of special effects can make a boring and empty movie, specialy if you see it more than once. I can bet, no one will release a 25th anniversary edition of JURASSIC PARK years from now.So once again its proved that lack of money equals imagination. JAWS looks so great because of it. If you havent seen it yet, you dont know what youre missing. Go see it, rent it, or buy the new incredible DVD 25th anniversary edition which has lots of extra stuff, including a 50 minute making off.And watch it with your kids, so they can see how chicken their parents were, for being affraid of going to see a movie that nowadays could be screened in a kids matine. Actually, it should be. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER*** Oh happy days of 25 years ago. Seeing those TV trailers of a girl skinny-dipping at night, followed by the John William's motif dum-dum-dum score, then of Brody's look of dismay on the beach as another young swimmer bites the dust(seaweed?); ending with the "We need a bigger boat" and a brief glimpse of the 20 footer ("25...Three tons of him")Off I dashed to the local cinema only to find queues doubling around the block eager to see this true blockbuster. The theatre lights dimmed, the packed crowd focussed; the curtains opened. First the Universal motif followed by that awesomeDa Dum....Da Dum Da Dum...dum dum dum dum....and we're off...As a bratty 13 year old back then, raised on action movies &amp; horror novels prior to this, I have never been so scared in all my life after watching Jaws. It proves you don't have to use loads of gratuitous violence (Halloween, Scream - good movies but reliant on the visual rather than the abstract) to get your message across.Spielberg gets the ingredients spot on in every dept - the music we already know about, never has the big JW produced a more sinister motif for a movie that stays in your consciousness years after seeing the movie than this.The Editing deserves special mention because Verna Fields knows how to play with the audience, offering us brief glimpses of the horror from the deep. That's all we need, because William's score lets us know when the shark's around.The directing also is a tribute to the Big "S" himself. It's a pity he didn't win an Oscar, although I supposed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (its major rival at the time) won the sympathy vote. But Spielberg really does drive the film forward with a very tight script (pruned extensively from the rather bogged down &amp; overlong "talky" novel) and some keen cinematography that would serve him so well in years to come.But top honours have to go the three men on the boat. Scheider, Dreyfuss &amp; Shaw all confessed to hating the movie during production especially Dreyfuss who felt it would damage his mainstream intellectual movie status after starring in the acclaimed Duddy Kravitz which he was publicising at the same time as making Jaws.But the end result is a perfect chemistry between the old sea dog (Quint); the eager young know-it-all rich kid (Hooper) and the ex-New York cop wanting a quieter life in the sticks but hates water (Brody).This film is still excellent 25 years on. And I still believe it carries one of the scariest moments in all of movieland - the head in the hull of the boat had everyone in the theatre jump in unison and it still makes me whince even now.My biggest regret though was seeing the shark being blown up at the end. Afterall, the shark is only doing what it does naturally and generally doesn't bother with bathers in real life. And yet after this movie was released back in the late 70s there was an instant backlash against any shark. Sharkhunters culled them and numbers dwindled, and Jaws, initially was to blame for that.Hopefully with a more environmentally aware audience these days the re-release of Jaws will have more positive effects than before.Anyway, for those who have yet to see this glorious moment in cinema history, go see it and be scared...very..very scared.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One terrific, suspenseful and outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is one of Steven Spielberg's best films to date, and it still manages to scare the hell out of people ever since it's release 25 years ago. The plot has a great white shark terrorizing the summer resort town of Amity around the 4th of July. Chief Brody (Roy Schieder) leads an investigation and closes down the beaches after a young woman was found dismembered, but Mayor Vaughn (Larry Hamilton) objects to closing them down because the town would lose money. After several more people die, a young Icthyologist (Richard Dreyfuss), a weird fisherman (Robert Shaw) and Chief Brody team up and set out to destroy the shark before he decides to make the Amity tourists his meals. The interaction between the three leading players is nothing less than perfect. They laugh, they fight, they yell, they each have their respective differences but you all relate to them in some way. Each of them do a terrific job. The music is tense, and also became famous over the years, being parodied and imitated in numerous films and TV shows. Spielberg did a fantastic job of scaring people to go into the water and I only wish the sequels did as good of a job as this classic did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's JAWS is pure genius. Its a scary movie but a different kind without demons or devil and blood and guts. Yet its just as scary if not scarier.The story starts off as you all know with a great white shark involved in a series of killings. They decide to set out to find and kill the shark. The famous quote "We need a bigger boat." Quint played by Robert Shaw was casted perfectly because you could tell he wanted to stay out and kill the shark shown when he broke the radio and i think ran the motor out purposely to be stranded and fight the great white one on one. Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper looked just as perfect with that young and scholarly. Although they had trouble filming with the shark it still looked real and very scary. JAWS is a great thriller and adventure story that we don't see very often anymore. Its one that i own and will cherish for years to come even though i have seen it over 20 times i still enjoy it every time i watch it. By all means avoid the sequels except the second one which is decent but the other 2 are bad. Let me leave with this JAWS is a brilliant story told well and shouldn't be passed by.Rating **** out of **** (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think like a shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with almost all of the positive comments about this film. The Williams score is near perfect in adding to the suspense and is even better during the less suspenseful if not downright fun and exhilarating scenes. The film is, however, very suspenseful and the relationship story among the three lead characters and how they have to learn to tolerate and work with one another is tremendous. Far better than any other variety of mismatched partner story lines. They all have very different motivations for doing what they are doing. Quint: Revenge. Brody: to protect others. Hooper: to study and understand. Yes, it's scary and largely so because Spielberg cleverly refrains from showing us too much. What is missing from all of the comments that I have read here is that one of the things that the viewer finds himself doing is trying to figure out what the shark is thinking... It's behavior gives it so much personality that we try to understand its motives. It's not a monster. It's the fourth member of the cast and its motivations are not at all clear. That's what makes it so scary. The DTS DVD should be a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I watched this masterpiece the other night.It still puts a chill in your spine.Spielberg direction here is great.His direction is truely wonderful.For example,The setup of the shark on the little boy.You know its him before he goes onto the water.Several false scares occur.Brody is like a man waiting for it to happen.The shot of the camera zooming him is priceless.Shaw steals the film with far less screen time.He overpowers the other 2 on the boat acting wise.Hollywood will never in a billion years duplicate this film.All the sequels and copys treat as the garbage they are.AVOID JAW3 AND JAWS4 AT ALL COSTS.I truely wished they left it alone at Jaws2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Steven Spielberg's first blockbuster hit is a thrilling entertainment from beginning to end. Now 25 years old, this movie still has the power to shock you as it did when first released in 1975. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss give excellent performances in the first of four movies about a great white shark. Forget about the three sequels, none of them match the intensity and scariness of this the original. **** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first cinematic blockbuster in history and still the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about this film that makes it utterly compelling and terrifying, even on the hundredth viewing! This must be due to Spielberg's vision and his aim of perfection for this movie, even under the stress of an escalating budget the and time spent on creating a realistic mechanical shark. The film contains everything that makes a great movie - with incredible performances from the main three stars, a great script, and a storyline that uses its tension and excitement just like a rollercoaster. Ups and downs every five minutes in the suspense make it impossible to turn away for a second, while the film continues to build towards an incredible climax and the final showdown between man and shark. Spielberg knew exactly what he wanted - a thrilling rollercoaster ride that never ends, because, when it's over you just want to go back and see it again! The 25th Anniversary DVD will be huge, but the film deserves a worldwide cinematic re-release as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Steven Spieldberg's best movie ever! Stay away from all of these other shark movies. This one is very scary. It's the only one that makes you THINK about going into the water. Roy Sheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss are the perfect three to go with this movie!My favorite character is Quint (Robert Shaw) because of the great acting done by him. Look, stay awa from Deep Blue Sea, and watch this GREAT movie. Anyone who puts down this movie just think it's too hi-tech to be scary, or, some, want BETTER special effects. Stay away from these reviews. This is one of the best movies ever. it's even better than "Radiers of the Lost ARk" So go watch JAWS today, widescreen. And don't miss the DVD version that'll have all the extras!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best shark movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few can argue that "Jaws" was the best shark/sea adventure movie ever made. A plot and character-driven work of art, so many scenes are memorable that it's hard to know where to begin -- the famous "Indianapolis" scene, where Robert Shaw blows us away with his acting; Hooper's confrontation in the shark cage; Quint's mad run for shore, with the shark chasing the boat; and of course the finale where (surprise!) it's Chief Brody who scores the triumph over the shark.Some may complain about the mechanical shark, with which there were endless problems during filming. Before you do so, try to imagine it being done with computer graphics. I'd rather see a few obviously fake-looking scenes (and really, there were VERY few of these) than see that shark in (un)glorious CGI. So many movies these days take the cheap way out with computer graphics... it takes great artistry to make computer-generated images look seamless and real. Many filmmakers don't seem to realize that, or they just don't care, and so we get obviously digital-looking junk.Spielberg has finally relented and is releasing Jaws on DVD this summer! Look for many glorious extras -- I'm positive a brand new "making of" is already completed, or is in the works. Now those who were too young to see it at the theater when it came out (I was 11, and lucky enough to see it on the big screen) will get to see it in much of its original, restored glory. If you don't have a big-screen TV or home theater system, watch it on a computer DVD-player (preferably with surround-sound speakers) for a simulated big-screen experience.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is the first film I ever saw and to this day it scares me. It is to put it quite simple masterful. From the unforgettable opening scene to the explosive finale, this film had me riveted. After the opening scene Spielberg allows a slow but suspenseful build up to the point where we actually get our first look at the shark. Of course Roy, Robert and Richard all perform exceptionally well too. One of the best acting moments in the film is definately Quint describing being torpedoed on The U.S.S Indinapolis. The shark itself looks pretty realistic especially when you compare it with the dreadful Jaws The Revenge which was made over ten years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Spielberg's most greatest films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAWS was excellent. And when I saw it I said it's probably like a dull film. But I was wrong this is one of Steven Spielberg's most greatest films ever made. He is now a favorite and hollywood legend now and has directed some of my other favorite films like JURASSIC PARK and AMISTAD. JAWS is about a shark that has been killing off people at a small town called Amity. Roy Scheidner plays the sheriff, Richard Dreyfuss plays the biologist, Lorriane Gary plays the sheriff's wife, Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Robert Shaw plays the salt greedy sailor. Susan Backlinie plays the first victim and her scene is now memorabile. My favorite part is were Roy Scheidner blows up the shark and says- Smile You Son Of A Bitch!Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner then in JAWS THE REVENGE she plays her role again as a cameo. JAWS is my type of movie I stil enjoy the music from John Williams and Spielberg's direction changed movie business forever. Followed by JAWS 2, JAWS 3-D and JAWS THE REVENGE. [ I always here rumors about a JAWS 5?! ]and was also made with rip-offs- GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS, ORCA, ALLIGATOR, CROCODILE, DEEP BLUE SEA and MAKO. Rated PG.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Spielberg's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "Jaws," after all these years, remains Steven Spielberg's best film (outdistancing his second-best, "Raiders Of The Lost Ark.") And it's my all-time personal favorite movie. While you'd likely not find it on many critics' best-of lists for the 20th Century, it's the most fully entertaining film I've ever seen -- a classic mix of drama, plot and characterization.I believe Spielberg was quoted as saying he was disappointed that the shark scenes near the chief's boat looked less than authentic. And while it's true the shark that attacks the boat looks more mechanical than real, it's only in the film for a relatively short time, and does not distract from the overall brilliance of the movie.An expert buildup to the shark attacks, a sense of chaos and fear that never feels phony, a fine (and underrated) collection of acting performances, a terrific score by John Williams, and refreshing moments of comic relief to ease the tension. All this and more make "Jaws" one of the great Hollywood films.I especially like the acting chemistry between Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss when the three are trying to hunt down the shark that's been terrorizing their beach-vacation town. Also, I found Shaw's character's tale about shark attacks on survivors of his sunken WWII boat to be a memorable piece of acting.Spielberg aimed for higher meaning with films like "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," and he made more money with "E.T." and "Jurassic Park," but I maintain that "Jaws" is Spielberg at his best, doing what he does best: solid storytelling and characterization, memorable and gripping plotlines, and first-rate entertainment that pushes all the right buttons.</fullReview>

Then, when I finally was allowed too watch it, I just couldn't get enough. I must have seen "Jaws" 20 times, and I know most of the lines by heart. The classic theme of man vs. nature is depicted in both a fantastic and truly realistic way, fantastic referring to the enormous beast, realistic in all the small details of the interaction between the hunters on the boat. It is in essence a movie about manhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the greatest movie ever. It is without a doubt Spielbergs finest. What he does with movie is he plays on our biggest of fears: the unknown. For the first hour of this movie we aren't sure what's out there killing people; but we know that it's big and and it's not where it belongs. It also gives us three complex characters to root for: First there's Chief Brody; he's cop on an island and he hates the water. But he knows that he must do something. then there's Matt Hooper the scientist who studies sharks. He knows what's out there and tries in vain to get the Mayor to understand.("You are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the a**!) And then there's Quint. The hardned shark hunter who's scared of nothing and wants the shark. Speilberg does a great job into developing these characters into people you actually like. If you have not seen this movie then by all means rent it or buy it. It's defenately worht the money. On a scale from 1 to 10 it gets a 10 for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is the favorite movie of so many people my age. I was11 years old when this film came out, and once we had convinced our parents to allow us to see it, it became the focus of our summer. EVERY kid had to know everything about sharks. EVERY kid wanted a shark poster, or toy, or tooth. On top of that the movie was fantastic! Gripping action, with actual people dealing with a near supernatural problem. The look of the film is still incredible today. The most lasting indication of how good this film was and is , is to compare it to its imitators. Whether it is real drek like ORCA or more recent attempts like "DEEP BLUE SEA" these attempts at re-making JAWS have been very pale shadows of the nail biting original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy meets girl, girl undresses girl, shark eats girl.When the body of a girl (well, some of it) is discovered washed up on the beach of a popular summer holiday resort town, the town sheriff, Martin Brody, isn't quite prepared for the turmoil that the town is thrown into when a killer white pointer shark arrives in time for the peak holiday season.Politics, petty rivalries and individual weaknesses all combine to make the job of eliminating the shark that much harder. Meanwhile the death toll mounts. After finally convincing the townfolk of their plight Brody, a marine biologist and a seasoned fisherman set out to catch the killer shark and make the beaches safe once more. My first foray into the world of adult cinema left an indelible mark on me. I was 9 years old (how did they let me in?) when my parents took me to see this landmark film at the State Theatre in Sydney. I was quite the reader at the time and had already polished off Benchley's novel, so I thought I knew what to expect.I was flabbergasted! It was my first scary big screen experience and the sights, sounds and audience reactions were overwhelming. I was hooked! (pardon the pun). The desensitised kids of today may scoff at the fake shark ("It's not CGE!") and may not wince at the bloodshed in this film but the suspense, drama and action should keep them in their seats.The actors held the movie together well with solid performances and it was only the magnificent 'Cuckoo's Nest' that prevented this film from scoring a 'Best Film' Oscar. I loved it and I gave it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

The showdown with the men and the shark during the last portion of the movie is well drawn out and is able to keep audiences interested the whole way through.

		<fullReview>This movie does what films nowdays are lacking. Jaws uses the fear of what we can't see to petrify us to death! Of course we know it's a shark; that awful dorsal fin comes out of the water every time the music picks up. The early scenes in the movie, released in 1975, have a residue from the sixties with the hippy group around the camp fire and the girl who goes skinny-dipping (the shark's first meal). Again, we don't even see the shark even though we know it is a shark eating her. The real horror is when Brody's buudy on the boat gets his midsection chompped by the shark as he slides down boat. Roy Scheider is excellent in this movie - his strong character fits his part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The million dollar golden boy of film couldn't and wouldn't make a film like Jaws again today. The film was plagued with numerous problems, primarily having to do with a mechanical shark that worked as well as........ well, Spielberg's 1941. These problems meant that Spielberg couldn't rely on ILM to create shocks, he had to create menace out of the old reliable horror tricks of suspenseful soundtrack, horrors unseen, and unique editing. The result is a film that holds up far better than most of his films today. It's the only one, except perhaps Schindler's List that deserves the critical accolades thrown at it. A great movie. The only problem is that most transfers to video are absolutely dreadful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I am too young to have ever seen Jaws at the cinema. But people who have have assured me that the experience ranks alongside Star Wars or 2001. I have since watched it on a big TV and I have to tell you, the waves become stronger, the soundtrack becomes more ominous and Quint getting bitten in half becomes more horrific. I could almost smell the sea-salt in the room. Its no surprise that this film scared half of New York city witless in the summer of '75, its such a thrill.Jaws was really the first summer blockbuster, kicking off a trend that is still present today. A film that reminds us of the terrors of the unknown, the fear of an untamed, unleashed primeval force, capable of destroying a whole community. Amity will surely never recover (not for three sequels anyway) from the arrival of a twenty-five foot rubber shark. The fact that the shark itself is so fake looking is immaterial, the abscence of large fish merely heightens the terrible suspense felt.The performances from the three male leads is exemplary, Scheider, as the hard-bitten New York cop no longer used to dealing with such hysteria that envelopes his peaceful coastal resort,plays Martin Brody close to his chest, calm and regulated until his fear of the sea (and a big fish) overpowers him and he loses it aboard the Orca.Dreyfuss brings the essential touch of humour to the proceedings, and I doubt that without his smart observations and comical mimicry of Quint that the movie would have been so successful with the younger audience, who would have seen only a shark eating people. And Robert Shaw as Quint, salty sea-dog supreme, a master fisherman, confident in his ability to land the great white. Jaws taps into your irrational fears and brings them to the surface, it dives into your subconscious and makes you realise fears you never even knew you had. Spielbergs relentlessly uncomforting direction will leave you distressed in the ocean the same as Fat Alfred made you disturbed in the shower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Thing About Jaws......Quint!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion and the entire world's opinion too. It's not only the story that grabs us and has us asking for more, but it's also the characters. Characters in movies like this are usually cardboard-like and one-dimensional because it's an action/suspense/horror flick and the good actors and clever characters are in more serious dramas that usually take home the Oscar for Best Actor/Actress/Picture etc. That isn't the case with "Jaws". This movie has fantastic acting and interesting characters unlike any ever seen in a movie before or since. The best character in the film and probably one of the best ever is Quint, the mean shark hunter. Quint is played by Robert Shaw, a fine actor who has been in a lot of great movies such as "The Sting" and "The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three". His performance in "Jaws" is his greatest achievement. Everything he does from his opening scene (grabbing the city council's attention by scraping his fingers down a blackboard) to his final death scene is wonderful. I can't think of a more enjoyable character to watch in a movie. Even when Quint isn't speaking, his character is through expression. Loud and opinionated, brutal yet poetic....Quint shows us a human being obsessed with a mission and conflicted with events of the past and the modern world around him. It is a character that once existed, but few have ever encountered. Quint's sea songs fill us with pride and spirit: ("Farewell and Adieu To You Fair Spanish Ladies....")Quint's vulgar ocean poems (The poem about 103 year old Mary Lee) give us a feeling of comfort. Quint's brilliant orders that were planned carefully and strategically: ("Hooper!! Starbird!" "Hooper!! Full Throttle!") Quint's magnificent observations, ("You got city hands Mr. Hooper, been counting money all your life.") show us that he is a wise man who has been all over the world and can tell a man's profession simply by glancing at his hands. Up to this point, people think that Quint is just a loud and mean old sea salt with no compassion or character structure. They're all wrong once they see the scene where Quint calmly and quietly tells the story of how he was exposed to sharks during World War 2. It gives Quint character and Spielberg lets Quint take his time in telling the story aboard the "Orca" - the vessel the 3 men go on to kill the shark. By giving him time to tell the story, you are allowing him to create his character and allow the viewer to put two and two together. Now you know why Quint is like that. How ironic is it when Quint's past comes back to haunt him in his final scene? A gripping and marvelous movie....Thanks to Quint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a landmark film. It was one of the first big "blockbusters", made Steven Spielberg (and the actors) a "household" name, and STILL manages to keep thousands of people skeptical about going into the water. "Jaws" is the story of three men: A Chief of Police (Roy Schneider), a fisherman (Robert Shaw), and an oceanographer (Richard Dreyfuss) going out to the sea to capture a great white shark terrorizing the small town of Amity. "Jaws" is quite memorable and well-done: the acting, direction, scenery, and camera work under water among others, but the music is one of the greatest, most memorable, recognizable, and frightening music used in a motion picture. While the special effects of the actual shark are not the best, seeing the actual shark is not the reason most people have been kept out of the water. It's the fear of NOT seeing the shark that scares most people. To those who haven't seen "Jaws", see it, and be prepared to think twice about entering ANY kind of body of water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was the first feature film debut of Steven Spielberg (not counting his TV movie "Duel") and the only film that he was actually involved in despite the other sequels. A 25 foot great white shark ends up swimming around the small resort town of Amity and attacks (and eats) tourists during the around the 4th of July. The local police chief, Brody (Roy Schieder), calls in shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the shark and the three set out to the ocean to hopefully get rid of it. The performances are great. Scheider, Dreyfus and Shaw deliver perfect performances but the main character is "Bruce" the shark, who chomps up a woman, a little boy and another guy in some disturbing sequences. Along with other performances from Lorraine Gary (who appeared in 2 other sequels) and Murray Hamilton, Jaws is a great motion picture! Just don't watch it if you plan on going in the ocean anytime soon!</fullReview>

Though Spielberg cannot escape his tendency to create a schematic representation of good and evil , his art is so full that permeates and escapes his narrow intentions.The close to the "finale" shot of the sinking "master of the sea" is majestic and revealing of the redeeming character the "beast" possesses.Never again Spielberg managed to retain such dignity for the "evil" part in any of his next films. Robert Shaw's performance is shakingly true ,and the exceptional "wound comparing" scene achieves its great depth due to his powerful presence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film still has the power to haunt you. To terrify you. Even today, in the post-Scream world.When I was five, my entire family - cousins too - packed into their pickup trucks to see this movie. It is the ultimate fisherman's movie, and I come from a fisherman family. I sat next to my dad, and asked him to tell me when the scary parts come. My dad said, "I haven't seen this either. How will I know when the scary parts come?" I implored him to let me know when he THOUGHT they might come.Guess what. He didn't. Thank you, Dad.This film stands the test of time, and I give it a 10.Also, does anyone know if Robert Shaw's Indianapolis speech was improvised? For years I've heard that it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tense, scary film. It features absorbing characters sporting realistic dialouge. And it also features a huge, fake looking shark named Bruce. But due to Steven Spielberg's directing(or is that Verna Field's editing?) Bruce is only shown a few times and the film relies on the viewers imagination for the real scares. It is kind of like a B-movie directed by Hitchcock. Coincidentally, John Williams' music is reminescent of Bernard Hermann's work. 5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in a lifetime....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 12 years old when I first went to see Jaws. I was fascinated by the Movie Poster. The poster was much more effective as a Painting than if it was a scene still from the movie. The music....Dum Dum Dum Dum....John Williams must have reached deep within his worst fears to come up with such a theme. I must admit, that I have seen the movie eight times in the Theater and at least thirty-seven times on video. Why would someone who is thirty-four years old, happily married, satisfied with his career, sociable, in other words "normal", if that is still considered normal these days, still infatuated with a movie he first saw as a child? Once in our lifetime, we see something, hear something, believe something, feel something, that we just will never forget. We tuck the moment into our brains and it becomes a part of who we are for the rest of our lives. There is no getting away from it. That is what Jaws is for me.The characters, the shocking moments, the camera angles, the music, the story...... No other movie has even come close in it's genre. Now I watch the movie through adult eyes and I understand it on an adult level. A further appreciation develops on a whole new level. The only question left is: WHEN WILL IT BE RELEASED ON DVD!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yeah! Pure, fantastic Spielberg with an overworked, run-away imagination. Could any director have possibly made this film any better or more frightening? Sure, the shark is the main character, but what about the inspired casting of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss? You cannot beat it. This is not Spielberg's best film nor his most gripping. However, it is one of his simplest and that raises this extraordinary thriller to an amazing level. Please, don't show it to your kids.

		<shortDescription>Good job Speilberg had no money then !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Speilberg made Jaws nowadays, when he can afford to make a movie to the cost of a small country's entire yearly budget, then the cinema would have been robbed of one of its finest moments.The main difference is that I am sure you would have seen the shark much more and that, of course, is a bad thing. The thing that scares the most is not the sight of something horrible or frightening but merely the thought. People who prefer books to films often say that books require much more imagination. Well what else is at work in the early scenes of Jaws, where you don't see the shark at all, but your imagination. Arguably the most chilling scene is the opening one when the girl gets savagely ripped apart. The only indication of a shark is the fact that nothing else could throw around a person like that but a great white.The weakest scenes, in my opinion, are near the end when the shark actively attacks the boat and we see far too much of what is a pretty average model. If Speilberg had the backing and money he had now he would have made an entirely different film and I would say an inferior one to this classic.Much of the plot and story comes from the fact that the shark cannot be seen and is being hunted down. How many great scenes would have been lost if it became a gore fest or an action adventure like so many of today's pathetic offerings ?Maybe I am not giving Speilberg enough credit. He is a great film maker and would have seen the benefit of suspense to his movie rather than outright graphic horror. It is the idea that a shark that big could be out there that put many people off swimming in the sea for a long time.As we saw in the sequels even the same formula, handled in the wrong way, didn't work. Forget the sequels, Jaws is probably the best true thriller ever made made by one of the top directors and starring a perfect cast. And remember a shark the size of a bus could be out there somewhere, we don't belong in the sea !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny how one of the worst books ever written can be adapted into one of the best movies ever made. Peter Benchley's tawdry gutter fiction is hugely improved upon by Carl Gottlieb's screenplay. With Spielberg's taut direction, Williams iconic score, terse editing, lovely anamorphic Panavision photography, and wonderful chemistry between the three leads also to its advantage Benchley's novel thankfully becomes a distant memory.Before Spielberg became the biggest name in Hollywood, capable of green-lighting anything he wants, he wandered in Richard Zanuck's office and picked up the script thinking he could churn out a decent B-movie. His only theatrical movie before this was The Sugarland Express, though it wasn't a huge hit. Jaws became the first summer blockbuster when crowds literally lined-up around the block to see it. $470 million dollars worth of bust is enough to kick-start any career.In the Atlantic waters off the coast of Amity Island a 25-foot Great White Shark has staked a claim for his hunting ground. The bathers and holiday makers are all he needs for his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. New police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches but the greed of local business owners keeps the meaty flesh of human on the sand and beneath the sun.When a young boy is devoured his mother offers a $3K reward for the killing of the shark, causing the overzealous, money-hungry local fishermen to crowd the waters with dynamite and chum. Only Quint (the one and only Robert Shaw), a WWII veteran with a personal vendetta against shark-kind, has the skill to pursue the monster. Brody and oceanographer Matt Hooper (a 'young' Richard Dreyfuss) join Quint on his hunt not knowing how monstrous the shark really is.Jaws is split into two perfect halves. One landlocked, filled with fences, boundaries, and a sense of being contained. The other filled with isolation and a sense of not belonging. The Orca, Quint's ramshackle boat, becomes its own little island, ever so slowly disintegrating and sinking as their safety slips away. Brody, already afraid of the water, almost buckles under the pressure, Hooper loses his cool when no one trusts his judgment, and Quint loses his sanity as he aggressively, psychotically pursues the shark.What makes Jaws special is that it scars and stays with you. The only other movie that I can of that has had similar success is the 1999 horror The Blair Witch Project. In much the same way as Jaws kept millions of people out of the water, Blair Witch kept them out of the woods too. There are some places that humans are just not supposed to go. Whenever you've been paddling at the beach and suddenly wander into a 'cold bit' don't tell me you've never thought about Bruce the shark coming to get you.He IS out there, you know. For real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember vividly when I saw this movie first - I was 13 years old. The scene where Richard Dreyfuss discovers the head in the boat is still the single biggest scare I have ever had in a movie theater. The tension of the entire second half is still unmatched by any movie since. JAWS was also the first movie I ever recorded on a VCR and myself and my brother watched it over and over endlessly even getting to the stage where we knew the dialogue. I agree that the shark looks really phony - yet somehow it doesn't matter - such is the brilliance of the direction, the career best work from the 3 actors and John Williams now legendry score. This is one film that should be re-shown in a theater - as it does lose some of its vice-like grip on the smaller screen. Although Spielberg went to to make "better" movies, in terms of sweat inducing nervous excitement this movie is still in a class of its own. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful story about a boy and his shark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite. But when I think of "Jaws", I think of a film that I can watch over and over again and never grow tired of it. Definitely one of my favourite films.Since seeing "Jaws" many years ago, I became fascinated with sharks. I saw it around 1981 at the age of 10. I read every book I could get my hands on at my public school library. What I found in the process, is that not only is the ocean filled with a variety of sharks, but lots of other equally deadly creatures. I think that is what freaked me out beyond the film. I have always been afraid of the ocean since. I attribute that to Steven Spielberg.Sometimes when I watch this film, during one of the calmer moments, like Brody and his son at the dinner table, I'm struck by the beauty of the film, in its aesthetics, later I'll be drawn in by the pace, story and suspense of a truly masterful film.I never did get to see the film in the theater. In the early 1980s, we rented a VTR on a monthly basis and would periodically rent movies from the local video store, "Videoflicks", which was an excursion that was always an exciting treat for my siblings and I.For my birthday party, I wanted to watch "Jaws" with my friends, and my mother was a little concerned. She was debating whether we should do it or not, worried what the parents of the other kids would say as the film scared her pretty badly too.She was worried about it until my 5 year old brother said, "Aw mom, it's just a mechanical shark."Of course, he too is traumatized, as were most of the kids at the party I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, Robert Shaw is riveting in the Indianapolis scene where he recants the tale of his WWII shark horrors. If you get the special edition laser disc or VHS it has bloopers including the scene where the fake blood goes all over his face and you can hear the movie crew laughing in the background. It also has the lost scenes not included in the theatrical release but used on TV as filler. Also a horribly acted scene which was never used between Quint and the old fisherman who works with him. I don't know who played the old fisherman but man was he awful, couldn't even say one line right. It's a wonder that an accomplished actor like Shaw even finished filming this scene with him.Neat stuff for any Jaws fan, however ..check it out. Jaws is #1 in my book, I hope they re-release it for its 25th anniversary next year in 2000, that would be cool if it was digitally remastered in theaters...hope they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every summer thousands of visitors go to a small beach-side town of Amity to get some rest and relaxation in the sun and sand. But one summer, the summer of '75 a new visitor comes to the bech an enormous man-eating great white shark. Brody (ROY SCHEIDER) a former big city cop and now the local sheriff, finds the remains of a college girl and orders the beaches closed. Mayor Vaughan (MURRAY HAMILTON) and other city officials, however, rescind that order for fear of what it will do to the town's tourism. Brody and his wife Ellen (LORRAINE GARY) don't think that was the right thing to do and worry about the safety of their two boys. After several more people are killed by the shark, though, Brody closes the beaches and brings in Hooper (RICHARD DREYFUSS), an oceanographic expert, to help find the shark. In the end, however, they need Quint (ROBERT SHAW), the local, grizzled "old man of the sea" to hunt down and kill the shark. The three men then head out into open waters and bait, and wait, for their encounter with the dangerous shark. One of the great box-office hits of all time is also one of the best horror films in the last few decades. Spielberg's classic shark story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, kept millions out of the water during the summer of '75. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the great Robert Shaw go shark hunting off the New England coast and find Melvillian adventure. A classic combination of suspense, effects, editing, cinematography, score and bristling characterizations. The movie that was supposed to be 1975's biggest flop, but instead it has become a classic thriller. This film briefly turned all of those actors into big stars, and for the next few years they headlined many of biggest released movies.From John Williams unforgettable score to Spielberg's unmatched directorial talent, Jaws is grand entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was one of the first movies with graphic scenes to be released at the time. The first one (in my opinion, was THE EXORCIST) but the only difference at the time was that THE EXOCIST was restricted while Jaws was given general audience. I did not see when it was first released. But a lot of people who went to see it at the time thought it should have been restricted. There was more graphic scenes than THE EXORCIST. Even when I first saw it on tv, it was pretty frightening with the head coming out of the boat. It left me feeling frightened for few nights afterwards.Nowadays, there are a lot of slasher graphic movies but no story or theme content. The first JAWS movie had story and an issue (about how the mayor of amityville ignored the attack for the sake of seasonal tourism that make the town a profit) . There was also the character content like brody and quint. The sequels had none of it except people being attacked one after the other.(the 1978 sequel)It's the movie that put Spielberg were he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the present time it is a different movie theme Spielberg invented in the same era, STAR WARS currently selling more retail gift products in the shops and screening a new movie. JAWS however has its merits and its innovations. Horror movies in which the monster makes only limited appearances without being at the center of theme is one. Cinematic portrayals of islands off Cape Cod as Martha's Vinyard is another. Every cinematic sequence shows brilliance in the way the storyline develops and in the photography, brilliant character portrayals in the minor characters and incredible rappor among the performers on screen. In its day one of the major Hollywood money makers and still in its own way modern and enthralling./</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks Steven Spielberg, that you found the way out of the complete storm the making of this movie was. All you movie-fans already know the story, and I just want to share my profits of It. The unique mind of a shoot that Spielberg holds, make him one of the greatest in my opinion. (OK, the whole team behind him should be applauded too, for getting this together.) It still stands out, as 40 year old piece of film, and matures continuously like a fine wine. Still watching It from time to time, one can always find new angles to enjoy. Born this summer, I never saw it fresh, of course. But I can imagine the hype it represented 1975. Nevermind the fake shark's failures, or the sometimes deficient facts of the script, the luck of the casting is what really stands out. Without the grumpy Robert Shaw it would have been a complete different movie. Without Richard Dreyfuss as the logical, sensitive marine Biologist it would not be the same, too. Roy Schreider's sheriff of the Amity Island struggles with both family and the city community for keeping the people "out of water". You can easily find extracts of yourself in all of the three men: Stubborness, fear, insecurity, resignation and anger. That is why I like this movie so much. Watch it with Brody's eyes, next time with Quint's. The other next time with Hooper's. And another time with the Mayor's? Just never, ever buy the fact of some kind of a smart shark. Because it will ruin the experience of this classic "sea-thriller."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Shark Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Steven Spielberg directing his TV movie "Duel," and his first theatrical movie "The Sugarland Express" he would go on to direct a movie about a man-eating shark that attacks people. The movie is about a great white shark, that has been causing all the issue for attacking innocent people on Amity Island as our three main characters set out by sea to go find the shark, and kill it so no one would have anymore shark problems whatsoever. "Jaws" is a cinematic masterpiece of filmmaking, and I thought Spielberg is able to bring such tension of suspense and excitement as you are going along with the ride. The production of this movie had numerous problems to get the shark to work, but Spielberg made such a wise choice to not show the shark as learned from one his idols Alfred Hitchcock as he makes this movie very suspenseful as he did with "Duel" for not showing the truck driver. He only shows the shark toward the end of the movie, which it makes a very good build up to show the shark. Also, the movie works well with the human characters as they don't come out as cardboard cutouts, but make them as they act like real people. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are excellent together in this movie, and they make a great chemistry. I have never read the book, but I'm sure that movie is different than what the book represents. Peter Benchley wrote the book, as well as co-writing the screenplay with Carl Gottlieb and the movie does have a very well written script. The shark itself is very well done for its mixture for using practical effects, and real-life shark footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor; this is before CG as they had to film a real shark so the filmmakers won't have to keep going practical with the shark. As for John Williams, his music is completely unforgettable and really loved the theme that he created for this movie; its a good thing that he won an Oscar for his music of the movie, and he really deserves that kind of recognition. The movie does go at a very good pace, and I thought the climax at the end between Brody and the shark is very well done. The opening scene, in my opinion, is really Spielberg's own shower scene from "Psycho" as it is shocking to see this poor woman get killed by our main antagonist. I'm not going into much detail about this movie because everyone has seen "Jaws," and it will always continue to be a classic movie as well as one of Spielberg's best films. "Jaws" will always be the definitive shark movie, and nothing can compare to this masterpiece. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ever are in the water and hear the haunting Jaws score, You should get out as fast as you can. John Williams orchestrated one of the most well known and referenced scores of all time. But that is not only the great thing about this movie. Often regarded as the first summer blockbuster "Jaws" provides a tale of horror and survival which is most notably shown during the final act. The dialogue is to the point and doesn't stretch out. The cinematography is wonderful as we are shown the white sandy beaches of Amity Island. My favorite shot is of Chief Brody looking out to the ocean after an attack on some locals. That shot embodied the vast space if ocean the Chief was about to enter. This is definitely my favorite movie with fantastic performances by our three leads: Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Schneider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. Shaw steals the movie in one particular scene where he provides a dark speech full of imagery. I don't want to spoil it. This film would not have worked without a fantastic crew, great script, actors and Mr Steven Spielberg who has gives imagination and adventure to the audience.

		<fullReview>Jaws is a film directed by the now legendary Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan, Schindlers List, A.I. Artificial Intelligence) in 1975. It is written by Carl Gottlieb (Jaws Franchise, The Jerk) and Peter Benchley (Jaws franchise, The Deep) who also wrote the book. It stars Roy Scheider (Jaws franchise, The French Connection, 2010), Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, American Graffiti, Pirhana 3D) and Robert Shaw (The Sting, From Russia with Love, A Man for All Seasons).Jaws is about a small town called Amity who begins to be terrorized by a rogue shark. The sheriff (Roy Scheider) gets a crew of three including a scientist (Peter Benchley) and an odd fisherman (Robert Shaw) to go after it.What makes this film most famous is probably the incredible soundtrack by John Williams (Harry Potter franchise, Star Wars franchise) writes an incredible score that has now become famous. Just listening to the theme of this movie will make you frightened and nervous about what you know is bound to happen on screen eventually. It won best score at the Oscars and is now synonymous with anything having to do with sharks.Another aspect of this film is Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a crazy fisherman who becomes obsessed with catching the shark. Anytime he is on screen he downright steals the scene. His performance will be looked upon as the classic crazy fisherman and will be copied until the end of time. Every time I watch him I see something new and he never seems to disappoint. While the special effects of this film might've been great for the time, sometimes they do not hold up as well as we remember. However despite that, this is an action-packed, dramatic film that will be remembered until the end of time and really brought Steven Spielberg's name to be as famous as it is now.</fullReview>

Considering all the production trouble on this thing it would be amazing to get a half-way decent film yet for some reason, perhaps the movie Gods were shining down, we ended up with one of the greatest films ever made. This is without question one of the greatest films to deal with tension as Spielberg masterfully handles all the material. The movie is like an amazing roller coaster as we get one scare after another until the end when we just get our senses attacked from all around. Millions of people have discussed the greatness of this film so it's hard to pick one thing but I'd say the greatest achievement of the film is the simple adventure it gives us.Even though we get some very intense scenes the screenplay is smart enough to give us other things to go with. We got some nice black humor in the witty dialogue but we also get a good buddy picture with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss delivering memorable characters. The three of them together are so different yet all three are like people I'm sure each viewer has met so it's easy to connect with them and it makes the film all the more fun when we go on this adventure.The film, of course, benefits from the brilliant John Williams score, which is perhaps the most memorable in film history. Bruce, the name given to the shark, caused most of the problems during filming but you wouldn't know that by just watching the picture. The look of the shark is incredible and Spielberg certainly made the right decision of keeping it hidden and just revealing bits and pieces as the movie went along. The first glimpse in the pond is hauntingly shocking and each sighting just grows more and more tension. The director also knows how to build suspense without us seeing the shark as we're constantly viewing objects floating (the dock, the barrels) to imply that the creature is there.What's even more amazing is that this film scared people so badly that they refused to go into the water yet the most suspenseful scene is probably the now legendary speech by Shaw about his time on the USS Indianapolis. It goes without saying but the three leads are all terrific in their roles and I really can't think of too many movies that have as many memorable characters as the ones here. We also get strong supporting work from Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife.For me this ranks as one of the greatest adventures ever captured on film because everyone involved makes it feel so real. When the men get on the boat to go after the shark you feel as if you're really there. When the camera is underwater given a POV shot of the shark, you feel as if you're in the water. The final death scene in the movie also just happens to be one of the most terrifying ever captured on film and it might even be the most brutal. The movie is a true masterpiece of suspense and I think it would be fair that nothing has come close to this in the past 35 years. Like PSYCHO, we've had a lot of rips of imitations but nothing has come close to the same power and it's doubtful anything ever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blockbuster That Started It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1975. I remember it well. I,along with millions of other people around the country stood in line (and yes there were lines at movie theaters across the US)on June 20,1975. I was too young to go by myself,so I was accompanied by my then 20-something aunt and cousin. I was in for an experience. Jaws was the birth of the summer blockbuster. A movie that draws in millions of viewers and millions of dollars. It features the incredible acting talents of the late Roy Scheider,Robert Shaw and the incomparable Richard Dreyfuss and one terrifying fish. The musical score is by the legendary John Williams and adds greatly to the suspense. In fact,I didn't develop any phobias about swimming in water unlike a lot of people but it was the musical score that creeped me out! The classification of Jaws as a horror movie is a bit off. It is more suspense than anything else. The violence is minimal compared to a horror film. I urge anyone a fan of 'eco- terror' films that were so popular during the 1970's to see this. It's a classic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is an excellent movie, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975. For the time, this movie is very well done. Even for today's standards it's good. Acting, effects, story are all superb.Story revolves around a shark which terrorizes an island. Chief of Police Brody, fisherman Quint and oceanographer Matt Hooper set off to kill the shark once in for all. The movie itself is very disturbing. When the shark kills a person you feel the terror of witnesses. That is the reason why this movie will always leave a mark on all of it's viewers. This movie is a landmark of cinema that everyone should see. However, this movie would have a better reputation if it didn't have all these horrible sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Thriller with a Killer Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, this is the movie which put the summer blockbuster on the map. This is the movie which made the line "We are gonna need a bigger boat" one of the most iconic lines in all of cinema. The soundtrack of this movie is one of the most influential and has been imitated by numerous other musicians. Jaws revolves around the life of a police chief whose duty is to ensure the safety of the people swimming in the water. Due to a killer shark who manages to kill two people, chief Brody tries to close the beach but is not allowed to do so as the people in that area are dependent on the tourists in order to run their business. However, due to the death of another person, the beach is closed until the killer shark is captured. A fisherman volunteers to do so in exchange of a hefty reward. After that the chief, fisherman and the marine biologist who was called in for his expertise on sharks. Now, on the boat we witness some of the most thrilling scenes seen at the time it was released. The soundtrack heightened the suspense which made it all the more riveting to watch. The film features a number of unusual camera angles which is a testament to the perfectionism of Steven Spielberg. The movie is well-known to have gone well over budget and also exceeding its production time by 100 days. The final product though makes it worth the wait and Jaws propelled Spielberg into stardom. Jaws must be watched by one and all but be prepared for one hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy this movie. Surprisingly, it didn't make me not want to go in the ocean ever again, which it seems to have that effect on a lot of people. But then again, I'm more of a pool person, not a beach person, so maybe that was the main reason I wasn't scared.This movie takes place in the peaceful community of Amity Island. But in the lovely Summer, out comes a furious shark from the depths, and it's killing everyone it can. After not caring and/or believing about the shark, people still go into the water. Until people are killed mid-swim. Jeez, does no one listen? Now, a particular set of men must hunt down the shark and kill it, before it kills themOverall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Nautical Masterpiece will have You Biting Your Nails!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long cited as the movie that changed Hollywood into a sensation- bound blockbuster factory, Jaws continues to be regarded as a high- point of Steven Spielberg's oeuvre - a near Hitchcockian exercise in transference of guilt and making the audience pay for its illicit pleasures. The setting is almost quaint by today's blockbuster standards. Instead of a faraway fantasy realm or a city sheltered by superheroes, Jaws takes place in the beach-side town of Amity during a blazing hot summer where tourists are out in force. However, the film's opening moments foreshadow the trauma that's to come as a young woman's sandy frolic ends with her gurgled scream as she disappears into an ocean, having fallen prey to the great white. While more bodies turn up on Amity Island, Spielberg milks the slow burn, hiding the shark in his watery depths, instead introducing us to Roy Scheider's protagonist, Police Chief Martin Brody. Despite Brody's protestations, the incidents go largely unreported as the town mayor doesn't want panic to keep the all-important vacationers away. But when an attack is witnessed in broad daylight, mass hysteria takes over and there's no denying the calamity the town faces. Soon, it's left to Brody, ballsy shark- hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) and oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to head out into the ocean on a heroic expedition and finish off the aquatic beast.Jaws begins as a sunshine-bright horror movie: ordinary people motivated by greed and pleasure are shaken upon understanding that a murderous uncanny fiend has arrived in their midst. Then it becomes an astounding descendant of nautical tales: rage and obsession unleash a flurry of vehemence. Spielberg expertly conceals the monster (don't listen to the cynics who claim the shark looks iffy now), luring us into a false sense of security before unleashing him into the frame sparingly to create impact jolts. Four decades later it continues to instill fear because Spielberg's direction is so assuredly taut, and is ably bolstered by John Williams' now-iconic, terror-inducing 'da- dumb' score (the alternating two-note motif still signals a shift to the edge of your seat, creating a throbbing sense of menace). Spielberg wants us to be terrified by his film, but he also wants us to be awed and excited and he achieves that with aplomb. Credit is also due for the cast for investing the monster movie premise with such believability. The trio's cracking camaraderie has seldom been bettered and the aquatic terror is deftly balanced with lively, likable characterizations. Jaws is a marvel of economic storytelling; its formula so hard to capture it's now near-mythical ? filmmakers have been chasing it like Ahab chasing Moby Dick ever since. They don't make them like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie which created the summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many if not all shark movies are garbage. But Jaws is the movie which does the shark formula right. After a girl gets dragged under water, pieces of her wash up and people start investigating what happened only to find out that a man eating shark is in the water. This movie has so many memorable scenes and every time someone goes to a beach, people always do the music to annoy you. Jaws is a truly brilliant film which is often called one of the greatest American films ever made. AFI put it at number 56 in their list of the 100 greatest movies. This is a truly brilliant film and it's considered the first true summer blockbuster. Many of its scenes are highly iconic and some scenes left a permanent mark in movie history as we know it. The 3 characters who went to kill the shark all had terrific performances. This is one of those films that about every kid knows about. This movie is so quotable and I could recite many famous quotes from the movie. This movie made everyone fear the water and it will likely be watched for many generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summer, 1975 Unknown director Steven Spielberg released a monster that changed the movie industry forever. Ever since it's release, people feared the ocean, and what lurks within it. I am of course talking about "Jaws". I first saw this movie when I found the DVD at my library (does anyone do that anymore?). Personally I wasn't scared of it. It's not the movie's fault, it's just EVERYONE talks about the major scares (I won't because I'm a nice person), so I already knew about the jump scares, and the disturbing images. It was fun to watch it with my mother, who was unaware of the scares. She screamed and jumped, and my sister, my dad, and I all laughed our butts off. It just goes to show that these effects are still scary to this day. Sure they look fake, but if they can make a person scream, then they're doing their job. Other than the scares, the characters are enjoyable too. By far, Quint is my favorite character. I love how he teases Brody and Hooper while they're on the Orca. It's like he's saying "I'm the king of this castle, I can do what I want." Hooper is also a fun character, and he probably has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Brody, even though he's the main character, is probably the stick in the mud out of the trio. I'm not saying he's bad, it's just Hooper and Quint steal the show. Overall, "Jaws" still holds up as a classic example of Steven Spielberg's genius directing. However, if you're curious about the source material, prepare for a group of unlikable assholes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An icon of cinema that still clenches its Jaws around your ankle for its entire running time without letting go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Confined to the mere dimensions of his poster, he's a shark rising from territorial depths, bearing an almost menacing grin as he prepares to feast on a helpless swimmer. But he's long since broken free of that frame, assuming he ever needed to. He is a harbinger of fear, that great primal substance that sent people scurrying from their televisions, from their beaches and from any signs of water in 1975, and brought them back again in their rushes of adrenaline and wonder and the masochistic human need to subject themselves to something more powerful or terrifying or that which we can't entirely understand. And he still encourages this process if not in adults then in new generations who are for the first time dipping their toes into that great foreboding water. Because whatever you believe of his cinematic credibility or enjoyment, his indomitable presence cannot be understated. In that carnivorous madness, he not only ate the limbs of unfortunate swimmers, but of last legs of the old Hollywood machine and in that bloodied wake was born the summer blockbuster. In this enduring legacy he's an icon; a symbol of change and the cinematic talent that struck the hearts of enough filmgoers to bring about that. I caught this film on the TV a few weeks ago, about 10 minutes in, and put it on not so much out of a nostalgic indulgence but out of intellectual curiosity to see how I'd immediately respond to it with a mind freshened over the years since I'd last seen it. Within about five minutes, I'd downloaded the film and began watching from the beginning. I don't know what I expected. As much as this is the kind of film that you revisit frequently, playing memory hopscotch as you jump from scene to scene registering the quirks, quoting your favourite lines and waiting for those 'big' moments, whether a scare or some catharsis or triumph of character, it's still ultimately a Spielberg film and that means there's always more to discover each and every time. Great cinema is timeless yes, but his name almost guarantees the film will have a longer life expectancy. Being in a Spielberg film, we are of course almost immediately introduced to a family, and one that will be core to which the protagonist gravitates, because of course there's more than just the audience's composure on the line in this film, there's the family unit to maintain. I like how in Spielberg's '70s families exist somewhere between a 1950s nuclear family and the Wonder Years era of freedom and discord and strife that became more apparent in the domestic environment. Introducing our timeless Chief Brody, unwitting hero, the man whom I seem to recall earned much adoration from me as a child, wakes up alongside his wife, bathed in the radiant summer glow, checks the window to ascertain the whereabouts of his kids, and trades quips with his wife and then leaves. It's fairly standard stuff, but it's great in introducing the warm domestic heart of Amity, Brody's life, and the man himself. This is what is being threatened constantly throughout the film, and we take much delight in that. Chief Brody is a perfect character with which to embark on this adventure, because he's neither particularly macho or domineering or timid and inhibited. He's played by Roy Schieder with both composure and hesitance, his glasses and his patience carry a bookish reticence to him, but he's also firm and resolute, like every good hero, and I dedicate this paragraph to him because I've always been drawn to the guy. I think as a child I had some sort of Freudian complex with his character, because to me he always emanated paternal qualities. Glasses, cigarette and black turtleneck are eminently respectable. Perhaps the wife, is a little underdeveloped, as she's really more of figure of quiet domestic life, and extension of Brody's family responsibility than much of a character herself, and maybe some of Amity itself, like the Mayor (played with shady-contempt and-a-thin-faade-of -beach-front- good-guy-with-that-bloody-sports-coat-of-his by Murray Hamilton who I actually recognised from an episode of the Twilight Zone), is a little underexplored, who insists on keeping the beaches open, innumerable times, despite his children also being there, but then, Spielberg knows to keep this film focused on the actual terror driving its way through the narrative, and that all the other stuff is there to keep us involved in the world and actually care beyond visceral thrill, but not start wondering in-depth about it all. It's a tight picture, and like Aliens what is does is initially suggest at the terror, which we know is there but can't be certain of, introduce us to the characters and see their dynamics unfold naturally, all whilst the tension slowly coils up, then thrusts these characters into danger, as that tension snaps violently in our faces. People may be surprised how little Jaws is actually seen, as the film taunts us with his presence and consequence but not a physical sighting and in one case the carnivorous beast becomes a floating pier, which is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Of course the immortal dynamic of this film is in the troublesome trio of Brody, Hooper and Quint, the latter two played by Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. The former is an animated dramatic-exposition- unloader, played to a wonderful point where he almost seems unhinged in his love of sharks, and the latter really needs little introduction, except to say that the monologue never diminishes in power, partly because Shaw in playing such a haggard and crude man is utterly arresting when he's quiet and haunted, and the silence that hangs over that seen is so heavy, and it's both a brilliant move in humanising a character and furthering the horrific mythology and possibility of this shark, and thus the sense of dread that becomes so palpable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I ever watched Jaws, I wasn't crazy about it. The second time I watched Jaws, I was glued to the scream. This movie features some of the most ingenious uses of suspense ever brought to a film. What enforces that suspense is the amount of care and appreciation you develop for the characters. They're all played to perfection and become the characters. Another thing this film deserves praise on is the screenplay. It's not Tarantino or anything, but its still pretty good. One of my favorite scenes in both this film and of all cinema is when Chief Brody looks out into the ocean with determination to kill this shark. In a nutshell, Jaws is simply a masterpiece in movie-making that invests me more each time I watch it. It's an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on it's Jaws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg is the master of film and Jaws is not a Bad movie at all in fact it is the scariest film of all time! Roy Schneider Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, Matt Hooper and Quint who are on the hunt for a great white shark! This film set the standard for motion picture blockbusters today for goodness sake! Steven Spielberg is a director with one goal in mind making a really entertaining movie and he always delivers the goods in every movie he has ever directed! The scope of the movie is incredible you never feel bored despite the fact there are long stretches of time where you do not see the shark, but the tension in this movie is incredible partly due to John Williams's outstanding score and he won a Oscar for this simple theme and to think Steven Spielberg laughed when John played the theme for the first time on the piano! HA! I mean every single aspect of the entire movie is sheer perfection every frame of the movie is meticulously thought through, some of my all time greatest scenes in film are in this movie, The Indianapolis story, the Banter between Quint and Hooper, the Virginity joke that Quint says to Brody's Wife is comic genius, The Barrel Scene where Quint goes Hooper Hopper hurry up Hopper and Hooper says I'm Going in and they think they have captured the shark the music is going crazy the trumpets and horns are going at full speed and then it slows down when they know they have failed and they have to try again and who can forget the immortal line of this historic film we are going to need a bigger boat I mean come on that is the best line in film! And I have not yet mentioned the classic opening scene which you will just have to watch but people who have watched the film will know what I Am talking about and the jump scares in this film are really effective! If you have never ever seen this film buy it on DVD now you will not regret it and it is a great film to study in film studies!</fullReview>

Jaws is one of the best nature gone amok movies and a great suspense thriller along with being a great adventure film as well.Good: What can I say that hasn't been said? The acting overall is great with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss are fantastic together and provide plenty of great scenes. The direction and cinematography is excellent and the tension is palpable. There's also some great comedy in here thanks to the banter between Roy, Richard, and Robert. It s also a great adventure film that it doesn't get enough credit as much as it is a great horror film.Overall, Jaws is fantastic. Go watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Not Going In The Water!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie so many times, and it is still one of the best all time best films ever made.Well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)"Jaws" is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. "Jaws" is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, except for the shark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this again on TV last night and it still works; it's one of the great monster movies alright, but the only thing wrong with it is the monster. Oh, the vast majority of 'Jaws' is spot-on; Spielberg has correctly concentrated on the characters and not the situation. The mayor's grotesquely 'loud' jackets are just a little too obvious a labeling device but otherwise the town and its characters ring true, and we are swept along with these ordinary local folk as the plot develops. Robert Shaw's Quint has a few rather hammy scenery-chewing moments, and the actor does occasionally appear to have had himself a wee private party before filming some scenes. Still, he is supposed to be a local weirdo, and so his 'crusty old sea-dog' shtick isn't too much of a distraction. The changing relationships between the three men on the 'Orca' is another welcome subtlety often missing from horror movies. After establishing a supremely sinister presence throughout the movie, we must inevitably see the shark, and the more we do, the less we want to. The much-trumpeted animatronic creature doesn't really look alive, and even back in 1975 when audiences had no access to movies outside of a theatre, the moment when the 'shark' rears up out of the water and flops against the stern of the Orca looked absurdly like the attack of a colossal salami sausage. It's not a perfect movie, but 'Jaws' is most of the way there, and aspiring horror writers could do way worse than take a leaf or three from its meticulous care with the characters. After all, they are our stand-ins, and if we don't identify with them then horror turns to farce or worse still, tedium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It's when teenager Cassie, Susan Blacklinie, went skinny dipping one evening in the waters off Long Island Sound that she attracted this giant 25 foot great white shark who ended up taking her out and under for his dinner! With the July 4th festivities about to start the seaside town of Amity, who's economy depends on tourist summer dollars, the news that a killer and man eating shark is on the loose off it's waters is the last thing that the town fathers and its Mayor Vaughn, Murray Hamilton, want the public to know about! It's when against his better judgment due to the pressure put on him by Mayor Vaughn Amity Police Chief Brody,Roy Scheider, kept the beaches opened that the killer shark strikes again gulping down another victim in front of hundreds of terrified beach goers including Chief Brody. With panic engulfing Amity and after a false report of having harpooned and killed the shark he strikes again this time in shallow waters off Amity Island. This on July 4th taking down another victim and thus closing the beaches indefinitely until the shark, the real killer shark not a cheap imitation,is finally put out of commission!With Mayor Vaughn and the town fathers finally coming to their senses their forced to hire the famed shark hunter Captain Quint, Robert Shaw, at $10,000.00 plus expenses to track down and kill the man eating shark before he adds more victims to his already impressive body count. There's also the young wise cracking Oceanographer Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss, who goes along for the ride together with chief Brody on Quint's shark hunting boat the Orca. It's Hooper's know it all attitude about marine life and sea fearing that starts to get under Quint's skin and almost leads the two to go at each other instead of at the killer shark. It's only later on that Hooper gains a new found respect for Quint when he finds out that his obsession with sharks and wanting to kill them was the result of an incident back in WWII where he almost ended up together with most of his 700 fellow US Navy sailors, on the torpedoed USS Indianapolis, being eaten by one of them.With the three, Quint Brody &amp; Hooper, shark hunters out at sea is when the killer shark, efficiently called Bruce, comes out in the open with his razor sharp and serrated teeth, as much as three rows of them,flashing. From then on it's a battle between man and beast on the open seas with the killer shark making the best of the situation. It's his turf or waters that he's battling in and he knows every drop of it. That's until Brody now on his own with nothing to lose, but his life, overcomes his fear of the high seas and together with a high powered rifle and full oxygen tank finally turns the tables on the surging like a train locomotive Bruce the Shark. With Brody leaving about just enough of him,all 25 feet and three ton's worth, to fully pack an 8 to 12 once sardine can! P.S "Jaws" released in the early summer of 1975 became the biggest money making hit in motion picture history in only just six weeks after it's initial release! Surpressing and almost doubling the profits of the previous money earing champ "The Godfather" without as much as breaking a sweat in doing it. Not at first thought to become the mega monster hit, with all the troubles and delays in filming it, that it turned out to be "Jaws" astounded the movie critics as well as it's own cast &amp; crew members who before it's release had them feeling that it was going to be the "Bomb" of the century, and end up destroying their careers, who tried to distance and disown themselves from the film. Check out the author of the novel "Jaws" that the film was based on Peter Benchley as a TV reporter on the Amity beach just before the killer shark springs or swims into action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amity Island in the northeast is popular tourist attraction for beach goers. In 1975, Jaws changed everything. A young woman goes missing during an ocean swim. She is found on shore and the medical examiner rules her cause of death as due to shark attack. Police chief Brody(Roy Schneider) wants to close the beach but is overruled by the mayor. Shortly thereafter, a boy is killed by the hungry creature and mommy dearest puts out a bounty for the sharp toothed murderer. This brings out a hoard of lunatics trying to win the money, without success. The town then hires a professional hunter, Quint(Robert Shaw), to exterminate the carnivores and bring peace to the community. Quint, sheriff Brody and a marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfus) hop a boat and team up for the great white shark hunt. The action is exciting without any of the present day cgi special effects. Good acting, a good story and Spielberg make Jaws worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its time you all watched JAWS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then there comes a movie that revolutionizes the industry and sets new standards. These standards would later be shattered and more modern benchmarks are set. Thus is the norm within the industry of movies or any other. Few directors have been tagged with titles by fans as leaders in such mass revolutions. James Cameroon (Avatar, Titanic) Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, Transformers) Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) Todd Phillips (The Hangover) Mel Gibson (Brave heart) and Wes Craven (Scream). Take a moment to consider the above names and the titles. These titles will always be industry benchmarks until otherwise a newer title tops it. How many times have you watched a movie and it's not as good as the Hangover or Brave heart was better or the soundtrack in not as good as the Gladiator. There is one man who can be considered THE GODFATHER, THE DON amongst the directors/producers and cinemas William Shakespeare. Please welcome Mr. Steven Spielberg! #applause#. Jurassic Park, ET, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report and the feature of this article JAWS. All of the above done by Spielberg are trend setters within its genres and some of them are yet to be topped by another even at date.Set in Amity Island in the Early 70s (way before I was born!) JAWS is a frightening eye opener that scared me clear of dark waters up until this day. Chief Brody (Ray Scheider) who is not a great fan of the waters is put to test when the small island community is hit by a suspected Shark attack. The New Yorker who has moved in with his wife and two sons, steps immediately into full throttle and makes preparation to close down the beaches in Amity Island until the matters are resolved. Dollar hungry Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) does not allow for this to happen and keep the beaches open at the risk of further danger just so he can rake in the summer dollars to the town budget. Death strikes again and this time a young boy is devoured whole by the monstrous man eater in broad daylight in front of the happy summer tourists. An immediate community meeting is called in by the mayor and the businessman of the community to handle the situation before they lose on the summer tourism. A price is set on the man eaters head at $10,000 by veteran seaman Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) and he guarantees them "the head the tail the whole dam thing". No agreement is made at this point by the mayor. In the meantime the amateur sailors in the community head out in hunt of the man eater and comes back to shore with a tiger shark a few feet long. Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is a marine scientist - an oceanographer who investigates the remaining within the sharks belly believes that the bite radius does not match with the captured shark. He suspects it to be a great white!For a movie that is 36 years old JAWS still remains as one of the most frightening movies to be done with man-eaters in the ocean. The lack of technology in the 70s brings the man and shark closer and the encounters are face to face and the intensity is raw. If set in today's time I am sure they can fry that great white with a flick of a switch from the sea shore. Although this was a hit back in time and also this was one of those movies I grew up with, the younger generations of today underestimate the value of classics as this. At a time where most movies are being remade in high tech studios it's time we salute those movies of the yesteryear. Its time you all watched JAWS.

		<shortDescription>The most essential movie for Steven Spielberg's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i think of the enormous impact that Jaws had for Spielberg, who was completely unknown before June 1975 and then became the hottest filmmaker on the planet, his fame and international career was launched so spectacularly not because of E.T. or Raiders but because of Jaws. Jaws is the ultimate suspense thriller, it is a magical movie because even it has enormous amounts of intensity it contains so much humour, The characters are more attaching than the ones in Raiders of the lost ark because they are more real everyday persons and they evolve with each others in a more touching way. The reason why Jaws is truly spielberg most entertaining film is that he really made the movie for us, he always wanted to make us laughed, or make us scare. He was extremely determined to create suspense.Instead of reminding us that Jaws was a nightmare to shoot, spielberg should rather remember all the advantages that Jaws brought to him as a filmmaker more than any other movies he has made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear of the Real, Grounded in Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first "high concept" films and father of the American summer blockbuster tradition, happens over no other than July 4 weekend on Amity Island, a vacation resort fuelled by the dollars of its tourism. A famed opening sequence sets up the incidence of a man-eating shark in the coastal waters. A girl goes swimming by moonlight and is pulled under, shrieking. All indications identify a shark, but Mayor Vaughn doesn't want to scare away tourists, and instructs Brody, the police chief, to keep the beaches open. The mayor marches along the beach wearing a sport coat and tie, persuading people to go into the water. They do, with inevitable consequences.A town meeting is disrupted by the second of the film's central characters, the coarse, peering Quint. He grates his fingernails down a blackboard with a sketch of a shark and proposes his help as a bounty hunter. Later on, Brody sits at home thumbing through books on sharks, an expedient that establishes the predator in our heads as we observe page after page of alarming teeth, unfeeling black eyes and fatalities with hunks ripped from their flesh.The third crucial character is Hooper, an oceanographer, recruited as an consultant, and practical for the movie as he can assert tense information. Brody is certain the beaches must be closed and the shark slaughtered. The mayor plays for time, and then after the shark makes the news, a big reward is proposed, and Amity is teeming with careless fortune seekers. It's here that Spielberg works in one of his most ingenious and chilling visuals for signifying the shark, a pier breaking loose from its quay and floating out to sea. Then turning around and coming back toward shore. Drifting items are employed throughout the movie to evoke the unseen shark. In the central action sequences in the last part, we're frequently looking at kegs and not at a shark, but the idea is so well recognized that the shark is there.In keeping the Great White off-screen, the man who not long from his work here could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List was exercising an approach applied by Hitchcock throughout his career, the crucial, often mistaken difference between suspense and surprise. Spielberg uses the shark to suspenseful effect for most of the movie. And the screenplay doesn't loop itself into allegory. The characters all have clear-cut intentions. A little dialogue goes far. Single lines overhang for hard-bitten brevity. The finest scene in the movie is the night scene in the kitchenette, where the men chug brandy and Quint and Hooper equate wounds. Ultimately Quint embarks on a morose monologue, telling the WWII tale of the sinking of the Indianapolis. He was one of its crew. Of the thousand or so, he says, one of the three hundred something still left before rescue came.Most people seem too caught up to wonder why the shark seems willing to trouble itself so much, at one point even trying to eat the boat. The shark has been so completely determined, through dialogue and somewhat documentary background, that its actual presence is augmented in our minds by all we've absorbed. Also, Spielberg's first smash-hit features rudiments he duplicated in many of his movies. A night sea hunt for the shark presents an early instance of his pet visual trademark, a ray of light made perceptible by smog. He's continued to apply strong concentration on characters, rather than rushing past them to the special effects, as so many '80s and '90s effects directors did. In this watershed tour de force and later, he favors atmosphere over emotional battering, and one of the extraordinary things about the movie is its naturalistically low-key milieu. The recognizable theme by John Williams, which, I dunno, maybe you've heard, is subdued and cunning. It's frequently heard during point-of-view shots, at water level and below, that are another way Spielberg implies the shark without brandishing it. The cinematography, by Bill Butler, is painstakingly marshals the story amidst middle-class America. If Spielberg's preferred location would become the all-American residential communities, Jaws shows his favorite middle-class squatters on vacation.</fullReview>

I, as many i'm sure, can't stand having to read long and self indulgent bullsh*t reviews about what are, lets face it, basic movies, that do not need to be pulled part scene by scene.Jaws is, without doubt, one of the most entertaining movies ever made. It is near on perfect in every way. The plot, casting, direction, production, acting and set pieces are genius. We could all pick holes in scenes and compare it to more widely accepted 'classics' but at the end of the day, as far as good old fashioned 'lets watch a good movie' films go, Jaws kicks 99% of films asses.Sit down on a Sunday, turn down the lights and let this movie in to your life - We are gonna need a bigger boat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic. Whether you like it or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just spent the last 30 minutes or so reading the "Bad" reviews of this movie and this is what I heard: "This movie kept me from going in the water for years!" and "Sharks don't act like this" and "Millions and millions of sharks were killed because of this movie!" It blows me away that people would say downright stupid things like this.If this movie kept you out of the water for x-amount of years, thats what it was supposed to do!!!!! If you think "sharks don't do that", then you should tell me how many times through the years ET has stopped off for Reese's Pieces at your place over the years or How many times Jabba the Hut has kidnapped you. It is FICTION!!!!!!!!!!1 If you feel too many sharks have been killed cause of this movie, GO HUG A TREE. Give me a break.Now to the movie. This is one of the best movies of all time. The cast? Fantastic. The suspense? Awesome. The fear I still have at the beach? Downright exhilarating. The movie does seem a little slow at times, but I understand that there had to be "Slow" time before the final fight.Robert Shaw was amazing in the Indianapolis speech and I thought Schieder was great as the land-lubber sheriff.The movie is better than the source material, I think. I believe the newer generation CANNOT enjoy this film, only because Hollywood has gone to the MTV way of making films. So if you are over 30 you will probably enjoy this film, if not, go watch Jersey Shore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fear of the Unseen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all. Jaws marked a before and after in American Cinema; it became the first true Blockbuster movie and it has since influenced films for 35 years. Before Jaws came out, there weren't any summer movies (perhaps many critics regret this since summer movies aren't necessarily recognized for its artistic value), but this movie set the standard for what a summer movie should look like. Jaws also launched the career of Steven Spielberg as a director since he was largely unknown by the general public. So you may ask yourself what made this film such a success. There are a great amount of factors that I consider helped turn Peter Benchley's bestselling novel into such a terrific thriller. First of all John Williams's score is breathtaking. The suspense he created with a few notes that accompanied the shark's point of view with the camera where masterful. There was no need to see the terrible shark; the music alone built the fear in us. Sometimes we fear more what is unseen than what is actually seen, and in the case of the shark it was much scarier not knowing where it was going to come out from in the water. The shark tales and pictures we see of people who have been attacked by sharks throughout the beginning of the movie are sufficient enough. Spielberg has already inserted fear in our minds before we even have a chance to see the actual beast. This technique was one of the reasons the movie was so successful. Everyone remembers the speech about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as one of the highlights of the film and that is because it worked just like a scary tale in the middle of a campfire in the woods works, because it takes the atmosphere and the context and plays with our imagination inserting fear into our minds.Jaw takes place in a fictitious island resort named Amity Island. Summer is approaching and the town is getting ready to receive thousands of tourists coming to its beautiful beaches, but a local teenager has just appeared washed up in the shore attacked by some sort of animal, probably a shark. Local Police Chief, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), is investigating the incident. According to the forensic report the cause of death was a shark attack. Brody thinks it is best to close down the beaches until the shark can be killed, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) stops him and says this will have a huge economical impact on the town. It is too soon to scare off the tourists and he gets the forensic doctor to change his report on the cause of death, so Brody reluctantly has to follow the Mayor's orders. The next day another incident takes place, although this time it occurs in plain sight, and a local boy is killed by a shark. Brody closes the beach and the boy's mother offers a reward to whoever catches the shark. Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) is the local shark hunter who knows they are dealing with a very big shark and tells the Mayor that if he wants the shark hunted then he will have to get paid a lot more than the reward the woman is offering. Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) is an Oceanographer who comes to the Island to help Chief Brody with the case. Together Hooper, Brody, and Quint set sail on the Orca to try to hunt the shark that has everyone panicking. They will soon find out that they are gonna need a bigger boat.Jaws is considered by many as one of the greatest thrillers ever made. It is no surprise that after this movie came out very few people wanted to get into the water. The shark was in everyone's nightmares. Jaws actually took home three Oscars, one for the musical score, another for the Sound effects, and a third for best editing under Verna Fields who took a lot of the credit for the success of the movie during that time. Spielberg was overlooked as a director, but he later proved in his other movies he was one of the reasons the film was so successful. He was a visionary in his field and was able to create one of the best thrillers without great visual effects. The secret was building the suspense through the unseen and showing the shark as little as possible. By the end of the film we were so immersed in it that we even believed the improbable ending and didn't even feel cheated by that final climax scene. Spielberg combined suspense and thrills with comedy and action to perfection. Each character played an important part in the film and Brody, Hooper, and Quint became popular characters in movie history. This may have been one of Spielberg's first films, but it still ranks among his best work because it managed to terrify audiences for ages to come.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book Vs. Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who are we kidding, this film is a classic. Not much more to add.What I want to point out is that Jaws is the exception that proves a rule. IN this case, the rule is, Books are always better than the Movie. It's almost always true in all but a few cases, and in the few cases, the book wasn't any great shakes to start with.Peter Benchley's Jaws was a heavily marketed book because they knew they were going to make a film out of it. The problem is, if they filmed it as written, it would have been confusing, the characters unlikable (seriously, you'd have been cheering for the Shark!) and the subplots weren't even logical. Thankfully, they scrapped almost all of it in Carl Gottlieb's rewrite.Then you have the factor of Spielberg himself, then a young, cutting edge director. (As opposed to today, where he's such a mega-producer, no one dares tell him he's making garbage like "IJ4: Crystal Skull".).Finally, you had the actors, perfectly cast for these parts, taking them and making them their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself to be one huge movie lover and my dream career would to be in the film industry. Now, I have been a Spielberg fan for as long as I can remember. I was born in the early 90's and Jurassic Park was released and it was my favorite for awhile. Until I turned 10 and saw Jaws. This has to be one of the greatest movies of all time because it sends fear and intensity into your head and entire body but the strange thing is that it's a really well made movie. The characters are well acted, Hooper is my personal favorite, the filming itself is impressive and of course the legendary score is probably the greatest piece of all time in the movie industry. I wish I could say more but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Take my advise, SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first of all, my apologies for any errors in terms of word formation and etc....I am an Icelander and a 17-year old....etc. Whatever...That doesn't change the fact that this movie is a wonderful work of art!OK let's start!I actually saw this movie for the first time just a few weeks ago...and boy do I NOT regret to have seen it! This film did something that is pretty hard for other movies to do when it comes to me...It made me CARE for the characters and really managed to keep me completely stiff-frozen in my seat. For those who haven't seen the movie...Quick! Get out to the next store and buy it, because this one is worth holding tightly on to!First of all. The character build-up is wonderful and the three main characters are so well portrayed that you desperately don't want anything to happen to them. Clearly the acting-formation of the three R-es (as I like to call them, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and last but certainly not least...Richard Dreyfuss) works remarkably well!1. Roy Scheider has this extraordinary thing about him that makes you like him instantly as the character chief Martin Brody.2. Robert Shaw was just magnificent as Captain Quint, and I even go as far as saying that his speech on the boat was Oscar-worthy3. Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper is really very funny and truly a necessary, like-able character (my favorite one in the movie). His laughs are the best!Second: Director Steven Spielberg and his staff are able to make so suspenseful moments that you almost jump out of your seat in excitement! I mean...you don't even see the shark until in the second-half of the movie and although you cant't see him...He STILL scares the crap out of you! Third: The directing is, of course, top-notch (we're talking about Steven Spielberg here..so...I don't even have to mention it) and the amazing view of the ocean and scenery is also beautiful.Fourth: The story grabs your attention right away and keeps you amazed all the way through. (again...We're talking about Steven Spielberg, the master of story-telling but it is also true that it is based on a novel).Fifht: The music score is incredibly good, also given that it is one of the movie's trademark yet still to this very day, today.Sixth: It Makes you afraid of sharks after-wards! I can't imagine how uncomfortable many people must feel when they go swimming in the ocean after such a film like this!In the end, I must say that after I saw Jaws for the first time, I couldn't stop thinking about it later...and when a movie does that to you, it really means that it has something special to offer the rest of you movie-goers. Considerably, Jaws is one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life...."You're gonna need a bigger boat" cause Jaws is too much filled with excitement to fit in yours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This big white shark not only killed his hapless on-screen victims, but - more disastrously - an era of intelligent and thought-provoking American cinema called New Hollywood. Spielberg introduced a new dimension of immensely successful pulp storytelling. No place for adult themes and honest emotions any more... at least in box-office terms.But fortunately, "Jaws" is pre-bumptious Spielberg, when he still worked as an effective craftsman, not a self-important mainstream "artist".So the movie's thankfully devoid of the cuties and cheap symbolism and bathos, that would soon ruin most of Spielberg's work. Instead, what we get are solid thrills, a splendidly cast trio of shark-hunters, some funny lines and quite a shoddy-looking man-eating shark named Bruce.7 out of 10 crushed plastic cups</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Tense Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" (1975) is a very tense movie. The film works on two very different levels: one, a simple shocker and the other is complex character study of three people ("Police Chief Martin Brody" played by Roy Scheider,"Matt Hooper" played by Richard Dreyfuss and "Quint" played by Robert Shaw) dealing with horrific shark attacks. All the leads give excellent performances, so, unlike nowadays in a disaster movie, you actually care about the people nearly being (and in some cases) eaten alive by a giant shark (and the shark dos not looks very rubbery to me!). But be warned, the climax is very bloody and tense. Not a film for young children! A movie definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

There's nothing more exciting the hearing the theme music. The acting ain't bad either.Jaws had people scared to go in the water. Jaws is still scary today. Seeing that pool of blood and short glimpses of the shark is chilling. The music and camera work just make it great. Things get even better at the end when it becomes 'Man vs. Beast' in a nail biting ending.If you have never seen a Spielberg movie then you haven't seen many good movies. Spielberg is possibly the best director of all time. I just can't think how bad the cinematic world would have been if he never became a director.Spielberg has made many great movies. From great family movies E.T., Jurassic Park. To great adventure Indiana Jones and Jaws.I highly recommend this. The only problem i had with this was it got boring in the middle. But besides that Jaws is classic and will remain one for decades to come. One of Speilbergs best. This isn't just a monster movie. THIS IS Spielberg.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is a absolutely BRILLIANT thriller - certainly one of the best thrillers ever made. This is obviously the ultimate shark movie. It is a very intense and exciting film. This is yet another great Steven Spielberg movies - I think Spielberg is one of the best directors ever.It is about a killer shark that killed a few people on a certain beach. Then they hire someone to go and kill the shark - which is a very long and hard process that gets one of them killed and the other two (on the shark hunting boat) almost killed. The great white shark which they are trying to kill is absolutely massive.The last shark attack is quite gruesome and you see a fair bit - but I still think the movie is a PG movie. Just don't watch it if you hate blood and gore.This is definitely a movie that will be remembered and is certainly one of my favorite movies.This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who loves very intense, exciting and fast-paced thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is a really good film. This is the movie that launched Spielberg's career into the heights that has never been reached before. The story for Jaws is simple. It's about a man-eating shark that terrorizes a town of Amity Beach and three people must trap and kill the shark:a police chief, a marine biologist, and a boat captain. For most of the movie, Jaws is intense and keeps you on your seat anticipating what is going to happen next. The action scenes featuring the shark are wonderful to watch even though there is a little gore. However, there are a couple scenes that are boring. These scenes occur basically towards the middle of the movie. The music in this film definitely rockstarted John William's career. The shark melody is mesmerizing. The acting, directing, and cinematography are all top-rate. I would advise parents not to show this to your children until they are at least 9. I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not saying that Steven Spielberg doesn't make good movies anymore, I just think that he has lost his feel for suspense. In two of his early films, this and Duel, the suspense was so brilliantly crafted and unexpected. I wish he still made films like this. Jaws is one of the best films in history, hands down! I know I'm definitely not the first to say all these things about Jaws but there are many reasons why so many have. The acting, the script, the shooting, the score and the setting are all amazing. Like most people, I was scared to go in the water when I was a kid because of this film. It's that scary! I think the fact that the shark is rarely shown adds so much to the suspense factor because you have to use your imagination. Mark my words, this film is truly terrifying.If you haven't seen Jaws, you've probably been living under a rock for the past 3 decades. Come out into the light and enjoy Spielberg's best.

Sharks don't purposefully attack people. Obviously the whole point of the movie is that there is a shark that attacks people willfully. To maintain credibility it should've really driven that point home on a few occasions.This was the movie that started the BIGGG Hollywood blockbuster. It's too bad that not even 50% of the big summer blockbusters released today even come close to touching the quality of the film making in 'Jaws'.9/10 (It'd be ten if it had given itself full credibility).(reviewed after 5+ (at least) viewings)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws, a thrilling horror film, is set on the fictitious Amity Island in the mid-seventies. The film focuses on a series of shark attacks and a subsequent shark hunt. Jaws is based on a bestselling novel by Peter Bentley, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. The groundbreaking 1975 film has won Academy Awards for Film Editing, Music, and Sound. Its cast is full of talented actors, including Roy Schneider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss.The acting seen in this film is phenomenal. Roy Schneider perfectly depicts the paranoid police officer from New York, Martin Brody, who is terrified of water. Schneider plays the part so well that the viewer can almost feel Brody's terror throughout the film, especially whenever he is anywhere near water. Robert Shaw is very convincing as Quint, a mad fisherman obsessed with shark hunting. Shaw's believable persona reminds me of Ahab, the crazed captain who devoted his life to the hunt for Moby Dick. Richard Dreyfuss portrays the geeky, shark-savvy "college boy" exceptionally well, adding comic relief to the otherwise morbid film with his dark sense of humor.Although Jaws was released over thirty years ago, its special effects are extremely believable. The first two shark attacks seen in the film are frightening, but not because viewers can see the actual shark; in fact, Jaws is only implied in these scenes. These shark attacks are chilling to watch because the viewer can sense the fear and pain and agony of the victim; he or she can see the water turning from blue-gray to red; the viewer can hear the shrill, desperate cries for help. The last shark attack of the film, however, is disturbing on a different level. In this scene, both the victim and Jaws are visible. It's graphic and realistic. In addition, the cadavers seen in the film aren't false-looking; the twisted remains of Jaws' victims are grisly and grotesque.I first saw Jaws in my English class when I was a junior in high school. I was expecting it to be incredibly lame, but I was pleasantly surprised. Jaws is a great movie. It's suspenseful, scary, interesting, and funny. The acting and special effects are believable. The score succeeds in "setting the scene" throughout the film. The screenplay is well-written. Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job as the director; he's very good at capturing emotion, especially fear and panic. Jaws is definitely worth seeing, even if you've never seen it before or you think it's overrated. You should give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Brody is the new police chief of Amity, an island resort town somewhere in New England. He has a wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a Summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Mayor Larry Vaughn, who is desperate to not lose the money that will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins. Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells all of the local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money. On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Really fun shark movie with only very little flaws and cheesy effects. This movie is a classic in every sense of a word.Rated PG for Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws- Classic chills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very fond memories of this Spielberg classic. I watched it when I was very young and I was terrified, it still has the same impact on me to this day. Unfortunately Jaws comes under criticism nowadays. The main criticism aimed at Jaws, some viewers of today claim that the movie is disappointing because they don't see enough of the shark. Well my response to that is that that was intentional, Spielberg wanted to create scenes of false scares along with some actual ones where we as the viewers actually see the shark. That is what makes Jaws so memorable. When released it became one of highest grossing movies of the decades.Spielberg for me has conquered almost 2 decades, in the 70's there was Jaws, 80'S was E.T. and 90's was Jurrassic Park. Unfortunately he has yet to make a memorable movie of this decade. Unfortunately none of the 3 sequels could match the brilliance of the original. Classic chills from the master of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to go fishing at Amityville!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the greatest thriller movies of all times, where a gigantic great white shark begins a spree of terror in the town of Amityville, threatening its beach-loving residents, and leading police chief Brody, marine scientist Hooper and gruff fisherman Quint seeking to destroy it before it keeps going to fish for humans. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all gave memorable performances in their respectable roles, out to catch and destroy the man-eating shark. The special effects were great, especially the performance of the shark - realistic and downright scary. Seeing people being drag beneath the waters by the shark as the water turn blood red is one creepy experience you'll never forget. John Williams' haunting music score is one of his most popular and signature musical works, an icon in the movie soundtracks. Just those few musical bars will forever make audience realize that this is "Jaws." Steven Spielberg gave one of his finest directions, making this an exciting and intriguing movie to watch.During the scenes near or under the water, there is an eerie feeling, making you wonder whether the shark will come up bite you or is lurking near you. The shark's entrance by sticking one of its fins above the water is probably one of the most signature character appearances of all time. One funny scene is when Chief Brody tells his kids to get out of the boat, but his wife assures him that nothing is going to happen. Then, she glances at this book where it shows pictures of shark attacks. Then, she tells the kids to "get out of the water, now!" Overall, a perfect horror movie for a Friday night.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is perhaps one of the finest films in any genre.**SPOILERS**Following a mysterious swimming accident, Police Chief Martin Brody, (Roy Scheider) is called in and they find the victim completely mangled. Fearing the worst, Mayor Larry Vaughn, (Murray Hamilton) talks him down until more victims are found, forcing them to call in Matt Hooper, (Richard Dreyfuss) a shark specialist. Thinking it's finished when a shark is caught, they soon discover that the shark is still out there. When the time comes after another shark attack, the Mayor finally relents and decides to hire shark hunter Quint, (Robert Shaw) to track down and kill the shark. As the three men board the boat to get the shark, they realize that it's much bigger than initially anticipated and a long, drawn-out battle between them and the shark for supremacy of the waters begins.The Good News: There's a really lot to like about this one, as it's one of the greatest films around. There's one main reason why this works, and that's because of it's theme. This is one of the very few films that actually uses a well-known and believable human fear as the basis for it's thrills. The idea of a huge shark or sea creature attacking us when we're completely vulnerable is a scary notion, and this here plays this up to perfection. The fact of making us right there with the victims when the shark's about to attack is the best way of showing this, and it gives a chilling sense of fear of the sea. This also helps to give the moments where the shark is there but unseen and there's a reason to believe it is. By making it seem like it's there but we can't see it, the feeling of dread that's captured by this technique. The several beach attacks are the best examples of this, which are some of the better scenes in the film. There's a ton of suspense in these scenes as the vulnerability of the potential victims in an unnatural environment makes it all the more frightening. This also adds the extra dimension of having the film appear to be more realistic, since this could actually happen. The realism of having a giant creature invading recreational waters and prey on defenseless humans without cause or care over who is attacked where is a truly scary feeling, and this plays off those feelings as well. These are mostly helped with the most innovative technique where we're right up there in the face of danger with the camera-work. This is a beautiful looking movie, and it causes most of the film's biggest scares to come from it. From the sweeping vistas out at sea that capture the entire sea, to the up-close-and-intimate work during the attacks to a simply marvelous sequence where an attack is foreshadowed by sweeping across the witness closer-and-closer when a new victim crosses by, the camera-work in here is simply outstanding. Of course, the ferocity of the attacks is what really makes them stand-out, and the main attacks in here are so brutal and scary that they still drive home the point countless times over. It's hard not to pick a standout as they're all timeless in their quality and simply marvelous in their brutality. The film's high-point, if one such spot exists, is the ending fight against the shark. This is a series of innovative, interesting and logical events to destroy the creature, and everything in here is a joy to behold. From the cage assault to the barrel sequences to the beginning stages of hunting it down, every scene here scores wonderfully. It's also got everything needed to enjoy the sequence, as the lulls are eminently watchable, there's tons of fast-paced action and every step is also logically done, which is perhaps the greatest plus of that series. They're totally believable, which is the greatest trick possible done in the film. It's also a long, drawn-out affair, making sure that time is taken with it so as to make sure that the shark comes off as a strong, imposing threat to the group, which it is, and that every resource imaginable must be thrown at it to bring it down. There's countless words that can be thrown at it to describe these scenes as they're loads of fun. The last big plus is it's great score, which is simple, catchy and really manages to drive up the tension, making the scares work wonders. All these make this a simply wonderful film.The Bad News: There's only a few relatively minor problems associated with this one. The main one is that the shark doesn't look that good. When the shark is on long enough to get a good look at it, it looks fine but it's biologically different. The snout is way too pointed compared to a real shark. That's a big giveaway, but the major one is that the creature's upper lips don't retract when biting, like a real shark does. As that's a big reason for a shark's fear, not including that feature makes the shark standout slightly. The last big problem is that this so easily features implausible scenes simply for scares. The attack on the cage is a sterling example, as even though it's a great-looking, action-packed scene, sharks don't exhibit that kind of behavior. The ferocity and intent of the attack is what gives it away. The finale is another excellent example, which simply can't happen in real life. There's several others, but those are the most prevalent, and are the only real flaws in this one.The Final Verdict: One of the greatest films of any genre, this one here is great entertainment with plenty to love about it. A must-see film, not only for genre and creature-feature but for movie fans in general. Highly recommended.Rated PG: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief full Nudity and children in danger</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome thriller in which everything that COULD have been done right HAS been done right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a thrilling story about a community gripped by fear as a great white shark brings death to their waters. It is also the film that truly cemented Steven Spileberg's reputation as a maker of hugely entertaining films ? and introduced a trend of studios seeking to release "summer blockbusters" that has lasted to this day. More than thirty years since its release, Jaws still retains the power both to entertain and terrify. It is a classic, plain and simple.A naked swimmer is enjoying a dip in the waters off Amity Island when she is attacked by something beneath the surface that pulls her to her death. When her mutilated remains turn up with the tide, local police officer Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) discovers that she almost certainly has fallen victim to a man-eating shark, most likely a Great White. He decides that her death is probably a tragic one-off and allows the local population, plus holiday-makers from farther afield, to come to Amity Island for the usual summer recreations. But another victim is eaten by the shark, this time a young boy swimming not too far from the beach. A huge shark hunt takes place with all the local fishermen attempting to capture the one that has brought death to their waters. They believe they have succeeded when they kill a Great White and bring it in for public display, but a scientist named Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) isn't so sure they have caught the right fish. He convince Brody to cut open the belly of the shark to see if it contains human remains in its stomach, and they discover that it does not. With the real killer Great White still at large, Brody and Hooper enlist the aid of a crusty sea-farer ? Quint (Robert Shaw) ? to track it down. But it is only once they are far out to sea that they discover what a strong and formidable foe they have taken on. A terrifying game of man .vs. nature ensues as the three hunters and the shark play out a battle to the death on the lonely waves.Jaws is awesome. So many elements gel perfectly - the casting, for one, with Scheider outstanding as the police officer trying to protect his town and family from the underwater menace. But it isn't just Scheider who catches the eye; Dreyfuss also seizes his opportunity to etch a wonderful portrayal as the scientist simultaneously thrilled and terrified by the foe he is out to destroy. And Shaw is utterly mesmerising as the experienced shark hunter who comes to realise that he is on the trail of his most dangerous ever quarry. John Williams provides one of cinema's most recognisable scores, a simple but chilling tune that builds to a devastating crescendo as the action intensifies. Spielberg reinvents the meaning of "thrill" in cinematic terms, taking his audience to the point where they think their nerves can take no more? only to turn the screw even tighter. The finale, as Scheider clings to the mast of a sinking ship and watches the shark's fin cut through the water towards him, is so tense that it is impossible not to feel your palms sweating and your pulse thudding in your ears. A fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the best movies ever. The first time I saw it, I didn't think I would like it. I didn't like it. I loved it. This movie has the honor of joining my collection of movies. The music is perfect, and when combined from the point of view of the shark, it creates the perfect combination of suspense and sheer terror. This movie single-handedly made millions of people fear water. You can not name another movie that generates this kind of atmosphere. Kudos to Steven Spielberg for one of the most well known movies of all time. This movie set the bar high for all other horror movies as well as suspense. All I have left to say is that shame on all other movies that have a Jaws parody. You are just trying to bring it down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! Jaws was excellent! I wanted to go to Old Orchard Beach in August (It's a tradition that first took place when I was 5 years old.). If I go to a beach, it's usually for the water. Well, Jaws is making me change my mind. It was mostly the death of Alex Kintner that scared me the most. Just seeing the blood splatter everywhere. UGH! And Chrissie Watkins was also pretty dramatic. But at the same time, maybe I'll go this summer, because Great Whites have never been attracted to Old Orchard beach. At least not yet... But this movie is also good. No wonder it features # 85 in IMDb's top 200. The carachters were cool, the story was original. Believe me, you won't want to miss that one out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so Citizen Kane and The Godfather are undeniably great films, and I love both of them dearly. But when it comes to sheer enjoyment from a flick, Jaws is my #1 film of all time.The mother of all blockbusters has a very simple story: a great white shark begins feeding on swimmers at an island beach resort. However, the movie is so much more than that. A young Steven Spielberg creates a visually-stunning and suspenseful film; for instance, the zoom/dolly close-up of Roy Scheider on the beach has since become a popular camera technique. The acting is excellent, and Robert Shaw's performance is especially unforgettable. The script is solid, and the dialogue is strong. And, despite what people say, Bruce (the mechanical shark) looks great! This is one must-see that even those who usually don't care for must-see movies will love. Three decades have not taken any of this film's power to please.</fullReview>

Me being from Newport, Rhode Island which is one of, if not the biggest summer places on the east coast saw the movie at a drive in. Well we went to the beach the next day and it was packed, oh there were bikinis and people playing beach games and all that. but not one persons toe touched that water. Peter Benchley did not obviously know what kind of fright he was creating. I understand that this story is based on facts but as all good story's, he twisted a few things around to create a horror classic. And Steven Spielberg only 28 years old incredible photography what an eye that man has. And of course Robert Shaw, Rob Schnider, and last but definitely not least Richard Dryfeuss all played there parts to well. I think I will close with the immortal of Chief Brody ( WERE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT ) a 10+.Noquitter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Jaws film in my opinion was excellent and one of my old time favourite films alongside The deer Hunter, and Its a Wonderful life and many Fred Astaire musicals which sadly they do not make anymore.Jaws was excellent and Steven Spielberg deserves top credit for this as he does for many of his films. The Music was excellent, unforgettable and quite scary and the cast especially The Great Late Robert Shaw was brilliant as usual as the Old Sea Dog and he played a great part in this film, the story is brilliant, it is tense with some memorable performances from the cast the making of this film was also very interesting and the scenes from the sea with all three men in the boat were great and the line you are gonna need a bigger boat is great the film is exciting, absorbing, tense scary and thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching i cannot believe it was made many moons ago in the mid 1970s but it is still one hell of a film and enjoyable to watch again and again and i love the script and can still remember some of the lines actor Robert Shaw said in the Jaws film especially the stories he told when in the middle of the ocean with the two other guys very scary will make you jump out of your seat or at least leave you on the edge of your seat and have you transfixed and wonder what is going to happen next. This film has been seen by many and if you have not watched it yet i am surprised get watching it now you will not regret it.

		<fullReview>This Movie delivers what critics said it would and I was not disappointed. This movie was so thrilling and never was there a dull moment.From the Start I thought that the whole film would be depicted on the beach. How wrong I was. At least 40 minutes of this was spent on the boat and thank Spielberg for that, because he knew that the second half of the movie needed to be better, and it definitely was.The most fascinating tecnique used was how Spielberg and his team rarely allowed the Shark to be revealed. Instead they used the camera to be depict the Shrak's view of what it's thinking.Another enjoyable part is the realism used. I cannot think of a film before this when attacks looked so real, especially when the boy got attacked by the Big White. A pool of blood leaked. Even Movies like THE BREAK UP have less realism in action scenes. You could literally see blood on the side of Gary's Nose, not coming out of it.To everyone who just read this, if you have not seen the film, go and rent it out because it is a timeless classic, which would be very difficult to shoe off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Jaws in the summer of 1975,I thought it was amazing then and 31 years on it's still as just as good. Every time I see this film is like seeing it for the first time again.I don't know how many times I've seen Jaws,but,I'm guessing it must be in excess of 20 and I never seem to tire of it. This is one of the only film's I have ever watched were you know what's going to happen next and you don't want to fast forward or skip to the next scene.Dreyfuss,Shaw and Scheider are brilliant together. The film is witty &amp; frightening, with a perfect balance struck between these two elements throughout. A case in point is Robert Shaws recounting of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the shark attacks on the survivors which is immediately followed by the trio singing a jovial version of "Show me the way to go home". Robert Shaws performance as a "on the edge" character is truly memorable and his rendition of "Ladies of Spain" (I don't know the real name of the song, so this description will have to do)sticks in your head for days after the film. Finally,The movies score is terrific and atmospheric and keeps you on the edge of your seat during the attack scenes.A classic movie score that will live forever. One of my all time favorites,so 10/10 for Jaws (the original), Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is one of the films that will forever leave a mark on you. It's terrifying and will continue in generation after generation to keep people afraid of the water. Jaws was pure great adventure/horror film, that will continue to tap your fear against sharks and the ocean. For director Steven Spielberg, this was a huge turning point for him. Jaws is a landmark classic, and started the blockbuster generation, and one of the first movies to reach the $100 million dollar mark. Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. I think this is one of Spielberg's best work, for a first time director. Spielberg is a very smart and talented director. Steven Spielberg's terrifying blockbuster is one of the most brilliant, enduring, action-suspense movies of all time.Jaws is a phenomenon, and today it is still one of the highest grossing films of all time. The visuals of the shark will wear of anytime soon, but yet who cares, it's not about the special effects. It was the 70's, and for that time around, the shark looked pretty real. I really hated the sequels to this film. It just killed the the first film, and it just made me sick to look at. All three sequels, especially the four one, were not as close as the first Jaws. Jaws 2 was more of a teen flick, which I thought wasn't a serious film. Jaws 3 (3-D) took place in Seaworld which I thought was a very stupid idea. Jaws the Revenge, a shark stalks a 60 year old woman and takes revenge on her! What is up with that? I mean what was Universal thinking! I recommend this film to all, it is tense and an enjoyable film that will have you scream and jump out of your seats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this thing countless of times since I was young. In fact, it was my mother's favorite and was the first movie that we ever rented as soon as they were available on the market in the early 80s. And there were two scenes that just HORRIFIED me and still produce a shock each time -- the part where the head pops out of the sunken boat and the part where the Skipper gets his. Since then the part where the guy's leg falls off into the ocean floor has pretty much rivaled that scene's scariness.However none of those were very realistic attacks. The most realistic one was the first one -- the girl in the bay. There's probably attacks like that in seaside resorts all over every whenever. And that is the part where you learn not to trick a shark into thinking you are a seal.However, in none of these were mentions of the very FACT that a shark CAN swim anywhere up to half-way down the Amazon and even into the New Jersey channel as long as the water remains, "brackish" -- that is, a hybrid of salt &amp; fresh water. And my question is, "why?" It would seem logical. After all, Spielberg and Benchley would have you believe that a shark intentionally seeks out a human or even boat victim like it had a radar or something when that's the furthest thing from reality. One such race of shark is the bull-shark, though there are others, and I wouldn't doubt that the Great White would be among them. Yet, nowhere in the film did it even think of doing such things as has been found in real-life, supposedly.7 is the highest rating that I've gave a film so far, and I probably won't go much further than that because no film's perfect. However this one, for a mid-70s thriller, isn't bad. It's just a bit repetitive because it's over 30 and is on all the time. So I gave it that because it has never really worn out and still manages to have its moments at least. However, I had to knock off points because it too is capable of insulting my intelligence and has also been somewhat responsible for genocide of sharks worldwide. At least though, it did inspire others to learn more about them.An overall very powerful and unique film and book alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I have seen this movie more than 25 times, I still get shivers ever time I hear the pounding bass from John William's brilliant score. The opening scene in Jaws is, hands down, the most guttural, frightening scene in the history of cinema. Unlike other horror/thriller films before or after, Jaws delivers elements of adventure, politics and humor. Spielberg will always remain a genius because of this movie, especially for his tactic of not really showing us the "monster" until 2/3's into the film. Brody, Quint and Hooper's unique triangular relationship is another trademark of this entertaining film. If you are one of the few people who haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself a favor and rent this classic, but don't watch it before you plan to go swimming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fearsome cartoon shark, Bruce, from Finding Nemo wouldn't have exited without Jaws. So many people's fear of the ocean, and particularly shark infested waters near otter and seals (such as up and down the California coast), wouldn't be what it still is (save for the gotta-cowabunga surfer-dudes), thirty years later, if not for this blockbuster summer hit that was Spielberg's breakthrough film.The 26 foot great white is introduced slowly, as a blur killing the little boy, more as bird's eye under the water killing the guy in the 'pond', but fully at the stern of the Orca, at last, and which then proceeds to attack the boat and its crew as if this fish were the equal of Rommel writing on tank tactics, and were as unstoppable as any terminator juggernaut - four barrels!, says Shaw's Quint, in disbelief. The barrels represent the shark, of course, when they pop to the surface (a sort of black humor).Schieder as the chief is very believable. Spielberg said he looked to cast an elderly Sterling Hayden, the nutty general from Kubrick's, Dr. Strangelove. But Hayden had other plans. Schieder is good. Dreyfuss is the same, for a guy whose characters veer into the annoying. He gets excited, and sometimes doesn't know what to say to bullies. But he's brave, at the last, and shows that he is paying attention. And Shaw's Quint does the same. Sure, he has the bluster of one who just doesn't like or trust people, as with the classic nails-on-the-blackboard scene where he negotiates his price of ten thousand, which eventually they pay. But when Dreyfuss tells Schieder to watch it, on the Orca, or else tip over some compressed air tanks (to introduce the essential plot resolution, later), after sort of dismissing Dreyfuss, Shaw in more hushed tones tells Schieder's character to watch it, as well - ask if you don't know what you're doing. So he's paying attention. But the character flaw of Quint, suggested by his general demeanor and craziness, is that he copes poorly under stress. He just flakes out. He becomes dangerously unglued. One could only imagine his difficulty in the water after the sinking of the Indy in WWII, which his character in this story was said to suffer.As for the script, it seems much was opportunistic. Spielberg was up against it. Things weren't going well, it seemed. He thought they might stop production, and that would be it - and his career it might have turned out. But as others have pointed out, and I think Spielberg's friend and close collaborator, George Lucas, should take note, the success of the film was due not merely to the outstanding and appropriate score, but to what you didn't see on screen. It succeeded not because of the hard fought effort to get the effects to work, but because for the longest time, they didn't, forcing the filmmakers to improvise. What you got, instead, was an almost clean, theatrical encouragement to imagination - film-making as substitute for radio serials. Crissy, the opening victim, doesn't even seem to bleed. Something is happening to her, but there are no bloodpacks in the mouth, as later with Quint, when you've already seen the shark. She just, literally, gets jerked back and forth and is pulled under. It's much the same for the mannequin, the remains of the fisherman found in the dead of night as Dreyfuss confesses that he's rich and bought that boat/yacht, himself. The dead head is obviously a prop. But the reaction shot, the pacing, and importantly that Spielberg has your suspension of disbelief at that point, might make it work. At lot is left to the imagination for you to ignore that it's obviously a prop, a dummy.Looking on the shark, now, in 2006, it's difficult not to see that it's obviously a mechanical prop. But in 1975, if you'd said to most people, they're building a large mechanical shark, people might have said - why? Great whites were known to those who would know. Those around Martha's Vineyard knew, of course - and that it didn't work, most of the time. But I think to most, this was the introduction of a creature they didn't know existed. So caught up in the film's suspense, the pacing, the direction, I think it was easily possible not to see this as a mechanical thing, but literally by imagination to overlook the obvious and make it seem what it was supposed to be - a live, gigantic, smart as an elephant, shark. But again, fortunately for the filmmakers, the fake shark was broken much of the time. And some of the key underwater footage was of real great whites, sometimes attacking a small model of the shark cage, scaled down. And Spielberg even shot a few brief shots of 'Dreyfuss' in the cage at the very last in someone's swimming pool.There are a couple of key scenes. The set up for the shark eating the guy in the dingy, in the 'pond', apparently goes to some theme of the novel of the greedy businessmen who would overlook their civic duty and responsibility for the sake of not shutting down business on the big holiday. And then the 'shark fin' attacks, the frightened adults paw over the kids floating in their way, and trample the oldsters who can't get out of their way.Another is the first view of the shark, showing that it is as big as the boat. That's the key scene because Quint jumps into attack mode, rather than abide the advice that they should retire from the scene - they need a bigger boat. This isn't a shark - it's Moby Dick.And the last, obviously, was the one set up by the air tanks falling. Jaws bites one, holds it in its mouth, and policeman Scheider gets off a lucky shot. Otherwise, the movie ends as it should have ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the faint of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest shark movie of all time. The deaths in this movie are very grizzly and brutal, but hey, what would you expect from a shark? The acting is superb, the music is powerful, the fear is sudden and unexpected. It's like Jurassic Park, but with sharks. I know the shark looks really fake at some points of the movie, but still just the excitement and tension going on makes you forget that. And it's not just some mindless horror movie about a hark attacking people, it's much deeper than that. It's a movie about self-conscious, doing what is right, and not succumbing to peer pressure. A very quick overview of the story would be: The Chief of Police on Amity Island is struggling to keep the beaches safe from a large shark, but the Mayor insists that they stay open for the tourists. It's got a lot of ties into other subplots, but it still comes down free of any confusion. This is one of the best films by Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every summer without fail, I stick Jaws in the DVD player and just enjoy the ride. I love watching it the day before going to the beach.This has to be one of the greatest films to ever grace the screen, pure thrills from start to finish.Last summer I made a friend of mine - a young woman who is easily frightened and has flat out refused to watch several of my favourite movies in case she gets scared - sit down and watch every second of this masterpiece, and she came away a changed woman. She absolutely loved it. Even the scary bits.I first saw Jaws when I was three or four (I know what you're thinking - Great parenting!) and I can still recall the first nightmare it gave me. I was so traumatised even I refused to watch all of it well into my teens. But about eight years ago it played on TV and I was hooked.I can't wait for summer to roll around ...10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are many reasons to have respect for this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most atmospheric Horror movies ever made. "Jaws" is truly a master piece. A mainstream Horror movie about sharks was an idea that was begging for a release, but only someone as great as Spielberg could produce it in such a flawless way.The best thing about "Jaws" is the direction in my opinion. The camera does the job for the killer shark. I mean, you don't need to see it in order to be scared. That's the best thing about "Jaws". The terror that is created is thanks to Spielberg's direction.But also the plot is excellent. A simple, common idea was taken to a new level of creativity. The f/x are great, amazing. This is the real shark to fear of. Also, what can be said about the classical score? It's simply amazing and it's a part of cinema history. The score plays an important part in the movie's creepy atmosphere. Also, the acting is top notch and lead by high profile actors. You can't get a better cast, director, and musical producer than in "Jaws".There isn't too much to spoil. In fact, if you haven't seen the movie please watch it not only if you like the idea. "Jaws" is a great movie in all aspects. Forget about it's Horror label. The movie stands alone and that's why it's been respected for many generations. In these days "JAWS" is overrated but believe me, believe the hype towards it. The concept is thrlled and clich?d but it's effective. The ocean hasn't been the same since this movie. A movie that has scared, and impressed many generations. I have to admit that when I was a child, I had nightmares before going to the beach on vacations. I was terrified by this movie when I was on a boat or swimming. So my advice is, don't show this movie to your kids! ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had everything - you loved the characters, the storyline was great and it had plenty of gore! C'mon, people, you CARED about the characters and you were terrified. I saw this with my family and I remember when Ben Gardner's head popped out from that hole in his hull I buried my head in my father's armpit and didn't come up for five minutes. This movie completely affected me and to this day I don't go wading in the ocean at the beach. The shark may have been a technological nightmare but I bought it - hook, line and sinker. Who isn't scared by crusty, old Quint and yet empathizes when he tells his Indianapolis story? You don't love Hooper and his nerdy, giggly comebacks? And Brody? He is every normal father in the 70's. This movie is a classic, warts and all, and still gives me warm fuzzies and the chills 25 years later. I just wish I could remember the line after Hooper lifts up Chrissie's arm in the autopsy room and says, "This is what happens. . .". bcz, for some odd reason they cut the scene after he says that and we don't get to hear the rest of the line. Still bothers me.I live in Palm Beach close to the beach but I don't go swimming at the beach. Never have after this movie. AWESOME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost impossible to give an objective review of this film ? a cultural phenomenon, the first modern Hollywood blockbuster, the movie that propelled Steven Spielberg to iconic status and was the progenitor of that horrible cinematic trend known as 'franchising.' Nonetheless, as I watched it yet again last Sunday, I realized I had never actually reviewed this film, and as I spend enough time poring over bad and mediocre films, it would be a nice change to review a good ? nay, a great ? one.Set in the resort community of Amity, Jaws follows the story of what happens to the town when a shark comes hunting and threatens their precious summer economy. Of course there's much more than that going on; it's also the personal story of Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) a man living on an island who's afraid of the water, and those who help him pursue the shark: oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the colorful, cantankerous shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw).Spielberg sets up the film economically and effortlessly, sketching Amity with exactly the right details, rendering it familiar to us in an instant. From the Boy Scout water badge tests to the man badgering the chief about painting a red zone on the curb in front of his house, Amity is suburban anywhere, circa 1975, a small, quiet town of normal people whom Spielberg breathes to life with swift but textured strokes. Standing out amongst them is Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), whose interest in preserving the town's economy nearly leads it to ruin; but rather than render the mayor a one-dimensional villain, Spielberg gives him a moment of stark humanity in a scene in the hospital where he is so unnerved by a shark attack a few hours earlier that he absent-mindedly starts to smoke. He turns to Brody and hisses in a wavering voice, "Martin, my kids were out there in that water too." While Hooper joins the proceedings relatively early (in a hilarious scene where every fisherman in the northeast is launching their boat to try and nab the $3K reward on the shark) and is saddled with the lion's share of educating the audience about sharks (the exposition is seamlessly worked into three conversations between Hooper and Brody), Spielberg is wise to save Quint until the second half of the picture. Although he makes a brief cameo earlier (scratching his nails on a chalkboard to gain everyone's attention ? how's that for an entrance?), once Quint is on board full time the movie really kicks into high gear. His disdain for Hooper's easy life and modern gear aside, Quint is like a character straight out of Hemmingway, and Shaw fleshes him out to perfection. In the hands of another director and actor, Quint probably would have been easy to dislike, but here, he steals the show from the other two men, and again, much like the mayor, he is given his scene of humanity, where he discloses that he was a crew member of the USS Indianapolis, the ship that was torpedoed by the Japanese on a highly secret mission to deliver the atom bomb.Spielberg masterfully follows the heroic plot arc in this movie. The hero's simple village is threatened by an external force it cannot understand or defeat; outsiders are brought in, even while the hero must face his own inner fears and 'grow up' to conquer them. Quint is the transitional hero here, an outsider in the community (even though he resides in Amity), whose anti-social nature and unwillingness to compromise permanently exclude him from the village; we know as soon as his boat is ruined that he will die, for now he has no home, no place to live (can we really picture Quint sitting at the Brody dinner table as Hooper did?).Of course it's not just the brilliantly executed structure of Jaws that makes it so great; the performances are all spot-on, terrific; all three of the main actors shine here, and even tiny bit parts are played perfectly. Spielberg also uses terror more effectively here than he ever has since; while apparently the mechanical shark wouldn't work and he had to disguise it in filming and editing, not seeing the menace for most of the film heightens the suspense and terror far more than revealing it would have.This film is Spielberg firing on all cylinders, every piece in place, a masterpiece from start to finish. It's rare that you encounter a perfect film, and that's a phrase I don't even like to use; but it certainly fits Jaws, which is as flawless a piece of movie-making as you will ever encounter. It's a good bet most of you have seen it (it is thirty-one years old, after all), but if you haven't seen it in a while, maybe it's time to get reacquainted with a classic once more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vote Jaws ,like 12 out of 10 stars. It is just original. You can tell the shark is fake but who cares. The script, the acting, the using the camera as a shark to build suspense....It is just great, really one of the only great shark flics I have seen. For me living in Massachusetts is cool because it's fun to go down to Martha's Vineyard and spots that can be seen in the movie, like South Beach. If you haven't seen this movie, which is odd, you have to. There will never be another shark movie that beats Jaws. Deep Blue Sea was cool, using both digital and animatronic sharks but it just didn't reach better than Jaws in my head. The second Jaws installments was okay but not as good as number one. Number 3-D was the worst-second to worst movie I ever saw. Jaws the Revenge, had a more realistic shark but acting could have been better. So I think that open water was cool but just face it Jaws is great</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is one of those few horror epics with good acting, a great story, and it actually scares you. JAWS will make you afraid to go in the water.After a little boy is attacked Chief Brody must hunt down the shark that killed him. It is an INCREDIBLY scary film that keeps you on the edge of your seat 90% of the film. For a 70's film, the special effects were good and the story was solid. Be warned, kids should not see it. There is some gore and will make the kids not be able to fall asleep that night. But if you're looking for one great horror film, watch JAWS!</fullReview>

I was very pleased with it, (and the special features) I really enjoyed the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it definitely! It was well directed by Steven Spielberg, of whom i'm a great fan. The famous tune by John Williams still scares me today! The shark still looks real and its an absolute classic in my eyes. If you are new to films or just watch a good thriller then I recommend this film Jaws! I think anyone could like it and I certainly did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're gonna need a bigger boat."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Scheider ad-libbed the 'bigger boat' line, and as sometimes happens, it became a classic. I just viewed the film once again in it's entirety, one of the few times I've done so since it's original release. It holds up amazingly well, and retains all the thrill and horror that it did during the summer you were afraid to go into the water.Although he appeared on screen earlier, Robert Shaw's fingernails on the chalk board at the town meeting was the perfect way of introducing Amity's potential savior. What he might not have known about rogue shark mentality and territorial behavior is provided by Richard Dreyfuss' character, derided by Captain Quint as a mere college boy, but with enough sea smarts to know that this could be the big one. Boy, was it! I forgot about the dead sailor in the hull of the boat discovered by Hooper (Dreyfuss). It's still one of those unexpected 'oh s---' moments in movies that works even after the gimmick has been played out countless times since. What's remarkable about the film is it's ability to convey unspeakable horror in a way that doesn't get in your face. The opening scene is a perfect example, but how about when that patrolman's leg gets lopped off in the water and slowly floats down to the sea floor - the stuff nightmares are made of.Filmed in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard in the fictional town of Amity, the picture also explores the crass commercialism of summer tourism winning out over safety concerns. Murray Hamilton's Mayor Vaughn is a master of the spin machine that successfully lures the crowds to the beach on the Fourth of July, right before the fireworks break loose. The beach reporter on the scene is none other than Peter Benchley, who wrote the novel and screenplay.When I saw this movie when it first came out, I recall doing an 'aw c'mon' when Brody shoots the cylinder in the shark's mouth sending it to fish heaven. But you know what, it might have been luck, but it certainly wasn't for lack of trying. It took Brody six shots before connecting with the big bang; just in time too since he was going down with the ship. Did anyone else besides me forget about Hooper in all the excitement until he surfaced to hook up with Brody after the fish fry?It's amazing how certain movies have a way of weaving their way into your subconscious. More than thirty years later, "Jaws" still heralds that two beat 'da-dum' every time I go to the shore or take a walk on the beach. I can't even think about telegrams without recalling that goofy 'Saturday Night Live' skit with the candy gram shark knocking from behind the door. Such is the power of film. I think I'll go for a swim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is really two stories in one, a wedding of An Enemy of the People with Moby Dick.In part one, we confront the conflict of evils and goods represented by the collision between the police chief and mayor over keeping the beaches open in face of threat. At points the book and the movie hint at that classical collision of values worthy of an Ibsen or an Arthur Miller in An Enemy of the People: the needs of the community to make a living as opposed to the potential hazards they are creating. The film and the book upon which it is based approach but do not attain a ranking with the classics.Near tragedy for the mayor's son persuades the mayor to hire the real shark hunter.Thus ends the conflict of values in Part I and begins Part II The Fish hunting story of three men against the smartest and strongest that ever swam.Can they beat the Great White?

		<shortDescription>Classic summer thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chief of Police on Amity Island, Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is presented with a monumental problem one summer on the relatively peaceful island of Amity in the form of a huge, man-eating, great white shark feeding in the offshore waters. He is first alerted to the problem when the decomposing body of Christine 'Chrissy' Watkins (played by Susan Backlinie) washes up on shore and is found and reported. At first, the Mayor, Larry Vaughn (played by Murray Hamilton) gets the medical examiner to attribute her death to a simple boating accident, but, with the arrival of shark expert Matt Hooper, this verdict is questioned. Hooper contends that the cause of death could only be a large,hungry, predatorial shark. Larry, however ignores his expertise and continues to let the beaches be open. It is only with a second death,that of Alex M. Kintner (played by Jeffery Voorhees) that the townspeople are called to a meeting wherein the people continue to shortsightedly agree with Larry and call for the beaches to remain open. When the Fourth of July finally comes, business is booming and the beaches are packed, partially due to the fact that no one will go into the water. Then, after the urging of Larry, two of his friends, an old couple, venture into the water. They break the ice and cause others to join, but this only ends in disaster where another man is killed. After this final offense, the townspeople commission Quint (played by Robert Shaw), a shark hunter, to find and kill the shark for $10,000. Chief Brody and Hooper join him on this expedition upon his vessel, the Orca. They then play a suspenseful game of cat and mouse with the shark where it becomes unclear exactly who is hunting who for a while. But finally, after Quint is messily devoured, Brody kills the shark and Hooper and him swim safely back to shore. This movie was Spielberg's seventeenth, it ranks 91st on the list of the top 250 films of all time according to the International Movie Database and is one of the highest grossing films of all time. I completely agree with'lurker_from_persia's' take on the film, "...I seriously do recommend you seeing this if you haven't, and if you have, watch it again " When this film came out, it shocked audiences as one of the most graphic movies to come out yet and sent many moviegoers to the lobby or the bathroom in order to avoid throwing up. (Which seems unbelievable by today's standards.) But, it was light-years ahead of many of the movies filled with senseless nauseating gore that come out today. Because, in contrast to them, the plot of Jaws is both engrossing and suspenseful.Both of these characteristics are amplified by the unforgettable musical score. From the start, you feel vulnerable, since the first attack victimizes a naked woman, her nakedness makes her even more vulnerable and makes you question your own safety. Chief Brody is my favorite character from this movie, but I think that he would be incomplete without the wit of Hooper to accompany him. Both of them have many engrossing scenes such as the one where Hooper first arrives and attempts to help Chief Brody organize the 'shark hunters.' "You know the eight guys on the fantail launch out there? Well none of them are gonna get out of the harbor alive." Hooper to Brody Aside from comic relief, Hooper is also by far the most intelligent character in the story. He is called to Amity to convince Mayor Larry of the danger of the situation with the shark, but is met, at every turn, with the single-minded uncooperative spirit that Mayor Larry strives to keep. "What we are dealing with is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all. Now, why don't you take a long look at this sign. Those proportions are correct. Hooper to Mayor Larry"Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic." Larry's response to Hooper"You are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass" Hooper to LarrySpielberg exploits people's 'hot spots' of fear in this movie and shows how ignorance can be bliss in the case of deadly creatures. "Martin, it's all psychological. You yell barracuda, everybody says, "Huh? What?" You yell shark we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July" Larry to Chief BrodySpielberg also shows how excitable people are in panicked situations. In the scene following one of the shark attacks, where the eldest Brody son is playing on his boat, Chief Brody's wife changes from encouraging her son to play in the boat he got for his birthday to yelling at him to get out of it when she sees a picture of a shark eating a boat. He uses his directing genius to profile different types of personalities and their reactions to stressful situations. He shows Quint, the psychotic, run-and-gun, personality taking it all in stride versus Chief Brody, the responsible parent being noticeably worried and fighting for the safety of his family. When Spielberg directed Jaws, he made a blockbuster, a classic, and revolutionary movie. The first Jaws deserves all the credit it has gained, but the later sequels also deserve the more negative credit that they have gained. Spielberg created a monster in Jaws, one that has stood the test of time much like The Mummy or other classic creeps and one that continues to scare children before their summer trip to Florida.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a leisurely ocean dip would never be the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and was impressed. I had not read the novel but in 1974 Peter Benchley's book Jaws spent most of the year on the best seller list and the film's producers approached the young Steven Spielberg to direct. He was known for the big made for movie hit Duel and had recent success with his first theatrical released film Sugarland Express so he was given the monumental challenge to adapt for the screen a runaway best selling thriller for a summer release. Summer releases were usually relegated to Drive-In movies back in 1975 but because of the film's subject they took a chance on coinciding with the swimming and summer tourist season for maximum effect. The chance of a summer release of a major theatrical release and the use of a relatively unknown director was a big hit. Major summer releases became the norm and Spielberg became a legend. Spielberg would of course go on to direct such major films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's two big Indiana Jones sequels, ET, The Color Purple, the Empire of the Sun, Jurasick Park, Shindlers List and Saving Private Ryan among his big hits. He stumbled with a few misses too but the Spielberg name on any film draws interest and anticipation. Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay of his own novel along with Carl Gotlieb and some contribution from Spielberg. The monologue of the story of the Indianpolis tragedy was drafted by playwright Howard Sackler and screenwriter/director John Milius. One of filmdom's most memorable and effective music scores by John Williams received an Academy Award, one of three the film won including Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost to One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It also was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning one and got seven BAFTA nominations, winning one. Cinematographer Bill Butler had been a second unit photographer on The godfather, Deliverance and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and had been the cinematographer of The Conversation. He only filmed a handful of successful films after Jaws including Biloxi Blues, Stripes and Grease and it's odd that his career nosedived and he was involved with a ton of real bad movies. It's also odd that with the success of Jaw Spielberg never used him again in any of his films. Rexford Metz was the underwater cinematographer. It's basically a simple story of a giant Great White shark who has developed a taste for humans and had began prowling the sea shore of a resort town. It's possesses almost supernatural strength and cunning and the town's police chief wants to stop it but the town's mayor doesn't want tourists to know they have a shark problem. The cop enlists the aid of a young oceanographer, fresh out of college and a WWII Navy veteran who has become a seafaring bounty hunter. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus and Murray Hamilton star. It's a well done suspenseful drama, well written with shock, horror and a little comedy too. I would give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This magnificently-made masterpiece of a motion picture is definitely Steven Spielberg's best piece of work yet. Even now, over thirty years since it was released, it's still scaring people to death because it's so brilliantly made. From the moment that I saw "Jaws" for the first time, I was amazed by the movie and it instantly became my favorite of all time.First of all, there's the fact that Steven Spielberg is in the director's chair and when that happens, you're guaranteed to get a good movie. Even the worst of his movies are worth seeing over and over again a few times. And "Jaws" is probably his best. I find it amazing he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His great idea of not seeing the shark until the movie is half over was a great one. Although John Williams was and he won the Academy Award for his haunting and still very famous music score. It's definitely the best horror theme ever made. Very original and powerful.Also, we have a cast of talented actors. Roy Scheider plays "Police Chief Martin Brody", the law officer who is desperate to hunt down and kill the shark that is menacing the people he was hired to protect. The late and talented Robert Shaw is "Quint", a cantankerous modern Ahab who hunts sharks for a living. And Richard Dreyfuss is "Matt Hooper" a young marine biologist called down to help Brody and Quint handle the twenty-five-foot-long great white shark.Note: I also thought that Robert Shaw should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in this movie."Jaws" is based on a bestselling novel by Peter Benchley (who died in January of this year, 2006). And although the book was a great one, definitely one of my all-time favorite novels, I prefer the movie. I liked some of the screenwriter's decisions better. Such as having Brody and Hooper being friends instead of enemies. And I also think that the ending of the movie is far more climatic than in the book. In the movie, the shark is killed when a tank of compressed air is crammed into its mouth and then shot with a rifle, causing it to burst open and tear the shark's head apart. In the novel, the shark just bleeds to death. This is not an insult towards Peter Benchley's ideas, I just felt that Spielberg's version was a better one."Jaws" is the best thriller of all time. Definitely a classic that will always be around. I hope it never gets remade, because nobody will ever be able to do what Steven Spielberg and his team did on this movie. And besides, there will never be another Robert Shaw to play Quint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest thriller of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAWS by Will February 10, 2006.Summer. It's a time for people to take their families and go swimming at the beach; however, in the summer of 1975 this all changed. Half the people spent their summers in the movie theaters while the other half spent their time at home too afraid to go swimming. In one way or another, everyone was affected by Steven Spielberg's JAWS.The story takes place in Amity, a small charming island where obese New Yorker's come to spend their summer weekends at the beach. This one however, will not be so charming. The resort town has been plagued by a killer shark that plans on staying in Amity until the food source (people) is depleted. JAWS follows the story of Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)'s attempt to rid the resort town of this monster. Martin is a sea-fearing father of two, who has recently moved to Amity from New York City.The theme of JAWS ? which seems to include the importance of facing your darkest fears - is revealed through his character. When first dragged into the conflict, Martin is an observer who prefers to stay behind the water's edge. When prompted by oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to board a boat, Martin refuses and only complies after being intoxicated with several glasses of wine. Then things get more personal, after the near death of his son, Martin realizes that he must face his fear of the water and take on the monster. With the help of Matt Hooper and hardened, eccentric sea mate 'Quint' (Robert Shaw) he sets out to play a grand game of Cat-and-Mouse through the frigid waters of New England.The film is amazingly crafted in every way possible. The camera is operated beautifully, always staying at the level of the human eye, just inches above the water level, which personalizes the fear of the film. The casting is first rate, each actor fits his role well, creating realistic characters and (with the help of screenwriter Peter Benchley) realistic conversations. Director (then rookie, now famous) Steven Spielberg pulls the whole film together wonderfully and strikes terror deep inside us like no one since Alfred Hitchcock. However, with the exception of a few memorable lines, no aspect of the film is remember as much as it's music, which earned legendary composer John Williams a well deserved Academy Award for Best Original Score; furthermore, the thesis of the score can be achieved by simply hitting 2 notes on the average piano, and yet the score is arguably the most recognizable of any movie ever.The concept of the film, in it's most basic form, is simple: monster attacks man, man runs from monster, monster attacks man again, man fights back, man kills monster. Never before though, has this simple story been so well crafted, so well developed, and so well told. From this simple premise, Steven Spielberg and the other filmmakers behind JAWS have fashioned the greatest thriller of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the best movies ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was ten years old (my parents would'nt let me watch it before that). I was terrified!! I got so freaked out that for about three years, I refused to go swimming in the ocean. I lived in Santa Cruz, California at the time. But what also happened was I became curious about sharks and started to study them. Strange, yes...but it helped cure my fear. However, even now I will NEVER get into a shark cage and be face to face with a Great White. I would die of sheer terror. Back to the movie.....Beyond the scare factor, this is a brilliant film. Well acted, well plotted. Solid all around. Steven Spielberg is a genius!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies of all time. One of the greatest parts about this movie is that it is so simple. Sorry, but as cool as some thrillers are, life is not chock-full of twists and turns. Life is actually pretty simple. Which is what this movie is. You can start watching it at any time and you will get the same enjoyment. The only thing you need to know is that there is a killer shark, and these three men have set out to kill it. Its so incredibly simple, and yet perfectly elegant. And even without the plot twists that abound in other movies, this movie has so much suspense. Its Spielberg at his finest.Now, one of my favorite parts about writing reviews for the classics is to make fun of the people who didn't like it. This one was particularly interesting, since there were a few critics who had the gall to place Deep Blue Sea above this movie. Someone said the sharks in DBS had a reason to be aggressive. Right, like the therapy they were on gave them PMS or something. Get real! Yes, sharks don't usually eat people, but sometimes they take a liking to human flesh. In fact, Jaws is based off of real events, the Matowan sharks attacks of 1916. It doesn't get any more reasonable than that. Jaws is a heck of a lot more realistic than DBS. To compare the two is laughable, and murders any credibility.So, ignore that crap, and go see this movie, because it was a classic then and its a classic now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While being closer to a 'monster movie' than more mundane forms, Spielberg is skilled at telling a story...which he does to near perfection. Consider this story more as an adventure than a a typical monster movie.Spielberg's first film adapted from the novel by Peter Benchely.An all star cast delivers in spades. Robert Shaw, Richard Drefuess and Roy Schneider all have career performances.The Production was wrought with delays and destruction. Sets sank, Sharks wouldn't bite....it was bedlam.A good popcorn movie. The only one worth seeing of all the Jaws series.Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws/1975/***1/2Main Stars: Roy Scheider Robert Shaw Richard DreyfussA handful of people calls this one of the best movies ever made and THE best Spielberg film ever made and it will become an instant classic! It's EXCELLENT! You know what I say? I say it's a great entertaining film but it's not one of the best films ever made, trust me. The best SPIELBERG film would have to be a tie between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Yes, I agree, Jaws is a classic and always will be but yet not as much as ones like the old classic Disney cartoons orrr, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. That would be The Untouchables. It's a wonderful crime-drama just like another EXCELLENT film, The Godfather. They both have their own sense of style and both directed by different Italian directors, Francis Ford Coppola (for The Godfather) and Brian DE Palma (for The Untouchables). They both involve Italian mobsters, Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). I was tempted to put Dona Vitoa Corleonea when talking about the Italian character but I held it back. See those are two classics. Jaws to me is a great but not EXCELLENT film to be ranting and raving about. I mean the story is about a killer shark haunting the citizens of Amity Island. The highlight is definitely (the late) Robert Shaw's character, Quint, who plays the crazy boat captain also trying to look for the killer shark along with Richard Dreyfuss, playing the wacky Matt Hooper whom is very experienced at his job. Then you got Roy Scheider playing the friendly police chief. He's nothing much. Robert Shaw tops 'em all however in his acting. He was always a great actor and also the highlight of James Bond: From Russia With Love. What do these people have to do with this killer shark? Well, the gotta kill it! Before it kills everyone in Amity Island and then continues on its journey to kill other people too. However, the annoying, roly-poly mayor disagrees with their intention. He'd rather keep the beach open in order for people to enjoy the nice, soothing, relaxing water. Basically he bribes with them. If they want to do this and close down HIS beach, he'll want a lot of money for this doing. So the adventure goes on and on and on until finally? the classic ending which everyone should know about. Not only does Quint pass away gruesomely in this film but also Robert Shaw himself is dead in real life too. Then leave it up to the people hungry for more. Here come some more sequels, Jaws II, Jaws III, and Jaws the Revenge with whom of all people, Dennis Quaid! Now what's he doin' in a flop like that. When it comes to classic ORIGINAL films, they're great! But then they get put down because of the horrible sequels that follow it or the prequels that begin it. It usually happens that many original films either have sequels or prequels or both. It happens all the time unless every single character dies in the original film or it's based on a true story so they'll just have one film and give up. Movie directed by Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still scaring people today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws was the movie that sent Spielberg to stardom. I was talking to my friend who will not see this movie because she says it will scare her to go into the ocean. Now that seems to be telling you something. It is 30 years later and people are still scared to go for a swim. Well thought out plan because it tackles a fear that everyone has had at one point in their life. My favorite movie of all time because it is very suspenseful and has a really good and simple story line. This movie was voted b the second scariest movie of all time by the American Film Institute. It was also voted by the Bravo channel to have the number 1 scariest movie moment of all time. Why is it so scary? Well, you are going to watch it and find out on your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this first came out in 1975 the ad campaign was overwhelming. It made me want to NOT go. But my friend wanted to see it and, heck, she was paying so why not? I spent 3/4 of the movie with my feet up on the seat. I was never much for ocean swimming in the first place; this put the nail in the coffin (tho I have gotten over it enough to snorkel in Hawaii - nice CLEAR water there that you can SEE in).This, of course, was Spielberg's first commercial film and he and his team made the most of it. The thing is, we don't really SEE the shark very often ("The shark is not working. Repeat, the shark is not working.") and, IMHO, that just makes it better. Makes the suspense almost unbearable. The stunt shark (Bruce), when cut together with the film shot by the "B" unit in Australia is pretty darn convincing when we DO see it. The cinematography is stunning and some of the shots are ground breaking; the zoom-push when Brody sees the shark attack the little boy for one. It's no wonder Spielberg became one of the most respected directors ever. And don't forget the brilliant editing.The cast is great, but the threesome on the boat are amazing. I absolutely adored Robert Shaw. I was heartbroken when he died a few years later. Schieder and Dreyfus were stellar. The scene recounting the Indianapolis' sinking gives me chills to this day. I read that Shaw did the bulk of it (his close-ups) all in one take. It wouldn't surprise me. I cannot understand why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this. One of the greatest characters in cinema history. I love his little bit about the cage; "You go in the cage. Cage goes in the water. You go in the water. Shark's in the water. Our shark." Then sings, "Farewll and adieu..." I laugh every time. God bless him and thank goodness for film to treasure his performance. And, of course, there's Schieder's immortal "You're gonna need a bigger boat."As for the music... one name -- John Williams. Who else could have scored this? The chase music always send me into paroxysms of delight; even though it's a scary film, those pieces invoke the open, wild nature of the sea. If I ever get a boat, I'll have that music on a loop (just THAT, not the rest of it). Not to disregard the rest of it... the entire soundtrack is one of the best ever written. The opening is classic. If you've never even seen the film, you know where it came from. What else can I say? I will watch this movie anytime it's on even though I own the DVD. I'm like a junkie... I cannot resist. Of course, I hate the cuts they make and if I'm in the mood to WATCH it, the DVD goes in. But I'll have this on even for background. I remember taking my Grandmother to see it when it was re-released in the 80's. I warned her about the jump-out-at-you scene at Ben Gardner's boat. I told her "This is scary if you want to hide your eyes." God love her, she said "I came to see the whole movie and I'm going to watch the whole movie." And she did. She loved it, too. If for some reason - you think it will scare you, you don't like (fill in the blank) - Get over it and see this film! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ocean Was Wet...And So Were The Theater Seats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the dawn of the movie blockbuster, Hollywood unintentionally achieved two goals: with THE EXORCIST, they scared a legion of moviegoers back into church, literally. And with JAWS, they scared them out of the water, in some cases, permanently. The simple, pleasurable act that virtually defines summertime - going swimming at the beach - would never be the same again. And also, the audience love affair with a new, young, talented director by the name of Spielberg spanned into a marriage that lasted for both better and worse, over the course of damn near forty years! Whether you think of it as an adventure film with horror movie overtones, or a horror film that offers one hell of an adventurous ride as a bonus, there has never been anything quite like it. Based on the late Peter Benchley's runaway best seller, the plot is quite simple. Following a lead very similar to the one that Hitchcock had previously set with THE BIRDS, a unusually large Great White shark shows up in the calm, blue waters just off the coast of Amity Island, (played superbly by Martha's Vineyard), and begins to snack on the unwary and unwise tourists and townies who decide to engage in nautical activities at the wrong time. The town's police chief (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled shark hunter (Robert Shaw) decide to deal with it the best way they know how. Needless to say, the three men's lives are changed forever by the encounter.JAWS has long been an indelible entry into the lexicon of pop culture slang and references. There are times even now when someone can hum the ominous notes of John Williams' familiar theme, and watch their best friends' faces turn ashen as they mutter "That's not funny." For those who keep score of such things, many will remember this as the first American-made film to ever gross over one hundred million dollars domestically. I will always remember it with great fondness as the first film that caused people in darkened theaters across the nation to drop their buckets of popcorn, and maybe check their shorts as well, myself included.For those rare viewers who have never seen this classic before in life, you have my envy and my sympathy. Envy, because there is nothing else in the world like seeing JAWS for the very first time. And sympathy, because no matter how great your HDTV and your home sound system is, there will never again be an experience like seeing it for the first time on the BIG screen. This is one of those rare ones that deserves four out of four stars, for great reasons.</fullReview>

There are movies that are original and cannot be topped, then there are those movies that you just wanna get up in the movies and walk to the movie next door. Jaws is one heck of an original. Its really not in a genre. You have horror, thriller, family and comedy. But ill tell you one thing. Horror is definitely in that category. After watching this (and I'm SURE I'm not alone) I was sort of scared to go into the ocean. But don't let that stop you. Just remember every time you get scared, its just a stupid shark robot. I give Jaws 10/10 2 thumbs up! Wonderful JOB! LIke they always say, if you have not seen jaws, YOU Ain't SEEN Nothing YET!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people write off Steven Spielberg because of his commercial success, and, frankly, that's too bad. While it's true that much commercial film-making is pap, there are also filmic artists who can also deliver slambang entertainment. Steven Spielberg is the master of contemporary artful entertainment, counting the likes of John Frankenheimer and Alfred Hitchcock among his cinematic forefathers.Jaws initiated that spell between the mid-1970s and early 1980s when, seemingly, Spielberg could do no wrong (well, except 1941). He had shown a sure hand and a feel for thrills in Duel, but nothing prepared audiences for the brilliance of Jaws. Everything in Jaws falls into the correct place and, even though it pales in comparison to the maturity of vision in ET and Close Encounters, it's likely one of the greatest action- adventure films you're likely to encounter.What I think separates Jaws from its imitators and from lesser action films is its unwillingness to abide by conventions. Eschewing the lax characterization inherent in most thrillers, Jaws makes sure we understand the three leads, while never offering up scenes that serve only to establish character. Nearly every scene that allows us to delve a little deeper into Quint or Hooper also advances the plot (though I would argue it does so imperceptibly). The film moves like the shark--smoothly and forward. Even what appear to be divergences come around to forward momentum by their end. Take the scene in which the men compare scars: here we learn quite a bit about Quint and, at first, it seems that's the scene's entire purpose, but then the shark returns and damages the boat. Most scenes in this film operate in a similar manner. It's a basic screen writing concept, but one that keeps Jaws fresh with character insights and action.Then there's also Spielberg's decision to postpone the visual arrival of the star for nearly an hour. People may have come to this film to see a shark, but instead they found a couple glimpses of fin in an otherwise land-based drama. Most movies of this sort put off the monster's arrival but precious few postpone it for so long. The story is enough to carry this movie--the relative success or failure of the film does not rest on the back of the shark. Think about it this way--Spielberg creates such a fascinating story about a shark without actually showing us the fish that, when we finally see the entire thing, we're amazed, but it doesn't really matter because we're entirely hooked already. That's impressive and admirable. Since Jaws, Spielberg has gone on to make better films, but his greatness manifested itself here first. Jaws is a superb film and superb entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was never one of my true favorites, but it's still a classic indeed, with a suspenseful story and wonderful performances. All the characters are fantastic, and the Shark attacks are just great, plus Roy Scheider is simply amazing in this. Steven Spielberg has another classic in his resume, with this one, and while I do think this movie is truly excellent, it's a bit overrated by some, still I really like the movie, and am proud to own it on DVD. The effects may seem a bit dated but still hold up pretty decently, and the finale is the best part of the movie, as it's extremely suspenseful, plus it has one of the most memorable openings. It also has one of the best Horror scores ever, and it's extremely well written and made, plus while it's not very graphic, it does not need to be. All the characters are extremely likable, and Lorraine Gary is very charming as Chief Brody's wife, plus the only actor in this cast that didn't fully convince me was Robert Shaw, as he was off and on throughout the movie. This was never one of my favorites, but it's still a classic indeed, with a suspenseful story and wonderful performances, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is top notch as always from Spielberg. Steven Spielberg does a brilliant job here, with top notch camera work, a great job of adding tension and suspense, cool angles, and great POV shots, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Roy Scheider is amazing here, he was extremely likable, vulnerable, and I really felt for him because it must have been a tough situation he was in, he also remained calm and cool under pressure as I loved that!, he played a very memorable character here, and his chemistry with Dreyfuss was also on (Roy Rules!!!!). Robert Shaw is OK here, but totally unconvincing a lot of the times, as it was hard to hear what he was saying, and his character rather bothered me, he gave the only somewhat weak performance in the film. Richard Dreyfuss is excellent here, he was very likable, funny had good chemistry with Roy, and I really enjoyed his performance, he rocked. Lorraine Gary is beautiful and very charming here as Brody's wife, she was very likable, and showed a lot of class, she did a terrific job!. Murray Hamilton is extremely convincing as the greedy mayor, as he will get under your skin. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it now. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

OK maybe not the latter but it really does hold something for everyone. When I was a kid this was shown on TV, it seemed, every other month. As a result it became a bit of a joke to many. Now viewed over 30 years after it was made this film hasn't aged a bit. The Shark looked fake in the 70's and it still looks fake now. The scares it provides, either seen or unseen, are very real though. I really can't praise this film enough. Spielberg is a true master at his profession and this is his finest hour.</fullReview>

The acting especially from Schneider and shaw is tremendous and for his 1st film Spielberg really pulled out all the stops.The film relies heavily on the build up of suspense and does this perfectly and will entertain legions of people for years to come. A highly recommended and enjoyable piece of film-making (bar the plastic shark!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, hello!I guess you could say that this comment is only 30 or so years late, But what the hey. I have always loved this movie, mostly because it kept me out of the water (really!) for a long time. We as human beings will always be afraid of what we don't know or can't see. Great White sharks happen to be real and every summer they are back in the news. Maybe not Great Whites per say but sharks and shark attacks along with death and near-death experiences are synonymous.This movie had everything in it. Humor, compassion, anxiety, and the director really made us afraid. Brave to Mr.S for giving us such a wonderful film to watch again and again.magnuscountry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a sneak pre-view when it was first released. We saw it in Sandusky Ohio, when visiting Cedar Point amusement park on a rain day. All we new was the tagline; Something about not going in the water again or whatever. To say I was stunned was an under-statement. It was, and remains, the most incredible film I have ever seen. Spielberg seems to Pooh-Pooh it, but it is his finest work. From the acting, which has been completely overlooked to the suspense, dialogue and music, it remains a masterpiece. It can't be replicated because we have become so jaded by Jurassic Park, etc., we don't appreciate the subtleties in movie-making. We need to be hit over the head w/it anymore. I realized this as I watched the new King Kong. It's all so much computer imaging, that we are losing interest in the thrill. Sad but true. If Jaws was made today the teed boppers out there would let out a collective yawn!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is a famous movie. It is on the English textbooks of middle school in China. Today, I saw the movie, finally.30 years passed, the movie still remains in fashion, and it is exciting.Several days ago, I saw the War of the Worlds. Together with this one movie, I think I understand Steven Spielberg better. When I for the fist time saw the Terminal, I thought it wasn't Steven's Style, because it was not amazing,or astonishing. But I was wrong, it was in Steven's Style. To make big movie is just one ability of this great master, and he also can play around with drama, which may touch your heart, or inspire deep thoughts and always, he do this under a big movie cover.Jaws is exciting, not for its scene. The shark scenes,which were made 30 years ago, though you can't find anything wrong with it, surely couldn't compete the last movies. But there are things that would catch your eyes, and those things wouldn't go out as time go by. Simply, Steven know how to make you feel and stay exciting.Though a good movie as it is, it isn't as good as it should be.For example,some actress were a bit of over acting.In a word, It is old, but it shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 years old when I first saw this film,and remembering queueing outside the old Classic cinema in Stockton-On-Tees with my dad. After seeing it,I swear at the time it was the best film I have ever seen. I saw it again with my late mother (who kept hiding her eyes at the climax,and I kept saying "You're missing it") and I saw it again and again. It came on television and when we got a video recording machine,we taped it and kept and finally on 5 September 2001,I got the video as part of some gift tokens for my birthday. I remember that date with some infamy. I decided to go to Middlesbrough as it represented a better selection for my tokens. I got my video and went back to my car. GONE. STOLEN. Of course six days later,another date of infamy emerged. I had seen Deep Blue Sea,which for me was a reworking of Jaws,and while I'll admit the sharks looked better in DBS,it lacked the menace and terror of Spielberg's original masterpiece. Also whilst DBS had better sharks,when one of them got Samuel L Jackson,his image being eaten resembled an inflatable dummy and not the classic image of Robert Shaw going down the great gob. Jaws had style,it had great characters,it had humour and it had everyman representation,as if the whole town became a character. Maybe a reworking of Ibsen's Enemy of the People (but who was the enemy:the shark or the money grabbing authorities) and the final phase was of Three Men In A Boat. Memorable scenes:Chrissie screaming for her life,Polly the secretary being mundane about things,the Kintner boy,Quint's intro...there is too many. The climax though is still the best of its genre. Spielberg from thereon was unstoppable and has matured to make such classics as Schindler's List,Saving Private Ryan and the recent and excellent War of The Worlds,not forgetting the Indiana Jones' films. Schindler's List is quite rightly his masterpiece,but the excellent Duel became the template for Jaws and Jaws was the seminal classic for not only the career of Spielberg,but film making in general. Recently I got the DVD for my birthday (no car stolen this time) and for my dad,we always put the subtitles on,and I am amazed of what dialogue I had not known,thinking I knew it all. My favourite film now,after I have matured myself over the years,is David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia,a film that once inspired a one young Steven Spielberg to become a movie maker and who himself had a hand in the restoration.

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so 30 years after the film was made and released and 18 years into my life I have finally sat and watched the film Jaws. Usually a coward when it comes to thriller movies i was persuaded as a film fanatic to see the classic by my cinema showing the film on the big screen in its original glory to celebrate 30 years of it terrorising children out of the water, and after all the build up to the film i am pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. I think this film really is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing talent and a true suspense thriller. The acting in this is superb and although some scenes were rather predictable it did not spoil the suspense and thrill you feel when you hear that famous music. Richard Dreyfuss is well cast as the young scientist who along with Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider save Amity Island from the killer great white shark. And although the mechanical shark may look ever so slightly dated it is also a triumph technically. I am very pleased that finally I have sat and watched Jaws and even though I know now who dies and who survives i could watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good adventure story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaw stars Roy Schieder as the police chief of a coastal resort town that is being terrorized by a giant killer shark. He enlists the help of a marine biologist Richard Dreyfuss and they hire a crusty sailor Quint (Robert Shaw) to go out, find the shark and kill it.The first part of the movie takes place in the town and on the beach as people get attacked. The second part is on the boat as they hunt down the shark.By today's standards Jaws in pretty tame but it was considered very scary when it premiered. It's still a good adventure story and worth seeing. The mechanical Jaws shark was a marvel of movie puppetry at the time. Spielberg has the good sense not to show too much of it which would ruin the effect. The ending is very suspenseful.Robert Shaw is especially good as the WWII survivor of DDay. Jaws is probably Spielberg's best film along with Raiders of the Lost Ark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when it came out. I was 13 at the time and I remember what I was wearing, a ball uniform, and the fact that I had a bad sunburn. The uniform was orange polyester and it was itchy. It did not dissuade me from experiencing the thrill of a life. I recall walking out of the theatre thinking that this was the best movie I have ever seen. Time has not diminished its impact. I saw it recently again and was amazed by its power.The music, the directing, the acting are all first rate. I had forgotten some of the scenes and they amazed me again. The use of the camera when Brody is watching the shark from the beach is amazing. I never thought of it at the time.And no they don't make movies like this anymore. Now there would be more blood and screaming - from the actors not the audience. Technically the film is so impressive - the editing is just right, not to much is shown but just enough to tantalize. I did find the special effects lacking but this was 30 years ago when Bruce had to be mechanical not CGI. I wish Spieberg would make movies like this again. His new efforts are first rate of course but they don't have the wonder of JAWS, ET and CE3K.Now I want to get the new DVD. A movie that wants to make me see it that quickly must be exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the big classic movies of the 70's. But still a joke in many ways. Like the ending when police chief Martin Brody shoot that tank in the mouth of the big white shark and he says die you son of a bitch. Yeah sure that tank would blow up impossible. Spielberg was not the smartest director when he did make this movie. But it is still scary and not realistic in many ways. And it made many people afraid to swim in the ocean out there in the world. But this movie still kick ass not realistic and not smart but it is still funny and scary and has good actors and a good music score. I have watch this movie many times in my life even tough I can't rank this movie to be Spielbergs best. Schindler's List is the best that he have done so far.

		<shortDescription>a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great movie! The actors were good, the shark looked reasonably realistic(CGI wasn't the same in 1975)the plot was good, it had its share of jokes(not the most hilarious comedy, but definitely not unfunny). I'm actually a big fan of monster movies, and i think monster movies are underrated. Hasn't anyone but me noticed that this is the only monster/horror movie on the top 250 list? Thats sad that "The Godfather" is first and all the horror movies are so low. "The Godfather" definitely isn't the worst movie of all time but COME ON! First???? The fact that its above LOTR, the matrix, kill bill, saving private Ryan, deep blue sea, deep rising, and all the bond movies just makes me sick. Anyways, jaws is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone that isn't scared of sharks.*WARNING THIS PART CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**THIS IS THE BASICALLY THE MOVIE IN WRITING* The main character is the police chief, Brody. The other important characters are Matthew, the shark studier, Quint, the shark hunter, Ellen, Brody's wife, and Martin, the governor of Amity. At the beginning, the shark eats a girl and later the police chief finds her arm on the beach. Later the shark studier looks at the arm to figure out the size of the shark. Soon, inevitably, another person is eaten. Then there becomes a huge conflict about whether to close the beaches because the government needs the money and the government reluctantly decides to but a 3000$ bounty on the shark. Quint said that he would hunt the shark and catch it but it would cost them 10000$ After all the other fishers have failures and death or near death experiences the government lets quint have 10k if he catches it. Brody and Matt want to come on quint's fishing boat and quint agrees to give them 1000$ each and let them come on his boat if they help him catch the shark. After a bunch of fishing line and barrel battles, Matthew decides to go underwater in a metal cage with a poisoned needle (i don't remember if it would put the shark to sleep or kill it) but the shark attacks the cage from behind and he drops the needle out of shock but when the shark is mauling the cage he manages to sneak out and hide under a reef before the shark sees him. After that, the shark leaps on the back of the boat and smashes it. The back of the boat starts sinking the boat is at an angle(kind of like this&gt;ignore the bottom half of the example). Brody and Quint are hanging on for dear life. However an oxygen tank falls on Quint's hand and after a quick, desperate attempt to grab Brody's hand slides down towards the shark. After a 30 second battle the shark gets Quint and drags him underwater. Brody jams an oxygen tank in the sharks mouth and starts climbing up the mast of the boat(the only part thats more than 2ft above the water). The shark pops out of the water and Brody stabs it several time with the spear before the shark bites the spear and takes it out of Brody's hand. The shark goes underwater again, but soon surfaces about 50 ft from Brody. Brody shoots at it, and after a few shots, says a few swear words and shoots again. The bullet hit the oxygen tank and there is a huge explosion. Matthew, seeing that the shark is dead, comes back to the surface. Brody and Matthew create a raft from the wreckage and paddle to shore THE END.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What PSYCHO did for not taking showers, JAWS did for keeping people away from the ocean. And it's no wonder! The first terrifying attack is awesome in its ferocity, thanks to the screaming torments of the young woman trying to get away from the thing below the surface. After that, the film builds slowly but gathers suspense with each scene, especially each beach scene. The mayor's refusal to shut down the beach is simply an act of greed (it's the height of the tourist season), but once the attacks begin to multiply it's up to Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw to do something about catching the great white shark.All three carry the second half of the film aboard a boat that has Schneider delivering the unforgettable line: "We should have had a bigger boat!" after he spots the shark for the first time. The plot gets a fair share of thrills once it becomes clear that killing the shark is not going to be an easy matter.Adding greatly to the suspense is a wonderful John Williams score and great cinematography. Incredible that Stephen Spielberg was only 29 when he directed this little masterpiece of man against beast.Well worth watching--and guaranteed to hold your interest throughout the final hour especially. One can sense the influence of MOBY DICK on the screenplay, especially with Quint's obsession to kill the shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They'll need a bigger boat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's been said before,but it really does bear the truth:this film is pretty much the granddaddy of "Summer blockbusters". I am not old enough to recall movies or the summer movie season prior to 1975,so I suppose I have to trust the voracity of that contention. The story's pretty familiar by now: around and about the 4th of July weekend in the New England beach town of Amity,a shark is killing unsuspecting swimmers along the coastline. Enter Sheriff Martin Brody(Roy Scheider),who with his family has freshly relocated from New York. He's not fond of the water and,to his great chagrin,the deaths of two swimmers has him running into unforeseen tension with the grinning,business-obsessed Mayor(Murray Hamilton),who doesn't want to close down the beach on the 4th. When Brody's warnings heed another attack,he is sent to find and kill the shark along with an out-of-town marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss) and a crusty old sea salt named Quint(Robert Shaw). As per any creature feature,the task is going to prove easier said than done.Spielberg may've worked his most deft touches here: the amount of horror and tension here are choice,and,as is the case in his movies since(E.T.,War of the Worlds,to a lesser degree Jurassic Park)the creature of doubt is not revealed until well into the film. Off the top of my head,I don't recall if Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay version of his novel,but whoever did was able to keep the script tight and understated,so as to allow for a normal framing to a menacing situation.Well worth a collection for the cineaste,whether they are into monster/man vs. nature films or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment you hear the music while the woman is diving in the ocean, you know what you're in for. A little trick that they play throughout "Jaws" is that the music only plays whenever the real shark is approaching; thus, when the kid in a shark costume approaches, there's no music. But when Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) are on the "Orca", the shark pops up without warning; this prompts Brody to suggest getting a larger boat. There was also a good contrast between the two sailors and Brody: both Quint and Hooper had scars from being attacked by sharks, while hydrophobic Brody had no scars. Of course, the real star is the shark. He is one bad mother, but he made Steven Spielberg what the latter is today, so it all balances out.Do you feel like going swimming now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a very good movie, but there are a few things that bother me about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if it is pure coincidence or if they did it on purpose, but it's a fact that only a couple of days after we got the news that two people in the USA had been attacked by a shark in a couple of days time, this movie was shown on one of our national television channels (I don't really believe this was just pure coincidence, since they can't get any better 'publicity' for such a movie). And it has to be said: this movie may well be thirty years old, but it's still capable of scaring the hell out of people.The story of "Jaws" is actually a quite simple one. When a girl dies in the ocean near a peaceful community on Amity Island, it's immediately believed to be a shark attack. But because the mayor doesn't want to spoil an entire summer by scaring the many tourists away, he is able to have it called a boating accident, much to the new police chief Martin Brody's frustration. He's convinced that more people will die if they don't do anything against this ferocious predator and soon enough he's proved right when a boy is killed by the shark. Together with a scientist and an old fisherman, he goes after the giant white shark to get rid of it for once and for all...This movie may well be one of the most famous movies of the seventies, but that doesn't mean that it is perfect. As long as you don't see the shark this is really a terrifying movie, but from the moment on that they show that giant rubber 'thing', it loses quite a lot of its power. You just know that this isn't correct, because it just is too gigantic and it doesn't react like a real shark. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it attacks boats, what I'm talking about are some 'small' details like not closing its eyes when attacking or not changing the position of the mouth. Normally a shark opens its mouth further when it gets closer, showing a lot more of its gums. This shark however is lifeless as it attacks.However, the movie has a lot of good things to offer as well. The acting for instance is really good. Roy Scheider does a good job as police chief Brody, but in my opinion it was Robert Shaw who was the best with his role of Quint, the fearless boat captain. Also very good is the music. I believe there is absolutely nobody who doesn't know what it is like and if you ask ten people to hum it, nine out of ten will be able to do it. And let's be honest, if it wasn't for the music, most scenes wouldn't even be scary. It's the music that creates the atmosphere of tension and terror when there is in fact nothing to be seen in the movie. But it works perfectly and that's all that matters.Overall this is a good movie, but if it hadn't been from the hand of Steven Spielberg, I'm pretty sure this would have been an awful one. It was probably his very first really great movie and he proved with this one that he was able to make a very good movie out of a concept that begs to become a failure. Many others have tried to copy its success with two sequels, but also with other 'shark' movies and not one of them was able to get to the same level of fear. However, when you are at least a little bit interested in sharks, you know that what is shown in it isn't correct. Many people only feared sharks after seeing this movie and that's too bad, because this marvelous creatures really aren't the mindless terror / killing machines that this movie made of them. I like the fact that the movie is one of the best in the genre, but I wish it had been a bit closer to reality. That's why I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

There have been many attempts at making a novel into a film but only a few actually accomplish. The consistency is not exact but it doesn't matter. Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife in the novel and dies in the end. The way he is brought into the film. he is too likable to die and to have an affair with Brody's wife would add irrelvance and an unneeded negativity to his character.

		<fullReview>Jaws. (1975) Action-Horror I first saw parts of Jaws when I was 8. I watched until the little boy was eaten. I turned it off.Two years later...I turned it back on.A few years later...Here I am writing this comment.Jaws is a classic, the story, the acting, the now-famous soundtrack and of course- the infamous shark that kept viewers out of the water for decades to come.The plot of Jaws is the story of a New York cop who moves to an island named Amity to live with his wife and children.One morning, a teenager comes to him saying he found a body on one of the beaches on Amity, he investigates, and finds that the body is heavily mutilated.He suspects a shark attack.He suspects right, he warns the mayor of the town that a rogue shark is loose and that he should close all beaches until they are sure that the shark is dead, or has gone completely. The mayor is ignorant, and keeps the beaches open for a 4th of July vacation-party thing.Despite the security around the waters, a little boy is eaten by the shark.The situation quickly escalates...Men arrive on boats with high powered rifles to catch the shark for a reward, set out by the mayor. They fail as another victim is taken.The mayor is then pressured to hire an infamous fisher who demands a high price for the shark.Togethor, the New York cop,Martin Brody, the fisherman,Quint, and a marine biologist must travel to the outskirts of the island the capture and kill the shark.While Quint becomes more intent on killing the shark, and collecting his reward, Martin becomes more worried if they'll survive the experience...This movie is the mother of all shark films. Idiots who think this is bad because the shark effects are a bit outdated obviously have no real respect. You can't compare this to other pathetic shark films like "Open Water" or "Jaws 4". This is a classic. It will remain one of the greatest, and it will always open our imagination, and our fear, of going into the unknown, into the water.Highly, highly recommended, 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Jaws again for what must be the 37th time, I'm still pleased with almost all aspects of the film. The pacing is nearly perfect, the story is strong, still fairly frightening (really, after 37 times?) and the acting is good. Many of Spielberg's trademarks grace the film. Solid cinematography all around, some of which has since been taken for granted. Viewed against "Duel", its easy to see why he felt he could pull this one off, despite obvious limitations. Knowing the history of "Jaws" and seeing it again, it is hard to believe that it was as difficult to make as everybody working on the film has since stated. It feels very natural. I would speculate that it's status in film history would arguably be the same if some of the bumps along the way were apparent in the film. In retrospect, I do see moments in the film where one might suggest its hit a rough patch, but the story itself isn't perfect so I find it difficult to tell. At the same time, I don't feel that I'm doing the film justice by thinking about it heavily. Spielberg later made plenty of those, "Jaws" not being one of them. Still, it doesn't leave you brain-dead like the standard popcorn flick (i.e. "The Lost World"). This is still very much a cut above most anything like it that followed and only a bit better than "Duel", both of which are very close to my film-going heart. Spielberg has not since given us such a shock or such a fright, but almost certainly better films and better stories. I'm giving "Jaws" a 9 because it's really a sum of it's parts, and it still works on many levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inspired by the early 20th century attacks by a shark in New Jersey (see "Close to shore" by Mike Cupuzzo), this movie still strikes fear into the hearts of many swimmers, including me. In addition to being one of the best "Creature Features" ever made, the movie also asks the 'no place like home' question since the Brody Family have mistakenly moved to Amity for safety -- away from the nasty city of New York where you have to even walk your children to school. Here in Amity, your children are safe; or, are they?The third choice as Quint, Robert Shaw, gives one of his best performances and he was not even nominated for an Academy Award. With the exception of the totally miscast Lorraine Gray, the rest of the cast is superb, including Bruce who we do not see until at least 2/3s of the way in.</fullReview>

The plot gets a fair share of thrills once it becomes clear that killing the shark is not going to be an easy matter.Adding greatly to the suspense is a wonderful John Williams score and great cinematography. Incredible that Stephen Spielberg was only 29 when he directed this little masterpiece of man against beast.Well worth watching--and guaranteed to hold your interest throughout the final hour especially. One can sense the influence of MOBY DICK on the screenplay, especially with Quint's obsession to kill the shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shooting star captured in background.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi all,Has anyone noticed the nice shooting star visible in the background? It appears at 1hr 36m (give or take). Just after the 3 guys have been interrupted while singing "Show me the way to go home" as Jaws batters the boat, they go on deck and Brody gets his police revolver from his bag, just then look up at Dreyfuss in the background as he says "you alright martin" and you see a beautiful shooting purple star behind him in the night sky. Funny cos I'd never noticed it before, and I've watched this movie hundreds of times. Like many others here, I saw this film during its original release as a 7 year old boy with my folks and sheesh! Couldn't go near water for years without thinking of Jaws. Watching it today I realised that this really is one hell of a film. The clash between Shaw and Dreyfuss characters is timeless and hugely entertaining. Although after reading the trivia on this site, I'd loved to have seen a Lee Marvin and a Sterling Hayden version.Jaws + Jaws 2 = yeah! Other Jawses = naahh!"Don't threaten me with jail, Blanche, because it's not a threat. With my expenses and my alimony, a prisoner takes home more pay than I do."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going on 30 years old, and still the greatest movie of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Brody is the new police chief of Amity, an island resort town Somewhere in New England. He has a wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins.Mayor Larry Vaughn, who is desperate to not lose the money that, will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins.Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells the entire local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money.On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Ever since I was, at least five years old, Jaws has, and will always be my all time favorite movie. Going on 30 years old, there has yet to be a film that has the amount of intensity and brilliance that Jaws has throughout the picture. Jaws more or less invented the "Summer Blockbuster" by becoming the highest grossing film of all time. There's has yet to be a shark film that even comes close to Jaws. They all suck basically compared to Jaws.What can be said about Jaws that you don't already know? It's the original "summer" movie. It was the first to raise the roof with screams and then subsequently bring it down with applause. The legacy of Jaws isn't just that of a great summer movie, but of a great movie period.The popcorn flick formula, one that has been imitated for decades, was begun with this malfunctioning mechanical shark. However, unlike most of its successors, Jaws filled the pit of your stomach with more than just popcorn; you got a nice helping of fear as well. For many, even after thirty years, it's still the ultimate event movie.While it was Hitchcock who was first dubbed the "master of suspense," and it was Coppola whose Godfather first shattered records, no film up until Jaws' release in the summer of 1975 had so successfully combined movie-making, mass-audience appeal, and box-office magic. A perfect movie -- a cinematic machine that is a miracle of craftsmanship.In addition to bringing a fear of the water into public consciousness, it also catapulted twenty-eight year-old director, Steven Spielberg, into super-stardom. While Spielberg's earlier independent, film, and television work was impressive, it was Jaws that made him a big name.It wasn't only Spielberg's contribution that made Jaws what it is, it was the efforts of several people, all hoping against hope that they could turn what was becoming a disaster-ridden film into something worthwhile. From the film's major screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to the ad-libs of the actors to John Williams' perfect score. Somehow everything came together to produce a movie that was greater than the sum of its parts.Perhaps the first thing that went right, other than the decision to give Spielberg the job, was the casting. The three principle actors all gave career-defining performances. Roy Scheider (playing everyman Police Chief Martin Brody) has just the right amount of heroism and cowardice for the audience to identify with.On the opposite end of the spectrum you've got Robert Shaw (as sea-hardened Quint) captaining the Orca and giving the movie a character that'll drag viewers towards the shark when all they want to do is turn back. Finally there's the bearded Richard Dreyfuss (scientist Matt Hooper) who is the brains to Quint's brawn, the reason to his madness.The idea was simple, the execution was anything but. Despite the difficulties surrounding the production, intentionally or accidentally -- but probably both -- Spielberg and company hit exactly the right beats and pushed exactly the right buttons. The result is Jaws, a movie that, to this day, is still making people scared to go in the water. Da-dummm...*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that really reminds me of high school; it came out the summer before I started my senior year, the summer I turned 18."Jaws" was the "Psycho" of my generation. I don't apply this term to "Halloween", another equally scary film of the '70's involving pointy things that can kill you, because "Jaws" and "Psycho" have too very important elements in common with each other, and "Halloween" somehow seems to fall into a different horror genre.Both "Psycho" and "Jaws" are about ordinary people doing something ordinary and enjoyable, two activities one would normally never find dangerous: showering, and splashing about in the shallows of the ocean.I don't remember, but I can't imagine that this movie made people very happy whose livelihood depended on beach tourism, as it was released in the early summer.Seeing "Psycho" made many people afraid to take showers (including actress Janet Leigh, who starred in it and claimed she never took another shower afterwards), and "Jaws" made many people afraid to swim in the ocean. It scared the hell out of us teenagers and made for endless pranks at the beach that summer (hey, I was 17 when it came out in the theater, what can I say)? Two of my friends would take turns pretending to be an approaching shark in the water, using his hand as a fin, while hmming the classic "Jaws" soundtrack, or pretending to be the first victim in the film (minus the screaming, which upset the lifeguards), thrashing and flailing about in the waves as if being attacked and dragged underwater."Jaws" was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster. It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star). It spawned one of the most classic and oft-quoted lines in film history: "We're gonna need a bigger boat." It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.I hadn't seen this film in several years, having seen it umpteen times when it first came out, and several times on VHS, as I owned an old VHS copy of it. But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full-screen only old tape).Suffice to say that when the head pops out of the boat...I still jump just as much as I did the first time I saw it in the theater.The ultimate, and best, of the "Scary Summer Movie" genre.The "Special Edition 30th Anniversary Edition" (widescreen, of course) of the film includes some great special features such as deleted scenes and outtakes, a never-before-available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two-hour documentary of the making of the film. The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot; I can certainly see why the shot of Robert Shaw's clog-sheathed foot stepping out of a big black car with the words "QUINT" in white and a white outline drawing of a shark on its door were cut! Shaft! We never knew ya!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film countless times and, thinking about it, is one of the first films I remember seeing.This film came at a time when the term "blockbuster" didn't exist but it sure did start it! All the elements are there. An arduous shoot;based on a bestselling novel;never before seen effects etc.The film is based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley. It tells the story of a mainland cop who moves his family away from the city to a quiet island. However, his peaceful life of dealing with moaning shop keepers is shattered by an unexpected visitor...I am sure there are some youngsters out there who have not seen this picture so I am not going to say anymore about the plot. I want you to experience the terrifying opening sequence as I did and let yourself enjoy the ride! Spielberg was a newcomer to Hollywood when he made Jaws and the fact he is now regarded as one of the world's greatest directors is testament to the power of this film.Get the 30th anniversary DVD, a bag of popcorn and see it fly across the room - Jaws is cinema at it's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, it's not "Gone With the Wind", but who needs a antebellum epic to become one of the best movies ever made? The fact that Spielberg worked with a down-right pitiful budget and against conditions of the sea earns him respect. But then the writing and story were also downright awesome. That scene where the Quint talks about the Indianapolis and gives grisly account of his survival. Sure, it is seemingly meaningless to the story, but it terrifies the other characters. Nice job. This movie actually altered my childhood. At first I was afraid to go near a bathtub...by the time I was 16, I realized that it was a movie and I realized I wanted to become an Ichthyologist (a scientist that studies fish). Thank you Jaws, you were the bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't go in the waters! Why? There's a huge man-eating shark, It's JAWS! This movie really puts the fear in Fear Factor! At first I thought it would be in Califorina thats where all the great whites are located, WRONG! A sleepy New England town would have to be the place to be. I would know it would be a fact that sharks would be one of the most feared killer animals we would ever have. I would thought alligators would be the top one. Steven Spielberg has made a success with this movie, it was not only filled with depth, but also intrigue, wonder, and of course horror. It seems that the great white has given a bad rep for its ferocity, but it's our own fear that really does that. In order to give the respects of the shark it to understand them like snakes, the non-poisonous ones, this idea wouldn't get so twisted. However, there has been shark attacks in the past, and this movie is just another scare factor just to keep us out of the water. What a cast, what a hit, this movie was definitely a blockbuster hit, and I would say anything that movie is not a keeper. And that's no fish story. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive killer shark movie &amp; forever shall be the best killer shark movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a female victim turns up on the shores on Amity, police chief Martin Brody determines the predator is not a serial killer, but a killer shark &amp; asks that the beaches be closed down until they can bring down the carnivorous beast. But the mayor of Amity refuses to close the beaches due to loss of profit, especially since they are right in the midst of the July 4th weekend, but when the rogue 25 foot great white shark makes a smrg?sbord out of the many tourists &amp; townsfolk swimming in the lake one afternoon, Brody hires shark hunter Quint &amp; shark expert Matt Hooper to help him in his quest to take down the beast, but as they soon find out, planning to capture the shark is very easy, but pulling it off will be anything but!JAWS is such a tremendously good film! The acting is so good! Not only are the characters very well written &amp; well developed, but the it's almost hard to imagine anyone else playing these roles, even the smallest, least important bit part is strongly acted, which is a rarity in filmdom. STEVEN SPIELBERG'S direction is so indescribably awesome, that it helps elevate JAWS into an utter masterpiece! The film is nerve shreddingly suspenseful, with many jump out of you're seat moments &amp; enough fake jump scares, that it will give even the most strongest of wills a jolt! The opening scene where the shark devours it's first victim in the waters of Amity at night, is still one of the scariest &amp; best opening scenes ever to grace a thriller as tight as this one! The frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark, actually managed to work to Spielberg's advantage, the shark is never seen during a good portion of the films first half, instead we see the unseen monster burrowing under the seemingly safe waters of Amity Long Island. The first half of the film plays more like a pure suspense horror thriller, while the last half focuses on QUINT (ROBERT SHAW) MATT HOOPER (RICHARD DREYFUSS) &amp; CHIEF BRODY (ROY SCHEIDER) sailing in the ocean trying to catch the carnivorous beast, while trying to sort out their own differences &amp; strengths when it turns out that the shark they are trying to capture will be anything but easy, as the beast turns out to be a lot smarter than they ever thought it would be, in what turns out to be an pure adventure film. But for me, no matter how awesome JAWS is, I honestly don't think the film would have even achieved half it's success without JOHN WILLIAMS haunting &amp; to this day, terrifying musical score, that is still recognized as being one of the best &amp; most influential, well known scores to ever grace a suspense horror thriller, next to BERNARD HERMANN'S PSYCHO score, it also serves as a catalyst for the shark, signalling it's presence when it is not seen on screen, but trust me, when you hear that infamous score, you know the shark is in the midst! In fact, JAWS is one of the rarest movies that actually winds up being far superior than it's own novel on which it is based! The film notably drops several subplots from the book, the most recognizable one, was Brody's wife having affair with Hooper, while this may have proved a hindrance to most films when a few of it's subplots are dropped, JAWS actually benefits from it. Director Spielberg later admitted that he faked JAWS, that the film was not true to his own sensibilities, since it lacks the emotional manipulation that trademarks pretty much all his works to follow afterwards. Quint's monologue on the boat, where he tells both Brody &amp; Hooper about the real life attack on the U.S.S. Indianapolis that he was on &amp; wading in the waters while sharks made frequent visits to pick off his team, is so dramatic, captivating &amp; so driving, that you can't help but not be carried along with it weather you want to or not. There is some gore involved, although nothing to heavy, we see a severed head, arm, leg &amp; head, but JAWS doesn't focus on the gore, it's a pure suspense driven machine!Highly influential, often imitated but never duplicated. A series of rip-off's &amp; imitators followed in it's wake, including PIRANHA, GRIZZLY &amp; MAKO: THE JAWS OF DEATH (which despite claims to the contrary, was actually written before this film) &amp; a slew of others, with it's plot &amp; characters still being ripped off today, in many killer shark movies. Based somewhat on a real life shark attack that occurred decades earlier in a small New England town. Look for PETER BENCHLEY as a reporter on a beach (he also co-wrote the film with CARL GOTTLIEB, based on Benchley's novel). All in all, JAWS is an absolute must see &amp; easily one of the top ten best horror thrillers ever made! One of my all time favourite movies &amp; deserves every bit of it's good word of mouth. A near perfect white knuckle thriller! Followed by three increasingly inferior sequels, starting with JAWS 2***** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be my favourite film of all-time, it is one of those films that I can watch over and over again still love it as much as I did when I first watched it, I have watched it so many times I have lost count.Directed by one of the best if not the best director of all-time Steven Spielberg and with excellent performances from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss adds up-to to make a classic to be remembered for many years to come and I'm sure if there are to be more films of killer sharks they will be compared to Jaws(I doubt any will come close though).The effects of the shark are just brilliant, it has that lifeless look to it that shark are renowned for. It is a real achievement to build a shark of that size, to get it to move and look real as it does. It makes you think that all the use of CG in films like Deep Blue Sea recently and yet a model shark used in a film that is 30 years old still looks more realistic.After watching this movie I will guarantee you will feel different about going into the water again.10/10 - Scary, Jumpy, Funny, Tense and pure edge of the seat entertainment, especially recommended for shark fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Helluva movie great story, great characters, music well conducted. However there is one problem with Jaws. Its Too Famous! Because it came out 15 years before i was born i never saw it when it was "just a movie" and by the time i Finally saw it I knew what would happen. The music is so well known in society today that when you hear Duh Duh Duh Duh you know Shark! It Completely ruins the suspense of a Great movie.But otherwise if you haven't seen it see it if you don't want to, see it anyway its a classic! So stop letting be so famous and let future generations enjoy it as what it I was. Also it is way better than 2 3 and 4. I really hate when studios try to make more money by taking a classic movie and making a bunch of crappy sequels that make no sense. For the love of god if you kill a shark its Dead it ain't supernatural or immortal if a shark dies its dead! Also i have one question if amity is in new england why does it look like California? Thats all the movie is still a classic and if you haven't seen it then see it its really good. Safe swimming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the summer of 1975, America experienced a phenomena that sent people running from the beaches into the cinema. JAWS was the smash box-office hit that put both up-and-coming director Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park etc.)and composer John Williams (all the films listed above, Star Wars, Superman: The Movie, The Cowboys etc.) on the map. Though the younger set (my age group of 10-16) often scoff at the fact of a movie from the 70's, I truly think Jaws is a classic and ranks up-with the great horror/adventure films like The Exorcist, The Omen and Psycho (1960). But why does such a great piece of cinematic gold not have a spot in the top 20# of IMDb's movie list? And how's Spiderman 2 in the top 250#? 9A fun film that I personally enjoyed, but nothing close to a classic.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg, cast, and crew still say making this film was a nightmare. Problems with the mechanical shark caused the film to go over budget and way over schedule. However, the end result was worth it. There has never been anything like JAWS and there never will be. It was the film that kicked off the summer blockbuster in the summer of 1975. A great white shark stakes a claim off Amity Island, really Martha's Vineyard, and Roy Scheider's Chief Brody tries to stop it. He has the help of Richard Dreyfuss's amusing Matt Hooper, shark expert and nothing at all like Peter Benchley's handsome and pompous creation from the book. Both men are trying to prove to the stubborn town Mayor, brilliantly played by Murray Hamilton, that there is indeed a killer shark out there. There is some real suspense and terror in this film which has proudly stood the test of time. People can relate to Brody's everyman hero, enjoy Hooper's wisecracks, and become enthralled and miffed with Robert Shaw's brilliant turn as Quint, the sea captain whose seen it all. Quint's story about the U.S.S. Indianapolis is pure terror. John Williams's score is tense and frightening. Spielberg has made a career of working with this man and I can see why. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T.,etc. Williams knows how to set the mood and to this day when I swim in the ocean I hear his score in the back of my mind. There are so many great scenes in this film. The horror of the opening scene grabs you and doesn't let go as we watch a beautiful, young woman take her final swim. Quint's introduction at the town meeting scratching the chalkboard is one of a kind. Brody and his son's mimicry at the dinner table. Just watch the camera move into Brody as he realizes a young boy is being attacked on the beach. Hooper is hilarious at the dinner table at the Brody house. Who could forget the shark's surprise appearance and Brody's reaction while he's chumming. Robert Shaw steals the film in it's final hour and you can't take your eyes off him. There's also a great number of memorable lines. Roy Scheider's improvised,"We're gonna need a bigger boat." Richard Dreyfuss telling Murray Hamilton,"Your gonna ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the a$$!" And no one will ever forget Brody's last line to the shark. Benchley's book was excellent but the film was smart to eliminate the affair Chief Brody's wife had with Hooper. It was also wise to tone down the political angle. In the book Brody's young son is threatened and his cat's neck is broken. Also, the final three man shark hunt consisting of Brody, Hooper, and Quint was condensed into a few days rather than a series of weeks. Quint's demise in the book is also more fitting though the movie gives him a truly horrific and gory demise. The conclusion is pure Hollywood and really deviates from the book. Spielberg told Benchley,"I got them where I want them so I can do what I want." He sure can and did. Jaws is still one hell of an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slightly less than 30 years ago as a teenager, I saw (on my second attempt--the first time the showing was sold out) what at the time was the first heavily hyped and marketed summer blockbuster. It was one of the most enthralling movie-going experiences I've ever had, and watching "Jaws" today on DVD misses something of that magic (nothing like seeing it on a 50-foot Panavision screen with 1,000 moviegoers screaming, applauding and laughing in all the right places) yet does not diminish the movie itself. Steven Spielberg would go on to projects of greater artistic ambition ("Schindler's List," "Saving Private Ryan") and would enjoy the services of much more reliable and convincing special-effects monsters (although less convincing humans) when he brought dinosaurs to life in "Jurassic Park," but has yet to make anything that's as perfect as "Jaws," on its own terms, was and is. Visually dazzling, marvelously suspenseful, and blessed with more character development and depth than most popcorn flicks, this is one for the ages.</fullReview>

Not much bad things could happen there. But when Chief Martin Brody(Roy Schneider) finds a bloody hand on the beach. He wants to shut down the beach and calls in a shark expert named Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) for help and Matt tells him that it was a shark but the mayor of the town tells him he cannot shut down the beach unless he has proof the beach is not safe. They then team up with a shark hunter named Quint(Robert Shaw) to hunt the shark before its too late. I enjoyed this movie it kept curious as to will they catch the shark before more happens.</fullReview>

But its not just about the shark its about 3 completely different men who don't particularly like one another having to work together as it is a basic theme of man vs nature and the terror that we as humans cant control everything . But I'm going to deep this movie is just great fun brilliant acting 3 very fine actors to my mind Robert Shaw is especially brilliant as the mad ex sailor who has a grudge against sharks ever since he was on the USS Indianapolis which was sunk and subsequently half the crew were eaten alive not surprising, and Brody as just a sheriff who has to come to terms with the fact that horrors like this do exist ,and finally Harper who has that typical Dreyfuss brash brat attitude about him who thinks that sharks are wonderful creatures and that is what makes the film so great 3 different men three different ideals one total horror linking them</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS!)The plot: Girl goes swimming at night, gets killed by shark, the police chief Brody decides that the beaches need to be closed, but the greedy mayor leaves them open for the Fourth of July weekend. Eventually another person(a boy on a raft) bites the dust in a violent death that leads to a reward for $3,000. Then a shark expert(named Hooper) flies in to investigate, and the local eccentric sea captain Quint joins with marine biologist and police chief to go out and kill the big old fish after a few more deaths.Needless to say, there's a few screw-ups, including: The severe underestimation of the killer's strength by Quint. A poison dart that misses its mark. Quint's death... which leads to an awesome finale, in which Brody blows the shark's head up with an oxygen tank. "Smile, you son of a-" Then the happy ending in which Brody and Hooper swim back to shore. THE END. But wait! Three sequels!If you get past the obviously fake shark, and focus on the good(which there's lots of), you have a five-star film, which is one of my personal, all-time favorites.Five out of five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******POSSIBLE SPOILERS*******Just when you thought it was safe to hate a movie Jaws came out. This is one of the greatest classics of cinema. Amity a town that depends on it's beach to bring tourists has a problem. A huge 20 + foot shark is roaming it's waters searching for food. After a girl is killed by the shark police chief Brody tries to shut the beaches down but the local government stops him. Then more evidence that there is a shark in their waters is found. So Brody calls the help of a shark expert Matt Hooper to help prove his case. Along with the help of Quint an old captain they go in search for the shark. Steven Spielberg does a great job on directing this movie. He creates great sequences of suspense and the camera angles are great when an attack is about to occur. Good acting performances by Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make this movie even more enjoyable. The music by John Williams is great as well. All up this is a good movie to watch with good effects for the time. I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>jaws is still one of the most powerful films of all time because it works on every level and is what inspiring film making should be about. i was astonished when i found out that Spielberg was only 27 during the making of jaws. I was only 5 when jaws was released so i saw the film later, the poster is so amazing it has blockbuster written all over it when i saw the film it really delivered. i have now seen jaws countless times and still i admire the acting, the score, the story and of course the shark! and these days i,m a lot less scared of going in the water! and to all the people that slag of the sequels jaws 2 was a worthy sequel and though not in the same class as jaws was still a good film. yes the others were terrible</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total total classic - the original blockbuster and definitely one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is one of the first mega Hollywood blockbusters - and definitely one of the best. It follows the Peter Benchley book of the same name - an obsessed police chief enlists the help of a marine scientist and a veteran fisherman to help track down and hunt a giant Great White Shark who has been terrorising the North-eastern US community of Amity Island. Spielberg - who knows how to shock and keep an audience at the edge of their seats with Duel - is certainly in his element here in Jaws. He places the audience in an strange environment - underwater camera shots at swimmers who are blissfully unaware that they are about to become Shark dinner. The excellent John Williams score also keeps up the tension. All the leads are well cast - Roy Scheider as the outsider Police Chief who is on the edge and Robert Shaw as the old, wry fisherman. Yes - the mechanical shark might look cheesy by today's standards - and yes - the film depicts the shark quite unfairly and inaccurately - But I was sucked into this film when I first saw at the age of 3. Ever since seeing this (I'm sure I'm not alone here) - but I always felt like there is something waiting for me down at the beach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Shaw did it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I agree that Jaws is one of the greatest movies ever made. I first saw it age 15 in a local cinema in my native Germany (dubbed of course but as is the standard in Germany - top quality)and I was blown away. I never saw anything with that natural acting approach and grandeur before that.Now after way over a quarter of a century I have seen this movie again on DVD in its original English version and here is what I have to say&gt;This is one hell of a movie but not without some minor flaws.I mean who am I to judge Steven Spielberg... This man has got the talent for grandeur but in order to achieve this he goes for overacting in all his movies. Just watch Laura Dern in Jurassic Park or even the great John Malkovitch in Empire of the Sun. The master director undoubtedly goes for, or allows for, overacting. I personally find it annoying and distracting from Spielberg's otherwise impeccable production values. The same can already clearly be seen in Jaws. All actors are overacting. I mean all. Let's watch and judge this true classic from a 2004 point of view and we can clearly see it. What saves the movie and makes it a classic is the casting. Some actors can overact and still be great or they simply never overact no matter what the director might scream into the megaphone.Richard Dreyfuss is overacting but he is a brilliant actor so it doesn't hurt.Lorraine Gary is way overacting bordering on cheesy but we can forgive her placing her in the big picture.Roy Scheider definitely is the center point, our identification figure. Any movie with Roy Scheider in it can't go wrong. He is a wonderful actor and he just won't overact. Robert Shaw IMHO simply IS the movie. His performance is way beyond brilliant. Spielberg's first choice for Quint's part was Lee Marvin, admittedly a great actor but most likely he would haveben a poor choice since he was and is too known from other movies before Jaws.The fact that Shaw got the part IMveryHO was what turned the movie into a classic. His performance as a "working class hero" as the Richard Dreyfuss character puts it is simply outstanding. Shaw has no problem showing his thinning hair or taking out a false tooth. That makes Quint all the more frightening and believable. Shaw's over the top old salt with a British accent IS the movie.The fact that Quint by coincidence was on the USS Indianapolis seems a bit contrived when the film is viewed today with knowledge of the real event on captain Mc Vay's ship, but Robert Shaw makes it seem convincing and even more - the trauma he suffered makes his character seem even more believable.God bless robert Shaw. What a great actor and what a waste to see him being cast during the late 1970s in some really bad movies probably being the effect of the success of Jaws.Bottom line&gt; Spielberg has the sense and talent to create grandeur but he goes for overacting bordering on the cheesy in some roles even until today.As soon as he has even just one top notch actor in the cast such as Shaw who can overact as much as one can imagine and still remains to good to be true(or Jeff Goldblum or Ben Kingsley or Morgan Freman who all seem to insist on the high art of slightly underacting or to put it better, a natural talent that overrides anything a director might say)Spielberg has a home run. This director has a wonderful talent for all the rest including lighting, editing, photography and of course choice of music in form of the great John Williams - maybe the best film composer alive today.Jaws is a great movie (closing our eyes to the clumsy and definitely failed fake looking shark called Bruce) and I repeat that Robert Shaw's brilliant performance must take a great part of the credit. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS *****This is it! The film that launched a revolution in film making and made Steven Spielberg a household name!As we begin yet another season of summer blockbuster entries, I can't help but give credit to the movie that started the trend. I was just a little girl, growing up on Long Island, when I begged my mother to take me to see JAWS and afterward, it took me another 2 years before I would venture out into the ocean again! What I love about JAWS is that it was more than just a casual popcorn horror flick. It has good acting, drama, suspense, action and even some humor. It's hard to believe that it was filmed on a restricted budget and plagued by equipment failures and delays that extended the filming several months beyond it's schedule. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that Spielberg originally planned to release JAWS in the late summer of 1974. The countless delays caused filming to run into the fall of 74. Rather than open the film to a winter audience, Spielberg chose to wait until the height of the following summer to release JAWS where it would have the strongest impact. This proved ingenious. The summer blockbuster was born and the rest is box office history! With today's technological advancements and computerized special effects, not to mention the overblown, unoriginal, popularity of remakes, it may surprise some that nobody has ever attempted to remake JAWS. However, after seeing the film, you'll quickly realize that this is because nobody could ever match the action, horror, chilling suspense, and tension between the characters than in the original. The acting is first-rate, particularly by the late Robert Shaw. The cinematography is quite good considering the challenges the film crews faced filming out on the ocean. Even "Bruce", the robotic shark that was built for the film, with all of his mechanical failures, is quite convincing in his scenes. One in particular is near the climatic ending where the shark breaks into the sinking ship, opens his mouth wide, threatening Chief Brody, and you see pieces of torn flesh and blood from his previous victim in his teeth! It still gets me, even today!The bottom line is, if you want to see a really entertaining summer film, definitely rent or buy this one! You will not be disappointed!Rating: 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first summer blockbuster and a film that has spawned three sequels and a whole net-ful of shark based imitations. The theme tune is embedded in the minds of everyone who has ever watched it and despite the weak shark effects the film still works today. The cast are excellent Scheider is brilliant as the good cop trying to protect his Amity Island while others are willing to risk lives as long as tourism and the economy thrive. Shaw plays the old seadog with his shark horror stories perfectly, and the claustrophobic cabin drinking scenes followed by the shots of the endless ocean kick the film from character to action driven scenes really well. The shark kill "smile you son of a bitch" and the long swim home make for a satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of the best films ever made. I doubt that any other action/suspense film is ever going to get close to "Jaws" in terms of chills, thrills, and characterization. One thing that makes "Jaws" such an excellent movie (and its sequels inferior) is the direction it got from Steven Spielberg. He kept a good pace through out the movie and created a high level of suspense. The shark POV shots and "Jaws" theme are two of the biggest reasons for this. I found the shark attacks here to be really scary! I'm sure if it wasn't for the suspense, they would have had less of an impact. Surprisingly, none of the kills (except maybe the last one) are overly gruesome or gory. It goes to show you that guts and gore don't make for scary material. Suspense and tension does. The acting here was excellent! Each of the actors fit their roles nicely. Robert Shaw chews up the scenery as the crusty old Quint while Richard Dreyfuss makes for a pretty good know-it-all-scientist type. Roy Scheider meanwhile, is quietly effective as the cautious Chief Brody. The only real setback in an otherwise great film is the mechanical shark, which isn't terribly realistic. Then again, the tension of the movie is so riveting that it's hard to really care about this. Overall, I'd highly recommend this classic to anyone. You can't miss it.Star Rating: 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cemented Spielberg's brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is still the ultimate adventure/scare movie ever made. One forgets that this was Spielberg's first BIG budget film (not counting The Sugarland Express), and the pressure he was under was intense. 'Bruce' the shark could have been a phoney looking disaster in the hands of most other directors, but Spielberg adapted to the limitations of his animatronic 'actor' and infused the film with a sense of mystery and forboding by rarely showing the shark, and only in quick glimpses when he did. The acting was first rate with great actors Robert Shaw as Quint, Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. They made you CARE about the characters. Without that we would WANT the shark to eat them, and all tension and suspense would be nothing but chum in the water.  Perhaps the biggest negative about Jaws is all the sequels it spawned. The movie was great and should have been left to stand on its own, with the sequels draining some of the reputation that the original created. Imagine E.T. coming back with phasers bent on world domination, it just doesn't work. See Jaws again for the first time, and remember how great it really is/was/will be.</fullReview>

Despite being made in 1975 I feel that this film will entertain people for ever. If there are people out there who have yet to see JAWS and are deciding whether or not to read the book first, let me give you some advice, DON'T READ THE BOOK!!! In comparison to the film, the book (despite being very good) does it no justice and may alter your perception of the films true nature, which is to terrify you beyond the point of sanity. My thanks goes out to the genius of Steven Spielberg and especially to the legendary John Williams for a true movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a pretty darn good film, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film just never did anything to me. This is surprising considering that I think it is very well made in almost every way. I was an outcast on this movie when it first came out because I must have been the only being on this planet that did NOT rush to see it. But I heard about it every damn day for months. After the hysteria died down and a few years later I viewed it. I couldn't figure it out. It was a very good film but it was nowhere as good as everybody made it out to be. So, I must face it. I am immune to this movie. Nevertheless, I think it is very much worthwhile viewing and would recommend it. The characters are good and almost cliche by some of todays Spielberg standards. The acting is top-notch and convincing. The story is almost too easy to follow - it's practically a template for future similar movies. And, yes, there are quite a few tense moments with the occasional body-part cameo. The shark? Yeah, Ok it is convincing when it needs to be. In fact, this movie has probably single-handedly put the kibosh on the rest of the world's remaining shark population forever. More people die from being kicked by horses every year than by encounters with sharks - but this movie got people worried. I suppose you could classify this movie as having cultural impact as well. Not a bad feat for a film. I give this film a good rating but I tend to not go out of my way to see it. It's kind of an Irwin Allen-on-meth-and-it's-a-sunny-day-type film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploiting the Ultimate Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws exploits the most primal fear that any creature can have: sudden, excruciating, inescapable death by a creature that sees one as nothing more than meat. We think that we are at the apex of the food chain, a creature that most others fear. Even the dog, the animal that most intimately knows us and our vulnerabilities recognizes us as a better food source alive than dead -- but woe is it to something that threatens that food source! Think of the Dobermans in "The Boys From Brazil" who dispatch a nazi war criminal in a particularly well-deserved manner.The people that "Jaws" kills aren't so guilty. They just happen to meet a very large, hungry, rogue shark -- the sort that sees humans in the water as meat. The tables are turned, and Man is deposed from what his throne as the biggest, baddest predator since T-Rex. If that isn't scary, then what is?This is a very gory movie. The closest parallel is Hitchcock's "Psycho" in which a crazy man becomes an animalistic killer, someone out of control of his impulses, who must kill because it is his nature. "Jaws" has more explicit killing, with human body parts left behind and great amounts of blood. The setting is so much different from the dry land of Arizona and the Central Valley of California that one cannot see a ripoff of Hitchcock. Like "Psycho" this is a relatively low-budget film -- but just as Hitchcock did with "Psycho", Spielberg did everything right.This movie is not for the faint of heart. Neither are the crude ripoffs involving tigers, killer whales, octopuses(?), piranhas, snakes, bears, and crocodilians. The ripoffs are simply cheesy flicks that would have been best unmade. This is the original and the unsurpassable best as a movie whose basis is the primal fear of becoming dinner for a big predator.Biological impropriety knocks off a "1" on my rating... to a "9". "Psycho" gets a "10".</fullReview>

The shark effect MAY look a bit dated when compared to todays standard digital effects but none the less, you'll find it hard to notice. Lets not forget this film really put Spielberg on the map in movie land.Also, John williams score is absolutely priceless. Never has a film score contributed so much to the success of a movie.Bottom line: Brilliant film, Brilliantly directed, beautifully acted and a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i was about 9 i bought this film solely for the purpose that is was a popular film. I sat down and watched it excepting a typical horror movie, ala nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Instead i got so much more then that. For anyone who calls themselves a movie collector who hasn't seen JAWS i advise you to get it.The opening sequence when Chrissie Watkins gets killed is cinema magic. Then shark is never shown yet it gives us an uneasy feeling of "what if?". What if we had of seen the shark? what gore is it unleashing on this poor girl? If they had of showed it, there is no way that the scene would have been as scary. Instead Spielberg gives us he IMPRESSION of what is happening.Alex Kintner's death is much the same. We see blood although we do NOT see violence. Our imagination is much worse then the actual truth.Then the Orca scenesThe bad chemistry that is going between Hooper and Quint is very obvious. Then you have Brody who is the common man. He earns a common salary, being the police chief of a common town with a common wife and common kids. He is US!!. The average person. He has fears, he has family he has a connection to us. His flash of courage in the ending is very uncommon. When Brody breaks the style from ordinary man to extraordinary man is the key to the movie. It ends up as a monster battling (in the end) an ordinary man.The movie of JAWS is not only a definitive point of Steven Spielberg, but the entire horror genre. The thought of being killed when you went swimming is unimaginable... until JAWS. After that film people are, and still are today, scared of swimming because of this movie. If a film of this magnitude has this effect on so many people, then there is no question that you have to see it.**** 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original novel of JAWS told more of Quint's obsession with the shark and in fact that was how the original book ended. Surprisingly, the novel lacks the element of suspense that the film had in droves.As most know by now, JAWS ushered in the mega-blockbuster era. We've seen the DVD special edition and watched the stories of how some of the effects and shark sequences were created. We know of the tough overlong, overbudget shoot and the fact that even Spielberg himself reckoned he would never work again in Hollywood after the completion of JAWS.JAWS was made for previews and discussions, for film fans and film lovers, for aspiring directors and writers, for artists and actors and it still will pack cinemas today (as I discovered some years back in the 90's at an NFT screening, although a big screen remastered print wouldn't go amiss!!)No need to pick out which sequences are stand outs, or which dialogue speaks off the screen, as you know what they are if you've seen it already.We're going to need a bigger boat?

		<fullReview>On an early summer night on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island, Chrissie decides to take a moonlight skinny dip while her friends party on the beach. Yanked suddenly below the ocean surface, she never returns. When pieces of her wash ashore, Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) suspects the worst, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), mindful of the lucrative tourist trade and the approaching July 4th holiday, refuses to put the island on a business-killing shark alert. After the shark dines on a few more victims, the Mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the culprit. Satisfied with the shark they find, the greedy Mayor reopens the beaches, despite the warning from visiting ichthyologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) that the attacks were probably caused by a far more formidable Great White. One more fatality later, Brody and Hooper join forces with flinty old salt Quint (Robert Shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White especially since the price is right. The three ride off on Quint's boat "The Orca," soon coming face to teeth with the enemy. I loved Jaws, one of the best movies ever and one that no one should miss. I liked the cast of characters Cpt. Brody and Quint, too bad Richard Dreyfuss didn't get eaten by the shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Movie, definite cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has to have been one of the scariest films I've seen in a long time, and will be for a long time. Its one of those types of movies you loved going to see in the theater more than once.... the first time for your own benefit, and the next time(s) to see the reaction of the rest of the theater in different parts of the movie. The movie was definitely ahead of its time, in that if it came out today it would be just another average action movie.... if not above average, but back in 1975 it was way above the norm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the ultimate popcorn thriller or what? It's maybe the greatest Hitchcock film Hitchcock didn't direct, mixing elements of "Psycho" and "The Birds" and even a little "Vertigo" when the camera closes on Sheriff Brodie as the Kitner boy explodes in a smorgasbord of red foam and flailing limbs.It's not Hitchcock who directed this film, but some other guy who has gone on to do some other stuff. It's probably true that other stuff has sometimes been deeper ("Close Encounters"), more exciting ("Raiders of the Lost Ark"), more gripping ("Saving Private Ryan"), or more fluid in mixing humor and horror (the first "Jurassic Park"). But "Jaws" was the most perfect movie Steven Spielberg ever made, as perfect and efficient an entertainment vehicle as Bruce was an eating machine.When this movie first came out, I wanted nothing to do with it. I was all of nine, and liked swimming on the beach. I saw the effect this movie had on kids who didn't want to swim out with me at the beach anymore. It wasn't until many years later that I saw the movie, and I was blown away. Not so much by the nasty shark attacks, though there are some shocking moments in this movie. I was shocked rather by the excellent acting, the absorbing plot, the whole story, even the spectacle of life in New England in the 1970s with all the bad bathing suits, ridiculous hair, and beach music like "You're Having My Baby" and "I Honestly Love You." Oh, yeah, okay, those shark attacks are pretty special, too.There's some very good things in this movie, some great things, and then there's Robert Shaw, who's beyond everything. He manages to be both the dramatic heavy and comic relief, the glue behind the male bonding that centers the final third of the film. If Shaw wasn't so good, the whole finale would seem illogical (Why did he smash that radio? Why is he gunning that motor when the boat is clearly failing?) As his WWII story makes clear, he's wrestling with major league survivor's guilt, not to mention a desire to go mano-a-mano with the monster of his nightmares. He almost wills himself into the shark's maw with nothing but a machete in his hands.What a master of detail Spielberg is. He's like John Ford, so bored in on the humanity of every character, big and small, as epic in his scope, protean in his range, and even faster with his pacing. Every time I watch this movie, and I do so a lot, usually in the summer, I pick up on something else I really like. Maybe it's the vignettes of small-town coastal life, the anatomy lesson of a rickety vessel in distress, Mrs. Brodie's subtle goading of her husband, or Polly the slope-shouldered old lady and Brodie's receptionist who thinks a community crisis is when the nine-year-olds are "karating" the picket fences. John Williams' score is rousing and brilliant, not just during the shark attacks but the moments in between when he references sea chanties and the like. Killer cinematography, too. Did waters ever look so blue, or skies so brightly azure, as they do during the voyage of the Orca? Murray Hamilton's mayor is a wonderful minor character, right up to the moment he suddenly realizes the waters around him are too deep and bloody to negotiate any more. ("My children were in that water, too.")But it always comes back to Shaw and Quint. Great lines, great moments, great shots, quiet ones of him standing in the pulpit with his rifle, noisy ones of him laughing with Hooper and Brodie, even goofy ones of him using the chalkboard at Town Hall to make a point. Even Richard Dreyfus's nasal, cutsey whining becomes effective counterpoint when set against the barnacly bluster of Capt. Quint. Shame Shaw didn't survive the decade; he and Peter Sellers were the two most missed actors in the 1980s.This is as much a movie for the summer as "It's A Wonderful Life" is for Christmas. Even if you live in Nebraska, do yourself a favor one evening, pretend the cornfields outside are the raging Atlantic, and pop "Jaws" into your video machine. Forget Moby Dick. There's no better fish story on the planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JAWS (1975) spoilers((( Steven Spielberg's horror masterpiece is unforgettable. One of film histories biggest blockbuster and most important movies is still an excellent movie. Roy Scheider plays the character as a calm but a bit nervous police chief that's afraid for water. Richard Dreyfuss plays a shark expert that comes to take a closer look on the beast, and Robert Shaw is the former World War II special ops soldier that maybe has got a bit psychological harmed brain...The movie is simply great! Director Spielberg was already back then co-operating with musician and composer John Williams, who made one of the most memorable melodies for this movie. The opening scene is marvelous, urge you too see it. The movie is long and interesting all the time, though 3 hours it goes fast cause of its entertainment. "Here's to swimming with bow-legged women" I think Shaw's character is superb, and that is also Dreyfuss', and Scheider's...so what am I saying here? STARS: ***** 5/5 (one of the best movies ever made)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Spielberg classic that I've loved since the first time I saw it in the theater (at age seven)! Robert Shaw's performance is one of the most outstanding aspects of the film. The performances of Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are nothing to sneeze at either. As a mother now, I have a lot of trouble watching the Alex Kintner attack scene...and yet isn't that scene one of the reasons this movie is so powerful? I own the DVD and continue to watch the flick every couple of months for Shaw's performance and the great ocean scenes. I will love this movie for all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Dialogue Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not a horror movie. It's a dialogue movie rapped in some horror elements. The true entertainment of the movie is in the interaction between the three main characters. This is one of Robert Shaw's greatest performances. He flawlessly pulls off the scarred veteran sailor. Scheider and Dreyfuss are above average here as well, though they are pale in comparison to Shaw. I rated this movie a 9/10, and I only failed to give it a 10 because of the horribly fake shark effects and the extremely unrealistic final "battle" between the shark and Scheider's character. I have this movie on DVD and I watch it often. Listening to the characters react to one another is all the entertainment this movie needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time when I was 8 years old and that was in 1979. It was playing in a holiday resort cinema at the time. A real run of the mill movie by the time I seen it, so even though I was so young and on my own, it was ok to go in and watch it. I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene. I had nightmares for weeks afterwards. Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time. There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious. The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way. A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids. I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound. I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film. But it is cool to see it digitally touched up. And what about the Score? Is there a more memorable score for a movie? Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world. That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better. I know it's strange but it's true. I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws. And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on. Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age. Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film. Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it. Big deal! Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself. In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once heard a definition of a "masterpiece": a work on which the artist has taken the exact same care with every brushstroke. Whether you look at it through a magnifying glass, or from far away, you are still in awe of it.I first saw _Jaws_ the summer that it came out, and I kept comparing it with the book. That prevented me from enjoying it as much. Now, 25 years later, I realize that the movie is a better work. The movie is on cable television constantly, and each scene still stands alone. Like a masterpiece of a painting, almost every detail is just right.Since then, I have seen the "Making of" videos, and I have noted some of the details that aren't quite right: some scenes in sunlight, some in cloud, sometimes the angles don't match up just right. Those little things only tell me how difficult it can be to make a movie, and makes me appreciate even more what a fine work actually made it on the screen.Steven</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is the most enjoyable to watch, ever. It sublimely entertwines comedy and action into a perfect mixture that has the viewer glued to film. Everything about the movie is excellent. The job done casting this movie was perfect and very interesting since none of the actors were huge stars at the time. Roy Scheider is perfect as the anal police chief, facial expressions and all. Richard Dreyfuss does his usual character, and is the most enjoyable to watch. Robert Shaw, however, delivers the best performance, and should have recieved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The writing is superb, as well as maybe John Williams finest score. Steven Spielberg became Hollywood's "boy genius" with this film, and for good reason. He sets every mood with his direction and allows the suspense to build naturally. His pacing his excellent. I believe it is his third best film, behind E.T. and Schindler's List. It makes my top 20 films of all time. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Jeffery Kramer, Carl Gottlieb, and Susan Backlinie. 4 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 8.8/10. Rated PG/PG-13 for Graphic Violence and Language. A great, terrifying catch of the day, JAWS was the summer mega-hit that established Steven Spielberg. This is the most cynically manipulative movie he's ever made (although it's deepened by some telling points about the tensions of contemporary masculinity), and it must be seen for its unexpected editing, driving score, and careful build toward shock images so big they feel like they're jumping into your lap.An East Coast resort, Amity Island, is plagued by attacks on swimmers by a 25-foot Great White shark. Although Mayor Larry Vaughn would like to keep the whole thing quiet--he doesn't want to ruin the summer tourist season--the brutal attacks soon cannot be ignored, so Police Chief Martin Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper, and grizzled old fisherman Quint go after the monstrous creature, winding up in a desperate fight for their lives.Now, everybody into the water! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "Jaws" when I was only 6 years old, and not one other movie has taken its place as my all time favorite. What's not to love? Since everyone else has given the pros (and there are tons) I won't go into it....but for those people who liked Deep Blue Sea better, get your heads out of your asses. Deep Blue Sea and every other modern action crapfest from Jerry Bruckheimer should look at Jaws and learn what a real action movie is all about. Effects only work if there's strong characterisation to back it up, and on that, Jaws delivers in spades. Jaws broke the mold for its day, and nothing in recent memory tops it. A+++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film kept thousands of people out of the ocean for several years. (And then it's sequel came out!) This is a cinematic triumph - what else do you expect from Steven Spielberg? This film sparked more shark-mania than any other shark story in history (before or since). Peter Benchley has actually expressed regret at having written this (and it's commercial success) since it sparked shark genocide on a huge scale. This film is so well-made that it had that sort of impact. The cast is excellent, the story first-rate and Spielberg's execution of the story is unmatched!</fullReview>

That being said, at the age of 28, I look back at the archive footage and so wish I were 10-15 years older so I could have seen the original screenings when the hype was ripe, much as when Star Wars was first screened. An incredible film with true staying power, and superb acting throughout. I LOVE this film, and re-watch regularly.I really do hope that the CGI addicted new generation of film watchers embrace this film and others of it's genre and appreciate it for what it truly is!!!.Long live that damned hungry shark :o)</fullReview>

Man against Self (Brody going out on the water even though he's afraid of drowning) Man against Nature (Duh! there's a shark eating people!)Pretty deep for an action movie.

YES!Is Jaws a natural disaster movie? YES!Is Jaws a monster movie? YES!Some people give it a bad rap for the shark effects, but that's ok, every great ________ (movie,person, etc...) has it's flaws. Besides, the shark looks pretty good compared to some newer effects I've seen lately. I would rather have a somewhat mechanical looking shark thrashing about and splashing water everywhere, than have it drawn in like a cartoon (Sorry, that's a Deep Blue Sea reference). This movie is scary on so many levels... First, the idea of something eating people you live near is scary. Second, the fact that it's a shark (something that really exists and you could actually see one) is scary. Third, there is a possibility that nothing will be done to protect innocent lives. (that too is scary)This is my all time favorite movie and would recommend that anyone see it. Some users posted that it should be rated PG-13... Well the movie was made in 1975, has very little harsh language, only has 5 deaths, and the PG-13 rating wasn't established until 1984, so that doesn't quite work out.This is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the grand-daddy of all action adventure movies. This is the one that started it all. This bad boy is the founder of the genre! Every action adventure made in the last thirty years that has to do with a creature attacking and killing people was inspired by this movie right here! Steven Speilberg's ultimate creation in fear, JAWS spawned one of the greatest world-wide phenomenons ever and got some people so scared of the water, that they haven't gone in since they saw it in 1975. Speilberg's gem that got him several Academy Award nominations, JAWS was way ahead of its time. The world was not ready for such a movie. But since it came, the people were satisfied and were loving it!Peter Benchly most likely never guessed that 30 years later, people would still be talking about this movie. Or that it would even have been a hit in the first place. So, next time you see this movie on TV, or the next time you pop it in your VCR, I want you to get on your knees, bow to the TV and pledge yourself to the grandfather of action adventure movies.JAWS gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first fell in love with Jaws when I was a kid and have watched it almost religiously ever since. It is also the only film that has prompted me to write a 'review' on this site(so far)...To be honest, there is nothing i can say about 'Jaws' that hasn't already been said before so I will just write about why I love this movie so much. I first watched it when I was about 7 and I remember crying because I was so scared and had NEVER experienced anything like it before (come on - gimme me a break, i was a kid!). It wasn't all fear though 'cos i also remember feeling thrilled and excited by the high sea chase ***SPOILER*** and the joy I felt when Chief Brody destroyed the beast with the oh-so-cool kiss off line ...When I watch the movie now, I still get the same feelings I had then because the film was always my favourite and it still has the power and magic to take me back to those innocent, summer days of childhood. Watching 'Jaws' as an adult makes me appreciate the movie on a whole different level...I recognise Speilberg's daring direction (It is still his best film), I see the brilliant chemistry between the 3 lead actors (Shaw should have got an oscar for his 'indianapolis' speech alone) and I basically see the hardship that went into making this movie possible (after watching the dvd and reading Carl Gottliebs brillant 'Jaws Log')...Jaws is simply a near perfect film that will stay with me forever...Great action, Thrilling adventure, Superb acting and even 'Bruce' doesn't bother me (come on, he doesn't look that bad - compare him to his 'look' in part 4 and you'll see what i mean). All in all, the greatest movie ever made..im my opinion at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAWS may well be the ultimate horror movie. Made in 1975, it's hard to imagine that it's leanness hasn't influenced the the serial killer/slasher trend of the 1980s, with Jason, Michael and Freddy and their knifes/axes just reincarnations of the Killer Shark's teeth. Man exists of 90% water and some anthropologists have theorized that our original habitat was the beach, with it's easy pickings of seafood, fish and birds. Perhaps a Jungian terror of what lurks just beneath the ocean's surface has seeped into our very genes after lethal encounters with sharks, jellyfish, portuegese warships, poisonous snakes and tidal waves.Water is of course also the spiritual element, represented by the color blue. Whatever the reason, in the year of the Vietnamese Communist takeover of Vietnam, this lean, ruthless, low budget (for Spielberg) gem of a movie was made. Based on a book by Peter Benchley, this movie is at once a metaphor for the power of nature and man's powerlessness in the face of it, and in a strange way a Western, with mad shark hunter Quint as the gunslinger, Chief Brody as the Sheriff, and Mayor Vaughn and the store keepers as the weasly townspeople. Due tribute is also payed to the men of the USS Indianapolis, who delivered the Atom Bomb, and who's return journey was, to say the least, beset with tragedy.When it first came out, it scared me out of going near the local ditch, let alone the beach and later, I had to think twice to even go near the water line. Great use of suspense, great use of music to enhance the expectation and terror, this is a showcase of what a talented director can do with our most existential fears. The movie itself is part monster movie, part guys on a mission movie, part revenge movie and as such is very engaging. Even a quarter of a century after it was made, it hasn't really dated and can be viewed again and again. One of the best movies of all time and possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever been more scared of a shark movie (sorry Deep Blue Sea fans). This movie made me go out about 5 feet into the ocean water when I went there. I swear, to me, this is the greatest film ever made (no offense to Godfather fans). Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss played their parts extremely well, as Brody and Hooper, but the man who should have won best actor was easily Robert Shaw. He greatly illustrated the part of Captain Quint, the salty old sea captain from years back. But the entire last half of the movie was definitely the best I'd ever seen. The scenes from the Orca were great, and the parts of the actors balanced out the movie. Scheider provided the worrier, the easy-to-panic man who's scared to death of the ocean but bravely steps up when he's the only one who can kill the shark [Smile you son of a -----! :)]. Dreyfuss gave the comic bits and the memorable lines, and Shaw, of course, gave the movie the best actor of the decade in my opinion. Jaws was the basic summer film; shark attacks, the chief police officer acts in the town's best interest, the mayor tries to stop it, and before we know it we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis not unlike the 1916 conflict that actually occurred. I give this movie my highest recommendations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A perfect film. I doubt that anyone reading this hasn't seen it but if you haven't, I'll keep the recommendation simple. For one, I still have problems with going into deep water at the beach because of this movie. Second, Robert Shaw delivers what can be called the greatest monologue of all time (which reportedly he delivered in a drunken state). Third, the score by John Williams. Fourth, there's just no reason to keep going. The only flaw that I can think of is that the shark looks kinda fake in one or two scenes but you know what? I'll take Bruce (the shark's nickname, named after Spielberg's lawyer) over anything that would be produced these days, i.e. a badly fitting, CGI monstrosity. The movie has aged more than well and deserves a place on everyone's top films of all time. I would love to continue telling you why I love this film but I don't think I need to. Rating: ***** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BRILLIANT MOVIE....I JUST CAN'T WATCH IT!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My feelings towards JAWS are somewhat perverse. On the one hand, it is a great movie (if not one of the greatest!) and i find myself having to watch it, once or twice a year.The problem is this;I am seriously scared and disturbed by this movie. I am a avid movie fan, i watch many (many) movies, i also enjoy reading up on movies. But (and please don't laugh) i have to wince in bookshops, when reading movie-books, just in case, a still from JAWS is in it. Even if it's just a land shot from the movie, it sends shivers through me. I have a real pathological fear of this movie (especially THAT poster) and after repeated viewings, this fear remains.This must be a sign of a masterpiece, because for all my fears of this movie, i have to push myself to watch it (i want to watch it!) Of course, i have never watched it alone. And even though i've bought it on several formats, i have to either;a.) take it round one of my families, house b.) watch it with someone round mineI have recently bought the DVD edition, that features several hundred photo stills/poster variants, and i've viewed about 50 of them, before i started to feel a little queesy.That asside, what else can you say about JAWS, it is a classic. You can take a wild guess at the age of some of the people who posted "not as good as (the dreadfull) DEEP BLUE SEA. DBS does not scare me in the least (nor, in fact do shark documentaries) it's the shark in the movie, it's fakeness (and believe me, i wouldn't go anywere near it for a million pounds!) is what adds a element of surrealness to the movie.The opening scene, for instance, with the attack on the girl has burned it's image, deep into my soul, to the point were, i find it to be the most intense part of the movie.The acting, plot and performances are too, perfect. And i think this lends a hand to the fear factor. I do not think SPEILBERG has fleshed out better characters, and to be honest i don't think he's made a better movie. The incidents surrounding SHINDLER LIST were very important, but i thought the movie sucked (i'm sorry!)Another good point worth noticing is this; If you have seen this movie as a child (and maybe watch it every couple of years since) you tend to grow up with this movie, on many levels. As a child i remember it on a 'pulp' excitement level (i.e, the deaths, and the justice dished to the shark) Then as a young adult, you embrace (not only the plot) but the more technical aspects of the movie, and you can relate more to the surrounding characters, rather than just see them as fish-food. The scene with BRODY and his son mimicking each other is a good example of this. Now, i am 29 (30 in october!) and with trying to make my own way in the world, i can relate to the residents in this movie, who have bills to pay, and who need to have the beaches open in july. The shark itself, is finacially eating the island be it on land or sea.This movie is every thing a blockbuster should be. Far better than the STAR WARS franchise, that could do very little, without the (over)reliance on special fx. As the trailer (that scare the sh*t outa me!) says; SEE IT.........BEFORE YOU GO SWIMMING!Ten out of ten!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the shark may be fake looking, Mr. Director, the almighty Steven Speilberg, used that to his advantage and left it unseen for the best part of the film. With an opening scene (the now legendary 'First Attack') that rides high up in the ranks alongside the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Speilberg, like the monster Great White in the movie, has proved himself a powerful force to be reckoned with. Apart from spawning three sequels (number two was okay, three and four, well lets not get into that shall we) Jaws is the ultimate monster movie which would only have its' perfect veneer tarnished if someone was to do a remake (Gus Van Sant's Psycho anyone?). The basic plot is that Satan's goldfish is snacking on the locals of Amity Island and it could cause a few problems as it is getting very close to the summer season and the tourists will be flocking in their droves to the island. It then comes down to three guys, Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Icthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a Captain Ahab style shark fisherman called Quint (Robert Shaw) to try to kill the beast. Speilberg uses the camera alongside John Williams' simple but classic haunting score to show the power of the Great White with exhilerating effect. While Quint's monologue of the events of what happened to the crew on the Indianapolis had audiences mesmerised, a couple of well positioned jolts in the movie had people leaping out of their seats with fear, Jaws has created what we have come to expect every year and that's the summer blockbuster. We only have Mr. Speilberg to thank for giving us this now annual event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was never a movie before, and there has never been a movie since that impacted the psyche of people around the world the way that Jaws did. Till this date you can't help but be a bit apprehensive about entering the crests of an ocean break. You start hearing the deep grumble of the two note score of Jaws approaching. It is a shame that it has been cheapened by being overplayed on TNT.Jaws is Speilberg's best film by far. He had to push his creative genius to its edge because unlike his films now, he didn't have a bottomless pile of cash to dip into. He made you love his characters. It's also beautifully shot. The shot of Brody sitting on the beach as the Kittner boy is eaten with the camera dollying in and the lens being widened out is used all the time now thanks to this move.Brody, Hooper, and Quint also give us one of the most interesting mismatches of characters ever to grace the screen. The scene at night in the boat after they've attached the first barrel is the kind of scene that all film makers should be trying to duplicate. The USS Indianapolis monologue is the kind of speech every actor dreams that a writer could plop in their mouth.In order to truly see if what I say is true, that Jaws is the best film ever, ask yourself this one question. Does anybody look at the ocean the same way they did before 1975.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INCREDIBLE FILM!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow!!! Easily one of Steven Spielburgh's best films of all, however, aren't all of his movies. Anyway, this is just wonderful. Spielburgh uses very little of the shark to create a fear, or tension in the viewers mind. We don't see much of the shark, but the fear of it is heart pounding. I couldn't believe it. A few years ago, I was flipping through the tv channels and came across JAWS being shown for it millionth time. I decided to give it a chance considering I had never watched it before then. Luckily, I came across the part of Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider) chumming, and complaining about doing it. Then, out of nowhere the sharks head comes out of the water to collect some of the chum. My heart stopped for a few seconds, and I turned white. I was absolutly terrified. I feel the blood tingling in my arms as I watched the scene unravel. Absolutly terrifying! Not only that, the story of the USS Idianapolis by Quint (Robert Shaw) is enthralling. The performances by every actor in this film are supperb. The is a classic, and far supperior to DEEP BLUE SEA, or any of the other JAWS films. JAWS 2 is a good sequel, but ultimately, not as good as JAWS. Although, I would recommed seeing JAWS 2, because it is a good film, and it is scary. However, I didn't see JAWS 3, and I bought JAWS: The Revenge on dvd because it was dirt cheap. Just forget about JAWS: THE REVENGE; it's terrible. Most of all, just stick with the first two films. They are great. But JAWS itself is easily one of the best movies ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent piece of pure movie entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A smart and carefully crafted thriller, based on the novel by Peter Benchley, when a vicious great white shark is suspected of attacking swimmers near a small, quiet sea-side community. The down-to-earth chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a keen oceanographer, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and a scruffy yet Captain Ahab-like fisherman, Quint (the late Robert Shaw) set out in Quint's untidy boat to find and kill the beast before it strikes again.Steven Spielburg, who directed the movie, does a brilliant in taking a tale like this and creating a real stomach-churning, mind-numbing adventure. Plus, Spielburg, the three leads (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss), and the screen-writers deserve a great deal of credit for their parts. I can't forget to mention the priceless score that's done by John Williams and Bill Butler's colorful camera work.What made me enjoy the movie is that Spielburg uses fear instead of gore to scare the viewer and make him/her feel like anyone who goes to that beach. Even the dialogue has its' share of good one-liners and the harrowing speech delivered by Quint (Shaw) about the sinking of the Indianapolis and the problems that he and the crew members encounter. He covers just about every detail that you can think about those who made it out alive and those who didn't survive.In conclusion, "Jaws" is an excellent piece of pure movie entertainment. As for Spielburg, the film made him a genius.</fullReview>

Put your boat in the marina; tie it to a pier, as long as it's in the water. Cuddle up with someone you like, grill some fish, have some wine, pop some corn...turn the volume up, feel the boat rock, as the theme comes up...perfection!Spoiler, Last paragraphOK, with the DVD out now, watch this film a few times. Watch each and every character. Down to the extras. You won't find a weak performance. The deputy, the chief's kids, no matter where you look, everyone is solid. (Even Peter Benchley, in his first acting role.)The late Robert Shaw was a marvel in this piece, again, Oscar-worthy. Roy Scheider, Richard Dryfuss, everyone was at their best. Mr. Spielberg did an amazing job, most assuredly Oscar-worthy. This is the only movie I've ever seen where the audience leapt to their feet and gave a standing ovation at the end. (When the shark blew up, and AGAIN when credits rolled.) And a rousing cheer when Hooper popped up from below.I've been to theaters where the audience clapped, cheered, groaned, and had no reaction. Never before or since have I seen a legitimate standing ovation for a film.What a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies..." - when I first saw Jaws, I don't even remember the crusty Robert Shaw saying those words, in fact I hardly remember any of the dialogue from the film. What I do remember, though, was the incredibly frightening fin of the man-eating great white. How it used to glaze on up out of the water like a knife as the ominous thumping of John William's orchestra filled the air with horror. That was the sign to bury your face into the pillow as the voices of panic began to increase in pitch and power. Needless to say, I was afraid, and still am to a degree, to go into the pool alone. The power and ferocity and terror of Jaws scared me to death when I was five years old, but now it remains on the top ten list of my all time favorite movies. Jaws was something of a problem for me when I was younger. My parents would say they were going to watch Jaws on the T.V. just to get me out of the living room and into bed. Now, when I actually sit down and watch the movie (for the thousandth time) it actually is a quite beautiful film. The dialogue that goes on between Shaw, Schieder, and Dreyfuss is incredible. Shaw delivers an awesome performance - especially in his U.S.S Indianapollis speech. Dreyfuss and Schieder are both funny and serious and terrified and don't know what to make of Shaw - and my feelings are that the audience doesn't either. Shaw is not your typical hero, but he is a great character anyway. The real jewel to the film is the score, however. John Williams, as in all his music, captures the audience in the deadly melody which is mesmirizing, beautiful, adventurous, deadly, bold, and simple all at the same time. The chase music is especially fun to listen to, but the theme of the music is what everyone remembers. This is such an incredible movie and is not something that you see very often nowadays. I give it a 10/10 and encourage all who have not experienced the magic of Jaws to get up and go rent it!</fullReview>

Great acting, great directing, great insight into humanity, great camerawork (Brody's scene on the beach when you focus in on his face as he watches the ensuing mayhem is a all-time classic). Great everything apart from the rubber fish, but what can you do - Yo Steve, instead of wasting your time and the efforts of your CGI boffs on that wrinkly alien, sort out the shark in this film man!This is one film where I can appreciate why the ending was changed from the book - it just wouldn't have worked on screen and risked looking a cop-out. Only watch this film in the series however - the rest suck. The only regret I have is that this film, unwittingly, contributed to hysteria that resulted in the mass slaughter of millions of sharks - poor fishies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>E.T., Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List all received more accolades and perhaps, deservedly so. But this film is the best popcorn movie of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career. At least in my opinion. Spielberg masterfully has blended suspense,horror,drama and at times humor into a spellbinding thriller. The best mainstream thriller since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is excellent and not just from the three leads but the whole supporting cast. From Murray Hamilton as the disbelieving Mayor to the mother of the little boy on the raft who confronts Brody in a small but memorable scene. John Williams' Oscar-winning score is arguably the most famous of all time. The whole movie is loaded with classic scenes from the opening sequence where Chrissy meets her fate to Quint's horrifying story about the men on an ill-fated mission to deliver the bomb during World War II. Even though most scenes have been memorized by now, this film never fails to deliver. That is perhaps the truest test of any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to bore the reader with the plot details because anyone who is the least bit familiar with this film knows what it is about. Jaws is one of those movies I never get tired of. It is still as entertaining and suspenseful now as it was when I first saw it on the big screen in the 70s. Spielberg does a wonderful job in not showing the actual shark until the latter part of the film. It really helps to build the suspense, leaving it up to the viewer's imagination as to what Amity and its people are really up against. A masterful musical score by John Williams helps to move this along wonderfully. The score really breathes life in to the movie. The music is so recognizable today that most die-hards of the cinema are instantaneously familiar with it. Jaws is similar to his previous film, Duel, about strife between man and leviathan, the leviathan being a truck and its faceless driver. In Jaws the leviathan is a great white.I feel the movie does a splendid job in showing the emotional strife that Chief Brody undergoes as the movie progresses. As the film opens, he is a sheriff who is quite happy doing his job on Amity without any real problems compared to what he once faced in his job prior to living on Amity. Then he transforms into a man under a great deal of pressure and anxiety as he encounters a problem bigger than anything he ever faced before.Numerous films were compared to Jaws throughout the 70s and early 80s. It was a huge phenomenon when it came out launching a plethora of rip-offs, some good, some horrible. The movie has great dialogue, editing, music and characters that help to make this one of the classic films from the 1970s. Robert Shaw's role as Quint is one for the ages. He really brought his character to life with a memorable performance worthy of an Oscar.For me, the best part of the film is when Brody, Hooper and Quint head out to sea to capture and/or kill the Great White. So many wonderful moments in the last part of the film that bring out a wide variety of emotions including laughter, tension, anxiety, sorrow and finally a sense of relief when the shark is killed. I have a friend that feels there are a lot of correlations between Jaws and Moby Dick. Bruce the Shark is to Quint what Moby Dick was to Captain Ahab. It's up to the viewer to believe whether this is the case or not. And finally, for what it's worth, all the dress jackets that Murray Hamilton (Mayor Larry Vaughn) wears in the film, including the one with the little anchors, are some of the worst I've seen in movies to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is a movie that does such a great job of making it's often ridiculous plot seem believable that we rarely think that what we're watching couldn't possibly happen. Jaws is masterfully constructed. Great use is made of it's music and it's camera shots and edits. The music is, of course, unforgettable while the camera shots of the shark are handled with extreme skill. The shark's fin is used often to convey menace while shots of the shark about to take a bite out of people are brilliantly edited. The shark attacks, themselves, are brutal and horrifying. The girl in the intro being menaced by an unknown force underwater is great because it leaves a lot to our imaginations. The little boy being killed is hard to watch and does a great job of building the shark into a malevolent enemy, one that's worthy of being hunted and killed. Roy Scheider gives a believable performance as the common man police chief. He shows a lot of restraint and control while other times exhibiting genuine hysteria and frustration. Robert Shaw gives a career defining performance as the crusty and eccentric shark hunter. Shaw is given some great lines and some great scenes to establish and develop his character. Richard Dreyfuss is understandably annoying as the brainy, hippie shark expert. The power and success of the movie is using the shark. It is created as the ultimate evil and becomes a famous movie "villain" in spite of the fact that it's just an animal. Creating a script where it's more than an animal is what holds the movie together. Great dialogue, great dramatic moments, a great cast that performs with zeal and passion, great camera shots and truly horrific moments make Jaws a classic. I first saw this movie in the theater as a little kid on a re-release and the opening scared me so much that I tried to leave the theater. My dad grabbed me and sat me down. I'm glad he did as I got to see a great movie.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws,without a doubt,is one of the most,if not the greatest film of all-time!(sorry Citizen Kane).What a crew it had!Steven Spielberg,who went on to become one of the greatest directors of all-time was still a bit inexperienced,but didn't let anyone know it.His combination of thrills,suspense,scares and humor were amazing!Like the yellow barrels bobbin'up&amp;down on the surface of the water,Ben Gardner's dicapitated head,and my favorite,the Indianapolis scene.It wasn't just the speech but the combinding of the 3 topics Brody,Quint and Hooper were discussing that made it so special.The comparing of scars by Quint&amp;Hooper &amp; Brody feeling left out,the famous speech by Quint,&amp; the old sailor song "Show me the way to go home"were all responsible for the success of the film.And Roy Scheider from "The French Connection"as Brody was great.He brought a real honest feel to the role that I don't think anyone else could have done.And Richard Dreyfus from "American Graffiti" brought a nerdy feel to his role that also was unbelievable.But I think the real star of the threesome was Robert Shaw from "From Russia With Love".Man,he was a god in this film.Who could of ever expected this rough-talking Brit to take on this role with such a Ahab-like essence?He should have won Best supporting actor at the Oscars,but that's Hollywood for you.He will always be one of my all-time favorite actors even though he acted in some pretty bad movies after "Jaws" like "Black Sunday".And Murray Hamilton and Lorraine Gary were fine supporting actors as well.Even though I think Gary is nothing more than a "Great" B-movie actress who got a big break.Oh,and how about Johnny Williams' greatest score ever?At least he got Awarded for his efforts,unlike spielberg.But he has been on the short end of the stick many,many times before.And Carl Gottlieb and Verna Fields for their writing and editing skills-Great Job Guys!This movie dosen't get enough credit these days with all these new films.But "Jaws" has something that no film can ever seem to fullfill nor imitate.Jaws'2,3,&amp;4 for example,and "Deep Blue Sea", and even that stupid movie "Shark Attack".Let me tell you something,when you have to use nudity and L.L Cooljay to try to attract an audience, you officially have a really bad shark movie.But not "Jaws".(except for a brief flash by christy Watkins.)But not this predator.It's as though(as Orson Welles said:)"God created the Devil and gave him...JAWS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, Fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion. The way it was made is an incredible story in itself, Jaws was a smash hit and its clear why. The casting was excellent, the story was great, the suspense was awesome and the acting was wonderful. Robert Shaw steals the show as the rugged yet loveable shark hunter Quint. Fine British actor who sadly died soon after Jaws was made.I have personally watched this film over and over, even for 1975, the effects are great and the shark actually looks scary. No computer graphics or state-of-the-art effects like that were available but they still managed to scare an audience so wildly that people darent even draw the bath water.One of only a few films I will give full marks to.Rating 10/10. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-time classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as Jaws is recognized as a "classic," I still believe it is somewhat under-appreciated. It is so much more than simply an action movie or a horror movie. Jaws is an outstanding drama with powerfully written characters and superb dialog, largely delivered via one of the all time best trio of performances ever together on film. Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Schieder gave us such comical, interesting, yet realistically human characters, and Robert Shaw should have been nominated for an Oscar for his work. This is not a movie about a shark attacking people. It is a movie about three diverse personalities dealing with the shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many Shark Films try to Deliver the Same Classic Thrills Found in Jaws. Many have Tried, But No one will ever make a Movie that Could even Compare to Perhaps one of America's Greatest Films in History. It Redefined the Way we look at Sound and Picture Quality for Years to Come. And it was the Most Shocking and Original Motion Pictures Since Psycho. The Movie itself was Quite Scary. The Musical Score was Brilliant. and The Acting was Mighty Fine. I Recommend that any fan of this Film See the Dvd Version, Because the Special Features are Enough for Me to Get Lost for Hours and Hours. 10 out of 10. Also Recommended: House IV.

		<fullReview>Among the best action/suspense/horror films ever, with fine performances by Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw. You must see the 25th anniversary edition with added footage. The only fault I have with this film is the dumb ending with the shark jumping onto Quint's boat. It's dumb, cheesy, and it kills my favorite character in the film. This is light years ahead of all the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that did to beaches, what Psycho did for showers! (Beware, spoilers ahoy!)That, in itself should partly sum up what this film is about. This is probably the greatest action/horror/suspense/drama film ever. It has all the good elements that a film needs to hold the audience's attention for about 2 hours. The opening sequence sets the mood perfect, with John Williams' haunting score. I really do squirm and grit my teeth when that first victim gets killed. God, what a scene to start a film with! From here on, the film gets better and better. The four main characters are great. Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, and the rubber shark all have beautiful screen time together, and they work off eachother well. (Hehehe I've lost it you think? Yes I have!) But, seriously, these four are what make the film so entertaining. And damn those critics for saying the shark looks fake! Is it just me, or doesn't it still look as good today as when you first saw it? It still scares the heck outta me! But, to me, the guy who steals the show is Shaw's crazed sea captain. He has seen some horrors in his time, and in his (mostly improvised!) monologue, we really feel close to him. He evokes an emotion that many directors feel the music must create. But he does so, without any aid of music. Bravo! This is the first, and, of course, the best film of the series. It's most likely to be THE best monster flick ever. Spielberg, directs this with an energy akin to that of the unstoppable shark. He plows ahead, until the final 'explosive' climax. It's also a buddy movie. The three characters on the boat, at first look out of place with each other, but they soon begin to bond, especially Quint and Hooper. that scene when the two are comparing scars is priceless. Although there were many, many, many mechanical problems with the shark, this films still floats perfectly. It is a film that deserves to be owned. If any of you still havn't (for some BIZZARE reason) seen this landmark film, then do yourself a favour and watch this film, you will not be dissapointed. Without a doubt a perfect 10*! I couldn't even consider giving it anything less. This film has left it's mark on me, and probably I'll never venture into another beach alone again! "Show me the way to go home. I'm tired and I wanna go to bed! Well, I had a little drink about an hour ago... And it's gone right to my head!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I lined up..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..with the rest of the world when this came out. Its been on cable quite often but not until yesterday did I see the entire thing uncut and uninterupted. Its a good movie, not classic, but solid entertainment with some thrills and some things best overlooked. Spielberg created some excellent suspense but some of the deaths are horribly overlooked, they seem to just have happened to move the plot along. Its hard to believe that a beach community would think twice about closing down a beach with known great white sharks in the area, so to make that feasible, it gets laid on the politicians, who are greedy and untrustworthy in every single movie since time memorial. This is very timely right now, in this 'Summer of Sharks' here in the US. Each time someone gets attacked its all over the press; two people died this past Labor Day weekend and of course their families were all over the news, being continually insulted and exploited by the press. On the other side of the coin, you get 'Jaws' author Peter Benchley on CNN proclaiming that the sharks are more often the victim than the predator, so its just easier to ignore it all and say a prayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"JAWS", why I became a cinematographer is the first place!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie theater goes dark, the trailers end, then the images begin. We see a young coed strip down to skinnydip in familiar waters. Everything is fine and dandy - until the antagonist of the film comes swimming towards her. I can say that EVERY scene of Spielberg's "JAWS" has had an impact on my life. I can't think of another film that has evoked more primal feelings out of a young kid ( I was 7 when it came out) than this one. (I can add "COMA", "WATERSHIP DOWN", "STAR WARS" and "HALLOWEEN" to the top of my list as well). Spielberg has, as with almost every other of his films, created a an experience to behold with this one. I think one of the greatest elements of the film is Spielberg, and editor Fields, techique of NOT showing the shark until half-way through the film. This creates a "Hitchcockian" type of suspence that so extremely effective. It is hard to describe the impact and influence the plot, and characters had on me - I guess I was at the right age to absorb what was going on enough to formulate it in my mind and instill it in my brain. Chief Brody and his fear of water, Quint's hatred for the shark, Hooper's know-it-all expertise, the Mayor's denial of the situation, etc. And, of course, "Bruce", the hungry shark. Bill Butler's cinematography was very good, considering the budget and locations he had to work with (this also goes for Dean Cudney's '"Halloween"). Benchley and Gottlieb's treatment of the film, I think, works better that if they would have stayed true to Benchley's novel. Spielberg's approach and stylization really works. It could have been "shot through a cannon", but Steven likes to be creative, and Zanuck and Brown took the chance and allowed him to. Well, motion picture history was made that summer of 1975. And I owe all involved in making it a huge thanks. I would have not became a filmmaker if this was not made when it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie was when it came out in 1975 at a local drive -in and I was 10. I remember going to the snack bar just before the scene where the little boy on the raft gets eaten. I was walking back and saw the scene and closed my eyes. I was terrified for a long time after that . It wasnt until years later when it was released on home video that I could see just how much I had missed that night. Robert Shaw was absolutely riveting and to me extremely sexy. What a shame his character had to die at the end even though it was his idea to change the ending ,in Benchleys book Quint drowns.Evidently Shaw didnt like that and Benchley wasnt thrilled with Shaws ending and was thrown off the set. You do get to see Becnhley in a cameo as a news reporter on the beach in once scene. Roy Scheider is a great actor as is Richard Dreyfuss.This movie put Dreyfuss on the map and he won an oscar for the Goodbye Girl a few years later. Also a shame he has not been given any good movies to do lately.I hear hes going to tv now .Roy Scheider hasn't aged too well ,about 70 i think now and doesnt do much acting work . Most of the main characters are either dead or out of the business. Robert Shaw sadly died a few years later after doing the Sting another great movie and a few lame ones after that . A shame because he was such a talent and you know rumor has it that Sterling Holloway was supposed to be Quint but had problems with the IRS .Shaw didnt wanna do the movie ,thought is was silly , supposedly his wife had a hand at the time to urge him on . Boy was he happy when it was a hit .I am somewhat surprised that he wasnt even nominated for an oscar that year or for any other award. The indianapolis speech alone should have one him that .I figure its because it was a horror movie and most actors guild members didnt support it .It was nominated for best picture but obviously didnt win. On a somber note are the sequels . Jaws 2 was ok at best but without a Quint character or a Hooper and only Brody's character returning it sinks. I wont even mention 3 or 4 except to say please dont make any more sequels to this movie . Its 26 yrs old now and enough is enough,each sequel ruined it. But i hear rumor has it they actually have a script to do another sequel which actually might be a prequel involving Quints days in the military. That could be interesting if done right and with a good director ,top notch acting and directing.This movie is and always will be a classic .The only horror movie to me which worked better when the monster couldnt be seen . To the person who made the comment why didnt they show more of the shark at the beginning ,i think it made it more scary to not now what it looked like .Sure we all knew it was a shark but how big or how scary we didnt know / FAct is that made movie better and in real life the modem shark that was used kept breaking down and they got it too work so rarely so they had to work around it. This to me was a great suspense and audiences loved it .. I dont care how old or tired the special effects get . There will never be another movie like it . Enjoy and show your kids for the first time . Bye now</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel Good Factor Like No Other!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the obsession started in 1975 when I was carted off to see Jaws at the now demolished Plaza cinema in Cardiff. I was 5 years old, I remember being there and being amazed though I was probably too young to be scared by it. Surely they wouldn't let 5 year olds see it today! This was the film that got me addicted to cinema, not Disney classics that most kids seem to love.Years later I remember watching Jaws on TV and being absolutely fascinated by it again but it was not until I bought a copy on VHS in about 1988 that I really started to watch the film in detail. What a piece of work! The second half of the film must be the best three-hander in film history, the casting of Shaw, Dreyfuss and Scheider has amazing chemistry. Scheider's everyman, Martin Brody being the "fish out of water" against the salty Quint and Ocean Brat, Hooper's needling relationship. (Has anyone else noticed Scheider's resemblance to the shark?? - sorry Roy) Virtually every line that comes out of Quint's head is macho rhetoric that we'd all love to be able to quote verbatim when we are drunk. He is from the same mould as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore in Apocalypse Now. A macho hard man impenetrable mostly but with a slightly soft centre when put under the microscope.Jaws has had an undeniable influence on our culture. It has instilled in a generation a fear of what is under the water. How many times have you had a moment of illogical panic whilst swimming? For me and many I know this was put there by Jaws. The "scars" scene is undeniably a Cinema classic and has been parodied and tributed many times. It is in this scene that we see a more human side to Quint emerging. How many times have you heard people in desperate situations say "We're gonna need a bigger boat"? Just watch Buffy!So much has been said about the film and it IS a flawed masterpiece but no one questions the fact Halliwell's rates this as two star film! I love Halliwell's and this is the only real faux pas it contains. Such a seminal film (the true father of summer blockbusters) and a film so well crafted, scored, acted and scripted should qualify as a four star. Technically Jaws is brilliant - temperamantal mechanical sharks aside! All that water-level perspective camerawork is groundbreaking and was copied hugely in Robert Zemekis' Cast Away - go on take a look it's where the camera is half in the water half out.I am glad to see that other IMDB users love this film enough to put it where it is in the Top 250. It may not be fresh in our memories and there may be better films out there from one aspect or another but when it comes to the best all-rounder of all time I don't think there's one to beat this. It is so accessible and it preys on a fundamental human fear while using very human relationships to convey the story.Of all the films that I'd like to see a remake of this is the one, Here's your cast: Edward Norton - Brody, Seann William Scott - Hooper, William H Macy - Mayor Vaughan, Tommy Lee Jones - Quint, Brian Singer - Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that took a big bite out of beach business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most traumatic productions in Hollywood history also turned out to be one of Hollywood's greatest masterpieces of terror. JAWS is often blamed (wrongly, I think) for starting this obsession Hollywood has with blockbuster hits. I say "wrongly blamed", because, besides grossing a quarter of a billion dollars at the box office (the first film to do so), JAWS is really a very great movie.The story itself is familiar: a New England coastal resort town terrorized by a Great White shark, a mayor unwilling to put his town's economy at risk so that the shark can be killed, etcetera, etcetera. The problems they had with the mechanical shark are even more familiar. But the fact remains that JAWS works, because Steven Spielberg has never been the kind to let go of a vision he is in the process of making into his own--and this was no exception. Instead of making it into a visceral monster movie, Spielberg took to not showing the shark for the first two-thirds of the movie (although the fact that he had very little choice had more than a little to do with it), thus mandating an Alfred Hitchcock approach to things. He is helped by the excellent performances of Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, as well as John Williams' classic score. The score, Verna Fields' editing, and the production sound team of John Carter and Robert Hoyt won Oscars for their work.And of course one must thank Spielberg for having delivered a truly terrifying and dramatic piece of cinema, and not just an ARMAGEDDON-style sound-and-fury event. JAWS, even after a quarter century-plus of being sequalized, parodied, and ripped off, is still a Hollywood masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film ....EVER! (part one)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers will indeed follow*What a load of crap, right. A shark starts eating the locals of an island community, putting a sheriff, who happens to be afraid of water, on the spot. The selfish mayor opposes the sheriff in shutting down the beaches because its bad for business, and puts some tourists out for lunch. Sheriff gets mad when son almost gets chomped so he enlists the aid of a cocky oceanologist and a crazed fisherman to kill the shark. These three go out in a rickety old fishing boat to do battle, become amazed at shark's enormous size and swimming skills, and proceed to get their rickety old fishing boat smashed up by the gilled beast. Cocky and stupid oceanologist goes down in a shark-proof cage, and narrowly escapes with his life. The shark, apparently feeling confident, jumps on to the back of the boat and eats the fisherman. Sheriff then manages to blow up the shark into millions of pieces before swimming gleefully back to shore with oceanologist.Yikes! That sounds terrible, does it not. But what is pretty unbelievable is that I just finished decribing to you the greatest film ever made. Now let me explain why.Jaws was the breakthrough film by a then unrealized film director named Steven Spielberg. Very young, very talented, and still possibly naive about the film industry, he undertook the overly ambitious and utterly preposterous task of bringing this story to the big screen. At his disposal: the prestigious lineage of Zanuck filmmakers (lots of money), a talented cast (none of them A-list), a devoted crew (very good swimmers), and a mechanical shark. Luckily for him that shark never worked.The shark in the film becomes an unseen evil because, due to the technical difficulties involved, Spielberg and friends were not able to show it as much as they wanted. This makes the film less of a gimicky B-list monster movie and more of a taut suspense-horror-adventure film. Not seeing the shark makes the viewer more uneased, not being able to know where it is and what it is going to do next. I mean if you were swimming in the ocean, how many of you would see the shark coming anyways. All we know is that when that thumping music starts playing, the shark is there, and its going to try to eat someone. Actually, they should have gave a cast credit at the end with shark played by John Williams, because his simple but very effective score steals the movie from any actor or mechanical shark that appears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, here it is: the film that made everyone afraid of the water and gave sharks a bad reputation that they are still unable to shake off. "Jaws" is my personal favourite of all of Spielberg's films, it has it all: humour, suspense, a great story, magnificent acting and, most importantly of all, it grabs your attention immediately and doesn't let go. The film is set in the small seaside resort of Amity, a peaceful holiday town and to its residents, the summer means everything to their business. However, all is not well beneath the surface of the ocean, for a 25 foot great white shark has staked a claim in the waters. It begins to pick off some of the townsfolk and the panic begins to spread. Enter Police Chief Brody (a career-defining performance from Roy Schieder), who tries to close down the beaches to protect the people but is soon met with opposition from the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) who refuses to have them shut down for the 4th of July weekend. As a compromise, Brody calls in an expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (one of Richard Dreyfuss' early roles, and one of his best) who warns the mayor also of the dangers of allowing people into the water when a beast of such mammoth proportions is lurking below. Predictably, disaster strikes and the mayor finally relents, allowing Brody to hire a contractor, someone to go out and kill the shark. The contractor comes in the form of an old sea dog in the mould of Captain Ahab, namely Quint (Robert Shaw in fine form as usual) who has had several experiences with sharks on his many voyages. He accepts the duty ("I'll find him for three, but I'll catch him and kill him for ten") and so he, Brody and Hooper set out to hunt down the beast. However, it isn't long before the hunters become the hunted...I don't think I've had as much sheer enjoyment watching a film as I have when watching this 1975 classic. Everything about it is perfect, the cast, the script, the effects, everything. Anyone who criticises the shark for being unrealistic ought to have their heads examined, not only was it as good as was available at the time, but I haven't seen it bettered in any modern offerings - "Deep Blue Sea"? The sharks in that pathetic excuse for a film are shamefully poor, I am still shocked to hear people claim that that production bettered "Jaws" in any way. Steven Spielberg's offering is far superior to any other tale of the ocean and I doubt it will ever be bettered.I couldn't write a review of "Jaws" without commenting on John Williams Academy-Award winning score - the best score I've ever heard. Just listening to it without the images encaptures the spirit and mystery of the ocean and who could possibly forget the oft-imitated main theme used to indicate the shark's arrival?This is as close as cinema can get to perfection in the action-horror genre, every moment of "Jaws" is priceless, and I for one will never tire of watching this marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say. This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. You will never look at your goldfish the same way again. And out of 187 reviews (188 after this one is put on) only four are bad (Shame on you four)I first saw it on TBS and even the edited version scared the crap out of me. Schieder is terrific as the water fearing Chief of Police. Dreyfuss is at his best as the the young shark expert. Hamilton and Gary are excellent in their supporting roles. However, I think Shaw (an often underrated actor)was the best. He actually becomes Quint. The chilling Indianapolis speech (Which he had a hand in writing) is one of the best scenes in cinematic history. Not only does it transport you to the chilly waters of 1945, it seems he isn't reading lines from a script. He narrates it like he was there. That is the gift of a true actor. What's particularly hard to believe is that he was the THIRD choice for the role of Quint. Lee Marvin was the first, and Sterling Hayden was the second. It's hard to imagine them giving the type of performance that Shaw did.This is the film that put Spielberg on the map. And gave him the most headaches. One of the main reasons the shark is only seen towards the end of the film was the fact that the shark rarely worked. However, the lack of the shark is what really gives it suspense. It gives you the chance to build up the horror for yourself before you actually see it. Another great touch is the fact that there is a humourous line just before the shark appears. And who cares if the shark is rubber? what's scarier, a rubber shark or a computer generated shark? Neither, if that's all you're worried about. Personally, I didn't think the shark looked phony. One of the more interesting things is that when it came to casting JAWS, the shark was considered the star of the show. They didn't concentrate on getting huge stars. They got ACTORS. That's what pays off. Due to the sucess, Spielberg, Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss became major stars(though sadly, Shaw died not long after in 1978).All in all, this is definitely a must see. However, it's better to get the unedited version that to watch it on TBS or TNT. Check it out, you will not be dissapointed.10/10*****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is one of a handful of films I can watch again and again, and it gets better every time. I queued round the block to see it the first time I was allowed to the cinema on my own back in 1975; the crowds were such that I missed the beginning, not getting inside the theatre until the bit where Roy Scheider comes out of the police station and walks down the street, giving a little skip-and-a-jump when he hears the band playing. (I still love that moment.) Two hours later, when the film had finished, I discovered I'd been so hypnotised by what was on the screen I still had my coat done up.In the intervening years, I've read Carl Gottlieb's book about the making of the film countless times, and in 1998 finally made a pilgrimage to Martha's Vineyard to see the location of the fictional Amity Island for myself. (Travellers' tip: they don't like you mentioning sharks there.) I walked in Roy Scheider's footsteps down that same street in Edgartown, I crossed to Chappaquiddick on the ferry where Murray Hamilton first puts the screws on him, I cycled over the bridge across the entry to "the pond", I sat on *that* beach.My VHS copy was worn pretty thin when the marvellous DVD release came to my rescue, along with the excellent behind-the-scenes documentary. Of course, since missing that terrifying opening scene as a teenager, I've made up for it since - and it's probably the one scene that I still find difficult to watch, for Susan Backlinie's panic and agony as Chrissy always sound so painfully real.If I had to pick a favourite scene, I'd be hard pushed to choose between two. One is, of course, Robert Shaw's classic USS Indianapolis speech. The other is one of the most masterfully subtle pieces of directing Spielberg - or anyone else - ever pulled off. It's the scene where Brody, having been publicly humiliated by the grieving Mrs Kintner, sits that evening at the dinner table, unaware that his toddler son is mimicking his every facial expression. But this isn't quite the tension-releasing moment it appears to be. Listen to John Williams' haunting, nursery-chime-like music at this point. It's undermined by a slowly repeated, discordant bass note, reflecting Brody's mood. Then we hear Brody's wife Ellen letting in Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who seems to be the only person on the island who knows what's on Brody's mind. "Is your husband at home? I'd really like to talk to him," he says, proffering a gift of wine. "Er, yes, so would I," responds Ellen tautly, showing him in. He sits and everyone looks at each other for a moment. Then Hooper asks, "So: how was your day?" And Brody relaxes, and grins, and says, "Swell...."I still get emotional every time I watch that scene. And it's partly to do with the situation and the performances, sure; but it's also because the absolute perfection with which it's constructed leaves me breathless.And, of course, we're still a long way off seeing the shark at that point. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shark looked fake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But who cares?! Frankly, I'm sick and tired of hearing people complain about the shark looking fake. You didn't think the shark looked real, but you were still in suspense, weren't you? The fake-looking shark is a testament to Steven Spielberg's directing skills, because he still made Jaws into an intense and terrifying thriller. That shark may have been the reason that Spielberg only agreed to direct Jaws on the condition that the shark would not be shown until at least halfway through the film. (spoilers) Jaws wastes no time. The film starts off on a beach (a scene in which the film's time period ? the mid-70s - is very clear), and some goofy young guy gets together with some drunk girl, and they waste no time in getting naked to go swimming. This is a confusing scene, though, because it seems to be dawn when they get to the water. Were they drunk and going swimming at dawn? And then, in the next shot, it's dusk again, and it even switches back and forth a few times. Needless to say, the naked drunken promiscuous girl gets munched, and they find her remains on the beach the next day. Spielberg wisely chose to present a very tasteful autopsy, which was not gory at all but still effective, and it was one of the little tricks that he pulled in this film in order to keep the rating down. The shark attack spells disaster for Amity Island (!!), a very small town dependent on its summer tourists for a substantial portion of its economy. The mayor, who proves to be not a very nice guy, wants to keep the shark attack covered up and keep the beaches open so that tourists will come, even though those very tourists would be in danger. Little does he know that an idiotic horror film - released four years later and nearly named after his town - will probably hurt the tourist economy much more than any shark could. Some of the best parts in the film come early on, as Brody (Roy Scheider) nervously scans the tourist crowded water for the shark, after having tried unsuccessfully to get the beaches closed. There are at least two shots in which the ocean itself looks menacing, which is significant because the ocean naturally radiates calmness and tranquility. Robert Shaw plays the part of Quinn, the hardened fisherman (who, we later find out, was once involved in a historic naval accident, putting him in the water with sharks for an extended period of time) who offers to go out and catch the man-eating shark terrorizing Amity Island, given the proper reward. He provides a good guide for Brody, the chief of police who doesn't handle himself very well in the water, and Hooper, the oceanography expert who doesn't seem to have as much field experience as Quinn. The final scenes with these three men at sea battling the shark are probably the scenes that this film is best known for. Obviously, this is the first time we get a good look at the shark (oh shut up, it was plenty effective enough), but also, I think that the scene where Hooper goes down in the shark cage may be the most intense moment in the film, because we actually see the shark coming while in its own habitat ? underwater. Jaws is such a powerful film because it takes something out of nature, something that is real, and presents a situation in which that element of nature has become extremely dangerous and must be stopped. The film score is one of the most memorable in motion picture history, and the film also contains numerous pieces of dialogue which have quickly become universally recognizable ? `Don't go in the water,' `You're going to need a bigger boat,' etc. Steven Spielberg proved his masterful directing skills with Jaws only four years after his first full-length motion picture, leaving audiences all over the world wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The DVD Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching the hour long documentary about the making of Jaws, one begins to realize what an incredible production this film really is.The main problem with the production was how to deal with the shark. The effects people were told it could not be done and would thwart the production. But they had their own ideas and used such skills as carpentry, science, sweat, and bringing an old effects man out of retirement to get the job done. The documentary takes you back to when films were almost regarded as going to war where ideas and concentration consumed a 24 hour day, as well as plunging deep into one's creativity to get what they want and sometimes not what they want, which many times were welcome surprises that made the film better.You can't help but compare the creation of the shark to today's computer effects. Where instead of hard work, solving tangible physical problems, the computer effects are done relatively simply and after the production is finished from a controlled environment. The documentary of Jaws shows the filmmakers fighting the elements of the sea, nature, and the mechanical creation which they weren't even to sure whether or not would look real. The result is that it does look real. Even more so than computer effects today which look nothing more than animated cartoons mixing with live elements. With the old physical effects we get a better sense of physical interaction with all the elements on screen. The lighting is consistant, the textures the same. All of which subconsciously create the illusion of reality to the viewer, discerning ones anyway. It also asks the question. Did filmmakers talents in physical effects eventually peak? Or was it that computer effects were easier to do?Overall the documentary shows that movies are not made like this anymore, only differenty. Which could be good or bad. But when you hear Spielberg talking about the scene when the Kitner boy being eaten being more about the Chief's fears and concerns do you then realize the thought and concern directed to the viewer to enjoy a good story rather than to be impressed by a special effect for 2 hours. Movies today get that backwards now. Somehow most filmmakers think we will be entertained by eye candy, rather than their suggestions of drama and horror they can put into our imaginations. Because truly the most terrifying scenes are when there are only suggestions of the shark and how John Williams score conditions us to feel at ease only to later make us jump out of our seats.This movie could be released tommorow and set all sorts of records and audiences would once again stand to cheer it. Perhaps even go so far to thank the filmmakers on taking them on such a great journey. Or perhaps not. In any case, truly most films are not made with such consideration as how the audience will respond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The initial success of this film is not up for question, but I think that with all the hype that surrounded this film upon release the quality of the film that Spielberg had made was upstaged by the shock value.I like to see this film every twelve months or so and it simply appeals to me more and more every time I watch it. It has possibly the best combination of acting, dialogue, direction, photography, suspense, humour and plausibility that I think I have ever seen. Some of the shots that Spielberg got when out on the water are simply superb and obviously took enormous effort to consign to film back in the mid 70's.I'm loathe to mention 'Deep Blue Sea' in the same sentence as Jaws (although it was an enjoyable film in it's own right), but there is a point that can be made here. The advent of CGI effects means that we can now see more of the stuff that used to cost huge amounts of money, man-power and time to create on film. However, this is exactly where Deep Blue Sea fails where Jaws so resoundingly succeeds. We do not need to see the shark in Jaws to know it's there and the film is carried not by the appearance of the shark but by masterful acting (by the whole cast), great cinematography, genius direction and an intelligent and fit-for-the-screen take on Benchley's novel.It's nice to be able now to sit back and appreciate this film for more than just the shock value of the 'shark in the water' formula. More than 25 years on this film still stands head and shoulders above most other movies (similar or not).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's scary, it's thought provoking, and it's brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this movie to thank for my shark fascination, and also for demonstrating to me, at an early stage in my development as a writer, how successful horror is when it is implied, rather than shown. Of course, the actual shark is fairly terrifying, but it's twice as scary when it just pulls people under the water, or pursues them with a torn off fishing dock stuck on its back (and how about the scene where the yellow barrels become so much scarrier than a dorsal fin). The killing of the little boy (a choice that Spielberg seems to me spending the rest of his career atoning for by having little kids get rescued in all his other movies) is an especially brilliant scene- writing, filming, acting and... oh God!... the pacing and timing!!! Excellent performances from all three of the leads and some of the supportings as well (Lorraine Gary... unsung brilliance sadly tarnished by later appearing in JAWS: THE REVENGE); Shaw's monologue about his pacific experience is one of the greatest movie speeches ever. The writing in general is excellent- they remembered to take the time to develop characters and such, rather than just move from one shark attack to the next- as is the filming (my favorite moment being the beginning, when there's a shot of the sun setting on the water, and you see Chrissie's arm and hand sink slowly beneath the surface). Too bad the sequals were all so terrible, and have more or less stigmatized the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's effortless storytelling and filmmaking skills are an excellent reason to recommend this film. Spielberg has a knack for knowing how his audience wants to be treated and he calmly goes about setting up a variety of scares and thrills that do their things without fuss. There's a lot to admire in the tension-and-release techniques he employs and his smooth cutting sense (the editor is Verna Fields although Spielberg is in complete control) helps move the narrative along at a natty pace. His clever way of slowly introducing us to the monster (in this case a shark) is well thought-out and effective. John Williams' score is excellent, done at a time he was delivering his best work ("Star Wars", "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind") and before bombast became his standard. The cast includes Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss (at his hyperactive best) and Robert Shaw; everyone is clearly having a good time, knowing they're in the process of making a scary movie with a talented mastermind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no less than a cinematic classic. An adrenaline-pumping, nailbiting, scaring-the-living-hell out of you film. How does Spielberg make a plastic fish seem scary? Simple, you don't see it until half way through the film. John Williams' threatening musical score takes your imagination to new levels as you see everything but the beast that is devouring swimmers left right and centre. I heard that Paul Newman amongst others were up for consideration but the casting is perfect. You believe Shaw and Scheider not only are their characters but that people like that exist. Dreyfus is wonderful and almost steals the film from "Bruce" the mechanical shark. If films like Hook made you doubt the directing talent of Steven Spielberg, watch this film and cower in shame at ever daring to doubt his talent for excellent direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is not the time or place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSBut it's always a good time to dissect Jaws, one of the most iconographic ? if not necessarily classic ? films of the last three decades.I'm not normally a Spielberg fan, finding him often bland and sentimental. So it's a pleasant discovery to find a director who, with Jaws, was at the top of his game.Oh, it's all hollow, of course. No real message or depth, just a multiplex-pleasing piscine horror movie, yet the way each and every single shot is lovingly put together is truly commendable. There's neat touches, like Schieder's face zooming into close up while the background stays the same distance. Admittedly, he's ripping off Hitchcock left, right and centre, but he's doing it in such a caring way it doesn't really seem to matter. Other images stand out, such as the head in the boat, or the dead swimmer's buried hand crawling with crabs. (The crustaceans, not the STD). There are clever moments, like Roy looking through research pictures on sharks. Not only does this give out relatively discrete exposition, but also it gets in our minds the image of a real shark, a sense of foreboding that would cover over any misgivings when the actual rubber version finally appears. And with John Williams' supremely memorable "der-der, der-der" incidental theme, Spielberg has a Psycho-rivalling sting to deliver home the shocks.A man coming out of his hut with the sign "Harbor Master Frank Silva" is a little obvious in imparting information, but Dreyfuss' autopsy is another genius touch. In order to keep the film available to the widest possible audience, the gore is toned down. So what Dreyfuss' description does is to suggest it, which is scarier anyway. In fact, the first sighting of the shark isn't till nearly an hour into the movie, during which time Spielberg has skilfully borrowed and honed shots from classic cinema to blend into the picture. Characters walk too near to the camera, or in front of it, obscuring the view, while waves splash up it ? all giving a subliminal illusion of reality.Yet it has to be said that the second half, with it's slightly camp incidental music, and ponderous male bonding dissipates the tension somewhat. It's as if Spielberg realised he was building up to something really special and lost his nerve. Shots of the shark itself actually amount to less than ten minutes of the film's duration, many of which are underwater shots of the real thing. Where the action (i.e. when he's eating the actors) dictates the fake prop must be used the movie is less effective. The rubber shark now looks, frankly, slightly ridiculous. It's ironic that while the shark is the thing on which the movie is based, whenever it appears it tears at the credibility of the piece. While the shark's indestructibility and extreme powers of devastation ? "smile, you sonovabitch!" ? is an air of the feint silliness that would be symptomatic of the vastly inferior sequels...</fullReview>

Among the usual comments about the direction, the music, and the characters, I'd like to chalk one up for the pacing. The movie flows perfectly, and before I knew it, an hour and 15 minutes went by in what felt like half-an-hour. That's what I call good pacing, as well as an engrossing story development, and give Spielberg his dues for that one.Nothing more to say other than it is deserving of the label "classic."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of this writing there are 160 comments for this movie and it ranks an 8.2. I ask, where does it lose that 1.8 points? It's perfect, my favorite movie of all time. If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark? I'm stumped. See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie. Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand. I've often wondered- why is it that as the years go by and technology advances, the sharks in the Jaws movies just look worse and worse?Everybody has seen this, so to summarize the plot is a waste of time. No other movie has terrified the world in such a way. The most terrifying films of all time don't get into your head like this. There are few people who are afraid of hotels due to the Shining, and even fewer fear demonic possession (Exorcist), or Zombies (NOTLD). Now these are among the scariest films ever made and I love them dearly, but they don't get to you like Jaws. I've heard that in the past some people feared the shower after seeing Psycho, but come on, Jaws kept MILLIONS away from the beaches, and people still fear the ocean to this day. That is true, irrational FEAR, spanning 25 years, especially since it is rather common knowledge that sharks are about as interested in eating people as they are logs. This movie had the same effect on cinema as War of the Worlds did on radio. It showed that the entire nation can be profoundly affected by what is on that screen.So see this masterpiece again, and for heaven's sake, DON'T watch it on TV. The edited pan and scan version just doesn't cut it, and you don't even get to see what happens to Quint. As for my feelings about the DVD, I really enjoyed some of the new sounds, but overall the original is still the best. It doesn't matter though, only people who've seen this film hundreds of times like me will notice the new sounds anyway.</fullReview>

Take the fate of Quint at the end. I just saw this movie recently and even knowing what his fate was to be, and seeing how fake the shark looked, I still found the scene extremely chilling, almost disturbing. I really didn't expect this. In fact I was anticipating this scene all through the movie, knowing how it would occur and it STILL managed to shock (also, at the time I was extremely tired and nearly nodded off a few times). I think that's a pretty good indication as to how good this movie is.Oh, one last thing: Deep Blue Sea is a stinking turd. Don't waste your time on it. Rent or buy JAWS instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following on from his success with Duel and Sugarland Express, Steven Speilberg took Peter Benchley's legendary bestseller and crafted one of the most effective thrillers in the history of the cinema. Not to mention, one of the best and most popular films of all-time.For those who still may not yet be familar with the story, the action starts off at the picturesque island of Amity. Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider ) is the new cheif of police and finds himself dealing with something that Amity has not encountered up till now - a shark attack. His attempt to close the beaches is rejected by the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and it isn't long before another innocent beachgoer winds up as a victim. Brody calls out for the help of an oceanographer, Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss), and later the colourful shark fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw). The three of them set out to sea in order to destroy the terror and it isn't long before they come face to face with a three-ton great-white shark. The problem is though - who's the hunted here?Digtially remastered for its 25th Anniversary, Jaws has lost none of its stunning power or suspense. Its a film that's guarnatted to frighten and fascinate viewers no matter times they've seen it or seen something familar. And once you remember and know by-heart the thrills and shocks, Speilberg's directorial genius becomes even more apparent. The ensemble cast of Jaws is something else. Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are an acting threesome made in heaven whilist those based at land, such as Hamilton and Lorraine Gary, and many other of the suffering locals stand out strongly. To sum it up everything is awe-inspiring. The cast, the shark, the script, the directing, the techniques, the music and everything else. Jaws is a forever unrivalled cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Jaws" is still a fantastic film, even by today's standards. It positively set the cinema world on it's ear upon it's release in 1975.The story is well known and simple. Somehow a great white shark has made its way to the local waters of a New England town. People start disappearing, and the hysteria begins. The mayor (Hamilton) refuses to acknowledge that there is danger, as he wants to protect the precious revenue the summer vacationers will bring to the town. The police chief (Scheider) enlists the help of an marine biologist (Dreyfuss), and a professional shark hunter (Shaw) to battle the shark out on the open seas. Fantastic scenes include when Shaw recounts the story of a WWII vessel that capsized, dumping all of the seamen into shark infested waters. Nobody can watch that scene without getting affected. There's also the scene with Dreyfuss investigating a wrecked fishing boat for evidence of a shark attack, and the two old men who think they can catch the shark with a thanksgiving turkey as bait. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the opening scene involving the skinny dipping girl and the first shark attack, and of course, the entire last half hour... the true showdown with the beast. Excellent casting, and believable multi-dimensional characters make this a film that is proving to stand the test of time. Lots of people will tell you the shark looks ridiculously fake, but I always though that given the era this movie was made, WAY before even the earliest computer special effects, the shark looks pretty good. Besides, the performances and story are so strong, that you don't even stop to critically analyze the effect of the shark. Go out and BUY this film... I guarantee you WILL want to view this one again and again! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies capture the audience as Jaws did. While some movies try to imitate it, such as the sequels and films like Deep Blue Sea, none can duplicate the awe Jaws gave. Who can forget the classic team of Roy Shieder, Richard Dryfess, and Robert Shaw as Brody, Hooper, and Quint? (I for one can't) They deliver a dynamite performance that is difficult to find elsewhere. And what about Spielberg and his crew? They fought the elements of the sea that made the production all the more difficult. They went to great lengths to bring the movie, and the shark, to life. And all their efforts paid off, creating the best horror film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made before I was even born, but it holds the title of being my all-time favorite movie. I've seen it too many times too count, and after every viewing I feel the same way as I did the first time--slightly nervous about going swimming any time soon. I know the movie almost by heart, yet there are certain parts in it which scare me every time (the best example being the scene where Richard Dreyfuss is investigating the sunken ship). The feeling of suspense throughout the movie is unparalleled by any other horror movie I've ever seen, and it will no doubt remain my favorite for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest stories ever told. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so i'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propellor, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has recieved it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outakes. Definately money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. 10/10 stars, and worth every one! G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've watched the original "Jaws", and then I decided to it up on DVD.It just goes to show how such a simple premise can make a great film.Genuinely scary for its time (and still remarkably effective today), "Jaws" has a 26-foot great white shark terrorize a small resort community. Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw all make good as the group set on destroying the dreaded killer fish, and the supporting roles do a nice job of fleshing out the citizens of Amity.The end result are some tense and mildly gory frights, another classic John Williams score, and a thoroughly entertaining movie. The 25th anniversary re-release is worth getting, especially if you don't own the movie already. The film has been nicely restored, with an informative "making of" documentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes (see Quint terrorize oboe playing children!) and a few extras give this package some real (forgive the pun) meat.A fun classic film, although its sequels are absolutely ridiculous. (Come on, when do sharks really take things "personal"?)</fullReview>

The funny thing is that when Jaws came out and people were leaving the beach by the millions scientist's told us that a large shark like that would never come close to a public beach a 28 foot great white was caught 150 miles off the coast of long island.

		<shortDescription>The DVD special edition of this timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true beauty of this anniversary edition can be appreciated in the scene on the docks where the town mayor is heard cautioning Chief Brody about the implications of "yelling shark". In the laserdisc version, the gray flannel of the mayor's blazer adopts a dancing rainbow spectrum of colors, whereas the intricate details of his decorated suit jacket look flawless (though no less fashionably disastrous) on this DVD edition.My only question about the footage that accompanies such "special edition" releases as this is, Who recorded the audio!??? It never ceases to amaze me how much money is spent marketing and releasing these retouched classics, while for some unknown reason, skilled audio technicians seem to always have inordinate difficulties getting a simple "clean take" of the commentary sessions. As writer/director/actor Carl Gotltieb speaks of his involvement with the film during "The Making of Jaws" featurette of this "DTS" disc, your ears feel like those of the Great White itself, preying along under 40 feet of ocean as his speech penetrates the water like muffled subtones. I've made better quality recordings in my apartment with a $68 mic than is heard on parts of this over-saturated recording!Despite that, the supplemental material is intriguing and insightful; any true "Jaws" fan will surely gleam at some of the anecdotes of Spielberg and others. A timeless classic and well worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy 25th to the scariest movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a miracle that it's been 25 years since this film has been released. I unfortunate didn't get to see this in the theater (I was born a year later), but countless viewings on video, cable, television, laserdisc, and now DVD has made this my second favorite film of all time. What's rather ironic, is that Steven Spielberg consider this film his "nightmare" not because it scares him, but because it was a nightmare to make. With "Bruce" (the mechanical shark) keep breaking down, Spielberg went over budget and schedule to complete this film. He might call it a nightmare, I call it a blessing in disguise. Because of not showing the beast until over a hour into the film, it's a Hitchock element that even Alfred himself would be proud of. And the characters, the timid and aquaphobic Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider). The scary, experienced, and strong-headed fishman Quint (Robert Shaw). The excited, knowledgeable, and brave marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). The community concerned as well as economic minded town mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). And also the loving, worried, and tender wife and mother, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary).The story is very complex, from a problem that Mayor Vaughn will continue to ignore, until it swims right up and bites him in the.... well, you know. The police cheif from New York City, who moves to a more quiet and relaxed community, only to find that he has more problems in Aminity than he does in the big city, not to mention being afraid of the water, and living on a island. When it's only a island when you're on the water. The scruffy fisherman that is the town terror, who torments everyone from a child playing the clarinet to the entire town in a meeting. Plus not to mention the gigantic 25 foot and 3 ton great white beast that snacks on anything that swims. Because of this movie, it has influenced me a lot in life. First, it has open my mind with movies, not to make exciting movies, but also excellent movies. Second, it has helped me gather research on Steven Speilberg, which I find this to be his best film, above E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (although those films are also classics!) Third, to confront my fears, I am like Chief Brody and am terrified of the water, and seeing that bloody shark doesn't help me. But by watching this film, it encourages to stand up against my fears and face them. And finally, it is just as exciting to watch the first time just as much as it is to watch it the one millionth time. This is the movie that introduced the world to Steven Speilberg, not E.T., not SCHINDLER'S LIST, and not JURASSIC PARK, it was JAWS. Because of JAWS, the entire planet has seen this director evolve from doing films that are from the imagination of a child to doing serious films with important meaning. Countless people label this film the first "summer blockbuster" I label it the classic films for the new generation. From STAR WARS to PERFECT STORM, JAWS was the first film to have big special effects, big budget, exciting action scenes, and a excellent story. This film will forever be a timeless classic. ***** (one of the best movies of all time!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1975's Jaws is now an immortalized classic after 25 years this film still brings suspense and fear to all beach lovers and swimmers. Jaws can be called a classic for many reasons to name a few the directing of Steven Spielberg the good acting of Richard Dreyfuss as a genius scientist studying and analyzing the Great White Shark and Roy Scheider's portrayal of a good-hearted cautious town sheriff(Martin Brody). Most of all the musical score at the films beginning and really throughout all of the film makes such a suspenseful climax that movie fans loved I remember owning the 45 record I wish I could now find the CD or tape soundtrack. Jaws is not really a horror film, but more a suspense-thriller that builds up to a horror climax. This film really had many people I know terrified to go swimming at the beach, because of the portrayal of a shark being a human-eating machine. Jaws is definitely one of the century's best movies a film to view many times for suspense lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm inclined to say that some of Steven Spielberg's best movies so far are "Schindler's List" (1993) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), this movie ranks up there just slightly. There are some flaws with the special effects. For example, you can tell the difference between the "live" and mechanical shark footage. The film does have some positive factors, such as screenplay, editing, score, and acting. Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss should have received a Best Supporting Actor nominations. John Williams' score is a masterpiece. There are some great "shock" sequences if your seeing the movie for the first time on the big screen. Hold onto your seats! score: 9 (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always loved this movie. I guess it is the the legendary musical score, Robert Shaw, Roy Schneider, and Richard Dreyfuss's unforgettable quotes and acting, and the thrilling shark attacks. However, nothing compares to the final assault against the boat. As Roy Schneider slings the rifle over his shoulder and climbs onto the mast of the sinking boat, nothing can tear me away from the screen.Many people complain that this movie is not scary. Well, it really isn't. What it is is exciting, thrilling, and very entertaining.Deep Blue Sea in no way compared to this movie. Deep Blue Sea is exceptionally entertaining, however, Jaws had a realistic plot (for a shark attack movie) good acting, direction, cinematagraphy, and music. Blue Sea had none of these.The ultimate shark movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twenty five years on... it's still thrilling movie making !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film I was around 13 years old and I went to see it along with a group of friends for my birthday. To say it made an impact, is an understatement !! Over a quarter of a century later, this well told tale of a community paralysed with fear, a ferocious great white shark and three very different men on a boat confronting their worst nightmare is still nail biting cinema. Jaws easily rank's as one of the most influential films of the seventies and one of Steven Spielberg's best works ever. The three male leads each play their roles brilliantly...Roy Scheider as the nervy, aquaphobic police chief of Amity....Richard Dreyfuss as the daring and off beat icthyologist drawn to the terrifying great white...and Robert Shaw in excellent form as the violent half mad, shark hunter Quint, teaching both Scheider and Dreyfuss how to be men....and leading them all into a life and death struggle with a more powerful and cunning adversary than he has ever encountered. What makes this movie so memorable is that it operates on so many different levels. It is a boy's own adventure story...it is a psychological thriller...it is a horror story about a unseen predator...it is about facing an unknown environment with terrible consequences. The tightly wound story, the crisp editing, the soundtrack, and even Bruce the mechanical shark plus the frenetic pacing of this movie add up to one of my favourite cinema thrill rides of the last 25 years. Can't wait to own this one on DVD !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still effective after 25 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid Jaws was the ultimate 'terror' film, the film my parents would not let me watch late at night, but also the one I most wanted to see. It had been a while since I had seen Jaws, but it seemed to be as terrifying as I remember. Of course there are shots where the shark looks a little fake, but the camera angles used in most of the attack scenes, or false alarms are excellent. It still is very creepy in some parts, very atmospheric - with the music, camera angles, pauses by the actors - it all comes together very nicely. The story is not too bad either, especially when we forget the 3 inferior sequels. Jaws is still the ultimate monster movie, even with films like lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea trying to reinvent the genre with comedy/horror, Jaws knocks them over anytime. The casting of Jaws was really very well done, and all three actors- Dreyfuss, Shaw, Schneider seem to have a great chemistry between them- although this is not really seen until over half way through the film when they board the Orca. With Jaws it doesn't seem that the attacks are what are most terrifying, its the buildup. Its when its very still and silent in the water, most definitely the calm before the storm. What is most impressive about Jaws is that it has aged very well. Even with the enormous advances in special effects, and computer generated imagery Jaws still seems to have some real power - heaps more effective than the sharks in Deep Blue Sea. Jaws has certainly stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often mimicked, never bettered!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you can watch every once in a while, even though you know what's coming up. After all these years, Jaws is still a great movie. It's put up with a critical backlash, but only because of parodied rubbish like Piranha, and more recently, Lake Placid.The overall film might appear less than the sum of its parts - that's due partly to the superb performances turned in by Shaw, Scheider and Dreyfus, and their interaction with each other. The other reason is that, despite the wisecracks about rubbery sharks, we don't really see the shark attacking that much; rather, the beauty of the film is about the presumptions we make and the fears we have about what's going on beneath the water, and what's out there in the deep.You should see this film again - bear in mind how old it is, how good it looks, (the locations on Martha's Vineyard are beautiful), and how you'll jump out of your skin in the 'head' scene! Jaws is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Because what this movie is, is one of the most suspenseful and thrilling movies ever filmed. The sparring use of the shark (which looks far more real than in the sequels and far better than any computer effect could have been) heightens the tension and allows for a wonderful repartee to develop amongst the three leading actors. Strong character development, deliberate pacing, Spielberg's creative eye, and John Williams' amazing musical score all intertwine beautifully and the result is a true film classic. Not to be missed!

Witness some of the more incidental touches, like the scene where Chief Brodys' son imitates his actions. The genius of this film is that touches like this are seamlessly interwoven with jaw dropping moments like the "we're going to need a bigger boat!" scene.And of course that reverse zoom dolly shot of Brody's face when he is sitting on the beach is alone worth buying the tape for!</fullReview>

Steven Spielberg is The Master. Since that time I've seen the film more times than I can count, and I know it intimately. Its been a childhood friend and undeniably one of the best adventure/horror films ever made. The casting of the three primary roles could not have been better, can you see anyone besides Scheider, Dreyfuss or Shaw in the lead roles, I think not.If you haven't seen it rush out right now and get a copy... Widescreen of course (anything less IS just that) Shot in 70mm the film still stands up against any film Hollywood can put out.Ignore the sequels stick to the one, the only,...

		<shortDescription>a classic film that never loses it's ability to thrill and shock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is perfect. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, and direction is top notch and the movie has not lost it's ability to thrill and shock the viewer. The legendary problems that the filmmakers had with the mechanical shark nicknamed "Bruce" meant that Spielberg had to find a way to film scenes without actually showing a shark. and this was the best decision since if the shark would have been visible the whole film, the extreme amounts of tension would have not been present.The mediocre sequels have done nothing to diminish this film's legendary status and is definitely one of my top ten films of all time. I honestly feel that Spielberg has never topped this film.rating:10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy about this movie for 25 years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember standing in line with my brother's waiting to see this movie. I was pretty nervous and really was dared, by my brother's, to see the movie. As I watched the people exiting the theater, I knew I had made a serious mistake. I just do not like to be scared. One of my brother's decided to buy a large tub of popcorn to pass around between us during the movie. Well when the music started, the popcorn began being passed. As the music increased the popcorn picked up speed. Just at the moment the shark gets the girl, my youngest brother is throwing popcorn at his mouth completely missing his mouth and hitting the people behind him. We were all laughing and he never realized until the guy behind him asked him to stop. So, if I live to be 100, I will always remember this movie. No before or since have I seen a movie, that scared me or entertained me more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favourite film of all time, perhaps not the best, but it is among the most complete. While owing a debt to Moby Dick for certain, this film combines sharp pacing, clever and intelligent dialogue, and is a text book for the man-versus-nature parable.

		<fullReview>This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. My math major brain has a strong distinction between fantasy and reality, so it takes a lot for a movie to scare me--so far, only three have. _Jaws_ is one of them (the other two are _The Shining_ and _Psycho_). Literally every single animal attack movie from 1976 on is at worst a rip-off or at best a remake of _Jaws_.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast/dialogue makes this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its concept may have revolutionized the way viewers thought about movies (or the beach). Its musical score is arguably the most memorable in movie history. And qualified kudos can even be given for its special effects.Nevertheless, the very best thing about Jaws is its character interaction.It is with a certain amount of chagrin that I must admit to having watched this movie literally several dozen times, but I should probably mention that the vast majority of those times were confined to watching the last half of the film--the ocean-going scenes with Brody, Hooper, and Quint that my friends and I affectionately refer to as "The Boat Scene." In my view, the beauty of Jaws is that the special effects of this film are easily overshadowed by the actors and their dialogue. It is difficult indeed (perhaps impossible) to think of another F/X-based movie where this is the case.So strong are the dialogue and character interaction of the final half of Jaws, that they rescue the film from a number of plot devices ranging from implausible (e.g., a 35' foot shark engaged in a high-speed boat chase) to the sublimely ridiculous (e.g., a 35' foot shark leaping atop a boat to capsize it). In my view, the F/X shark is literally a secondary consideration in this film. Sure, you couldn't have a shark film without it, but the shark alone cannot a good (or even passable) film make . . . as is amply demonstrated by the abysmal Jaws 3D and Jaws the Revenge, as well as by the truly mediocre Jaws II.It is perhaps worth admitting that the dialogue of the "Boat Scene" is not the only great character interaction in the film--it is simply the best. The acting in Jaws is generally pretty good, but nothing beats the "Boat Scene" and the actors who comprise it. Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are so good in this film that they clearly elevate Roy Scheider's performance. (If only Scheider's other films starred Shaw and Dreyfuss!)For the character interaction alone, Jaws is well worth watching, and it fully deserves its place among the AFI's top 100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is what movies are all about - exciting, thrilling, edge of the seat entertainment. I saw it for the first time the night it opened and have seen it many times since. Great characters - Quint, Brody and Hooper, electric action and brilliantly directed by Steve Spielberg who took a good book and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece. The crowd reaction at the theater on opening night only added to the experience - they screamed, laughed and cheered throughout the entire movie. And the ending (smile, you...) is one of the best ever. Clearly movie-making had been redefined forever. Jaws is an American classic. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tied with THE SHINING for my favorite film of all time, I first saw it when I was 4 years old and I have never been the same since. It scared the hell out of movie, and I liked it because of the incredible effects and attack scenes. Now, I appreciate it for different reasons. The effects are still top-notch and the movie still scares the hell out of me, but the character development is the main reason why I like this film so much. The interaction between Brody, Hooper, and Quint is truly special, and the monalouge about the USS Indianapolis is one of the most creepy experiences I've ever had. So, I reccomend this classic to anyone who likes movies. It started my obsession with sharks, and I'm sure it will spark an interest in you, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most perfect films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was ten years old and spent the rest of the summer petrified of even going near a pool . . .and yet I watched it over and over again. My favorite film, this movie symbolizes nearly everything that can be done with the medium of movies. It can make you laugh, and it can make you cry; it can make you stand up and cheer and it can make you crawl under your seat with fright. What Spielberg did with this film is majestic, and it was made all the better by the great performances of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and especially Rober Shaw (who was robbed of at least a nomination). The shots are magnificent, and the brilliantly ominous, yet often upbeat, score by John Williams is spectacular. One of the true masterpieces of cinema, it will forever be known as the first Summer Blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that can scare as many people for so long has definatley earned the place Jaws has in the vast sea of movies. I first saw this movie as a young child, and being an impressionable young child with mean older brothers, I was afraid of even tap water for months. In attempt to reduce my fear, my mother told me Jaws was the size of the swimming pool at the YMCA, and I have not swam there since. I appreciate the movie on an entirely different level now, but I am still in awe at it's pure genius. The fear that the shark induces will never fade in my eyes, I will never grow out of that. But I have learned to appreciate the characters, dialogue, and depth that Jaws offers. Rarely does an action film give you a chance to analyze the characters more in depth than face value, but the characters in Jaws are presented as complex, complete people. I can't wait to go watch it again.</fullReview>

I live in San Diego, where there is not a Great white shark problem. The problem is..this movie ruined swimming anywhere farther than a couple yards off shore for me! Think about it. What would be the worst ways to die? Suffocation? Burned? Crushed? Or drowning while a shark shreds you to pieces.. Its not too realistic but who in the hell cares? A definite classic even with the cheesy FX. Ask anyone who worked by the beach at that time.. The movie definately had an effect on people! A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely classic re-telling of the "Moby Dick" story by Spielberg. Ever notice that in this seminal "action" flick, the action STOPS for about 4 minutes for Quint's monologue. It's the key sequence in the movie, written to perfection and not an Oscar nomination in sight for Robert Shaw who created one of the most indelible images in motion pictures.This movie pretty much set the standard for all the crappy "shock" flicks that we've had to endure for the last couple of decades. Nothing since that even comes close. And don't bet the family farm on the upcoming "Deep Blue Sea". I've got a bad feeling that this new set of teeth is going to have a whole bunch of cavities, too.

My favorite parts were when Chief Brody (Roy Schieder) tells Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to tell a bunch of men who are going fishing to help get them out of the boat and if I remember right they said: Hooper-"Gentlemen, gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat" One of the men- "You ain't goin' man what do you care!" Hooper-"Ok well then can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island" One of the men- "Yeah, you walk straight ahead" Hooper-"He He He they're all gonna die" Yeah I liked that part and the part where Quint dies. This movie has GREAT shark music and it's awfully scary for a crowd of people to go swimming when there is a shark in the water. This movie will teach you to never go in the water again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's First........and Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, contrary to what people believe, this is not Spielberg's first film. That honor officially belongs to Duel, his first silver screen movie about a truck trying to run over a guy. After just finishing a biography of Steven Spielberg by John Baxter, I found one of the most interesting things to be all the problems of shooting this film. The shark, while not only looking terribly fake, also almost never worked in the water. For a fledgling director, this movie is remarkable. It's got just about everything: action, suspense, good acting, and a great storyline, thanks to Peter Benchley. I especially liked Robert Shaw as Quint, giving an almost flawless performance. Richard Dreyfus does a good job as the young, rich Hooper and Roy Schreider plays the movie's protagonist and all-around good guy Chief Brody well. My favorite part of the movie is the first half, contrary to popular opinion. It does a great job of setting the tone of Amity, and we can relate with the town's struggles. The last half is great too, however, and some of the best action scenes ever filmed are in it. This is a movie you should really see. I have no problems with it whatsoever, except it would have been nice to have more. Bravo to Spielberg for pulling it off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through the power of suggestion, Steven Spielberg made Jaws one of the best scare films ever. It's probably a good thing that the shark didn't work half the time, since in certain parts it doesn't look that convincing. Apart from that, what makes Jaws so much fun to watch over and over again is the amount of time that Spielberg invests with his three main characters. One of the best sequences is the second attack. Brody slowly starts moving toward the pond, but his panic increases and he explodes into a full run. Pushing this along is John Williams' score that will forever be implanted in your mind. The film reaches a palm sweating climax as the three shark hunters pursue, and get pursued by the shark. Great movie that spawned three inferior sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is a first class film and nearly everyone I know has the same thing to say about it..... it is brilliant. And they are right, the 3 main actors are brilliantly put together, and I can`t see anyone doing a better job than anyone in this movie.Robert Shaw was a very very talented actor, in the second James Bond Film "From Russia with Love".He played Red Dutch with frightening accuracy and he is still one of the most rememberable characters.But when ever I hear the name of Robert Shaw I think of Jaws.He played Quint the shark fisherman with a slight touch of manic.It was probably the best role he took up.I have heard that he made up the USS Indianapolis story.And I have heard that there might be a 25th anniversary for Jaws, and it will be a special edition like Star Wars.It was a tragic shame that Robert died of a heart attack in 1978, he was a great actor.Richard Dreyfuss played Matt Hooper the shark expert who had the job to convince Amity Island that they had a Great White Shark feeding off the bathers..Richard has starred in other memorable films as well such as Close Encounters of the third Kind.And Roy Schneider played the police chief. He would become the hero of the film and the sequel.And the real star of the film was the shark who was named "bruce" after Steven Spielbergs lawyer. This is the best film of the series and is the most rememberable film of all, people always say how fake the shark looks but cold they do better?I give this film a 9 out of 10 because of the great actors and story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE best movies are more than just a film - they are an experience. Just like watching Silence Of The Lambs, you are right there with Clarice Starling as she hunts the killer around his house, and in The Truman Show you are in there with Truman wondering what's going on and looking for a way out. In Jaws, this is achieved better than any other film. You really ARE on that boat with Quint, Brody and Hooper as the shark menaces them. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is superb, but it's the legendary boat sequences at the end of the movie that makes this head and shoulders above every other horror film (even Psycho and Silence of The Lambs). The shear thrill and fear you feel every time the shark comes near the boat is incredible, and when it throws itself on board and tips the entire ship up, with Brody and Quint metres away from that huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth...well, it makes you hang onto your chair with both hands. The unbearably tense climax ..it's incredible. Spielberg puts you inside the movie, and it's awesome. Odd to think the novel (which is superb, but not as thrilling) ends with the shark just dying inches away from the helpless Brody. ] The true mark of this movie is the impact it has had - all around the World, people still look at the ocean and keep a weary eye out for black, dorsal fins cutting through the water....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you are in a swimming pool or in the deep ocean frolicking in the water, be sure you have not recently watched "Jaws". The classic horror/suspense about a New England community terrorized by the fiercest creature that roams the ocean, the Great White Shark, changed the way that society looked at the playful and comforting atmosphere of the beach. Believe it or not, the audience does not even see the shark for the first 45 minutes or so of the film. Instead the use of a dorsal fin, barrels or a POV shot is used to determine the whereabouts of the shark throughout the film. Originally the movie was thought to be a bomb but with careful editing the film proved to be a success. Each actor was born for their part in th movie. A four star classic. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on telly when I was quite young, and from then on it gave me an obsession with Steven Spielberg and sharks. Since then my obsessive nature with anything to do with sharks has died down, but I still love Spielberg and his work. This film started the whole summer blockbuster and along with it started the whole hook thing where the first few minutes of a film leave you hooked and wanting to see more. Those first few minutes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding. I later found out it was so convincing, because Susan Backlinie who played the helpless victim Chrissie was being yanked too hard on her feet by the divers underneath and those were real grimaces of pain. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make a perfect trio and the film really starts to focus on these 3 characters and really starts to get thrilling as they leave land to kill the dreaded 25-footer. What follows is a fascinating portrayal of the 3 different ways these men handle what is before them. Roy Schneider's classic line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' has been ripped off time and time again most recently with Godzilla 'We're gonna neeed bigger guns' A classic chilling film masterpiece from beginning to end. This does for water, namely oceans but large swimming pools can have the same effect what Psycho did for motels and showers.

But for me it was succeed! Good film. Good suspense music and especially very good shark size. I haven't seen such a big shark of my life and that was what I liked the most in the movie. Apparently, Steven Spielberg is the most famous director of all time and he made many good movies!!! One of my favourite Steven Spielberg's films were Jurassic Park (with dinosaurs),Jaws,and perhaps some other ones (perhaps). Steven Spielberg is a genius.If you are under 16, you shouldn't see the film. Perhaps a little bit stupid of me,(I said PERHAPS)but I am fourteen and I saw the bloody scary movie. I saw it three times in total and I still like it! BE CAREFUL: it contains a lot of blood and like I said in the review:you are not obliged to see it if it scares you a lot. Actually I am not really sure, because, even if you are under-age for a certain kind of film, perhaps you could still watch it (if doesn't scarre you, of course) but I am really not sure.Don't ask me any more questions about it. I really recommend Jaws.If you are a fun of horror movies I could recommend you the Jaws film.(it was an Asperger review).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a gigantic great white shark begins to menace the small island of Amity, a police chief (Martin Brody), a marine (Matt Hooper), and a fisherman (Sam Quint) set out to stop it. The new police chief (Martin Brody) of Amity, an island resort town in New England. He has wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a summer morning, Brody was called to the beach, where a mangled body was found of summer vacationers Chrissie Watkins has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Brody wanted to close the beaches to swimmers. Mayor Larry Vaughn, who is desperate to not lose money that, will be brought in by the July 4th tourists. This doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The dead boy's mother put out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. This movie is my all time favorite shark movie. The movie has fantastic thrilling music, great actors, great setting, and a great director. The frightening and graphic attack scenes seem so surreal. The film is full of iconic shots, when you first see Quint you know about his character because of the way he announces his arrival into the room. Deep Blue Sea is another shark movie, but if you want to see a good shark movie I prefer you to watch Jaws. Truly or more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the level Jaws does. No other file so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling out our seats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws is the brilliant thriller that reinvented suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best thrillers ever made and possibly Spielberg's best, Jaws enthralled audiences in 1975 and has aged well. Jaws is about a shark, a man eating shark, a very simple topic, but it is perfectly executed. The shark itself is not shown until the very end (Spielberg intelligently uses the Hitchcock suspense technique there) and John Williams' brilliant score delivers all the scares. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss all play men heading into the waters outside of New England to catch the beast. It ranks up there with suspense thrillers such as The Exorcist and Psycho, a truly great use of suspense through music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 1975.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was never a great thriller like Jaws. Why is that? Because Jaws was legendary. It's suspense is surprising. Jaws is about a great white shark that terrorizes a summer resort in a small town called Amity. The police chief played by Roy Scheider, is determined to find out how to eliminate the shark after it's eaten one of the citizens of the town. Later in the film, a marine scientist, played by Richard Dreyfuss explains that the first victim in the movie, in the beginning of the film says that it wasn't no boating accident, it was a shark. Then, the Fourth of July comes up and the people of Amity are having a good time until the shark shows up. After the panic on the fourth of July, an grizzled fisherman, played Robert Shaw, plans to hunt the shark down and kill it. So, Dreyfuss, Scheider and Shaw team up to eliminate the shark. Director Steven Spielberg's has a great sort of suspense shots. Thought the shark is not seen the entire time, that is great because it is how Alfred Hitchcock directs suspense. It is what he calls playing with the audience like a piano. Jaws is one of the best films of 1975 and it's also one of my Top 10 best movies I seen. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Appreciation of Robert Shaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, it's been 36 years now since that summer when we were all afraid to go into the water, and what was new and suspenseful and amazing then is either a milestone or a clich, depending on who you listen to.I don't want to review the whole movie, because I don't think anyone needs a review of the whole movie. I just want to talk about one particular scene in the movie that, for me, lifted it above ordinary thriller material and put me in awe of what an actor can do.That's the scene when Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are on the boat "Orca," and they're all sitting around a table in the galley and they're slightly drunk. They start comparing scars, and Dreyfuss or Scheider, can't remember which, notices the tattoo that Shaw has. The one with the name "USS Indianapolis".When Shaw describes what happened to the men on the Indianapolis, what it was like, in that one scene, he makes the character of Sam Quint real, and completely understandable. Shaw makes the whole movie live and breath and crystalize in that one scene.I didn't get to see many movies when I was growing up, and when I went away to college I didn't have time or money to go to the movies. I didn't actually get to see Jaws when it first came out. But when I had time to see movies and could actually watch them on the VCR, this scene in "Jaws" was the first that actually left me in awe of what an actor could do, if he was good enough. If the material was good enough.After the movie was over, I couldn't wait to hunt up information on the USS Indianapolis and the events Shaw described. This wasn't as easy back then, around 1980, as it is now: there was no internet, so if you wanted to research something, you had to go to the library and try to find a book or magazine or archival newspaper stories. Well, I found a book about the Indianapolis and I was fascinated.I was awe-struck at the power Robert Shaw had to evoke the tragedy of the Indianapolis in that one scene. For me, that one scene made the whole movie. Shaw made me understand the character he played, and got through to make me feel the primal fear a shark can evoke.That's a powerful talent. And Shaw certainly was a powerful talent; I loved him in "The Sting" and in "A Man for All Seasons." But I think I saw him truly at his best in those magical moments of that one scene in "Jaws," when through his talent he broke through the gloss of fanciful entertainment and got right to the heart of terror, and in so doing lifted a summer suspense thriller above the ordinary into the extraordinary. I am thankful for Shaw and his art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What turned Mr Spielberg into one of the greatest directors of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before E.T,Raiders of the lost ark and Minority report comes Jaws...not only Steven Spielbergs first blockbuster but the very first blockbuster to have existed on this earth today...Some young viewers may be put off by how old this film is (its 36 years old this year... and the shark is not cgi) but for those of you who like modern Spielberg flicks (Indy 4,Minority report etc.) should give this a go. I'll promise you'll like it :) Jaws also won 3 Oscars for Best music,Best editing and Best sound... and was also nominated for Best picture.This is a movie that has tension that the sequels cannot possibly live up to...for the rest of the 70's Spielberg did mainly sci-fi blockbusters-and in the 80's,90's and 00's Spielberg balanced his blockbusters (Raiders of the lost ark,Jurassic park,Minority report etc.) with some more mature works (Schindler list,Saving private ryan,Munich etc.) so if you never seen any Spielberg films... i recommend you start here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first time i've seen jaws, and it blew me away! The acting was top notch, the action and special effects were grade A and it totally immersed me in the feeling of underwater horror. In my opinion the best scene by far is the shark cage scene, the realism of the shark was brilliant.The only reason I didn't give this marvellous piece of cinematography a ten was that some times the voice acting didn't hold up with the acting or the action.All in all this is definitely a brilliant film and a must have for fans of the thriller genre.

		<shortDescription>The Original Covered Everything You Could Want in a Killer Shark Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been perplexed why Hollywood thought they needed sequels to this great film. As far as I know, Peter Benchley who penned the original novel never wrote a sequel, and Spielberg declined to direct Jaws II. Of course the answer is the producers and executives believed they would make even more money off the Jaws franchise, particularly among those who just could not get enough of the original. But as an artistic statement, this movie really doesn't warrant sequels as it covers just about everything you could possibly do with the subject. Aside from the shark killings themselves, the characters and the audience actually learn a little bit about sharks, there are political "currents" regarding whether or not to close the beaches, forces more interested in profits than safety are exposed, and there is even the lynching of a poor tiger shark which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, i.e. he wasn't "the shark". I always felt sorry for the little innocent tiger shark.Two characters represent somewhat opposing views of the knowledge spectrum concerning their understanding of sharks: an expert scientist from the oceanographic society, Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfus, and a fisherman who makes his living catching sharks and other large sea animals, Quint played with convincing realism by the immortal Robert Shaw. Quint is not college-educated but he learned his trade through direct experience. Late in the film when Hooper and Quint are asked to sign on to a charter to kill the shark, their worlds collide. At interesting points, both characters misjudge the shark. Roy Scheider as Chief Brody, who used to defend innocent victims from mobsters in New York, finds his number-one most wanted man in Amity is not a human being but a shark. He ends up playing referee between Hooper and Quint. But as the last segment unfolds, we find Quint has some ulterior motives which may run contrary to killing the shark.The brilliant dramatic decision which pushed this movie into the realm of par excellence (rather than merely very good) is the delay in seeing the shark for nearly half the film. Despite the posters which show a young woman enjoying a care-free swim in the ocean with a large set of teeth propelling toward her from the depths like a menacing underwater rocket, the audience never actually experiences this scene as shown. Yes, the young swimmer is the first victim, but you never see her killer, sort of akin to a murder mystery in which you see and hear the victim's demise but you don't see the murderer. Certainly, the title of the film JAWS is a give-away as to the identity of the perpetrator, but the story begins as a kind of mystery, and almost immediately, the politics of the town begins to encroach on the decisions of Chief Brody who is mainly concerned with public safety. In one of the most memorable scenes, Brody and Hooper come upon the remains of the shark's destructive power without actually seeing the shark itself.This film was Steven Spielberg's big-time debut into the upper echelons of cinema. All kinds of interesting camera techniques are used to heighten dramatic and suspenseful effects. He even borrows a couple of trademark tricks from Hitchcock and Welles. The cast is A-list, although none of them were and ever have been big movie stars, but simply top tier actors doing what they do best. As the producers pointed out, the star of the film was the shark himself, so there was no need to put big name stars into the feature. If there is a standout in the acting department, I think it would have to go to Robert Shaw as Quint who is absolutely believable as the rough-and-ready harpooner, "sharker" and World War II veteran, a modern equivalent of Captain Ahab of Moby Dick fame. This is one of the all-time great action/suspense films, but don't waste your time on the ridiculous sequels. I think the original says all that needs to be said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old but Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved this film but watching the 2 hour documentary on how it was made recently on the Bio channel, it made me realise what an absolute triumph it was. Spielberg dragged this film up by the scruff of the neck and made this film a classic. It was dogged by technical issues, budget problems and a massive lack of support from the studio. The crux of the film's success lies in the camaraderie between the main characters, most of which were 2nd, 3rd or 4th choices. One of my favourite scenes is where Brodie is brought back to reality by his son imitating him at his dining table. Beautiful. That is why the vast majority of Spielberg's films are so successful because he makes the characters so believable and vulnerable and so we care about them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film classic one of my favorites. Well done suspense adventure and very memorable pulsating original score. Spielberg's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" a film that I've viewed many times over the years is one of my favorites, it's clearly one of the 70's best and probably one of cinemas all time best films ever made. As well before the days of special effects, CGI, and 3-D Spielberg did his best making this film with scenes of a mechanical shark. And the film is suspense filled as most scenes don't show the shark directly attacking the victims, yet it's often the things that are hidden and underneath that are the most terrifying like an underwater great white. And most memorable is the pulsating original theme score from the film, you've heard it many times as it just carries the suspense and drama of the film along so well.Based on Peter Benchley's novel(I must say a must read)"Jaws" is set in a New England northeastern island resort town of Amity. And all of a sudden unexpected bodies float ashore and deaths are reported. And the worst fears of the ocean have come to service a great white shark is responsible. So enter the town's sheriff stressed out Chief Brody(wonderfully played by Roy Scheider)and upon his assumptions and investigations he's meet with resistance and protest from the town mayor Mr. yes man and the politically corrupt Mayor Vaughn(well done by Murray Hamilton)as it's better to lie about shark attacks to the citizens for fear of losing money as people will not want to vacation in Amity if reports of shark attacks are true. Brody does the best to cope with it with support from wife Ellen(Lorraine Gary).Still matters need to be taken further so enter two problem solver helpers one in the form of Sam Quint(Robert Shaw)a weathered and crazy odd ball shark hunter who's methods are unorthodox and then to complete the twosome it's young hotshot educated marine scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss). And along the way this film turns into a suspenseful adventure of shark hunting that's helped by the wonderful and pulsating score it just keeps you on the edge of your seat, as in the end your happy to be served a big great white lunch with the death of Jaws! Overall a film classic one of the 70's better pictures and one of cinemas better suspense thrillers. Well remembered for it's strong and pulsating score which moved the drama and suspense of the film along so well. And the way the scenes were shot Spielberg made many of them hidden and suspenseful by doing them underwater proving what you can't see is most often the most dangerous just like the opening sequence of Chrissy's death. And the way that Steven shot the film even though tough and difficult by filming water scenes and moving the camera a lot on boat was well done and his working of the mechanical shark takes a big bite out of today's special effects and CGI and 3-D works. Really probably Steven Spielberg's best. "Jaws" is a very memorable cinema classic, one of the all time best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jaws' was and still is highly successful as a film and critically. It continues to be the first and ultimate Summer blockbuster.More recent but similar films are much more violent and gory. But still, 'Jaws' was quite a shocker at the time and even now it still is shocking. With this film, Steven Spielberg broke new ground in 1975 just like Alfred Hitchcock did with 'The Birds' in 1963.Unlike more recent sharks's films, this one is solid in its story and as a film. Also, the shark isn't that much seen, being more of an unseen assassin that is slowly introduced. This may be blamed to the reliability problems that plagued the mechanical sharks, which limited the role and made this a challenge to make. But it was worth it because that makes the shark more mysterious and also contributes to make this film the long-lasting legacy it is. Another reason is because the shark looks a little rubbery although it doesn't look too phony and still looks intimidating and petrifying.The director did the right choices for the cast. Roy Scheider is very convincing as the police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss is a comic relief as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw was one of those "old school" actors who, more than portraying the characters, seem to become them. All of this thanks to his performance as Quint, a character who is cocky, arrogant, crazy, rude, cynical, more stubborn than a mule and pirate-like yet hilarious at the same time. Murray Hamilton plays well the Mayor Larry Vaughn, a character who, in the name of the town's interest, ends up doing the opposite: a series of poor decisions. Even the actors who have minor roles were finger-selected.Cinematography is great. Amity Island looks very appealing and inviting and it has that wonderful golden sand beach. Reminds me Porto Santo island.This fascinating film is rich in suspense and horror element and can even count with a creepy soundtrack (the power and the magic that comes from the maestro John Williams). This soundtrack has that quality of mystery and horror. Sends chills down the spine and this sensation gets bigger just imagining that the shark is coming through.All of the deaths are shocking. Each death is as shocking as the other one/s. They are brilliantly made and directed. The death of Chrissie Watkins is terrifying and so are her screams. Alex Kintner's death is one of those that affect me most and you can hear him screaming either. It hurts more to see a child dying so horribly than an adult. The scene when deceased Ben Gardner shows up is sudden and scary. The guy who loses his leg... another shocking one. And Quint's death is the goriest and the one you see closer. Plus, to see the shark tearing him apart and the pain he cries out can make most people freeze. There are also two implied deaths (of two dogs) which are unseen, therefore uncertain.Where this film leaves a little to be desired is in details such as the fact that the 2nd half focus a little too much on the attempt to hunt the shark and a particular use of a long take (the bit when Quint tells his USS Indianapolis story - but fortunately that is nothing compared to the excessive long takes of 'Before Sunset'!) Nevertheless, they could have done, for example, scenes with Brody's wife and kids (and show Michael recovering from the shock he had and returning home) and show Brody returning home to announce that he killed the shark and his wife and kids congratulating him and hugging him at the ending.Now, these are just flaws, but this film is great. A cinematic benchmark. I believe it caused people the fear of going in the water at the time but I am also pretty sure that doesn't happen nowadays and ever since many years ago.Title in Portugal: 'O Tubar?o'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic shark attack flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie put me on the edge of my seat while I was watching it, before there was Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, Jurassic Park, Minority Report, War of the Worlds, Indiana Jones, etc. There was Jaws, a classic killer shark movie with everything with it. Its based on the novel by Peter Benchley.It stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gray, etc.Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is the new police chief of Amity, an island resort town somewhere in New England. He has a wife named Ellen, and two sons named Michael and Sean. On a Summer morning, Brody is called to the beach, where the mangled body of Summer vacationer Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) has washed ashore. The medical examiner tells Brody that it could have been a shark that killed Watkins. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who is desperate to not lose the money that will be brought in by 4th of July tourists, wants Brody to say Watkins's death was caused by a motorboat propeller instead of a shark, because the thought of a shark in Amity's waters would drive tourists away from Amity. It looks like Vaughn is a mayor who puts money ahead of people's lives. Shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) believes Watkins was killed by a shark. Hooper is proved right a few days later, when Alex Kintner is killed by the shark that killed Watkins. Looking for the quickest solution, Vaughn tells all of the local fishermen to let him know if they see the shark. A shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to find the shark and kill it, but Vaughn thinks Quint's price of $10,000 is too high. When a tiger shark is killed and hauled in by a couple of boaters, Vaughn hastily says that the shark crisis is over, but Hooper says the shark that's been killing people a huge great white shark is still in Amity's waters, but Vaughn leaves the beaches opened because all he cares about is the 4th of July tourist money. On the 4th of July, Vaughn encourages people to swim at the beach, and Hooper is proved right again when the shark kills a man, biting the man's leg off. Michael, who was in the water at the time of the attack, is taken to the hospital, where he's treated for shock after watching the shark kill the guy. Brody asks Vaughn to hire Quint to find the shark. Because his own kids were at that beach too, Vaughn agrees to hire Quint to find the shark. Quint, Hooper, and Brody are sent out to sea in Quint's boat, the Orca, ready to do whatever it takes to find the shark.Nothing beats the original Jaws with the sequels that came out.John Williams musical score was fantastic, he also did the music for Star Wars, ET, Jurassic Park, etc.Overall, this movie is just another movie you should see.Jaws gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg the master of audience manipulation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Jaws for the first time in about ten years I can honestly say that I forgot what a fantastic film it is and that modern days films should look at this as a guide to how to make a film.This film is near perfection in everything, the acting is good (not great but believable), there is a mix of nearly every genre in the script and narrative and there are some shots that have become iconic in film history, the special effects on the Shark are also awesome; better than some of the CGI in modern films.From the very start when the girl is eaten late at night Spielberg knows exactly how he wants the audience to feel and with a beautiful score from John Williams and a some good camera work and editing he pulls it off perfectly, in a way only Spielberg can... I've noticed this is many of his films but it is most obvious in this. Spielberg can turn an audience from crying with laughter to jittering with fear in a matter of seconds and that it why this film must be admired.I normally try to come up with some sort or criticism for a film no matter how good when writing a review, but I honestly cannot think of anything except that it didn't win more Oscars, although if I'm correct it was up against One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest another fantastic film that stole all the awards.Jaws is a perfect thriller, action, comedy, horror, romance film in which you surrender you emotions completely to Spielberg and can lose yourself for two hours of pure enjoyment.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing how this movie has held up against time. Roy Schieder is at the top of his game as the beligured cop on an Island. Richard Dreyfuss gives, in my opinion, one of his best performances as the eager sharkoligist Hooper. Robert Shaw, is nothing short of mezmorizing as the salty old shark hunter Quint. As for the Shark....Well, I must say that it is a credit to Steven Spielbergs genius that he wisely choose to save showing the shark until the last act of the movie. Its really the "Lack of what we see" that is the most terrifying. John Williams score will be forever seared into our memories whenever we think of something ominously stalking in the ocean. I never grow tired of this movie and strongly recommend it to future generations. The effects may not have CGI, but "Jaws" proves that what we don't see is far more spooky than what we do see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, I don't know where to start! Jaws is one of my favorite movies ever. It's also the first shark movie I saw. At the time, I was terrified of the scenes. Then again I was only 13 years old or so...Enough childhood memories, let's talk about the movie itself. It's a story about a great white shark, killing people just of the coast of a summer tourist town. The 4th of July is drawing near, and the mayor is reluctant of closing down the beach, because they need the summer tourist's cash to keep the town alive, so to speak. But is that really an option with a killer shark in the waters? The Sheriff (Brody) is insisting on closing down the beach, but no one listens to him. He then calls in an expert (Hooper) who examines the dead body of a woman and confirms that it was a shark attack. But even then, the mayor stays put and the beach remains open.The story is excellent and well-written. It moves at a steady pace and delivers everything: suspense, humor, drama, shocks, good dialog and some gore.The music! Let's not forget the AWESOME music written by John Williams. After 30+ years, the Jaws theme is still a classic tune and just about everyone knows it.Steven Spielburg handled this movie with great care. No real sharks are used in this movie, yet the way the scenes are filmed truly gives you chills. In particular, the opening scene (with poor Chrissie) is a scene that has been burned into my brain for the rest of my life.What else? ... The acting is amazing. A very solid cast and no 'dumb' dialog. You are really going to love and hate some characters.Then there's the shark. Like I said, it's not a real one, but that doesn't mean it stinks. On the contrary, Bruce (the sharks nickname apparently) prevented me from going swimming in the ocean for years! Jaws is perhaps the best shark movie in history. Using CGI nowadays to bring monster sharks and such to the screen just isn't the same as clever directing and filming.A true classic. I give Jaws 9 out of 10 stars!

		<fullReview>I have been too the cinema a lot in my day, "JAWS" in my opinion was the best ever film too sit through with unintentional audience participation and worth the money alone for that, the screaming and gasp I heard from the audience is something I have never ever experienced again in any other film I saw at the cinemas.The lining up around the block just too get into see the film all added to the tension, it sometimes took 4-5 hours to get in, (I kid you not.) You had too be their early in fact the queue was so long more often than not had to wait for 2 sittings before it was anywhere near your time to get in.The banter outside was good whilst you were waiting to get in, people whispering too others how many times they had seen it and telling those willing too listen how horrific it all is. Those who had'nt seen it where craning the necks too try listen into other peoples conversations about what they were about too witness, after all it had been all over the media and the first summer blockbuster I believe.Others had bought their flask, radio so we were entertained with disco music every now and again, cars were going passed honking at us and gaping at the long queue and pointing, some kids in the queue were wanting the toilet whilst the adults insisted they hang on for fear of loosing there place.lol.Every now and then a man would walk up and down,(Usher.)wearing a burgundy hat on and gloves all very posh counting and pointing with his finger to those that were in the queue silently to himself, he never ever said anything which added to the mystery.(I was only young.)Their were people fainting mainly old ladies wearing hats it was a hot summer old ladies still wore hats in those days, well the ones in Manchester did. There were also people that appeared to faint and then somehow managing to make there way stumbling and staggering towards the front of the queue head in hand then making a miraculous recovery. (How people appeared to get better once nearer to the front of the queue I shall never know.) And still remains a mystery. lol.A few youngsters selling badges with JAWS on would saunter up and down the line "get your JAWS badges 25p" followed swiftly by the souvenir Brochure sellers all eager to sell there wares, cinema goers were eager to buy the Brochure eager to get a glimpse of the shark,those that couldn't afford the Brochure asked others if they could share looking at the pictures with you over your shoulder, most were happy too oblige.Once in the Cinema the lights are dimmed the music starts, (you could hear a pin drop, and we had all built ourselves up.)instantly and menacingly your thrown under water, (choking for air,)brushing passed sea plants,(I thought if that shark pops up now I will surely die.)I have never seen the sea so big and powerful like this on the screen,so green and blue, dark yet clear, rushing through seaweeds and plants I thought we were going to bump into he shark, then we're back on land,(phew! big sigh of relief from the audience a few nervous giggles here and there.) Then a soothing sounding mouth organ starts playing, everyone is sitting around the camp fire nice and cosy drinking and relaxing.The first scene of Chrissie running up the sand hill "Where you going?" "Swimming" then Chrissie shouts "come on into the water" (More shuffling of feet and general nervousness from the audience,a few "Oh no's" and peeking through fingers you could feel the dread in the air.) Back too the film where we see Chrissie's drunken boy friend she just met trying too take his boots off and falling down in the process saying, "I can swim, I just cant walk" (The audience erupted in laughter,Then were all thrown back into that menacing sea.) too see Chrissie splashing around, then out of nowhere the music plays up, Chrissies naked body is seen in silhouette, ) the music we were all dreading and had all heard about on the News and on the Radio, I thought, Oh my god here we go its here! it was and the rest is history as they say and I held my breath.I enjoyed it so much I went too see it 16 times I loved the audience participation inside and outside of the cinema I couldn't help it. It has to be seen on the big screen for full effect as I did at the ABC Deansgate Manchester England in 1975.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think on of Spielberg's top three greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is one of the best Spielberg films of all time and definitely one of the best of any film. Everything from the opening title sequence to the credits is non-stop brilliance, the acting for one is immense, Shieder's Brody is edgy and paranoid but endearing and charismatic.The film is full of iconic shots, i mean when you first see Quint you know about his character because of the way he announces his arrival into the room, fingernails down the blackboard that is a genius shot (hope that isn't classed as a spoiler).The film has that classic air to it that makes you know that i will still be iconic in 10 years time. It shares the same qualities of Halloween (1978,John Carpenter) it has that same nostalgic terror that Micheal Myers produces. An all round hit from Spielberg.Hope you enjoy it if you see it, I certainly did. =]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt the best Shark movie ever. I'd say it's even the best monster movie ever. Being born 13 years after it came out, I wasn't aware of the amazing impact the movie had in the seventies. But after seeing it, I can imagine what the impact was. I remember watching it when I was 8. BIG MISTAKE!!! I was probably thinking it was some monster from a Disney movie or something. That movie scared the living ***p out of me. I'll admit that I still can't swim in water were you can't see the bottom. The price I had to pay for watching it as a kid. Oh well, I wasn't a avid fan of the ocean anyways.But I bought the movie some years ago and as a teen I enjoyed it thoroughly. Fantastic thrilling music, great actors, great setting and off course a great director. Deep Blue Sea is an okay movie, but if you want to see a good shark movie, watch Jaws, don't think, just watch Jaws. Trash such as Shark Attack, Megalodon and all that other junk is absolutely a waste of time. And to join the discussion about sequels, Jaws 2 is okay, but don't watch the rest, it's kind of silly. Anyway, this movie...WOW!!!9 out of 10</fullReview>

The suspense and tension bar is raised so high, it's phenomenal.The acting is great all around. Not a stale person in the bunch.Haunting and gorgeous music by John Williams.Wonderful screenplay, and Steven Spielberg's direction is flawless.One of the rare films that can make you fear going back into the water. After seeing this on a rainy day at the beach when I was seven-years-old, it ruined my vacation.Overall, with some great acting, down to the very realistic shark, Jaws will scare the living daylights out of you, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could even dip a toe in the water without thinking of Jaws? This movie will endure generations of action/suspense movies no matter how advanced the special effects, and the film is still talked about on beaches by people of all ages. I still get chills when Quint relates the story of being surrounded by sharks and his buddies being taken, one by one, explaining his hatred of sharks. I've watched many scenes over and over and they just get better. There is a scene they cut out that I loved too where Quint torments a kid playing the clarinet. Buy the Anniversary edition and watch some of the features that had to be cut; there's some good stuff there. I watch this DVD at least once every three months.</fullReview>

Just look at the facts to support this claim: 1) box office smash 2) quotable 3) long enough movie to develop into something special 4) interesting characters 5) memorable sounds 6) good enough to have several sequels 7) countless marketing schemes from amusement park rides to video games 8) based slightly on historical event (smaller shark with less graphic attacks) 9) changed people's perception of the ocean 10) led to other similar, yet less effective, animal thriller movies.

		<shortDescription>Jaws still lurks in the waters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the mother of all shark movies. Still standing the test of time since it was made, Jaws is a solid gold classic. I have had this on video and DVD many times now, but every time i see it on TV I always end up watching it. It is a film that has universal appeal (no pun intended). By now everyone should know the story a killer Great White Shark is chowing down on the small town inhabitants of the peaceful Amity and the Police Chief Martin Brody must find a way to stop it. Right from those terrifying (Spielberg found the tune silly when John Williams played it for him, later it would become the theme that would strike fear into film-goers hearts and still do to this day) opening scenes with THAT music immediately instills the fear into you. To tell the truth i have never been swimming in any sea since i saw this movie, purely because like its depicted in this film, you don't know whats under you. This is a gem of a film as it still has the power that it had many years ago and still terrifies the new generation. Spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the magic of Benchley's novel. A lot of people slag off the ending even benchley didn't like the way that Spielberg scripted the shark dying. I say think about this without that scene Scheider would never have had the opportunity to say that great line "smile you son of a....." If you haven't seen Jaws then where the hell have you been, you have missed a great film. The shark breaking down during the film was great because then Spielberg gave us the POV of the shark as it's about to attack. If he had of had the shark to begin with it probably would have never worked, thank god he didn't. There's something about the view of the shark that more scary than seeing the shark. Maybe it's cause you know it's going to kill someone, or it could be the fact that Spielberg makes the audience think that for brief moments WE are the shark. The film should have got an Oscar for not only Editing (which it did) but for Roy Scheider for best actor, Richard Dreyfuss as Supporting Actor and Spielberg as best Director because it deserves it. When you do finally see Jaws, you do jump and if the shark had been seen earlier, i believe that, the scene on the boat would have lost it's shock value. All in all Jaws boasts some great performances from all the key players and yes even to "Bruce". This is also the only Jaws film where the shark was believable and not rubber looking like the sequels. I'm not so sure that it would still work if a CGI was integrated into the film or if they do a remake, the power is behind the eyes and thats exactly where i should stay."I think you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bite you on the ass"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original summer horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was always a great movie to me. I always see it on TV and I watch it every time I see it. This is one of those movies you cannot go without seeing at least once in your life, or even once a year. No matter how many times you watch it, it always has you on the edge of your seat. I remember being scared of going in the water for a week or 2 every time I watched this in the summer. It still give me chills every now and then. One reason could be that it was based off the book "Close to Shore" which was about a real series of shark attacks on the South Jersey Shore...which is where I live! This movie had a huge impact on me for the reason that the town of Amity is much like where I live and could very well be attacked by a shark. Well...aside from the solid story, we have an excellent cast. Roy Sheider plays the unforgettable, smart, paranoid Chief Martin Brody, who serves as a very good protagonist here. Robert Shaw plays a very grizzly, creepy Quint; who besides the shark, seems to be the Antagonist here. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very know-it-all, smart Hooper. The other actors were all great as well, not one can be replaced it seems. This movie deserves its place on the top 250. 10/10 Seems like a good score.</fullReview>

MY personal favourite movie of all time and it was released on the year i was born in 1975. Sad to hear that Roy Scheider has died - he is Chief Martin Brody! Legend! R.I.P. to Roy and also Robert Shaw and Peter Benchley for giving me my all time favourite and truly one of it's kind- JAWS ! 10 outta 10! " You're gonna need a bigger boat!" - what a line! I've gotta add a couple lines in order to submit my comments on Jaws so i have to say that seeing Ben Gardner's head pop out the bottom of the boat was truly terrifying to a 5 year old when i watched it then and nothing has topped that since! Thank You Steven Spielberg and big up to Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton for being part of it all. Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lurking fear...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pop quiz hotshot: Your enjoying a day at the beach swimming on your yellow inflatable raft when sudden a movie theme starts playing in your head... tuntun tuntun tuntun... What do you do?Get the hell out of the water, most likely."Jaws" is one of those "simple" horror movies. Not simple on a technical level, the production had notorious difficulties with that. Not simple on anyone part of itself, but rather simple at what it probes: the fear of being attacked by something bigger, stronger that wants to kill you. That manages to cover both psychological (hopelessness) and visceral (mutilation) aspects of human fear. The result of this KISSing (Keeping It Simple/Scary) is pretty darn effective. The famous music has become synonymous with fear and has been used a multitude of times (including 3 increasingly bad sequels) and the word "Jaws" made quite a career in the English language as a result. Maybe in a thousand years, when archaeologists discover a copy of a "Jaws" DVD they'll determine that "jaws" was our word for that big fish, when in fact we call it a "shark."Take the opening scene. It is very simple in premise: a girl goes swimming and is first nipped by something, then thrashed around before being finally pulled underwater leaving the sound a buoy. We see no shark, no fin, no jaws (&lt;-- get it?) or anything for that matter. If we saw the sharks or it's jaws (I'll stop with the puns, promise) then it would be clear that the film would be trying to show us that shark and how vicious it is. When, in fact, the scene shows what I had described earlier: the fear of being attack by something bigger and stronger. What it is doesn't really matter. What does matter is that the scene taps right into that fear and carries it through the movie. Progressively we see more and more of the sharks... fins, the mouth (I told you that I wouldn't say 'jaws') and finally the entire shape of the thing, but it is only when the men hunting it see it too.Overall, this is one of not very many truly effective scary movies, because it doesn't just strive for shock, but also for a much needed element of being down to Earth. And it succeeds. --- 9/10Rated PG for terror/violence and gore. Ages 13+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is one of those films that i have seen multiple times throughout my life, and unlike many other things it just seems to get better with age the most important thing about the movie are the central characters.. Brody, Quint and Hooper. the three characters are very different to each other (slightly hippie academic rich kid, hard as nails working fisherman, and kinda edgy/disillusioned police/everyman) but they are brought together by a common goal. and the scene where they all get drunk and exchange shark stories is just brilliant. Shaw's recollection of events on the U.S.S Indianapolis is one of my favourite scenes in any movie, and he acts it brilliantly Brody, the cop that tried to get an easy life is fabulous as well, and he, Quint and Hooper share an entertaining rapport throughout.all of this, and the shark hasn't even gotten mention yet! i try to forget about the shark actually as this film made me afraid of the water as a child. and even though i've faced my fear since, I'm still scared witless of big sharks and this film is the reason!!! in actual fact the shark isn't a big deal and the parts where it starts leaping out of the water are less effective compared to what you don't see earlier on. and i'm certain that the shark scenes in this movie are small fry anyway by todays horror standards the movie uses a lot of real world footage so it captures a really nice authentic essence of the 70's. and the part where Brody flicks through the book on actual shark attacks brings the movie into the real world the sound in the movie is of course very memorable, and the jaws theme straddles the line between music and sound in an interesting way. also very nice underwater sound mixed abruptly with 'normal' sound as the camera breaks the surface of the water. i love that sound at the very start of the movie also just before the tune starts, which i think is a pod of whales or something like that. very cool anywayi'm not sure that the new generation would enjoy this movie so much for thrills, but for me this is a 100% classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: An overwhelming and unforgettable classic. (This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)Did Steven Spielberg with his unforgettable classic JAWS invent the term "blockbuster"? Perhaps not entirely, but here's to be sure: The redefined it. Packed theaters and satisfied audiences proved that JAWS was the ultimate blockbuster. There first of its kind (and by the looks of it, it sure isn't the last).During the heyday of the horror genre during the 70's, there seems to be only one that were above the others. One, were even today, it's still can be remembered by beach-goers who saw it in the theaters during its release. Yes, you've heard it before. "Duh-duh-duh-duh....". Upon hearing that theme, you now what your in for.Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss give excellent performances in this classic. Director Steven Spielberg, very young at this time, did his best in directing. And the script is well written, it was like it was straight out of Peter Benchley's novel, which it was based on.This movie is a terrific scare machine for its day, lots of memorable bits and even scary until now if you keep it up your head a lot. Way, way better than the films which tried to duplicate it (not to mention a nice try first sequel, a campy 2nd sequel and a totally awful closure). Is JAWS still the blockbuster to beat? Well, if you judge a blockbuster by gripping suspense, sustaining thrills and a generally unseen shark, then it is. Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is how much this movie plays with your head. I know, there is very little chance of being attacked by a shark, but that one or two or however much percent chance of that happening was enough to convince me to stay out of the water after seeing this movie. Let's face it, folks, "Bruce" or "The Great White Turd" as Steven Spielberg himself affectionately called him (and that's what it looked like when Brody shot him and he sank to the bottom of the ocean) made King Kong, Godzilla, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man et al look like wimps. Some of the macabre humor in this movie made you feel uneasy while you were laughing, eg., Mayor Vaughn's line "I'm not going to have all these people standing around here while you do some half-assed autopsy on a fish." As good as this movie, and the book is, I can't help thinking that this story is a rip-off of MOBY DICK, with Captain Quint being the Captain Ahab character with his obsession with capturing the shark, and in the ugly manner in which he died. Also, at least in the book, Chief Brody was the sole surviving Ishmael character (in the book, Matt Hooper gets eaten alive while he is in that shark cage). Also, great white whale vs. great white shark. A lot of parallels.This movie does keep you on the edge of your seat. And this is the soundtrack that put John Williams on the map. Before, he was the man behind TV shows THE TIME TUNNEL and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND. He also did those Irwin Allen disaster movies EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Now, he is probably the greatest living composer (along with Ennio Morricone). The thing about this soundtrack is, when you listen to it by itself, you don't have to watch the movie to know what is going on. It is so vivid, you can picture in your mind's eye exactly what is happening on the screen. Great horror thriller and soundtrack. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it is well over 30 years old now, the original Jaws is quite simply still one of the best movies ever made! I recently purchased a new home cinema setup, and decided that repeat viewing was long overdue.From the moment John Williams score blasted over the opening credits I knew I was in for a good night. Jaws has it all. Great acting (all round, although I personally think Roy Scheider deserves a special mention!), tight direction, and even though the special effects weren't great, it just adds to the mystique of the film.There have been rumours of a George Lucas style special edition, if that's the case I've got three words for Steven Spielberg.

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws tells the story of New York cop Martin Brody, who has moved to a small summer tourist island to become the chief of police. His job is relatively easy until a large Great White Shark begins using the beach for a buffet on the 4th of July weekend. Brody joins forces with an oceanographer and a crazed sea captain with a vendetta against sharks to kill the creature once and for all. With its great acting, superb direction and intelligent dialogue, Jaws is truly one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.Peter Benchley's chilling novel was an instant best seller, so it was only a matter of time before someone attempted to make it a movie. Thank God it was Steven Spielberg. At the time this film was made, Spielberg was still relatively unknown except for a few TV projects including the cat and mouse thriller Duel. Steven Spielberg brought his genius directing style and mixed it with the words of Benchley's great novel to make the first ever summer blockbuster. What I like most about this film is that it's not really a horror, and it's not really an action. There's actually a story to it. The intelligent dialogue makes the movie interesting to watch because of its blend of humour, fear, and desperation. Of course, there are two other main things that add to the effect of this movie. The first is the chilling score by John Williams. You don't even have to see the movie to know where it's from. The second is the fact that you don't really see the shark until the end. The tension just keeps building.Obviously, a lot of the success has to be credited to the great actors involved in this movie. Roy Scheider is great as Martin Brody who is determined to kill the shark yet has a great fear of the water. Robert Shaw is beyond perfect as Quint, the Ahab-like captain who will stop at nothing to destroy the shark, even if it means his death and the death of those around him. Richard Dreyfuss is always good to me, but especially so here. His constant bickering with Quint makes for some awesome comic relief.Overall, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films out there. It takes itself seriously yet it's still a popcorn flick. I recommend this movie to everyone.9/10</fullReview>

When I see the fin surfacing the water I immediately get goosebumps. While watching Jaws you immediately get into it. You just want to scream get out of the water!!! The music by John Williams is great. When you hear the music you immediately know who's coming. I believe the first movie is always the best. And Jaws proves my theory. The other 3 remakes are not nearly as good as the original. Once I saw Jaws every other shark movie didn't even look good enough to rent. So if you want to watch a shark movie try this classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is, hands down, my favorite movie of all time. The reason for this is simple, I own Jaws, I have seen Jaws about 100 times, and still Jaws is the only movie that no matter how many times I see it; it still makes me feel the same as the first time I saw it. The directing and acting, in particular Robert Shaw, are flawless. I would argue that no movie has ever had the immediate horrific impact on a viewing public as much as Jaws. The film spurned a shark kill that has never, thank God, been duplicated. It was banned from sea-side communities on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of America. This movie made you afraid of something you did last summer. (no pun!) The chemistry that the cast had is something that I have never seen recreated. The whole Community of Amity, even the background players, flowed so natural I would believe Amity was a town I had visited as a child. If you have never seen this gem get on it now. 100 years from Jaws will still be a vital part of American cinema despite how many new movies may be "more popular". Jaws is forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the tender age of five, my loving father took me too see this movie. It is now 30 years later, and I still will not go into the ocean more than ankle deep. And, every time I am flipping channels, and I see that Jaws is playing, I watch it. Sometimes I pull out the DVD and watch it. My son and I have been known to watch it, watch the special features and the documentary, and then watch it again all in one afternoon. Why do I do this? Because this is simply the best film I have ever seen.This film has everything! Drama, comedy, horror, romance, touching family scenes, interesting scientific facts and statistics, a moving tribute too a historic event, special effects, a spine-tingling soundtrack, you name it, it's in there. And even though the film was made in the 70's, the story is still current. The movie grabs you right at the beginning, and plays so smoothly throughout that you don't really notice the funky, out-of-date clothing. You are too caught up in the story and the characters to care about the dated hairstyles the actresses are sporting. All you care about, is whether or not they can kill the shark before it kills them. And when it's all over, even if it's thirty years later, you are still afraid to go in the water.</fullReview>

It did not do that to me at first watch...but then I thought...this is like the 70's this had to be the freaking scariest movie ever to hit theaters at that time. So I gave it a second look, and it was the greatest movie ever. Amazing plot, it was the birth of three amazing actors, amazing characters, and very much suspense. This was the best movie that I have ever seen. I hope the book is as good. This was a great movie....I cant think of anything else to say.. just see it and be amazed. **************** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great white shark haunts a small town and it's up to three men to stop it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is the film that keeps on giving and giving. Still, after 30 something years, we are still afraid to go in the water. The most known music of all time, the most boot-legged shark of all time, and you got a classic film that scares you to death. The movie starts with a bang, with the shark killing a young teen. The movies goes on from there. Chief Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint are people that you meet along the way. Jaws continues to scare people and it hasn't gotten old. Jaws is a type of movie that you can watch thousands of times and never get tired of it. Along with a great ending,Jaws just tackles the relationship of the shark vs man. It's nothing like the book. So, if your a fan of the book, don't get mad. But, if you want a scare, Jaws is the film. You'll think twice before you go in the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking a bite out of Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws was directed by Steven Spielberg. The first asst. director was Tom Joyner and the second asst. director was Barbara Bass. Police Chief Martin Brody was played by Roy Scheider, Quint by Robert Shaw and Matt Hooper played by Richard Dreyfuss. Ellen Brody was acted by Lorraine Gary and Mayor Larry Vaughn by Murray Hamilton. Original music by John WilliamA beastly great white shark terrorizes a small resort town during a most profitable Fourth of July vacation, and when Police chief Martin Brody proposes shutting down the beaches, the mayor and city council starkly refuse because of profit decreases. As the shark makes his deadly threats (and lunch) a crusty old sea dog named Quint comes along and offers to kill the shark. City council and mayor Larry Vaughn decline and instead bring in Matt Hooper, a marine biologist and shark buff who quickly proves wrong the committee whenever they try to cover up the slaughter. Finally, when a group of boys (including the mayor's son) then comes within the stinking breath of death and chum, the mayor gives in and pays Quint, Martin and Hooper to hunt out and finally destroy the ravenous beast. But do they make it?As a master of suggestive art, Spielberg used this ability to make Jaws into one of the most memorable films in movie history. With an excellent original music score, he turns an entirely stupid looking foam shark into a beast of terror. To aid the horror of how vicious this chunk of foam is, he also adds great emotion to the faces of characters such as in the autopsy scene where Hooper was observing what was left of the first victim. Though you never see the remains of the victim, his face contortions into many disturbed expressions, and a gallon of sweat dribbiting down his forehead clearly state that this shark is the Beelzebub of all sharks. He uses this technique throughout the whole film, and he never shows until the climax the dreaded foam shark.The film's overall idea is ridiculous, but the movie itself is great . The conflict growing inside the Chief is irkingly good because he shows in such a clever way. An entire juice glass of a heavy red wine and he downs it faster than the shark downs Quint. This shows the stress of how the town is all relying on him to solve the problem that is this menace and if he fails, what will they all do? Will there by another Kittner boy's mother, no son and hating him for it. Only he can't close the beaches because city council won't let him. This confusion helps viewers relate to the movie. Personally, I thought the movie was great. His use of music to build tension and only silhouetting the shark to hide it's overall stupidity was an absolutely brilliant maneuver, and even though the main idea sucks, the suggestion makes the move an all-time summer favorite.Kristen Stenvik</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a wonderful work of Cinematic Art! The film understands the need of an extremely accurate Editing job as well as an investment in Character Development.Most of all, Spielberg not only started the Summer Season Blockbuster back in 1975 but has defined the correct parameters for an effective Thriller as a genre in movie making. Personally i would not change an inch in this movie. Editing is amazing, the actors all of them have the right tone required for their parts and the pace is perfect when allied to John Williams score.Absolutely brilliant in every way.</fullReview>

I've read the book and to be honest I preferred the movie. The sequels were S***. The plot, A small island off the coast of America that relies on the tourists for their lives is threatened by a man-eating shark. When the first casualty occurs the town does not want to believe it. But more attacks happen and it is up to police chief, a scientist and a shark hunter to save Amity Island from terror. I would strongly recommend this film. But it does have many violent and gory scenes. Other Facts Cert:12 Year:1975 Dierector: Steven Spielberg (PS: Who ever says the shark looks fake, either A: Ignore them or B: Punch them. I know what I would do.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Jaws when I was young enough to cry at the end because "mummy...they killed the shark". Since then I have seen it again and again and again and I am still cautious when entering water - even in the shower (sorry, this is about Psycho). Seriously, here we are facing one of our deepest fear - the bogeyman from beneath. There has been no other movie playing so perfectly on such a real fear. I live in Australia - sharks happen to take their meal on the beach every now and then. So may be I should thank you Mr. Spielberg, as you may have saved my life, I think about your movie when looking at the sea, and it keeps me on the beach. Lorraine</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, now I'm definitely not a Spielberg fan but this is just a fun movie that I couldn't help but love. I haven't found myself gasping and going "ew" out loud watching a movie in a long time. But with this one, you just get really into it. It's surprisingly not cheesy, the shark is really scary and the bloody water thing is really creepy and you find yourself wincing. I was just thoroughly entertained. And you don't really find that anymore. There's nothing to these new summer action/horror blockbuster movies: just an overload of special effects and cheesy one-liners. With Jaws, there's a really good plot and it's very suspenseful. I've never been in to these type of movies but I guess I've just never seen a good one before. In the end, this movie just rocks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only did it effectively start the career of the greatest director of the modern day, (Steven Spielberg) but it became one of the highest grossing films of all time. On a personal note, I remember i saw this when i was 4years old, and it effectively scarred me for life! I hardly ever swim in the sea, and i even tend to give the swimming pool a couple of looks before i swim! On a critical basis though, i like to look at this film as the COMPLETE film. Every component in the movie is done at a phenomenal level. The music is Oscar-worthy, one of the greatest scores of JOhn Williams illustrious career-and created the cult classic "dum-dum-dum-dum" indicator for the sharks imminent arrival. Editor Verna Fields, also won an Oscar for the incredible editing in this movie. The camera work is expert, as well as Spielberg's genius craft in directing.The storyline of the movie is loosely based on true events of Sharks staking its claim on one area and developing a taste for human blood.The storyline follows a fictitious community known as Amity Island, in the New England area. Local Chief of police Martin Brody locks horns with the local Mayor, whom refuses to heed the claims there is a Shark. The mayor (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep revenue for the town so to keep people swimming in the local beaches for their event in the 4th of July. IN a memorable moment, the Mayor backs up the reasoning "...we need summer dollars... If the people can't swim here, they'll happily swim in the beaches of Cape Cod, Long Island." Martin retorts, "Yea, but that doesn't mean we have to serve them up a Smorgisbord!" the Mayor memorably then replies-"It's all psychological, U yell Baricuda people say 'huh,' 'what?'; U yell Shark, and we have a panic on our hands on the 4th of July." The opening to the movie is arguably the most powerful opening to a movie ever made. A beach side party, encourages a guy to go over to a girl Chrissie Watkins, whom immediately decides to go for a midnight swim, the boy follows and passes out at the beach side due to alcohol-the girl soon realises she is alone in the water. At this point with expert milking of tension, the camera does a sharks POV beneath the girls legs, treading water. The camera gets closer, the music gets louder, then as we cut to a close up of the girls face, we see her feel the tug from below as she is dramatically and terrifyingly dragged left and right before she is finally pulled under for the final time. The primal fear of what is unknown in the water, is one of the factors that makes that scene so effective.Meanwhile as the evidence points to a shark attack, the community mayor has none of it until the next attack, an attack on a young boy on a raft -the gruesome death in front of many members of the community ensues community panic. This scene serves to heighten to the audience that if even a young boy gets killed and a dog (pippet) earlier, that truly no one is safe adding to the unpredictability and fear to the movie. Again, the attack is expertly crafted.The aspect that makes this movie beyond a simple monster movie is the interaction and characterisation in the domestic environment. We get a real sense of a small town Ameircan island community, the movie looks at all members of the community, the fishermen, council members,and island families. The character interaction is realistic and the main characters were tremendous. Chief Brody, played by the excellent actor Roy Schieder- is the typical everyman hero. His wife, Ellen (LOrraine Gary) was effective in an understated role. Brody feeling community pressure not to close the beaches for longer than 24hrs, brings in a Shark Expert, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). AN instantly likable character creates a tremendous bond with the Chief and a humorous interaction between the two. When the Shark attacks again, during the 4th of July celebration, Brody brings in Robert Shaw as the colourful shark fishermen to kill the Shark. The 3 main characters are simply scintillating together. Even scenes which don't include the shark are fascinating. Robert Shaw is wonderful at portraying an over-the top colourful Shark fisherman and creates an immediate distrust to Hoopers upper class upbringing: "U have city hands Mister Hooper, U've been countin money all your life!" Hooper replies, "Hey, i don't need this Working class hero crap." This brings an immediate tension when they go on the small boat. Brody terrified of boats and the water and Quint's controlling nature with Hooper being sidelined.One of the best aspects in the film is the characterisation of the Quint character, in his USS Indianapolis story. One of the most fascinating speeches in any moment in modern cinema. And we see the 3characters all bond. Probably one of the most famous jump off your seat scenes is the scene when the Shark emerges from the water unexpectedly after Brody threw chum in the water. Brody aghast staggers backwards claiming in a classic understatement "We're gonna need a bigger boat!" The scenes on the boat are the most fascinating examples of all elements of classic cinema techniques at its absolute best. The movie mixes adventurous, swashbuckling daring- do, to pure thriller horror. The final minutes of the movie are terrifying, Hoopers dramatic escape in the cage, to Quints gruesome demise to Brody's heroic last ditch one- on- one with the killer shark. Brody's classic "Smile you son of a B...!" blowing up the shark by shooting the air tank- is a rousing end to not just the greatest horror film ever made; but the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spielberg takes on suspense,he agreed to do Jaws,only if the shark was not present the first act of the movie.Jaws is about a killer shark brutally devouring swimmers on the coast of Amity,a beach resort town.The Mayor tries to pretend a big problem isn't there,but Sheriff Martin Brody knows something big is about to happen.He brings in Matt Hooper a Marine Scientist,they know they are dealing with none other than a great white.After a couple of deaths,Mayor Vaughn agrees for Sheriff Brody to go out,and get the help of Quint,an insane shark hunter.Quint is played brilliantly by Robert Shaw who sadly died shortly after Jaws was made,he steals all most every scene he is in,he would have gotten a Best Supporting Actor Oscar from me if I were in charge.Jaws is scary,and it builds suspense.Spielberg is actually an excellent horror director,he could have had a successful career in the horror genre.Shame he hasn't done a film like Jaws,Jurassic Park borrowed elements,but never was as good.The characters are fleshed out and you feel for them.Pete Benchley's novel which is a good read,but the only real character who isn't a creep is Martin Brody,I'm glad they took a different approach in making the movie.Jaws is excellent,I highly recommend it,it is not only a great creature feature but an excellent film as well.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking &amp; still scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 25-foot Great White shark is doing what he knows best ? swimming around and eating when he gets hungry. In this case, his diet consists mostly of the people off the coast of Amityville, and Martin Brody (Scheider) the newly hired police chief has to not only protect the townspeople but also find the shark and kill it. Unfortunately, he has a few strikes against him right out of the box; the Mayor of Amityville is so mercenary he pretty much has to have a body dropped in his lap before he will acquiesce to closing the beach, he hires a crusty old curmudgeon of a shark hunter (Quint, played by Robert Shaw) who, while being good at what he does, has a beef with everyone who comes in contact with him (particularly oceanographer Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss), and finally, Brody suffers from a little thing called hydrophobia.The story is simple, yet the film is so well put together that it has held up as a horror classic for the last thirty years. Spielberg, at the time with only a few films and television shows under his directing belt, created a masterpiece with the film "Jaws", a film that is so good; its flaws become almost trivial when making an overall assessment of the film. Several great things occurred due to serendipity with "Jaws". Probably the best known was the trouble the crew had with the mechanical shark that led to underexposure of the monster; subsequently leading to a greater scare with the shard did appear. Spielberg, even with these formative films, knew how to create suspense and tension. The image of the three men on a rickety boat in the middle of the ocean where a man-eating shark who is looking for a 5th victim awaits is pretty scary. And that is one of the less obvious moments ? never mind the shark bringing down a young boy, a dog, a young woman and man. (Unusually, the goriest actually being the death of the child.) Throw in a now iconic soundtrack and we have ourselves an instant classic.Formally reviewing "Jaws" is pretty pointless when the movie is not only thirty years out of the can, but has been analyzed to pieces, but a mention has to be made about its lasting effect on pop culture. I know of at least one person who still will not go in the water as a direct result of this film, and while it is fair to expect that I was completely terrified of this film when I was 7 or 8, I'll admit that the movie poster still scares the hell out of me. I think the greatest thing that I found with "Jaws" is that a film that I remembered being so terrifying as a kid actually turned into a film that was terrifying for a completely different reasons when viewed as an adult. With this viewing I found "Jaws" to be more spine-chillingly suspenseful than anything; I really felt a sense of hopelessness for the plight of these men, and was scared on their behalf ? more of an adult kind of terror than anything that simply goes "Boo!" "Jaws" isn't perfect ? it actually has a pretty convenient ending that made me go, "Wait ? but- how will they?.huh?" But like I said earlier, it's things like this that make you realize that the rest of the film was good enough to forgive this transgression. I have always had a conflicted relationship with Steven Spielberg films; on the one hand, and as a self-labeled life long film student, I know how commercial his films are. But on the other hand, I can't deny that he makes damn good films. Maybe I should just lighten up about it and just enjoy, which I did while watching "Jaws" again, many years after seeing it for the first time. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this is my favourite movie ever, I love the effects considering that it was made in 1975 and it is still good quality effects and the shark looks real! This movie used to make me really scared when i was a kid but I still loved it back then too. Jaws represents fear to all human beings and I believe deep down everyone is afraid of Great White Sharks. Steven Spielberg did a great job on this film considering it was like his first ever. The acting is great too even though I hate Hooper. Jaws 2 is pretty good too but nothing beats the original. Jaws was the first movie in history to make over 100 million at the box office and it shattered the record by getting 260 million! It was the original Summer blockbuster and it is still great to this day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all-time favorite movie. I've both the DVD and VHS version, and it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over in the same day (along with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark). Jaws has it all - great story, great actors, and great film-making. Roy Scheider is great as Brody, making the character the most unlikely hero. Robert Shaw is also superb as Quint, the experienced fisherman who has been through a lot in his life. Richard Dreyfuss is awesome as Hooper, the marine biologist whose high tech equipment is no match for the power of the shark. Murray Hamilton is good as the mayor in denial of the evidence of the presence of the shark, until it's too late. Lorraine Gary is also good as the mother who cares about her family. And as for the shark, unlike others, I try not to notice it's technical flaws. It was 1975. I try to enjoy the other aspects of the movie. I think Spielberg and his team did a fantastic job with this classic. ****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't think of a movie that I 've seen more times than Jaws. It has every element that I love in a movie. Sure by todays fx standards it may seem dated to some, but it is a masterpiece of suspense and adventure. Steven Spielberg has been lauded for his other movies, he has made more serious movies of late, but I think this is one of his best movies. It is now known to most movie fans that the making of this movie was a nightmare. Steven Spielberg found a way to create a great film out of what in someone else's hands would have been a B popcorn film. True, at it's core it is a B movie, a great white shark terrorizes a New England Island town, three men go out to sea and battle the shark etc... What is great about this movie is its characters. Roy Scheider is great a Chief Brody, a Sheriff of the town who happens to be afraid of going into the ocean. He is not a hot shot know it all cop, he is an average Joe, doing his job to protect the town. Richard Dreyfuss is great as Hooper, a rich kid marine biologist who befriends Brody in his struggle to convince the town that they have a shark problem. And yes there is Quint, played by Robert Shaw, probably one of the most memorable movie characters ever. He is a salty sailor with a particular loathing of sharks. The movie takes its time to develop its premise, it doesn't rush to the battle with man and shark. The other great thing is that it is never pretentious, Spielberg could have filled the movie with metaphors of man against nature and the deep meaning of it, but he doesn't bother with it, it's an adventure film in the end. Most movie goers have seen this film, and I've seen a countless times, I always enjoy the movie. Jaws is credited by some to be the first bona fide summer blockbuster, it may have been , but it is better than most summer movies that come out these days. Summer movies nowadays are more concerned about CGI effects than storytelling, Jaws may have been made in 1975, but it holds up as one of the great adventures of all time. It lets us get to know and care about the characters before it thrusts them into the adventure, that makes the movie more entertaining. Great performances ,Great Director, Great script, Great Music, GREAT FILM!!!My love for movies began with this!!!Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is the best film ever made. It's that simple. It's the best use a movie camera has ever been put to. Steven Spielberg is a genius and that's just a fact.Everyone knows the shoot was chaotic, the script constantly in flux, the actors unsure of themselves and the crew seasick. Everyone knows the robotic shark frequently sank. And none of it, in the end, mattered because Jaws is the best film ever made and it's that simple.It's the film that made me want to make films and it's the film I've watched more times than any other. I can still remember my Mum constantly reassuring my brother that "It's only a film" when we first saw it on a Friday night on TV (probably it's UK network debut as my brother and I were very young). I've never forgotten it, the pure power of cinema in the hands of a genius really hitting his stride for the first time in his career.</fullReview>

When I saw this movie for the first time, I was really scared almost through the entire movie, even just by hear the famous `shark' music.Everything in this movie is great, since its scary beginning until its awesome conclusion.The acting is one of the best I've seen in an action/terror movie: The characters of Queen, chief Brody, and Hooper are just amazing, particularly Queen, which from my point of view is the best actor in the movie. He goes from serenity to insanity, from funny to despicable, and he just does it in a perfectly kind of way.The shark obviously is not the most real shark I've seen in a movie, but, for a movie from 1975 is reasonable. And it still is more impressive than the computer graphics of many current action movies. The DVD version is by far a must have DVD for those who like this movie, because the soundtrack has been digitally enhanced and the visual quality is by far a lot more better than the original movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is one of those movies that not only survives the test of time but gets better. I saw it way back, loved it and my opinion has never changed. This is a movie that is as riveting as it is frightening and it's frightening not because of the whole "don't go in the water" thing, but the whole element of relaism surrounding the story. You do not even ever feel like your watching a movie, it feels like watching a story unfold right in front of you.I honestly know a few people who wouldn't get in the water after this was made. I still think the book was scarier but this is one of those movies that you can't say a bad thing about because what's to criticise?Haunting, great acting, stunning visually-frightening, timeless-Jaws is a classic-10 of 10 without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is the reason that i'm a Movie Fanatic today. One of the regrets of my life is that i have yet to see it in a cinema screen. Perhaps one day it will be released on its 50th anniversary on the big screen and a new generation will be haunted from going for a swim down by their local beach. I know that i will be first in the queue.Most users reading this review will be familiar with the plot. A gigantic Great White Shark starts feeding off the shores of Amity Island. A free spirited woman called Chrissie Watkins who takes a night swim is devoured in the film's unforgettable opening sequence. The Chief Of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in his most famous role) immediately closes the beaches in fear of another attack until he is persuaded by Mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) to keep them open because Amity needs 'Summer Dollars' to survive in the winter.When it becomes clear that the shark has no intention of going away and kills again, the authorities bring in Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, brilliant) to determine exactly what kind of creature they are up against and how they can solve the problem. Despite efforts to convince the Mayor to keep the beaches closed, the Mayor refuses and horror strikes again during the 4th of July. Finally, and with no other alternative, Brody hires Shark Hunter Quint (Robert Shaw, in arguably his greatest role) and along with Hooper they set sail in Quint's vessel The Orca, to hunt the Shark which takes up the last fifty minutes of the film.The photography, lighting, set pieces (including the wonderful Orca itself) are absolutely brilliant. This is a film that ages like a fine wine. Some detractors and critics of this film might deride the Shark for its unconvincing close ups towards the end of the film, but its as good as any Computer Generated Imagery simply because it is really THERE.John Williams memorable score is one of the most popular in film history. The music is terrifying when the shark is around, and it is thrilling when the crew of The Orca chase the shark across the Atlantic whilst firing those yellow barrels time and again. William's Score was fifty percent responsible for the success of this Picture. He also won the Oscar for it. Enough said.This is Steven Spielberg's Best Film. It is also The Greatest Film Ever Made. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw should have been awarded special Oscars for such brilliant character performances. There have been rumours that they are planning a remake or a re imagining of Jaws, but if this happens, then Hollywood will have swallowed itself like a Boa Constrictor, for this was the first film that defined the term 'Summer Blockbuster' and created an era of big Hollywood movies that were King of the Box Office...a remake might destroy that forever.My Favourite Film Ever. I Love Jaws.Cal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that has been etched in my memory since the first time I saw it a two thirty in the morning at a cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been almost twenty-nine years since producers Richard D. Zanuck and director Stephen Spielberg unleashed Jaws onto the big screen and into film history. In 1975, the summer blockbuster was born, for better or as many now believe, or for worse. Whatever your feelings are on that subject doesn't matter. Jaws is still one heckuva ride.In 1971 Spielberg directed a movie of the week for ABC entitled Duel. It was the story of one man confronting a relentless enemy. In that film, the enemy was a huge tractor trailer rig. We never saw the drive of the truck, all we saw was his relentless, single minded goal to pummel and kill Dennis Weaver as the everyman. It was one of the best of the Movie of the week films, but little did anyone know that it would eventually lead Spielberg to Jaws, which would put his name on the map permanently. Just as the truck in Duel was of a single minded purpose, so is the shark in Bruce. As Richard Dreyfuss puts it, the only thing a shark does is swim, eat, and make baby sharks. In Jaws, it mostly swims and eat, with tourists and citizens of Amity being it's main course. The original idea was to use a mechanical shark in the filming of Jaws. The fact that the never before tested shark didn't work as planned turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to Spielberg in jaws. It forced him to rely more on his capabilities as a storyteller and director by shooting much of the film from the perspective of the shark. Yet, Spielberg is so astute at using this device, and aided by the editing of Verna Fields, after seeing the film, you'll swear you saw the shark more than you actually did. If any person besides Spielberg deserved an Oscar for Jaws it was Verna Fields who went on to score a win in the category. There is no explanation for the lack of so much as a directorial nomination for Spielberg. Bill Butler's cinematography deserves special mention as well, especially when the action switches from Amity Island to the Orca and the open sea. As for John Williams score it is the stuff legends are made of. The thought of Jaws without William's simple shark theme is unfathomable.As for the cast, they too are perfect in roles now ingrained in our memory. Though they have made other fine and notable films, one cannot think of Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw, Hamilton or Laraine Gary without thinking of this film. Maybe it was luck that brought this cast together, or like just about anything else associated with Jaws, the casting was perhaps one of those things that was just meant to be. Dreyfuss's Hooper provides the perfect foil for Shaw's Quint. Quint is hard edge and sea worn, Hooper is a product of luxury and class. Scheider's Chief Brody is like the dependable anchor, who keeps everyone in their place. I was really happy to see Murray Hamilton as the Mayor. He is perfect for the role, as evidenced by a conversation he has with Hooper and Brodie as they try to convince him the shark is still a threat. We know his arguments and defense of his position are foolish, but as Mayor Vaughn Hamilton gives the lines almost a comedic edge. If you have ever had the privilege of seeing Jaws in a movie theater, I can't think of too many films that had as terrifying and an attention grabbing opening as Jaws. Because of these first few minutes as the shark suddenly attacks Chrissie without warning, Spielberg grabs hold of his audience and never lets them loose for the entire running time of the film. The fact that the last forty five minutes or so of the film take place aboard Quint's small boat the Orca, yet never loses it momentum during the entire sequence is again a testimony to Spielberg's directorial brilliance.If ever there has been a perfect suspense/action/horror film made it has to be Jaws. It is a film that has been etched in my memory since the first time I saw it at two thirty in the morning in a cinema in downtown Cincinnati. We had bought tickets at five in the afternoon to get into that two thirty a.m. showing. I was thinking at the time it had better be one heck of a film if I was to be able to stay awake into the wee hours of the morning. I needn't have worried about that. For causing me one night's good sleep, and for being all around excellent you get my grade. It's an A+. Was there any doubt in your mind?  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's best films, and, indeed, one of the greatest movies ever made **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to go over the plot too much; this movie isn't really "scary" per se, but it's well-made, perfectly written, and perfectly cast. I have never read Benchley's novel, though it doesn't sound any good (at least not in comparison to the film). So, I won't compare the two. As I often do, I will analyze the acting and other important aspects of the film itself. There are no big-names among the cast - Scheider had made "The French Connection" prior to this, Shaw "From Russia With Love" and "The Battle of the Bulge", and Dreyfuss . . . nothing worth mentioning - but they were hardly big stars. Nonetheless, the three heroes handle their roles perfectly. Roy Scheider's performance is very good as Martin Brody, a police chief with a childhood fear of the water (due to an implied shark attack on him) and who's superiors (the Mayor, et al) think he's crazy. Scheider is very good here, in a subtle way, as a man trying to protect both his town and his family - nothing flashy, just a solid performance. Richard Dreyfuss, as Professor Matt Hooper, is my favorite character - he is very smart with a sense of humor - his quarrel with Quint is well-acted out and neither actor goes over the top. What more can I say? But it is Shaw's performance as the crazed Navy veteran Quint that carries this film. In his earlier scenes, Shaw is merely somewhat eccentric; in the protracted finale, he snaps; he seems to go insane, which Shaw handles very well. He smashes the "Orca"'s radio, sings sea shanties as the shark tries to ram the ship, and . . . well, he's nuts. Listen to the deadpan way he recounts the sinking of the "Indianapolis" (ending with the perfect "So we delivered the bomb"). Shaw should've won an Oscar for his performance - just goes to show how tasteless the Academy is. The rest of the supporting cast (especially Murray Hamilton as the Mayor and Lorraine Gray as Scheider's wife) is very good as well. As for the shark? Not seen until more than halfway through the film, the shark is not as horribly unrealistic (at least not always) in most of its scenes - I've seen more phony-looking pictures of "real" sharks elsewhere. Besides, at least it's there - I prefer Spielberg's cheesy but somewhat realistic shark to the heartless computer effects of "SpiderMan" and the new "Star Wars" films any day.  The attacks are all well executed; the opening scene is very well-shot. The dialogue is near-perfect; not a wasted line exists. The scene with all the "bounty killers" hunting for the shark is one of the best of the movie; it portrays the panic, the confusion, the frenzy, the desperateness of the fisherman, shooting at anything that moves, carrying dynamite (!), overloading boats . . . well, I think Hooper summed it up nicely: "They're all gonna die!" I could say more, but why? I think "Jaws" stands for itself. Nine stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best films ever made, Baby!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JAWS (1975) **** Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gary. One of the most successful and terrifying American classics that single-handedly coined the phrase "blockbuster" and did for swimming what "Psycho" did for taking a shower. Picturesque summer resort community Amity Beach is suddenly turned into a great white shark's feeding buffet with only source of reason Sheriff Martin Brody (Scheider) wanting to close down the beach prior to the profitable Fourth of July with the aid of shark scientist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) and salty shark hunter Quint (Shaw) on one of cinema's most memorable journeys into fear. Masterfully directed by a young punk named Steven Spielberg in his big-screen sophomoric turn helming the first of many successes in Hollywood. Based on Peter Benchley's (who has a cameo as a TV reporter) best-seller the storyline hooks you from its horrifying opening moments to its breath-taking finale of pure adrenalined, visceral terror. Oscar-winning and memorable soundtrack ("dumdumdumdum") by John Williams and production design Academy Award recipient for its genuinely scary and realistic shark nicknamed "Bruce" by the film's crew after Spielberg's lawyer. Classic line: "You're gonna need a bigger boat" by Scheider with a Pall-Mall doing a mad, dry-lipped jig on his close encounter for the very first time with the shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that changed my life.I was five years old when my father took me to this film.

Jaws started it all.Spielberg did a marvelous job under the well-documented, difficult circumstances. I do not know how this movie could be any better- it is much better than the book. It is scary, it is thrilling, the characters are engrossing, and it introduced the industry to the summer blockbuster.It's ranking of 69 on the IMDB rating system is a little disappointing. It's lost some of its luster because you have seen it so many times on TV. The special effects are also a little dated. But do not forget this film, it is just too good to let that happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws was the first real summer blockbuster, and to this day it's still the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most blockbusters of today, Jaws was blessed with a superb cast, a fantastic director, and a good screenplay.Most of Jaws's success can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's masterful direction. He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less and there by giving the audience more. By not showing the shark for the first half of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more suspenseful. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written. Now granted, this is not a brilliant character study but the script is more character driven than most of today's blockbuster scripts. Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions. The cast does a fantastic job at giving life and voice to the characters of the screenplay. Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable. Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea-worn fisherman, Quint. Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist. Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy, sleazy mayor of Amity; the town endangered by the shark.Bill Butler's cinematography is first-class. He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level. Although there are many continuity errors, Verna Fields's editing is smooth and fast paced. Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first half of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.John Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason. His simple use of a few notes to characterize the shark was ingenious. He brings the suspense/action scenes to life with his energetic score.Many people complain that the shark looks too fake. Do sharks really look all that life-like to begin with? I personally think the shark effects could have been much worse; they weren't that bad.All of these fine qualities are why Jaws has remained one of my favorite films for quite some time.</fullReview>

The special effects are considered today to be standard...and one can tell the fake shark scenes from the real ones. The acting, cinematography, and direction, however, have held up over the years.

		<fullReview>There was never a better action-movie, a better thriller or a better monster-movie than this masterpiece of suspense. As if to prove it, the "big teeth-monster" - formula has become a clich? in copycat grade-Z horror-films ever since. (And Grade A-junk, like Godzilla..)Watching it way back in 75, I clearly recall the jolts of terror, shock and disbelief rippling through the audience at my local cinema. The near-dissolved head in the wreckage of the fishing-boat gave me violent nightmares, and I didn't take a swim for ages after watching it (even in the shark-free waters of Norway, sightings of killer shark were rampant that summer!).Today, some of the thrills and horrific excitement has gone, but that gives one more time to enjoy the tight plot and the well-rounded characters. The references to "Moby Dick" gives John Milius` script literary credence, and the central premise of human lives being sacrificed in the interest of capitalism and greed is very powerfully realized. Jaws certainly started something big. It's a classic in every respect of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is without a doubt one of the most deeply effective thrillers ever to come out of Hollywood. The film has humour, good acting, a very good musical score by the world's best movie composer John Williams, and good special effects for its time. Jaws also holds one of my all time favourite movie characters. The rude fisherman we all know as Quint. One scene that always grips my nerves is the heart pounding pier sequence when two fisherman attempt to catch the great fish but become prey themselves. After seeing the film, going into the water was my number one fear especially if I was lying on an air mattress. Another thing I loved about the film was not seeing the shark, just seeing the barrels pop up, letting you know the shark was there and could appear at any moment.From the moment when Chrissie is taken by the shark to the moment when the credits role while John Williams beautiful theme played, I was blown away by the film. We'll always remember that classic line that set the mood for the second half and put deep shivers down our spines "you're gonna need a bigger boat".</fullReview>

However, there was a lot of cussing [-1 point] and smoking [-1 point] and I'm the type who can't stand gore and blood.

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's a matter of satiation overload and that with time the numbness and the redundancy has dulled the impact of the original contemporary horror-monster movie that started it all. Too many mayors who ignore warnings because of economics, too many mysterious deaths, too many gruff, war-weary veterans and too many sharp, whiz kids, and too many normal everyman has seemed to have made one immune to the scares and thrills, the upsets, and the boiling over stupidity of various what have become stock characters now. JAWS brought to the big screen the fear of the ordinary, the graphic depiction of both hidden horror and the in your face horror ending sequences, from the authentic crowd panic and trampling of people that would be later seen in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005) remake. Nevertheless, the original has to be recognized for its vitality and freshness of the genre it brought to the bring screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Benchley wrote a thriller about an almost supernaturally cunning great white shark which haunted the beaches of a holiday resort. It was an enjoyable book, but not exceptional. But it was definitely cinematic enough for Universal to acquire the film rights, although it was sufficiently low priority that they allocated a director who had only previously directed one cinema feature (albeit a moderate amount of TV).OK, so the director was Steven Spielberg, and everyone has to start somewhere, right? Together with screenwriter Carl Gottlieb (whose contribution shouldn't be overlooked), the soapy aspects of the novel were discarded and the story streamlined to concentrate on the shark and its effects on the community it was stalking. The movie brilliantly intertwines shark action with the interplay between the 3 primary characters, Police Chief Brodie (Roy Scheider), shark specialist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and professional fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw). All three performances are top notch.But the film also contains a huge number of "moments" - the first shocking attack, the jetty, the beach attack, the nocturnal underwater search (and its brilliantly choreographed shock moment - I recall seeing daylight between bums and seats in the packed cinema when the movie first came out), the fingernail screech... the list goes on and on. Jaws demonstrated that Spielberg's gift lay in orchestrating audience reactions, something he is arguably as good at as Hitchcock was.And let us not forget the impact of one of John William's most effective scores.Bruce, the mechanical shark, isn't always convincing, but that matters little. Even now, all these years later, Jaws still has the power to thrill, shock, and - above all - entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I base this review upon the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD release. We all know the theme and the famous lines. This is part of popular culture, with countless references to it and parodies of it in the almost 35 years that has passed. I suppose I will still describe the plot: A small island community finds itself terrorized by a shark. A really, really big one. The storytelling is good, and this never loses your attention. It's interesting to note that the limitations of the mechanical effect led to this being as excellent as it is. Not being able to show the animal all the time, Spielberg opted for build-up and character development, thus creating a marvelous suspenseful atmosphere as well as getting the audience properly invested in these characters. This is immensely exciting and intense, and you don't know exactly when something is going to happen. The acting is great, every single performance(with the possible exception of some of the kids, but that's nothing new). FX are better than you might expect, and the careful and precise editing and cinematography succeed in making them entirely convincing. The score is solid. This comes with an featurette that is almost two(in total, all of the stuff amounts to maybe three) hours long and worth watching, an interview with Spielberg, deleted scenes, Shark Facts, a minute and a half of unfunny outtakes and some galleries. There is frequent moderate to strong language, a little bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of horror films and/or thrillers. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's greatest directorial achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the story of JAWS. Small New England seaside town Amity is moving normally towards summer when, out of nowhere comes a killer shark. Not seen until halfway through the film, the shark is an ominous, almost omnipotent presence felt throughout the entire film, even from the beginning.An attractive young girl is swimming and gets taken in one of the great opening scenes in film history. She feels something bite her, drag her in all directions, then she disappears underwater. Her boyfriend reports her missing and her body is found by local police the next morning all chewed up and spit out along the shore. The Amity police chief is Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider in his greatest film role). When he and his deputy find the body, they immediately quarantine the beach and post signs to stay away, but the Mayor (played effectively by Murray Hamilton) will have none of that since local businesses will lose lots of money during the tourist season if the beaches are closed. The beaches stay open and a young boy is killed by the shark on the first day of tourist season.It appears as if some of the local fisherman have caught 'the shark' when a oceanographic expert on sharks named Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss in a totally winning and expert performance) shows up in Amity to assist Chief Brody in finding and catching the real shark. Hooper immediately does an autopsy of the girl eaten in the opening scene and verifies that a 'great white shark' did this. One of the many memorable great lines of this film come shooting out of his mouth 'This was not a boating accident!' The day Hooper arrives, while all the fisherman are patting themselves on the back and everyone is celebrating the shark 'capture', something unexpected happens. The mother of the boy that was killed, dressed in all black funeral garb, walks up to Chief Brody and slaps him for not closing the beaches even though he knew a man-eating shark was out there (of course we know this isn't all his fault). This one scene has always stuck out with me from the film. It is very realistic and shows how people can really take their grief and anger out on the wrong person, but this moment served as a kind of closure for the woman and as a wake-up call for Brody. From this moment on, Brody takes everything that Hooper says seriously and wants to be sure that the real shark is still not out there.Hooper does indeed verify to Brody that the shark is still out there by cutting open the captured shark and verifying no signs of human consumption. But the stubborn mayor still keeps the beaches open not believing them. As expected, the shark attacks again, this time almost killing Brody's son. NOW the Mayor has to pay attention. A town meeting is held and Brody and the Mayor tell them they need to hire professional shark hunters. Then another great moment occurs. An annoying, screeching sound is heard. It's a man scraping a blackboard with his fingernails to get everyone's attention. That man is Quint (played by Robert Shaw in a role that he should forever be remembered for). Quint is a local fisherman who is extremely knowledgeable about the sea and sharks (we'll find out why later) says he'll catch the shark for the right price. Eventually they agree and Brody, Hooper, and Quint (reluctantly) join forces to go after the great white.The adventure begins. The 3 men go after the great white in Quint's boat. An uneasy alliance forms amongst the 3 men, as they each argue with each other and get on each other's nerves early on. Quint is old school and thinks all of Hooper's technical equipment is hogwash, while Hooper thinks Quint is too rigid and primitive. Brody is like a 3rd wheel as he's not a seamen at all and he hates the water! At a totally unexpected moment, THE SHARK appears, then Brody in a frozen state slowly walks back towards Quint and says 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' (maybe the best line in film history). This is followed by one of my all time favorite film sequences as the 3 men scramble to do what each of them do best to kill the shark. They fail at first, but slowly bond during the trip. One night, while drunk, Quint and Hooper compare sea scars, then Quint tells the story of how he got this one scar while he was a sailor on the USS Indianapolis which got bombed and sank while he and his fellow survivors were stuck in shark-infested waters waiting for rescue. This dialogue is famous for being completely scripted by Robert Shaw himself and he delivers it perfectly.Needless to say, they get one final chance to catch the shark and in this long sequence that climaxes the film, the tension builds from moment to moment as they try everything to catch the shark and as the shark goes all out in trying to eat up the men and the boat itself. A great movie.This, for me, is Steven Spielberg's best directorial effort. I love his later work too, but JAWS is a perfect film. Not a weak moment in it. I love the Hitchcockian elements of building tension and suspense, the Kubrickian elements of overlapping dialogue and long scenes that are totally enthralling and not boring, the great background music, and quotable, memorable dialogue. Ironic that this perfect film inspired all the fake, unrealistic, over-the-top, unsuspenseful summer crap they make nowadays. JAWS should never be mistaken as one of these films.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1975 (should have won) and won the 3 other Oscars it was nominated for (Editing, Sound, and of course Score). Spielberg was robbed by not even getting a Best Director nom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the summer of '75</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 'Jurassic Park,' 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' and 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' was clearly the movie of the moment when it came out in the summer of '75, and it began a string of blockbusters by Steven Spielberg that pretty much continues to present day. All the familiar elements and themes that people love (and hate) about Spielberg are present, though some are more muted and underplayed than they would be in later films by the director. Perhaps he didn't feel he had as free a hand to indulge himself as he would later. As everyone on the planet has seen 'Jaws,' there's no point in recounting the plot. So instead, just a few observations. Roy Scheider died recently, and as almost inevitably happens, we tend to look at his performance a little differently now, with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy. He really was good in this, the Everyman we could all relate to. A decent guy in over his head, scared, not terribly intelligent but not stupid either, with the added ironic trait of being afraid of the water, and someone who ultimately becomes somewhat heroic, though not intentionally. He reacts the way we hope we would in a crisis where we're frightened out of our wits, but from somewhere inside ourselves we find the courage or fortitude or blind luck to do the right thing and save the day. Richard Dreyfuss has a star-making role as the shark expert Hooper. His character and performance are what date the movie more than anything; he has '70's yuppie written all over him and is the prototypical Spielberg male lead. Hooper embodies all the things that Spielberg seems to find so appealing: he is clever, funny, childish, emotive, silly, put-upon, but, like Scheider's Chief Brody, more resourceful than he gives himself credit for. Hooper is the man-child that inhabits so many of the director's movies (Dreyfuss would go on to star in 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'), and that most of the audience roots for and finds very entertaining. And Robert Shaw has the plum role, the scene-stealing turn as Quint, who is part Captain Ahab and part Popeye. In one of his best scenes, where the boat is being prepared for the shark hunt, Shaw keeps up a steady stream of seafaring prattle, almost gibberish, that is very funny and perfectly in character. Later, when he recounts his harrowing experience as a crewmember of the USS Indianapolis in World War II, and the desperate fear of floating helplessly in shark-infested waters waiting to be rescued, you can't take your eyes off him. (Spielberg says Shaw came up with much of the dialogue in this scene.) Quint has a kind of modified respect for Brody, but none for Hooper, whom he gives unholy hell all through the movie. 'Jaws' is one of those films that takes you back to wherever you were the first time you saw it. And for a couple of hours, it's 1975 all over again, right down to the leisure suits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie OF ALL TIME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Jaws in the theater with my father when I was 7. The Theater had two theaters, Jaws was showing in one and 101 Dalmations( I'm pretty sure, I know it was a Disney movie )was showing in the other. Of course we originally went there to see the Disney, but my dad being "my dad" we ended up in the Jaws theater! From the first scene I was captivated. I was so small and the screen was so big, which of course made the ocean scenes seem so overwhelming. I think I was more in my dad's seat than my dad was. I told him," Now dad, tell me when the shark is going to show up." He'd already seen it. Dad says," Just listen for the scary music and you'll know the shark is coming." Okay. That worked for a while UNTIL Ben's head rolled into the hole opening in his submerged boat! Then there was when Sheriff Brody was chumming and JAWS pops up out of the water. I think I jumped 3 ft out of my seat. Oh, it was on then! I spent the rest of the movie peeking through my fingers which were covering my eyes! I love this movie partly because it was a memory myself and my dad shared until he died, and partly because it was the first of it's kind, and the LAST (only) good shark movie. Sharks are a real threat and Jaws is the one and only good portrayal of this FEAR. Surrounded by water and the villain is somewhere beneath you, yet you can't possibly know where until he surfaces and attacks. I can't imagine anyone not seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg started his legend here !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this incredible movie at the age of 6. I remembered after seeing this film, I was always wondering if the great shark came to bite me while I was taking the shower. Indeed, this unique movie in 1975 scared all the people away from the beach and screamed in the theater. This movie has good photography, complete story, amazing special effects (at that time), and good directing. Though this movie was a disaster for Spielberg during filming, the box office still reached unbelievable point in film history. Obvious, this movie makes Steven Spielberg this name well known all over the world. the movie is intensive, frightening, and well entertaining. Spielberg is good in creating nervous shot (like shark's point of view for approaching the victim) and excellent atmosphere. In addition, the greatest music composer John Williams used simple three to four phonograms to grab the audience's attention. At any rate, this highly entertaining movie affects film making of this genre for the later thirty years. If you like exciting, and would like to "study" movies' implication" I strongly recommend to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3 "R's" - Roy, Robert and Richard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it misrepresents true shark behavior, this film is pretty entertaining. The dramatic elements are off-set well with the action sequences, and the overall structure of the film is nicely balanced (even though it is quite long).Robert Shaw is probably the highlight character, and Roy Scheider is pretty good as Chief Brody. Richard Dreyfuss is just as good as Hooper, who is the "rational" voice of the film, (opposing Quint's recklessness). The scene where Hooper tires to prove his way onto the "Orca's" crew is worth the sitting alone - it is ridiculously hilarious.Spielberg used his resources effectively, and there are no real cop-out scenes or short-cuts taken within the story. The real threat of the shark becomes apparent suitably, and you suddenly feel as if there is real danger for the crew, however see-through the dramatic devices/special effects are.This film is too legendary for me to add anything more - it is general knowledge that it is (or should be) the definitive modern (Moby Dick) adventure story.(Question: When Brody cannot close the beaches because of the Mayor, why doesn't he just go over his head to the next level of Government?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie would be one of my favourite movies ever.There are so many quotes and famous characters from this series but mostly this movie. This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen especially the parts where the shark is going to attack and that part with the decapitated head and others.My favourite character would have to be Quint the old sailor who knows how to kill the shark but won't do it without a price tag attached. The general storyline is three men go out and hunt a shark that is attacking a town.So in summary if you want to see a good movie and get a bit of a fright see jaws one of the greatest, most quotable movies ever made. I was frightened to go swimming for months even in a local pool!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....give this movie praise, along with everyone else. In the beginning, it's a shallow, predictable, embarrassing 1970s 'horror/shock' flick.By the time the longshoreman enters the picture, along with the bearded scientist, the movie takes on a whole new tenor. Now it's about something else, something eternal, and this is where the movie finds its light. This is why the movie is revered the way it is. There's something cosmic about that shark, the skipper, the scientist, and the policeman. These people love the shark (except for the cop), and they hate each other. They are jealous lovers of a shark, in a fatal embrace.A good story for kids or adults, it transcends itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now matter how much I watch this movie, I always feel that is is so underrated. As soon as the movie opens, students scattered on the beach and the young lady decides to go swimming . . . it has MASTERPIECE written all over it.They couldn't use a mechanical shark more than they (Speilberg &amp; Co)would have liked to - it kept breaking down and sinking. All this stuff is now pure Hollywood Legend.The acting is superb: Scheider down-plays his role as an everyday working man and pulls it off Big Time. He really is one heck of an actor, and incredibly underrated.Richard Dreyfuss over-plays his role and pulls it off very nicely. He is funny and in-your-face without ever being annoying.Robert Shaw . . . . he over-plays it and . . . well, he's like a cartoon character. I have never ever liked him. Firstly, you can't even here a word he says, and when he does say something half-audible, it's a loud of old clichd nonsense.He is the only dodgy thing about this movie (well, apart from Bruce, of course). The pacing is awesome, the directing unique and the first ever summer blockbuster.The greatest thing is, though, that you can watch this movie day-in and day-out and it never gets boring.Now THAT'S what a call a proper suspense movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the film that shot Spielberg to fame. A sleepy seaside resort Amity Island has an unwanted visitor for the summer season. Conscious of the fact that the island needs visitors for the economy they try to ignore the evidence of the man eating shark and go on as normal.The three leads Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss are excellently cast and put in fine performances. It's a bit surprising that Shaw in particular did not even get nominated for the best supporting actor award. It's a true tribute to Spielberg's craft that the head scene is still frightening even though you know what's coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws became a cultural phenomenon and the first bona fide summer event film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Television had taught director Steven Spielberg to grab the audience in the opening sequence, but Duel (1971) had shown him that our fear of the unseen dictates that our direct confrontation with the giant shark should be delayed. Spielberg's brilliantly edited and scored film unfolds in three classically conceived acts. The film carefully balances suspense and humour, provides the police chief with a believable home life, creates credible characters in Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and something controversially legendary in Quint (Robert Shaw). Several things give the film an extra dimension. First, the picture came out in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the biggest cover-up and public deception in American political history, and playing the craven Mayor of Amity is Murray Hamilton, an actor associated with devious authority figures, most famously Mr. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). The second is the teaming of a uniformed policeman and a bearded hippie as the principled opponents of a dishonest community. The third factor, the one that gives true depth to Jaws, is the revelation that Quint was a survivor of the Indianapolis, the American warship torpedoed in July 1945 after delivering the A-bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima. As he eloquently recalls, nearly 800 sailors out of a crew of 1100 perished while clinging to wreckage, most killed by sharks. The thriller is many things: a high point in the 1970s group-jeopardy cycle; a Hitchcockian horror picture for the carriage trade; the massive box-office hit that established the reputation of Spielberg; and the film that created a new fashion for releasing films nationally with several thousand prints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blockbuster is a bit of a dirty word in "serious" film commentary. It gets associated with base commercialism, the motion picture as mere product, simple fare with no long-term appeal. But such an assessment does a disservice to the savvy filmmakers who make the hits, as well as the movie-going public who make the box office figures. You can fake art house sophistication, but you can't fake popular approval.Jaws was adapted by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb from Benchley's best-selling novel. In many ways it follows the book closely, but there are some key differences. In the novel the mayor was being pressured by the mafia, and bizarrely enough there was a subplot in which Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife. With these aspects gone we have a story stripped of anything that may introduce a different tone - anything that might have been the focus of another story in its own right. The plot and dialogue are succinct and direct, especially in the earlier scenes. This is not a picture that wastes time getting itself going.And a lot of the racy pacing is down to director Steven Spielberg. Like John Ford before him, Spielberg has great economy of expression, often working two ideas into a single shot. In Roy Scheider's first scene, we get Scheider on the phone in the foreground while his wife tends to their son's injured hand in the background. The details of the phone call aren't important, we just need to know that it happened, and thus Spielberg can afford to balance it with something that demonstrates the significance of our hero's family life. The tenderness Scheider feels towards his two boys is the closest this picture comes to having a subplot, and it is something largely brought out by Spielberg. For example, scenes like the one in which the younger son imitates Scheider's every move were improvised at the director's behest.But more than conciseness, Jaws has dynamism and punch. Like another ace director of the previous generation, Victor Fleming, Spielberg encourages performances that really move. Take a scene like Richard Dreyfuss's inspection of the first victim. Rather than a professional study, the scene is staged like a heated argument, the actors waving their arms and snapping out their lines. Almost always there is movement ? characters walk as they talk, or stand before a busy crowd. The few moments of stillness ? Scheider with his family, the stirring Indianapolis speech ? are those of subtle significance, and their calmness helps them stand out.Of course Spielberg didn't operate in a vacuum. The invigorating style of Jaws is aided immensely by the tight editing of Verna Fields. Fields uses techniques of the art film ? jump cuts, rapid edits ? but with the difference that her use of them is purely functional, never attention-grabbing or stylistic, and as such she disguises her cuts to make them blend in like finest mise-en-scene. Take the beach scene where Scheider scans the seascape, fearful of another shark attack. Most of the cuts take place as an extra walks across the screen, softening them so that we barely realise the angles are changing.And it all works of course. Take this kind of professionalism, and you can make an exciting, box-office busting thriller about a shark, a dinosaur, a killer truck or whatever. This is why, when all those rip-off shark flicks began to appear (and I don't just mean the Jaws sequels ? the more recent Shark Attack franchise makes the Jaws offshoots look like masterpieces) they were invariably awful. They took the premise, killer-sharks-versus-humans, thinking that alone could make a hit. These are the true lowest-common-denominator cash-in trash. If a movie gets audiences flocking in to see it in phenomenal numbers, it surely must be a high-quality piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

This started big box office films, and almost none have matched it. Big films nowadays move way to fast. You don't ever get to take in the moment. With Jaws you always get to take in the moment. Everything moves at a good pace. The characters are all very good. The dialogue is great. A lot of people complain that the shark looks fake. I think it looks way more real than if it was CGI. It is also very scary. After this film nobody would go in the water. Jaws is an iconic piece of film that I love and will always love.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is "THE" Summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jaws' is considered the pioneer of the Summer blockbusters. After all, its impact and success made it a much copied movie, by giving birth to 3 sequels and different movies inspired on it (such as 'Deep Blue Sea'). But 'Jaws' is definitely THE Summer blockbuster (and also the one to own).Steven Spielberg was in the beginning of his career when he made this movie. Although he made other movies before, this was his first hit. Its success surprised even Spielberg himself. The movie is based on a 1974 book (same title) by Peter Benchley. I read the book and there are many differences...Filming of the movie took much longer than planned. It was supposed to take about 2 months, but ended up taking more than 5 months (also due to reliability issues with the mechanical sharks).'Jaws' is considered a classic in its genre. Indeed it is a great movie but also shocking. It is intense and combines strong suspense and horror. The shark is immense and intimidating. It is clearly over-sized, but that also makes the movie more terrifying. It looks a bit rubbery at times, but I don't think it looks as artificial as many do. Nicely filmed, the movie takes place in a fictional Summer resort town (Amity Island). The place looks very appealing, the sandy beach is big, beautiful and very inviting. And that's where the brutal shark's attacks occur. It's heaven and hell at the same time.The movie's got some of the most horrifying deaths ever in a movie. While not the scariest movie of its kind, it surely is scary when it is. In fact, I often read and heard that when the movie came out in 1975, never before had the cinemas been so full and the beaches so empty. It wasn't just because of the movie's euphoria, but also because of the shark's attacks seen in it (maybe more than the sharks's attacks in real life). Today the movie continues to marvel and shock audiences.And the soundtrack by the genial John Williams is strong and powerful, very appropriate for the movie. It gives the sensation of being spooky and carried with suspense, the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.Roy Scheider portrays the town's police chief Martin Brody. Richard Dreyfuss stars as the marine biologist Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw plays the rude fisherman and shark hunter Quint. Murray Hamilton is Larry Vaughn, the selfish Mayor of Amity Island. Ever since the beginning, Brody wants to close the beaches to protect beachgoers from the shark's attacks, but is overruled by the Mayor, who refuses to close the beaches because of his greed for money and also refuses to listen to or believe anybody. His selfishness costs lives, as we see in the film - including a child's life.The first half of the movie focus more on the attacks and also lets us know Amity Island and appreciate its scenario. The second half focus on the attempt to hunt the great beast.The movie's poster is great, even more so in the DVD cover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Suspense Films of All Time ! 10 out of 10 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 35 years "Jaws" still ranks as one of the Best Suspense films of ALL time ! Directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, music score by John Williams, this film delivers a wallop of thrills, and takes the viewer on a ride they will never forget.Some of the success of the film was really by accident. Mishaps galore caused numerous breakdowns of the multiple "Bruces", the Great White Turd, as Spielberg so aptly named him. This caused the shark scenes to be filmed last, but Spielberg did a terrific job while waiting for the shark repairs."Jaws" defines the Summer Blockbuster, and rightfully so. No film had ever made such an impact in the Summer Season until this movie hit the Silver Screen.The "hidden menace" is a great device to build a story around, because it is lurking just below the conscious and literal surface, and you must be ever vigilant to not be victimized.Benchleys Best Seller is about a rogue Great White Shark who infects the waters of Amity Island with dire consequences. In the mix is Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), whose disdain of the water is well documented. Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), denial is his strong suit, until the shark almost bites him in the ass. Sam Quint(Robert Shaw) as the crusty independent ex-navy sailor, whose life is on a crash course with destiny.Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) as the academic marine biologist whose style is 180 degrees of Quint.After a few swimmers are killed by the shark, the town of Amity hires Quint to find and kill him. Brody and Hooper go along for this sea adventure, and it gets intense. So there you have it , Great Director,Actors Script, Music, Score and Story. They all combine for a compelling time, and you will find yourself watching this darn film, over and over.Trivia: watching Richard Dreyfuss bite his lip when asked by Bob Costas if he was ever afraid of the shark, CLASSIC!By the way, there were different sharks used for the many scenes including half of a shark, left and right, even a shark on a dolly.Most of them suffered from mechanical failures.Trivia: The shooting stars overhead of Brody ,and later the boat are REAL. Usually the sign of Good Fortune. Different prints run 124 to 130 minutes.Trivia:Filmed in early spring, so look for allot of long sleeves.Gets a 10 out of 10 for just a Great Time !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws. Just saying the title makes John Williams' haunting score ring in my ears. When I first saw this movie when I was 7 years old, my life was changed. I'd never seen anything like it. It was breathtaking. For those who don't know, Jaws tells the tale of three men who set out on a perilous journey to try and stop a killer shark that has been terrorizing a small New England island. For the majority of the film, the shark is never seen. This builds up the tension until the big reveal. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss play the three men who set out to catch the shark, and they all give stellar performances. However, Shaw stands out the most. His speech about the USS Indianapolis is riveting, and each line he gives is perfectly delivered. The film also stars Lorraine Gary as Scheider's wife and the perfectly cast Murray Hamilton as the persistent Mayor Vaughn. The screenplay is written perfectly, and the character development is simply fantastic. Jaws is a great movie, and it will always be one of my favorites.</fullReview>

Humans are so arrogant, then they go up against nature and they get what comes up. I was still a little kid in grade school when I first saw Jaws. It frightened so many people off from swimming, no one I knew would go out to the deep water anymore after seeing it. It left such a psychic residue. It scares you by making you hyper-sensitive to a situation you took for granted before. Some people I know would still freak out if I even mention this subject as we enter the water. Apparently though Jaws is not one of his works Spielberg is all that fond of or proud of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could make a man go out into a hostile environment and fight a monster. This is the very heart of this story. When a rouge shark stakes his territory off the shore of Amity Island, the community responds first with disbelief then shock as the shark repeatedly takes victims.3 men venture out to catch the shark. Salty sea dog and shark hunter Quint has his own reasons, which I won't reveal here, but are not so dissimilar to that of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick. Hooper, a marine scientist has always been fascinated by sharks. Police Chief Brody who is scared of the water who must protect his community and his own family.Each person is an interesting character, and that is what makes the movie special. Mostly importantly it has the shark, a genuine monster that regularly causes the deaths of people in modern countries. If you have ever even paddled in the ocean you have visited the home of monsters.This movie is fabulous adaption of Peter Benchley's very famous book. The formula created in this movie for the battle between these men and the beast has been copied endlessly in monster movies since, but never so well.It genuinely reawakened humans fears of sharks (but shark fear was written about in Jule's Verne's 20,000 Leagues under the sea) and stopped people going to the beach. However, Peter Benchley has since spent much of his life campaigning against his own book for the preservation of sharks. In truth sharks don't often eat people, the usually take a bite, think "yuk" and spit them out again.It is a movie that should be on everyone's must see list and worth returning to if you are feeling jaded by some of the current monster fests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSOne night in the small seaside town of Amity, two teenagers decided to go for a swim. The girl, Christine, was already in the water as the boy was still undressing. Then, all of a sudden, something from under the water swam up and attacked Christine. It was Jaws, the meanest, nastiest shark in the entire ocean.Martin Brody was the new police chief in town. He investigated the attack from the previous night and concluded it was a shark attack. He wanted to close the beaches, but Mayor Vaughn said he'd have nothing of it because the 4th of July was approaching and the 4th of July celebration is the only thing that attracts tourists to Amity so Brody was told to keep a lid on it. Then at the beach, Jaws was sighted. He attacked a little boy. The city council tried to decide what to do, then in came a gruff sailor, Quint. He volunteered to catch the shark, for a price. They turned him down; a young oceanographer, Matt Hooper, arrived in Amity and met with Brody. Hooper was an expert on sharks. He had a close encounter with one as a lad. Meanwhile, Ben Forester and some other men set out to catch Jaws and they did in fact catch a shark! But Hooper was convinced the shark they caught was not the one who attacked those people so he and Brody do an autopsy then hit the water to search for Jaws. Hooper has another close encounter. Then another shark attack at the beach finally convinces the mayor to do something about it so they hire Quint. Brody and Hooper accompany Quint on his boat, The Orca. They bring along all kinds of weapons. Hooper brings along an underwater cage then they ship off, Hooper at the wheel and Quint shouting out orders.The men find Jaws. They harpoon some barrels to him so they could keep track of him. They try numerous times to destroy him, but miss each time. Jaws attacks their boat. Hooper get's in the cage and attempts to shoot poison into Jaws and is nearly killed. Jaws hit the boat again, causing Quint to slide right into his powerful jaws. Also, an oxygen tank slid into his mouth so Brody aimed and fired- KABOOM! Jaws was no more. Hooper surfaced and together they swam back to Amity.A pretty great movie. Well done. Steven Spielberg was at the height of his career when he did this movie. Actually, this started his career. Was very popular. You know, for years after this movie came out, beaches all across the nation were empty. It actually made people believe there were killer sharks waiting to chomp you to bits; Jaws had three sequels: Jaws 2 in 1978. I haven't seen it but I'll bet it's pretty good. Jaws 3 in 1983. I saw Jaws 3 and it was just awful! And finally in 1986 came Jaws: The Revenge which I haven't seen but I've heard nothing but bad things. Anyhoo, nothing beats the original. If you haven't already seen Jaws, see it! Roy Scheider is here, so is Richard Dreyfuss who's been in just about everything and the late Robert Shaw. In conclusion, Jaws is the Citizen Kane of killer shark movies! Good work, Steve!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the B movie became the A movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the history of the cinema, this film (along with Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc.) will be remembered as the beginning of a new era. One hallmark of this new era, which is still with us, is that the genres that used to be confined to B movies--such as science fiction and horror--are now the subjects of major, respectable motion pictures. To me, it is a little sad that the "big" movies no longer aspire to serious themes, but instead confine themselves to the stuff of comic books. After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us. People go to the movies to see fancy special effects and get cheap thrills, not necessarily to explore interesting characters and stories.That being said, the movie that started it all is still enjoyable on its own terms, particularly the second half, when it becomes a Moby Dick story of three men on a boat chasing and being chased by a big fish. The movie does a good job of showing the camaraderie that develops among the three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie still today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is about a new police chief named Martin Brody played by Roy Scheider. As a new police chief in a small beach town he quickly is informed that a local woman has been killed by a shark. With the 4th of July holiday approaching the chief knows the beaches will be packed as well as the water. He tries to talk Mayor Vaughn played by Murray Hamilton into shutting down the beaches, but the Mayor has not intentions of doing such a thing. The Mayor's main concern is the amount of money the town is going to make over the weekend and doesn't want to scare any of that money away. The Mayor refuses to shut down the beach even though Chief Brody and a scientist who studies sharks Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) beg him to.The 4th of July weekend approaches and the town has all heard of the shark who has killed a local woman and no one is in the water. Mayor Vaughn encourages the people to get in the water, and they do. This ended up being a bad idea. Shortly after the people began playing and swimming in the water the shark appears, and ends up killing a local man. The Mayor then realizes something has to been done, especially with the thought that his children were in the water that day as well. So the Mayor agrees to pay a local fisherman he request amount to kill the shark, and the Chief as well as the scientist Hooper join him. This local fisherman named Sam Quint, played by Robert Shaw, seems to have a great deal of experience with sharks and definitely views them as something to be feared.This trip out to sea ends up being a shocker to them all. The first time you really get to see the shark is when Chief Brody is throwing chum in the water and the shark sneaks up and then pops out of the water. Chief Brody is in such amazement all he says is we are going to need a bigger boat. Up to this point in the movie you really don't realize how big the shark is, the buildup of size in the beginning of the film you understand the shark is larger than normal, but the first time you see it you are amazed by its size. At this point the battle is on against the shark. Along this trip you learn a lot about the people aboard the boat. One of the greatest moments of the film is when Quint gives his story about being aboard the SS Indianapolis and you learn why he has the feelings he has about sharks. The movie Jaws was released in June of 1975, which was the year I was born, but has always been one of my all time favorites. Jaws was one the first horror movies I ever saw and it really scared me. I still do not like to go into the ocean to this day because of this movie. There are several parts of the movie which give you the view of the person being attacked and puts you in their place, which is frightening. The most memorable items of the film is the music. That music is universal for a shark. When you start to hear the dun dun?..dun dun?.dumb dumb dumb, it just sends a feeling of fear all though your body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This blockbuster about a shark feasting on crowds at a summer resort launched Spielberg's career into the stratosphere. The success of this film can be attributed to the chemistry among the three stars: Scheider as the police chief, Shaw as the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss as a marine scientist. Shaw, who met with an untimely death three years later, is particularly memorable as the cantankerous Quint. Of course they are just supporting actors to the real star: Bruce the shark. Spielberg does a masterful job of generating suspense and terror. Williams adds to the tension with the throbbing theme music that is quite effective if unoriginal (he lifted it from Dvorak's Ninth Symphony).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws. A shark is killing people in Amity Island. The only people who can stop it are Chief Brody, Hooper, and a sailor named Quint.In the beginning scene, a girl decides to go skinny dipping in the ocean. Not a very smart move. We see her getting attacked, but by what? A shark. We don't see the offender, but the girl dies, and we assume there is something terrible in the water.So, that's how it starts off. Events lead up to the thrilling climax. We are quickly thrilled by a fast-moving story. The audience is excited when the three men set out at to kill the menacing shark.Sure, a movie 30 years old probably isn't scary right now, but perhaps at its time. So, what do we have, here? You will be glad to watch the thrilling, fast-moving, and genius movie "Jaws." Well, it's entertaining at least. The story is a bit similar to many B-movies, but "Jaws" doesn't have a moment of bad acting or a single plot hole. Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg are geniuses. The only things I didn't enjoy were the fact that the shark was pretty cheesy, and that there were boring parts. Oh well?? 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How good acting, editing, directing and music can overcome a silly script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a testament to Spielberg's talent that he could make a movie like Jaws into a revered classic. The plot is incredible silly. You have a ocean full of perfectly edible creatures. Yet the SUPER shark only munches on people from one particular beach in New England. Yeah,un-huh, sure.But guess what, it works. Spielberg wisely builds up the suspense. We know the shark is out there and hungry. Yet we have to use our imagination on just how scary the shark is. So the tension and suspence builds and builds as the movie progresses. The New England setting works effectively. The extras all look and act like normal people. Giving the movie a sense of believability that say a Flordia beach setting would lack. The acting is wonderful. Shaw,Scneider and Dreyfuss throw themselves completely into their roles. Even if the characters are rather one dimensional. You can almost feel their fear at the climax. John Williams music is tight, but effective. Usually when Williams scores a movie he practically has music for every scene. (Which most of the time is a good thing) But keeping it to a minimum it's builds the suspence. Recommend if nothing else so many cliches stem from this movie's success. That and Kevin Smith references it in almost all his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws Is To Spielberg As Psycho Is To Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the many blockbuster films Steven Spielberg directed, I wonder if this might wind up as his most famous years from now. Like Hitchcock and "Psycho," it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching. The shark, which can look a little phony on occasions, is still frightening and the music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing. The more I watch this, the more I wish the shark had eaten more of them, like Richard Dreyfuss and Murray Hamilton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something terrifying about open water that has etched itself upon the human psyche . Undoubtedll this is because our natural survival instincts tell us to keep away from it . We can't see , hear or smell what's under the waves and we can't breathe in water either and anything that can has got one over on us . Why do you think there's been so many legends about sea monsters ? And the success of JAWS is entirely down to the way that it exploits mans fear of the sea The great thing about this movie is how focused it is , Spielberg's cut out all the crap from the book like the politics of the town , and the sexual subplots and made the ending truly climatic . Compare this film version to Peter Benchley's BEAST which is basically the same story where a greedy capitalist is in denial , an obsessive boatman tries to catch the monster etc the only real difference is that BEAST features a giant squid as the monster . You would probably be correct in arguing that JAWS is the only time when a film adaptation actually improves over the source novel Sadly at the age of 28 the then unknown Steven Sielberg seems to have reached his creative peak . True EMPIRE OF THE SUN , SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN may contain more artistic achievements but JAWS is certainly a more consistent movie that's difficult to fault . The only time there's any disappointment is when the eponymous shark appears in the last segment of the movie . It's obviously a giant animontronic model of some kind and since Spielberg has spent so much time using very effective suspense like the soundtrack and the shark's POV for much of the running time the on screen revelation is unfortunately going to be a disappointment But let's not talk about minor disappointment and just admire what the director has given us here . We know that someone is going to get chewed up on the crowded beach so Spielberg teases us . A fat woman walks past the screen and the audience snigger " I bet she'd make a good meal for the shark " so everyone in the audience puts money on Mrs Obesity being eaten , especially when she's surrounded by cute kids because cute kids never get eaten in movies . ooopppps I spoke too soon . Perhaps the reason it is a good film is because Spielberg has ignored convention , certainly we don't get drowned in sentiment or family life , unlike say THE TERMINAL or ET . Non existent are the other Spielberg faults like overlong shot duration , here everything is shot in a very snappy manner and the movie is quite rightly regarded as a classic fright fest</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Job Spielster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was when I liked Mr. Spielberg's movies. Jaws was an original movie that gave us suspense, entertainment, and a little bit of fear when going ocean swimming. The Spielster filmed some of "Jaws" in Australia where great white sharks are a regular feature on the beaches. The sharks never swim between the flags though so you are safe there.Some movies don't age, although unfortunately for "Jaws" the special effects cause it to age quite quickly. I won't hold this against the Spielster though, with "Jaws" he came out with a classic.A well earned 7.5 out of 10 for the Spielster this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About four minutes into Jaws and one can quickly understand why it was the first summer blockbuster. Directed by Steven Spielberg in 1975, Jaws sets the tone of anticipatory horror that it maintains throughout the whole film immediately from the opening shots. Starring Roy Scheider; in a brilliantly subtle commanding performance, along with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, Jaws tells the tale of a quiet beach town that gets the shock of their lives when they discover their calm waters have been overtaken by a man- eating shark intent to kill. The second entry on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills list, it is no wonder audiences around the globe still site Jaws as the reason they are reluctant to enter the water at the beach.Amity Island's brand new Sheriff, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is trepidatious of the water anyway and seems like he'd be happier to return to his family's home in New York. Shortly after his arrival, there is evidence of a shark attack, as a girl turns up dead on the shore after a night of partying. For a town that solely depends on the revenue from its beaches for survival, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) scoffs at the initial recommendation from Sheriff Brody to close the beach. Unable to surmount the incredible resistance, Brody relinquishes his better judgment in favor of keeping the beaches open, as few people knew about the incident with the girl anyway. To Brody's regret, a boy is attacked and killed by a shark the next weekend. The boy's mother causes an influx of fisherman flooding Amity Island after she offers a $3000 reward for the capture and killing of the shark that killed her son. Among those that flood the Island are Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), from the Oceanographic Institute who specializes in hunting Great White sharks. Still reluctant to close the beach, Mayor Vaughn instructs Brody to assemble a team and go to any means necessary to make the beach safe. A local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) agrees to hunt the shark, vowing to be able to kill it and bring peace to Amity Island. The three men, arm themselves into a boat that they soon realize is too small, and immerse themselves into the habitat of the creature. Steven Spielberg is at his best in this film. No stone is left unturned in the creation of the world of Amity Island. Each aspect of filmmaking, among them: the camera work, the writing, and the acting are nothing short of fantastic. Most of the success of this film must be paid to the famously haunting score composed by John Williams. As good as the story and as visually striking as Jaws was, had it not been for Williams' score, I doubt that people would be talking about it as much as they still do, 40 years after its release. Character development is phenomenal in Jaws, as well. Each main character has a completely fleshed out (see what I did there) story which is often lacking in films. Spielberg's camera work in this film, especially his exquisite use of foreground, middle ground, and background illustrates why he has the status as a director that he does. Filled with incredible shots, such as the scene in which the audience sees Brody typing "shark attack" on the death report of the first victim are a tribute to Spielberg's prowess in the director's chair. With a cast of likable characters, an infectiously adventurous plot, and a thrilling unpredictable protagonist, it is easy to see why Jaws still lives in the recesses of our minds 40 years after its release. Still noted for being the first summer blockbuster, the reputation of Jaws has not been lost despite its 1975 release date. Surprisingly, notwithstanding the advancements in special effects since the mid- 70's; Jaws has not dated very much at all, still creating a scare for today's audiences. Jaws does the amazing feat, indicative of a highly skilled director, of scarcely showing the beast of the film, yet instilling fear in the audience. Thankfully, there is not much of summer left for me to ponder the chances of my being attacked by a shark; yeah, Jaws is that good, even in 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the greatest 'underwater menace' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty-five years after it was first released, Spielberg's timeless classic still hasn't aged a day and retains that chilling suspense and tension which first propelled it into the limelight in the first place. A masterpiece in fear and terror, this is an expertly-crafted film (everything about it is just right: the pacing, the story, the acting, the cinematography) packed with believable, realistic characters who you know and care about, and plenty of nail-biting moments and scares. It also boasts an incredible last fifty minutes, which is basically a cat and mouse game between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw and the Great White itself.At first, the film introduces us to the main characters, showing them investigating and sometimes floundering about, unsure of what action to take. The scenes of victims getting pulled under the waves are occasionally gruesome and quite terrifying, especially for a non-swimmer such as myself. As the attacks grow more frequent there are lots of those scenes of people panicking which PIRANHA spoofed so mercilessly. All this is in line with the classic ominous music which quite rightly won an Oscar and gives the film that extra suspense. Having watched this film as a child, I can verify that there is one cheap shock which scared the heck out of me when I was younger. It involves Dreyfess investigating an abandoned ship. As he examines the hull underwater, all of a sudden a white head pops out of a hole, one of the eyes eaten away by fish. This alone helped me to have loads of nightmares and, seen today, it's still pretty disturbing.The final hour ups the film a notch into classic status. Essentially it becomes a three-hander, and Spielberg piles on the tense atmosphere. A lot of the film plays on our fear of the unknown, giving us brief glimpses of the shark but nothing more. I'm not surprised that this film put people off swimming in the ocean. Thankfully when the shark does make itself seen at the end, the giant model used is pretty good (for the time) and pretty menacing. Only one shot, of it rearing up against the boat, looks false. Other scenes of it gliding just under the water's surface are terrific.The acting from the three main cast members is excellent, all three men are as good as each other in a different way. A hairy Richard Dreyfess is the likable, slightly clumsy marine biologist, while Roy Scheider is the tough police chief who you wouldn't like to mess with. We don't really learn a lot about his character except that he's honest, fair, and above all else a family man. And that's enough for us, to know that he's a decent character who will inevitably win out against the menace at the end. However, I would say that the superb mannered turn from Robert Shaw as the ship's captain is the highlight of the film. Shaw instils his character with a kind of gruff charm that makes it impossible not to like him.In the final half an hour, the isolated ship starts taking in water and slowly sinks, while the shark plays with the humans on board and the waters keep getting redder and redder with blood. The action-packed finale is truly nail-biting and, I would say, one of the best endings in a film ever. All of this and more helps JAWS to remain the final word in underwater horror. Suffice to say, a handful of lesser imitations followed, author/screenwriter Peter Benchley spent the rest of his life rewriting the same kind of tale and the three sequels got progressively worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you ask me, there are only a hand full of movies that I can call "perfect", and this is one of them! Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody, the Chief of Police on the quiet island of Amity, and how his life was changed forever one fateful summer. It all starts with the mysterious death of a skinny dipper, soon found in pieces on the shore. Believing it to be a shark attack, Brody attempts to close the beaches, but this upsets the mayor of Amiry Island, who's main goal is to make money off the tourists coming to the island. Things become worse when a little boy is also killed by the same shark, putting fear and anxiety in the hearts of Amity's people. Trying to find a way to stop this shark before he strikes again, he teams up with Matt Hooper, an oceanographer hired to find out more about the shark and how it works, and Quint, a war vet with a terrifying past and a vast amount of sea shanties to sing as he hunts down this great white. Will they find and kill the shark? Or will they be the latest thing on its menu?First thing to comment on, of course, is the story. No other person on this Earth could write a more realistic, terrifying, and classic story like this! The movie is based on the book written by Peter Benchley, so he is given the praise for making one of the best stories ever put on paper and screen! Next up, the acting. Jaws gave us the best performances from Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and, most of all, Robert Shaw as Quint. His performance has sent chills doe the spines of many, and those chills never stop. Next, the score. It's John Williams. That's all I need to say. Up next, the effects. This is the only negative part of this movie. The effects are not the greatest, and especially considering the budget of the film, which I calculated as over $35,000,000, it's a wonder how this shark looked so strange. However, you have to admit that it was a good idea to keep the mechanical shark hidden until the final third. The shark may look odd, but it still scares the crap out of me to this day. Finally, the cinematography. The film is very beautiful and you can see that by just looking at the multiple screenshots. It's dark and disturbing when it needs to be, as well as nice and pretty when it needs to. Really, this review can't do this movie justice. All I have to say is watch this movie. Just don't watch it before going to the beach. You never know what could be down there...</fullReview>

But it is also so much more than simply an action movie or a horror movie. Jaws is an outstanding drama with well realized characters and great dialog, largely delivered by one of the all time best trio of performances ever together on film. Richard Dreyfuss gives us a comical and interesting scientist; Roy Schieder, a relatable protagonist, and Robert Shaw should have been nominated for an Oscar for his brilliant work. (Schieder too for that matter, he often gets overlooked due to Shaw's show stopping characterization. This is not a movie about a shark attacking people. It is a movie about three diverse personalities dealing with the shark. An all time classic.</fullReview>

Jaws is an adaptation of Peter Benchely's 1974 novel "Jaws." Still to this day people are scared of what is swimming below because of this classic film. Jaws is a movie about an unstable great white shark that is eating everything and everyone in its path. The film is based around a small island community called "Amity," and shot on location at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The main star of the movie Chief Brady (Roy Scheider) is tasked with stopping this eating machine with the help of Marie Biologist and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). Along with fighting the shark Chief Brady has to fight the town board to close the beaches, which are the small towns only source of income. Chief Brody tries desperately to convince the towns people to listen to him because with the beaches open there is a virtual buffet served up for this 25- foot beast. To help corral the killer Chief Brody enlists roughneck shark hunt Quint (Robert Shaw), who hates sharks more than anyone. These three heroes go where no one else wants to go, the water, to kill this behemoth knowing they no match for the creature. The truly amazing part of this movie is the score it is simple, but terrifying. Who knew that just two cords could have the effect it did on this film and people still to this day. The Jaws theme song is instantly recognizable. I remember as a younger man that every time I was at the public pool or lake that at least one other child would have his hands above his head like a shark fin and move through the water singing, dun da dun da dun da. This movie was mainly shot with hand-held cameras is rough seas. The views of the ocean and the authenticity of the shark are breathtaking. This is a keep you at the edge of your seat kind of film. There is no wonder this movie was the highest grossing film of all time until Star Wars in 1977. Jaws received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and won three Oscars for best sound, best film editing, and best music- original dramatic score. If you haven't seen this movie get out there and watch it. You will appreciate seeing the shark that started it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true definition of a classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is a movie you can see one hundred times and it never gets old or fails to entertain in the way it had its first time. In fact, you love it more and more with each view. There is movie magic in this film that is almost divine. It almost feels like an artist throwing everything up against the wall and miraculously the material forms itself into some kind of vintage masterpiece. Where the movie really sets itself apart from the rest is in the final third, where it breaks all horror conventions by somehow formulating an iconic interaction of the three contrasting characters, all likable: Hooper, Quint, and Brody. The scenes the three of these have together are some kind of an ideal in filmmaking- they're raw, improvised, and each actor completely takes control of their characters in a way that makes the contrast feel even more real. It makes for great scenes, effective drama, and every moviegoer's favorite- memorable, quotable lines and dialogue. Shaw not receiving at least a nomination might be one of the top three biggest snubs in Academy Award history. His two iconic monologues, especially the Indianapolis, are among the most memorable in movie history. In fact, he not only should have been nominated, but he probably should have won. A classic movie, more rare than ever before in recent decades, is one you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it. It entertains constantly and finds a special place in your heart. It contains some sort of magic, perhaps with Jaws it is originality or just that raw, risk-taking filmmaking that just sticks, and you just can't seem to change the channel whenever it's on. It withstands the test of time and dozens of views. That is a rarity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deals with a single theme: the shark attacks on humans. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, it has Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the lead roles.Regarded by many as Spielberg's consecration film (I don't quite agree, I think E.T. was most notable at this point), this thriller has become one of the most popular films of the seventies, a real milestone of cinema. Honor is made to it's director, who knew how to work the central theme and skilfully use special effects he had at his disposal, even if we think also in the failure he was trying to use that unfortunate mechanical shark. In fact, it was better that way because we have more fear of what we don't see. The actors went well with his role, particularly Shaw. The script was innovative for it's time, being the first to address shark attacks. The sound effects are excellent and John Williams created one of the most impressive soundtracks of all the history of cinema. It's impossible not to feel the heart beating faster when he heard that song that, unsurprisingly, has become a classic. This film won three Oscars (Best Sound, Best Soundtrack and Best Editing) and the Golden Globe for Best Soundtrack.It's not a mere coincidence that Spielberg is one of the few directors who won two Oscars. He is meticulous, inventive, perfectionist and genial. Although this film does not understand why sharks attack people (usually confusing them with seals and other animals in their food chain) and have caused a real stigma against them that still makes them deeply misunderstood, it was able to maintain it's popularity and continues today to be the target of admiration of the public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg captures the thriller aspect of Jaws in different elements than ever seen before in 1975, when this film was released. Although it was noted that the production costs were going over budget and there seemed to be many malfunctions with the robotic sharks, there would be a big surplus. The editing done to capture the camera work between the great white shark and people being terrorized was unique during the time this film was released. It is considered a classic also for the soundtrack to create tension for viewers watching the film and anticipating what will happen for the survival of the characters after encountering a shark. Overall Jaws had the highest grossing film of all time until other well-recognized films would top this. It is difficult for the audience to miss the camera work of extreme close-ups between the characters in the film and the close up of the sharks as the suspense is built throughout. Steven Spielberg took this creativity of the staging for this film and worked with the elements of water. Spielberg generally avoided low-key lighting during the film so viewers could clearly see the distance of the shark and it's victims. He took this film to the next level of shocking viewers using a soundtrack that keeps the audience on its toes for what will happen next as the camera zooms in to the shark. Actors, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss worked incredibly well together that will have the audience anticipate what will happen as they encounter the great white shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a man-eating Great White shark makes the shores of Amity it's feeding ground and closing the beaches isn't an option because the island's summer tourist trade will be affected, hydrophobic police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) enlists the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) to help him hunt the beast.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a rare case of the movie being considered better than the book, cutting out much of the novel's miscellany (including a mafia and marital infidelity plot line) choosing to focus only the battle between man and beast giving a more concise and concentrated story, quite literally throwing you in at the deep end with the demise of doomed free-spirited skinny dipper, Chrissie in the opening scene.Often quoted as being the first big summer blockbuster--and the movie certainly was successful--I resent the label as it implies that Jaws has nothing of substance to offer. While the scenes on and in the water provide the thrills, the scenes on dry land show and develop well-rounded and engaging characters that you truly want to root for. All three of the main male characters are superb in their respective roles.Robert Shaw as tough sea-dog, Quint is a fan favourite, however I find myself far more drawn to out-of-depth everyman Brody and science minded Hooper. With that said, Shaw plays the part perfectly and his delivery of the USS Indianapolis speech is chilling and one of the great moments in cinema.Of course I couldn't review Jaws without mentioning John William's brilliant music score. The Jaws theme did for swimming what Psycho did for taking showers; just those first few notes alone have the ability to strike fear into the minds of anyone who dares step into the water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Jaws is the tale of the great white shark who terrorized a small town and took more than its fair share of victims. In the beginning of the story we meet a new sheriff who is very distraught about a couple of tragic incidents.&nbsp; He is determined to take action to stop these vicious and deadly shark attacks.&nbsp; However, the small town of Amity is a tourist destination and is dependent on the income it derives in the summertime.&nbsp; Shark attack or not, the town cares more about bringing in money rather than preventing deaths. Amity is a small tourist town that clearly has never had many problems before.&nbsp; It's a place that is known for its friendly townspeople, good weather, great beaches, and amazing surfing. In the very beginning of the movie we see a teenage girl swimming at night just off shore and in one second is yanked under the water.&nbsp; The next scene reveals her washed up remains on the beach and it is clear that she has been attacked by something. The sheriff believes that it was a shark but the local townsmen insist that it was just a drowning. The sheriff is skeptical and wants to get to the bottom of the attack but is met with resistance, especially from the mayor, who tells him to open the beaches and shut his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the first weekend of the summer season and the tourists come in force to enjoy the beaches and warm weather. The sheriff is very reluctant to let people swim and warns his own family to stay out of the ocean. Shockingly, another attack happens right in front of their faces.&nbsp; A small boy's life is taken by the shark and that forces the closure of the beaches again. The fishermen go to work, determined to find the killer shark and bring peace back to the town.&nbsp; Before long a shark is caught and the people rejoice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a marine biologist, who had come to research the attacks, along with the sheriff, realize that the shark that was caught, could not be the shark who killed the two people off the shores of Amity. They both explain this to the mayor but he doesn't listen, and announces to everyone that the waters are safe. As the real shark continues its tear on the small town, a team consisting of the sheriff, the marine biologist, and a mysterious old fisherman set off to find and kill the great shark. Jaws is a bone chilling story that is emotional and terrifying. The suspenseful music sparks immediate fear without even seeing or hearing the horrific monster from below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Tis a Remorseless Eating Machine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Jaws' titular character one of the scariest movie monsters? Ultimately, it's a common great white shark that lacks the genetic and/or supernatural enhancements expected in horror antagonists. One explanation is its hunting ground, which is a place we cannot imagine anything bad happening. Besides its safety and beautiful weather, Amity Island is perfectly evocative of childhood beach-going memories. Adding terror to this idyllic blend makes it all the more terrifying. The three leads' all-consuming relationship with the beast also explains its near-mythological status. After all, it would take some kind of monster for someone like Hooper to devote his life to studying it and a hell of an encounter for someone like Quint to devote his to turning them into trophies. As for Brody, while hardly a shark expert, his every waking thought concerns stopping a single shark from ruining paradise and harming his family. Regardless, all of these elements could still result in a monster that makes audiences laugh instead of shudder. Spielberg and company prevented this from happening in one of the most famous instances of doing more with less in movie history. Since the mechanical shark prop was too cumbersome for extended use, the director made substitutions such as showing the beast from a first-person perspective and by revealing the aftermaths of its feeding frenzies instead of the shark itself. Besides adding tension, these flourishes make it more possible to imagine the monster not as a shark, but as the stuff of nightmares killing machine that Hooper and Quint describe. John Williams' theme for the shark is another prime example of doing more with less. Its simple repeated phrase not only adds an undercurrent of dread, but also mystery as to when and where the beast will attack. In the end, Jaws proves that a monster does not need an elaborate history or otherworldly origins. With enough movie-making magic, it can simply be an animal looking for its next hot lunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best Shark movie of all time Steven Spielberg directs this film in a very beautiful way with a good cast and a good story it still amazes me how this got a PG-13 rating because it doesn't feel that way when i first saw it it scared the hell out of me but now it's still hunting but not scary i mean common the shark is still fake. Another thing that i loved was the theme it's creepy but at the same time it has this Jurassic Park feeling. Everyone did an incredible job with this film it was awesome and i loved it. Jaws had 3 sequels Jaws 2, Jaws 3D and Jaws: The Revenge you definitely should see the 2nd one the other 2 not that much. Final Verdict 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gas bottle falls on his fingers - he screams. He screams sliding toward the shark. And again, when he is in the mouth of the shark - more screaming and blubbering. I thought he was a salty old sea dog? How come he resorts to screaming and panicking? Was he seeking attention by screaming and blubbering so much? How come he did not consider that he was upsetting Brody? I believe Quint was being selfish in those final moments.I personally believe that Quint should have just slid toward the shark in silence and then mustered the stamina to stay quiet while he was being eaten. A final act of bravery instead of screaming and panicking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film Ever Made....(In My Opinion, That Is!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straight out the gate , I must admit that I love this Movie!! Ever since I first saw it at the age of 3 when it was premiered on TV. I have watched Jaws more times than any other film, and I have seen a lot. This film has everything you could want from a movie, thrills, chills and excitement, as well as a great story and some damn fine acting from three of the best of they're times. The scenery, Camera- work and pacing are all top notch, but then again would you expect anything less from a Master Film Maker like Spielberg?As i mentioned previously, the actors in this movie are all excellent, especially the three main characters Brody, Quint and the excellent Quint. Roy Scheider is great as the put upon town sheriff Martin Brody, and a Young Richard Dreyfuss has just enough smart ass knowledge to be likable as Matt Hooper, But undoubtedly the greatest role went to Robert Shaw who plays the hard drinking, abrasively salty sea Captain Samuel Quint, the movies own take on Captain Ahab!Other standout roles are Lorraine Gary as Brody's long suffering Wife Ellen and Murray Hamilton as the weasel like Town Mayor Larry Vaughne.Then of course we must mention Bruce.... The name given to the much maligned mechanical shark that was used in this movie by Spielberg is also the name of his Lawyer. Much has been written about the nightmare the crew had filming out at sea with a shark that didn't want to stop sinking etc, but in the end great craftsmanship made it all work out for the better.I hold this movie in very high regard and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good time with a few scares here and there along the way.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws (1975): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton: Triumphant masterpiece about that one creature that strikes fear into the depths of the ocean and the so-called safety of the shallow. A great white shark has attacked and killed a few locals at a small community of Amity, and the Sheriff sets out along with a biologist and a skilled fisherman to kill the creature. After a grand start with films such as Sugarland Express, director Steven Spielberg put his name on the map while tapping in on one of humanity's greatest animal fears. Roy Scheider is superb as Sheriff Brody who investigates the killings before having to force the resort to be shut down. He is afraid of water and that will be tested when he faces his finned rival to the finish. Robert Shaw plays the skilled yet over confident fisherman who demands a reward for the catch but his boast will be put to the test during a struggle for survival. Richard Dreyfuss steals scenes as a biologist who faces danger in a cage lowered into the water. Lorraine Gary plays Brody's supportive wife whose son suffers from shock. Murray Hamilton plays the stubborn Mayor who waits until tragedy before closing the area. The shark isn't seen until the second half but once it emerges we hear the famous line that visualizes how big the threat really is, "We're going to need a bigger boat." Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

I love the theme song that comes on before every death so it gets you prepared for the death that is about to happen. I also like the lines they have in the movie the most famous one is "we're gonna need a bigger boat" that is the best line in the movie. I love the fact that the shark is literally bigger then life its amazing. I really wish they remake the movie so the shark looks a little more real so it can be more scary then the first movie.

		<fullReview>When Hooper dives on Ben Gardener's wrecked boat and is investigating the hole/s in the hull, Gardener's corpse floats into view, shocking Hooper into dropping the sharks tooth, as well as his flashlight and diving knife. When Hooper swims back to his own boat he says nothing about the discovery to Chief Brody, nor does he mention the body when arguing with the Mayor about closing the beaches. Surely the fact that the shark has killed yet another person would lend weight to his opinion yet he says nothing about it. Later in the movie it is mentioned that Gardener is still "missing", even if the body floated out of the boat when it was towed in, I imagine that a police forensic examination would conclude that Gardener was killed in the attack on the boat.Any ideas on this puzzling behaviour?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Monster movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws. The film that will haunt you every time you go swimming in the ocean. What a great film! Fantastic acting from Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss on the edge of your chair suspense (due to the memorable score by John Williams) and a superb ending.This film really hits home and tugs at the heart strings when each victim is consumed by the terrifyingly large fish that scars the lives of the victims families and engraves itself inside of them. You get close to the 3 main characters- Brody, Quint and Hooper thereby understanding what type of characters they are and how they'd react in certain situations so this shows how well Spielberg presents his interesting cast to the audience.We care about these characters and their goals to put an end to the monster's life so this makes it all the more tragic when it doesn't go to plan. Out of the three I can relate most to Hooper, who isn't used to a fisher man's life and seems to be content on focusing on the academic side of things.There are a lot of hilarious moments when Quint and Hooper verbally fight and the sarcastic and dark nature of Hooper's humour provides that light hearted side to this Horror film.The tension building up to the ending does indeed pay off, it would be a sin if Hollywood were to remake this classic as they'd never capture the great personalities of the characters or the suspenseful moments that this film brings. I give this film a 8.4/10 -highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Jaws is a movie shot with brilliance and filled with Alfred Hitchcock level suspense (which is the only reason why he didn't want to meet his biggest fan which was Spielberg, because he "made the fish movie." That Hitchcock wanted to direct so badly but was already working on his final movie Family Plot (1976) at the time. The movie stars Roy Scheider as New England police chief Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider) a man who wants to have a good time at the beach until all horror breaks loose because great white sharks are coming ashore to kill people. Then after he realizes what is going on at the beaches he teams up with an oceanographer (played by Richard Dreyfuss), and the captain of a tiny boat (played by Robert Shaw)and set out to kill the shark.The score to this movie is nothing short of fantastic from John Williams as well as being suspenseful and creepy at the same time. Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss are just flawless with their excellent performances in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Jaws Movie and the Only Good One IMO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws 1 is the only Jaws movie I would actually watch. The movie has everything, gore, screams, frights and everything you could possibly want in a horror movie. It all starts when Crissie Watkins goes out for a late night swim and is killed by a shark. The mayor keeps the beaches open, and as a result, a young boy is killed next. Next comes a frenzy of people wanting to kill the shark for a reward and they kill the wrong shark. On Independence Day, a prank by two boys takes a scary turn when the shark gets into the estuary and eats a man and almost kills 3 boys, knocking one unconscious. Police Chief Martin Brody, Oceanologist Matt Hooper and Grizzled Fisherman Quint go on a dangerous mission to kill the shark. The shark is revealed to be a twenty five footer and as the men attempt to kill it, many things go wrong and its a fight for survival. This is horror at its best. Whoever says it isn't horror is pure stupid because this movie is possibly the scariest I have ever seen. I wouldn't watch the sequels, as they aren't that good, but Jaws 1 is a great Summer blockbuster that will frighten many generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was Steven Spielberg's directorial debut, and it really put him on the Hollywood spotlight. Basically, a great white shark begins attacking beach-goers on the small town of Amity Island. As more and more people die, a fisherman (Quint), the chief of police (Brody), and an oceanic expert (Hooper) set out to catch the beast. It ends with Quint being eaten alive by the shark and Hooper goes into a shark cage to try to poison the shark but the shark attacks him and he merely escapes. Finally, Brody kills the shark by putting a compressed air tank into the shark's mouth and shooting it so it blows up in a slow-motion, bloody explosion of epic proportions! This is my favorite movie of all time, and if you've seen this movie, you'd know exactly why. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go see it! It's worth it! Well guys, that's my review! See ya later!</fullReview>

Produced in the mid 70's, this movie lurked through countless theaters, snapping off bits and pieces on screen, challenging the courage of every viewer. This was no boating accident?this was a very hungry stomach lined with huge teeth and propelled by fins. This carcarion carcarius eats and eats and eats.

The movie counted on, more important things. Let's see?it has an outstanding cast, some excellent directing and the perfect music. The original book wasn't bad either?although there were minor adjustments to the story?Hell, there were some really major changes made. Trust me, I'm not complaining, just observing. Just in case you have never seen the movie, let me give you a run-down, a teaser, if you like. "Spoiler Coming?so Watch Your Eyes." Some town is terrified by great-big-white shark and Harry is wearing one ugly hat. Sheriff Brody grabs up Matt Hooper, cuts open a shark ? finds a license plate and decides this is the wrong shark. The two of them pal-up with cranky-snarly-angry Quint, boat owner and shark fisherman. Farewell and adieu you ladies of Spain, the boys have some sharking to do. That danged shark is a monster. They do need a bigger boat. Sheriff Brody even says, 'We need a bigger boat." Too bad it is way too obvious and way too late when this assessment is made. The dinner bell had dinged and 'Bruce' is ready to eat. I know ? I know - special effects are so much better now-a-days?hmmmm?.did I mention this was the early 70's?

		<shortDescription>Not only a film that started Spielberg's career, but it was also the start of summer blockbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws (1975) is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss. The plot of the film is very simple. A great white shark starts terrorizing people in Amity Island. After a few accidents occur, a police chief (Schieder), a shark hunter (Shaw), and a marine biologist (Dreyfuss) set out to sea to kill it. I love Jaws. Jaws is a movie that I have been watching a lot when I was younger. Watching it as an adult, I admire the the film more than ever. This movie is perfect in every aspect and I can possibly say that it has no flaws. There is a notorious back story about how much trouble and delays that this movie had went through. One of the mechanical sharks wasn't working properly and instantly drowned. Spielberg and the crew had a difficult time making the movie. Even though the movie had a difficult time being filmed, I will still say that the director made a smart choice by not showing the shark to the audiences, but you feel its presence every time the brilliant score by John Williams stars playing. That was a brilliant approach by the Spielberg, because it just added more suspense and quality to the film. The score by John Williams is one of his best. The character development and the performances were very good. Roy Schieder as Chief Brody, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter Quint, and Richard Dreyfuss as the marine biologist Hooper all do a wonderful job and have great chemistry between each other. My two most personal favorites are either Brody or the shark hunter Quint. The final battle with the shark is one of the most thrilling moments I have ever seen put on film. Jaws still holds up extremely well and it is a movie that gets better every time after each viewing. It is one of those movies you either seen it or you should have seen it. Jaws is Spielberg's first true masterpiece. It is a movie that had put him on the map and history was made. Jaws was a box office smash. It was one of the first films that gave birth to blockbusters. 2 years after this film you had Stars Wars, then Indiana Jones and cinema was changed forever. Jaws has widely been acclaimed by critics and audiences as one of the greatest and most important films made. Jaws will always be known as a film than started the blockbuster genre and changed the way how movies are being made. Its a perfect film and I highly recommend it. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's Jaws is a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed with human beings we got to know and care about. It's a film that's as frightening as ''The Exorcist'', and yet it's a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we're being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of by a brimstone-and-vomit devil. The plot is good enough and the shark looks good. Its one of the greatest horror thrillers ever made, and three sequels plus one unofficial sequel was released. The movie is the best shark movie ever made and it won 3 Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heart Pounding Thriller, A Mindless, Fun Film With A Great Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has always been a great filmmaker. He does an excellent job at making a film a lot of fun, a way of making a film exciting. Though he does have many "artistic" films like Schindler's List, he is mainly known for his exciting, fun, adventure films like "Jurassic Park," "E.T.," "Indiana Jones," and ultimately this film, he also does make some artistic films like "Schindler's List." Jaws falls in the earlier category, and although it is a mindless film that has a basic plot, Spielberg was able to pull off a true masterpiece, a fun, thrilling, suspenseful film.Spielberg's directing as always was incredible. Though he doesn't take many intellectually inclined film routes (though he does) he is able to make a film important and memorable. The acting is also a very high point in this film. The acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss was incredible. They portray a great team, and have a lot of chemistry on the set. They feel like real people and a real group.Cinematography is basic. Not much to talk about here.Music is brilliant. John Williams produced a basic, yet tense theme song that reminds me of a shark's tail waving and pushing itself through the water. Though the theme is tense, most of the music in this film is cheery in a tropical way, nearly sounding like pirate music. This is an excellent film that is requirement for any movie watcher to check out. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have not seen this movie. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on a crucial part of film history and will be missing out on an intensely fun experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Not Going In The Water!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many years, Jaws is probably on my list as one of my five favorite films of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie. It's just got one of those feelings that Hollywood will never, ever be able to reproduce. I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so I'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat", "This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propeller, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark", "Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!", and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has received it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a "making of", deleted scenes and outtakes. Definitely money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The "making of" feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it.Don't go in the water!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a horrifying extravaganza. The first time I saw it, it was summer, and I wanted to go to the beach. I found this movie and watched it. After I watched it, I wanted to go the pool. Spielberg shows horrible side when he made this movie. After seeing E.T, I thought he's was a mild mannered person. After seeing Jaws, I thought he had a dark side.The story tells of a small town called Amity, which has extremely good beaches. When a massive shark starts haunting the waters, It's up to Police Chief Martin Brody to stop it. With horrifying special effects, gruesome, bloody scenes, and a good director like Spielberg, this movie was sure to not fail in the box-office.This movie is a definite ********** performance, if you ask me. It's a brand spankin' good time! I definitely recommend this movie to YOU!!! And, remember, "Someone Yells Barracuda, Everyone's Like 'Huh? What?' But If You Yell Shark, We Gotta A Panic On Our Hands On The Fourth Of July!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad I finally got to watch Jaws from Steven Spielberg. This is truly one of best thrillers ever made and I think the special effects for Jaws itself still hold up very nicely nowadays. The movie succeeded in providing the scares and It was interesting to see that some of the scenes had graphic violence, which made them even more realistic and intense. Jaws not only works well in its comedic moments, but also manages to be compelling on a dramatic level. The score by John Williams is just remarkable and really helps building up the suspense every scene the shark makes its appearance. I was quite impressed with this little creature who always transmitted a sense of sheer terror. Jaws is an epic cinematic experience and one of Spielberg's best works to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is two movies rolled into one. The first half takes place on and around Amity Island, which is inhabited by a small summer tourist community in the Atlantic, where Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) seems to serve as the entire police department. When a girl's freshly severed arm washes up onto the beach, Brody, who correctly surmises the cause to be a shark attack, attempts to close the beach, only to meet strong opposition from Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who sides with the local business owners who depend on summer dollars for their very lives. The mayor explains away the girl's death as a boating accident and orders the beach to remain open. Several attacks later, Brody finally convinces Vaughn to allow him to hire a local shark hunter, Sam Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the shark. Chief Brody and a shark expert from the oceanographic institute, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), accompany Quint on his mission, and their hunting expedition on board the Orca constitutes the second half of the film. Across both halves, Jaws manages to cover all of the three main types of story conflict. Brody and Hooper's struggle with Mayor Vaughn and his constituents in the first half exemplifies the conflict of Man versus Man. In the second half, Man battles Nature as the crew of the Orca pursues the Great White. Both Brody and Quint fight with themselves; Brody must battle his fear of the water, and Quint, a Captain-Ahab-like figure, must deal with his tragic flaw of selfish pride in refusing help from technology or outsiders in killing the shark. The shark hunt in the second half of Jaws is an escape, as well as deliverance. The ensuing adventure on the open sea contrasts nicely with the horror/slasher/suspense piece that comes before it. It's also like a mini-vacation for Brody, who, in the first half, is inundated with annoying requests from various islanders. The three-man pursuit of the shark, though scary, provides the singular excitement of a focused objective that releases Brody from all of the scattered, petty demands of his island job. It's a joy to watch these three very different men come together towards a common goal and mutual appreciation. Spielberg and company tell Peter Benchley's story with plenty of humor, and though his score is known for the shark theme, which has become synonymous with impending danger, John Williams provides an interlude that makes Jaws a feast for the ears. The finale of the film is explosive and satisfying as it features the triumph of a common man who always gets his shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're Going To Need A Bigger Boat "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Understatement if there ever was one. "Jaws" (1975) is without a doubt, one of cinema's greatest achievements. Here you have what could easily be considered your standard B-movie material (not that there's anything wrong with that) that gets turned into a masterpiece by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The movie starts out innocent enough, a group of teenagers are hanging out on the beach, a young man and a girl decide to go off on their own. The girl wants to go swimming and the young man wants to accommodate her, however, he is clearly suffering under the effects of alcohol and doesn't make it into the water. Lucky for him, because shortly after the girl goes in, we, the audience, can clearly see that something is lurking under the surface and is getting closer and closer and then STRIKE, the girl is grabbed, whipped back and forward, pulled under again and again, and screaming for her life. In a few seconds, its all over as she is pulled down for the last time. From then on, we know that we're in for one hell of a ride. There are so many great things about this movie that I'm not even sure where to start. The acting is superb: there's the always reliable (and sadly, now deceased) Roy Scheider as Chief Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as the brilliant and sarcastic Hooper. However, the most brilliant performance may be that of the late, great Robert Shaw, who plays the hot-tempered but likable old fisherman Quint. Despite his enormous ego, you can't help loving him. In addition, there's Murray Hamilton who gives a great performance as a typical politician and Lorraine Gary in the role of the supportive chief's wife. The real star of the movie though, is the shark himself, who is created with a combination of real shark footage and a mechanical creation, which, while it may look a little fake in some scenes, still looks pretty scary after all these years. Filmed at the famous Martha's Vineyard, "Jaws" is a movie that revolutionized the film industry by creating the summer blockbuster and made people afraid to go into the water. Oh, and who can forget the iconic theme by John Williams, a theme that has become so embedded in pop culture that every time anyone hears it, they know what it is. To put it bluntly, you are robbing yourself by not seeing this monumental achievement. Watch it and be afraid, be very afraid the next time you go into the water, because you never know what might be down there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws portrays the hunt for a seldom seen villain, with little interruption. The films depth, particularly that of the three leading characters is endlessly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultimate adventure film, Jaws will almost certainly remain the leading title in its genre. The single founded criticism of the film, which will only increase in severity with each passing year, will be the quality of appearance of the villain. Undoubtedly, for the twenty-first century viewer, the image of the shark would do little to frighten. However, and remarkably so, the quality of the model shark has little influence on just how frightening it, and the movie, is. Why? Because it is not the thought of the shark's appearance that is most frightening, but rather the thought of what the shark will do. Too often thriller/horror films, featuring non- human antagonists rely on the image of the creature to form the climax of the film. Spillberg, instead relies on the Shark's actions to frighten the audience, and a more effective frightening of an audience has never before, or since, been seen. The film, in the words of the producers and director is a straight a-z action film, with little interruption of the realisation of the conflict and the solving of it. Thus, Jaws is a very real candidate for a superficial action film, one which as time ages it's effects, it's quality wains. Yet the performance of the cast is so incredible, that the film's depth exceeds that beyond the waters which the rouge Shark circles. Scheider plays a plagued straight man brilliantly, Dreyfus is everything a good character shouldn't be, a know it all, spoiled, arrogant, condescending, and yet this is precisely why his character is so endearing. Most of all, Shaw's outstanding performance is beyond criticism or comparison. His every scene is a highlight of the film, and his final meeting with the film's antagonist, leads the audience to question just who they're cheering for, albeit momentarily. In watching Jaws, one views perhaps one of the greatest ever cinematic artist's first true critical and commercial smash-hits. It's not his most well-rounded film. The filming is raw, the score confronting and confusing at times, the characters seem ill-developed, and scenes without the villain are spent waiting and hoping for his emergence. And yet, it is these characteristics, or more accurately these qualities, which make Jaws such an incredible film. If seeking to be entertained, watch Jaws. If seeking to be scared, watch Jaws. If seeking to see powerful acting performances, watch Jaws. If seeking to view a film alone, watch Jaws. If seeking to view a film with friends, watch Jaws. If seeking to see a frightening, confronting or grotesque monster, don't watch Jaws. If the purpose of a film is to entertain, then Jaws is the definition of a cinematic success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws Sets The Benchmark For Sea Thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, Steven Spielberg's shark saga set the standard for the New Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water in this movie,Jaws. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen.The screenplay was written by Benchley and Carl Gottlieb; and it was directed by Spielberg.One early summer night on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island, Chrissie decides to take a moonlight skinny dip while her friends party on the beach. Yanked suddenly below the ocean surface, she never returns. When pieces of her wash ashore, Police Chief Brody suspects the worst, but Mayor Vaughn, mindful of the lucrative tourist trade and the approaching July 4th holiday, refuses to put the island on a business- killing shark alert. After the shark dines on a few more victims, the Mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the culprit. Satisfied with the shark they find, the greedy Mayor reopens the beaches, despite the warning from visiting ichthyologist Hooper that the attacks were probably caused by a far more formidable Great White. One more fatality later, Brody and Hooper join forces with flinty old salt Quint, the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White. The three ride off on Quint's boat "The Orca," soon coming face to teeth with the enemy.Compelling, well-crafted storytelling and a judicious sense of terror ensure Steven Spielberg's Jaws has remained a benchmark in the art of delivering modern blockbuster thrills.Aside from that,credit should also be given to the outstanding performances of the cast particularly by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. Featuring an unforgettable score that evokes pure terror, Jaws remains one of the most influential and gripping adventures in motion picture history as it has remained a cultural phenomenon and forever changing the movie industry.When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in Jaws overall is very good. Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody quite well. He plays the character very serious and very dedicated. Though Roy in my opinion doesn't always show his emotions clearly. Something would happen like a shark attack and his face would just stay in the same image with words being spoke seriously. I mean sometimes its cardboard.In one of the scenes i did spot Roy laughing at a boating crew that were going to die.That felt very out of character,But overall he did play Brody quite well.Robert shaw as Quint was very good. The character was quite weird.He laughs at things that aren't really funny,he sings in tense moments,and he talks very loud but yet his face stays calm.I loved Quin.Richard Dreyfuss played hooper and for me was the best actor in this along with Robert Shaw. These two characters Hooper and Quin,sometimes they get along with each other and other times they hate each other for no real reason. Hooper is a shark lover and knows it all about them.Towards the end of the film he becomes a brave character that can be scared in a calm way.The plot in my opinion was not that bad as people make it out to be. Yes,it could have been better like a stranded situation for the whole of the movie,but it did build up.A shark terrorises a beach at Amity Island,and Chief Brody Wants the beach to be shut,but the mayor wants tourists so he doesn't close it. Quin,Hooper and Brody go out to sea to hunt down the shark.I know it wasn't a very detailed description but I'm trying to keep it short and simple to follow.The score was excellent.John Williams was the composer.The opening music was slow,but got faster as this creature under the water was getting closer to its victim.Very chilling.But,sometimes it was a bit corny but it did capture the mood in someways.This dates back to 1975,so yes,it does look a little bit outdated.Overall the movie makes you jump a fair couple of times and it is a really enjoyable film which should be experienced. Though at times is slow and boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This was not a boat accident!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the "summer blockbuster", "Jaws" remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.The story deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens &amp; visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.Roy Scheider is perfect as the everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget THAT music by John Williams, the composer / conductor who's given us some of the best instantly recognizable movie themes of all time? The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark "Bruce" to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hoopers' night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, "Jaws" is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar "nature strikes back" thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have "Jaws" on the brain.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cultural phenomenon of the best kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s was a transitional period for Hollywood and American society. Failure to win Vietnam and the shame of Watergate prompted a reassessment of America. The moral certainties of old Hollywood were now irrelevant. In late 60's a new group of directors emerged to fill the vacuum. Their influences were other films. They were the movie brats. And the only one of them to achieve sustained unbroken success was Steven Spielberg. He is the most commercially successful filmmaker of all time, with an unerring instinct for the modern mainstream. He has converted his filmmaking powers to unprecedented corporate power in Hollywood. But while his commercial success is indisputable he has suffered much criticism; chiefly that his films are childish in their viewpoint. He positions himself in the cosy Middle-American ideological mainstream and presented issues in morally simplistic terms. His movies were full of sentimentality, moral certainties and special effects wizardry. He made Schindler's List partly with a view to address the accusation that he was not a serious filmmaker. But to be perfectly honest, whether you agree with this viewpoint or not the fact remains that Steven Spielberg directed Jaws. And that will be something that no one can ever take away from him. Jaws remains one of the most iconic, timeless, suspenseful and brilliant films ever made.It was nothing short of a cultural phenomenon on release. Not only in that it terrified a generation of people from going anywhere near the ocean but it had a profound and lasting effect on the movie industry. It was the biggest money maker of all time on release and it instigated a Hollywood production strategy that has been geared towards summer blockbusters ever since. It ushered in the era where marketing campaigns often cost more than the movie itself; while it was also the first film to be released via saturation booking, forever changing exhibition strategy. For better or for worse, Jaws changed the way the industry did business.But it would be enormously unfair to blame Jaws for the blockbuster phenomena. It was just by chance that this movie about a killer shark was the monumental success it was. In many ways this was a sister film to Spielberg's earlier movie Duel. Where that movie pitted an everyman against a malevolent truck driver, Jaws adopted the same basic idea but made the villain a great white shark. Jaws is essentially a horror movie because the creature in this film does not behave in the way any shark would. Here, the shark is given a malevolent evil intelligence that makes it behave in an almost supernatural way. It operates along the same lines as a maniac from a stalk and slash horror film. Moreover, the killing of the sexually liberated girl at the beginning of the film is very much in line with the conservative ethos of the slasher films that would follow in its wake. The price of immorality is evidently death in the universe of Jaws too.Spielberg manipulates the audience brilliantly by keeping the shark off the screen for a long time. Instead John Williams extraordinarily effective music is used to signify the presence of the monster. There are a series of scenes of incredible suspense where the fear of the unknown are played to the maximum, such as the opening killing and the attack on the two night fishermen. When the shark does finally appear it is nowhere near as rubbish looking as many claim. Despite being clearly fake you always believe in it. This is the power of Jaws.Spielberg's preoccupation with suburbia is very evident here. Amity is a small community put under siege by an alien enemy. This deadly foreign presence threatens this suburban idyll. Does Amity = America? Who can say for sure but there is no question about the parallels to Watergate in the town mayor's repeated attempt to cover up the scandal for his own self-interest. Political corruption was everywhere in 70's American movies, and here is no exception.Masculinity and class is represented in three types here. There is the abrasive and working class Quint, the intellectual and wealthy Hooper and the even-handed and middle class Brody. Despite their antagonistic relationship Quint and Hooper have much more in common with each other than with Brody. They share expertise despite the class divide. But seeing as this is the world according to Spielberg, narrative logic dictates that Brody - the man of the suburbs - will provide the sane middle ground that will ultimately prevail. His motivation is born of concern for the community, he is a family man with self-doubt; he does what he does out of a sense of duty not for selfish reasons. The everyman triumphs against evil.Jaws does crystallise the world view of Steven Spielberg. But where in some of his other films this perspective is coated with a saccharine feel, it is simply not the case here. Jaws is a thrilling film, with three dimensional characters. It terrified a generation of cinema-goers in the 70's and remains one of the genuinely great blockbusters. It never gets old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3rd film to be released by Mr Steven Spielberg, the king of the cinema, Jaws is arguably the best . When Jaws was released, it became a worldwide hit, bringing fear to the audience about swimming in the ocean, as shown by the tag-line 'Don't go in the water' and a poster displaying a simple image of a woman swimming on the surface of the sea and a fierce looking creature at the bottom about to eat the woman. The synopsis; on a vacational island, a number of swimmers are dragged in the ocean by an underwater monster and it falls to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider (The French Connection)), shark expert Matthew Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind, Always)) and working class fish hunter Sam Quint (Robert Shaw (From Russia With Love)) to destroy the creature once and for all. Unusual for the horror genre due to the summery setting, Jaws depicts a truly haunting view on vacations by the sea and the scenes with Hooper swimming underwater will shock the daylights out of every film watcher who watches the film. Jaws is also highly recommended for anybody who has not seen it, because it covers the following messages; Do not swim on your own, do not swim late at night and sharks can see colors very easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always thought there was a big hype about this movie,enough to make it a Spielberg classic or to have been considered better than the Cuckoos Nest.Finally I decided to watch this film i thought was crap, and my final conclusion has been that the film is entertaining. I know it has a big misinterpretation of shark's behavior and the plot is too simple but if you give this a chance you will sure like it. Its not that good as a classic but as a nice picture thats now 35 years old.Jaws is just like the other classic-considered films from Spielberg like ET or Indiana Jones, its all about giving them a help to be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspenseful thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws The movie Jaws is a suspenseful thriller about a gargantuan, man-eating, great white shark that is using the beaches off Amity Island as its own personal hunting ground. The local islanders of Amity Island refuse to close the beaches, because they do not want to loose money produced from tourism. Therefore, the killer shark continues to attack and kill whoever goes into the water. Hence, the local sheriff takes matters into his own hands and gets the mayor to agree to hunt down the shark and kill it before anyone else turns up dead.The movie was produced in 1975 and was directed by Steven Spielberg. Robert Shaw, played Mr. Quint, the crazed, psychotic shark hunter. Matt Hooper , played by Richard Dreyfuss, was the eccentric oceanographer brought in to study and educate the town about the shark. Martin Brody, played by Roy Scheider, played Amity Island's Chief of Police who suffered from aqua-phobia. This film shows the true-life terror of the situation we put ourselves into once entering the ocean's waters. We become the prey at the bottom of the ocean's food chain.This film was acted out brilliantly and brings the viewer to edge of their seat. Steven Spielberg uses special effects in the movie that sends chills down your spine as the killer shark (a mechanical shark) lunges out of the water and attacks the unsuspecting swimmers. The shark with its dead, piercing eyes and enormous layers of razor sharp teeth grabs its prey and begins to feast in front of our very eyes. The shark reminds the audience of the real life possibility of this situation happening to them at any time they enter the ocean. The movie The Deep also uses these same scenario to alarm its audience, as abandoned divers are being feasted upon in shark invested waters.Furthermore, Spielberg uses light to bring out the terror of the true life situation. The demonic, killer shark is a nocturnal hunter; therefore, during the most intense scenes in the movie the screen is dark and a shot of light is shone right at a crucial moment in the film. This technique makes these horrifying scenes even more intense. For example, Matt Hooper dives into the water to investigate an abandoned boat owned by one of the local islanders. The scene is shot at night and the whole screen is dark except for a beam of light from his flashlight. As he investigates the boat, he shines his light on a huge chunk that has been bitten out of the side of the boat. He realizes there is a gigantic shark tooth still stuck in the boat. As he moves in to investigate the tooth further, his beam of light lands on a decapitated head as it flows out towards him. Once again, the audience is jarred with the terrifying reality of the situation.This movie was intensely thrilling and it is a true reminder of the chance we take once we enter into the domain of these gigantic, carnivorous creatures that don't mind eating us for dinner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" may be considered one of the best thrillers of all time. From a best selling book, to the big screen in (1975) that changed summer hits forever, Seven Spielberg's brilliant approach to an average book puts him on the map of directors forever. "Jaws" is about the small town of Amity and how a great white shark becomes a menace while Sam Quint (Robert Shaw), Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) attempt to stop the kayos. The overall theme of the movie is simple, respect the sharks and always take a bigger boat. "Jaws" starts with a young girl being killed by a shark which sends panic through the small town of Amity. With the island depending on tourism the Mayor wants the beaches open despite the incident. Brody, the town's chief of police, is against the idea but opens the beaches anyway. With a $3000 reward put up by a mother who just lost her son, the town goes into a frenzy to catch the shark and claim the prize. A shark is caught but it is quickly learned that it was the wrong shark. Brody decides to take Shaw who is a veteran shark hunter and Hooper who is a scientist out to see to catch the shark. The shark is smarter than the three think. After being hunted the shark ends up on the back of the boat and almost eating one of the men. Some how Brody is able to lodge an air tank in the sharks mouth and it is detonated sending the shark to the bottom of the ocean. "Deep Blue Sea" is similar to "Jaws with the theme of respect the shark. "Deep Blue Sea" may not have been as big of a block buster but the movie shows that sharks are smart and they should be respected. The lighting in "Jaws" was brilliant for its time. With the movie being filmed outside most of the time, the use of glares and other forms of lighting was brilliant for its time. Viewing the Anniversary Collector's Edition in widescreen is better than the original. It is much clearer and the screen being wider gives the viewer more to see. "Jaws" is a movie that changed how we watch movies forever. We are forever reminded to not only respect the sharks but always take a bigger boat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Showcases Spielberg brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 4th July celebrations 3 men attempt to stop a dangerous great white shark from harming the people of Amity 35 years on from its first release and this Spielberg masterpiece has generated its fair share of parodies and mock ups but this picture is by far a unique piece of tension and adrenaline showcased through a terrifying ideology.The story begins with some frisky teens and when one goes missing through a point of view shot of an anonymous underwater predator does the story take a sharp turn in the right direction of family entertainment.The title sequence underwater is juxtaposed with some great John Williams music that has been talked about for numerous decades and taught Steven Spielberg the value of significant score in relation to a terrifying creature. The development over the decades has seen the director tackle the T-Rex in Jurassic Park and the fantastic boulder chase in Raiders of the lost arc, all John Williams collaborations that all have made excellent impressions worldwide, not to forget without such great build ups in tension and action, we would not have had countless sequels to Jaws, Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park.As a piece of direction, Jaws balances finely on a thriller whilst for me on first viewing, had a sense of dignified horror whilst not over indulging itself on sharp screams. It was quite surprising to see this given such a low certificate rating despite the amount of action involving blood and the motive of threat throughout.Regardless the pace is on the money, the actors do a good enough job to get a feeling of terror mixed in with their ordinary character's lives.As mentioned Jaws now 35 years old has dropped in terms of viewing pleasure for many as a source of being shown countless times but having this picture as a source of viewing infrequently makes it a guilty please in today's society.For example the rapid development in technology, especially given what has just happened with James Cameron's Avater, make this picture look timid and ordinary. But cast the eyes back to its first release and this was all the rage. Whilst the lighting is occasionally off key, particularly during the opening beach scene, there is still an impressive sight given when we eventually see the shark and how Spielberg accomplishes his feeling of authenticity through great set placement and ideology.Looking at some of the great horrors over the years they all share a same concept. Predator, hung in the background, Alien, hung in the background, T-Rex appeared when we least suspected it. Having the presence of mind to encode an unusual but equally brave creature and using it as an evil semiotic in the plot delivers so much joy and entertainment, and it is as valid here as it is anywhere.In the wave of recent blockbusters this perhaps does not have enough panache and swagger as modern releases do but this is still a tremendous excuse to sit back and be either terrified or excited by some great direction and creepy ideology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that IMDb doesn't consider this "horror", but it certainly rates as a horror movie in my mind, and an excellent one, so it gets top billing from me. Spielberg has done a great job of creating tension and suspense, and keeping the shark hidden for much of the beginning of the movie just added to this.But I think I like the acting and the dialog as much as the suspense here. Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss have this great chemistry that makes their characters real. This is the best acting that I've seen from Robert Shaw. Roy Scheider also does a great job here.Jaws has one of my favorite monologues in any movie too-the "Indianapolis" speech that ends "So, eleven hundred men went in the water; 316 men come out and the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb." Great entertainment, great acting, great dialog...in short, a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story about three men and the sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film about Martin Brody, a police chief who relocates from the Big Apple to Amity Island, expecting to blend in. He's in unfamiliar surroundings, so he calls in Matt Hooper, a scientist from the Oceanographic Institute. Together they perform autopsies, drink wine, and yell at the mayor. They have one thing in common: they are both madly in love with Ellen, Martin's wife. Martin and Ellen have two boys: Michael, a laid-back teenager who blends in well with his island peers, and Sean, who makes sand castles. One night Martin and Matt go out to sea for some one-on-one time. There is tension over Ellen, and Martin says "It's only an island if you look at it from the water." Matt doesn't understand how Martin and Ellen's marriage has sustained. The mayor is excited about the 4th of July and the inherent tourism, so Martin and Matt yell at him. They meet up with Quint, a salty sea dog who doesn't care for Matt and his sophisticated means of studying sea life. Matt is defensive and senses class envy from Quint. Martin doesn't know if there's a chance for the three to forge a relationship, but he is glad they're not talking about Ellen for once. The three unlikely comrades set off to sea to relax and learn more about each other. They drink beer, throw chum in the water, play solitaire, and sing songs. At night they drink apricot brandy and compare scars. When Quint tells a war story, Matt sees something in him he hadn't seen before. Judging Quint in a new light, their friendship is forged. They swim home, on account of their boat sinking. These three buddies who went to sea as strangers came back as dear friends with respect for one another, until Quint gets eaten by a shark. Martin admits to Matt he used to hate the water. When you see "Jaws", you will see why when men aren't afraid to be themselves, Martin changes his tune. "Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies", and hello to a wonderful masterpiece you'll want to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ground breaking thriller and one that will always live in my memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many other people who have watched this film I was captivated by the whole two hours experience and to say that the film is atmospheric is an extremely large understatement. To watch this film in the cinema all those years ago when it was released was like an epiphany. I suspect that most people must have been aware of the story line before they viewed the film but quite naturally would have wanted to watch it first. The film hits you from the first second and keeps the tension and excitement throughout. Once in a while a film comes along which just bursts on to the film scene and it is immediately obvious that you are watching something very special. I would highly recommend anybody watch this magnificent creation. To the cast and crew that were responsible for this classy piece of work I would personally like to thank them all for their efforts and the professionalism and craft that they all applied in its making. Once again when the resulting film is very good the total seems to be greater than the sum of all its parts and in my opinion this is one of those films. This film has numerous added ingredients which are naturally occurring but only in the better films and it is these intangibles which make the special films special. I have never been entirely sure what all of these intangibles are but when you watch a really good film you will know when they are there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg invents the summer blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the National Safety Council, you're more likely to perish through "fireworks" than being chewed like bubblegum by a great white (especially if you live in, say, Ryegate). But during the summer of 1975, parents could have been forgiven for blaming their children's aversion to water on the precociously young director, who might as well have developed his classic Hitchcockian eco-thriller in tandem with the British government as a means of enforcing the hosepipe ban during the following year's drought. Jaws has it all: that John Williams score, fantastic character actors, a proper grown-up story, and a mechanical shark that refused to work so many times they had to keep it out of sight; the definition of making lemonade out of lemons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before Spielberg got interested in dinosaurs, extra-terrestrials, Jews etc, the most deadly predator on the planet caught his attention - The Great White Shark and thus was created one of the best thrillers in cinema History. The plot is simple - A chirpy, happy sea town named Amity which is famous for it's beach-tourism faces the deadliest challenge in the form of a man-eating great white. Three people namely the Police Chief of Amity, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) and a marine scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) take it upon themselves to get rid of the man-eater and save Amity. Are they successful in doing so and what will be the cost they will pay defines the movie plot. The plot is simple, but Spielberg takes this weak plot to an all together different level with his direction. His efforts are supported by his special effects team without which this movie would not have been possible. The movie is not all about fear and screams, it has it's comic moments and the touchy emotional moments as well. Spielberg has mixed these emotions perfectly and the outcome is brilliant.What can I say about the acting, when the protagonist of the movie is A Great White Shark.The Shark plays hide and seek with the audience most of the times and is seen only for some minutes at the end. In between the 3 'Human' actors, Robert Shaw impressed me the most in his short role as a sturdy fisherman. In short, Jaws is a movie, any true Hollywood Fan wouldn't want to miss. Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

Hooper is out of his League Enter the film's most colourful and memorable character Quint wonderfully played by Robert Shaw If Brody is the town's Heart and conscience Hooper the young Hero Then Quint is the modern day Ahab who becomes obsessed with killing the shark for 10 thousand dollars. the three end up on Quint's Boat the Orca and Hunt the shark in the films most memorable moments The Highlight is when Quint tells us about his time on the ill-fated USS INDIANAPOLIS and the deaths of the crewmen after the ship sank. Robert Shaw delivers a chilling story that creates it's own moment in Jaws. Spielberg shows us the genius that became his trademark he crafts a well honed movie with realistic people with flaws like us as they battle the monster only to find it's not the only monster haunting Amity. Wonderful film and richly deserved Classic. 1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've not rated on this movie because it sucks to do so. I just can't think what to give out of full 10 marks. To tell the truth i don't remember the first time I watched it but i only remember the first time I watched it- I was a small kid and I enjoyed it for then. I hardly remembered anything of the movie until again I saw it 8 years later on AXN! Now I have the DVD with me. I liked many things about the movie- 1.) The shark's death. 2.) The excitement when Chrissie Watkins was to be going attacked by the shark. 3.) Brody's steadiness(every cop should be like him) 4.) "Smile you sonofabitch" 5.) "Farewell and Adaeu" 5.) Quint's sense of humour 6.) Hooper's great laughter 7.) Brody's Glassess(lol) 8.) Quint's upright character and sharp nose Well, I could only suggest a thing for this movie: It could at least have some features as the novel. I think I'll be writing a remake to Jaws. In it Quint would die but not kiled by the shark. It will be like this: Quint will try to attack the shark for the last time it appears. A rope would be attached to the harpoon(Quint's weapon to attack the shark) and by chance the rope would tie around him and he would be throwed down into the water and there he would drown to death. AnD in case of the shark's death it would be like this: Brody would be left alone and he would try to swim as best as he can and the shark would be rushing towards him and just then he would blow off the monster's head in the same method he did in the movie. And Hooper would be killed by the shark and he would be a villain-trying to get Brody's wife from Brody. (These above ideas is of the novel- Jaws) and I'm gonna write a great remake!(no joke)-write it down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The island resort of Amity, there has been reports of deaths near the ocean as it seems police officer Brody (Roy Schneider) suspects that it's the work of a vicious shark. The Mayor (Murray Hamilton) wants to help make the place tourist friendly for the 4th of July celebration as safe as possible, so Brody teams up with ichthyologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and expert sea explorer Quint (Richard Shaw) whom are the only ones to take care of this huge man-eating Great White Shark.One of the greatest movies of all time! this suspenseful horror action adventure from Steven Spielberg is a timeless masterpiece that has lasted for years. It originally started as a best-selling novel by Peter Benchley as Universal bought the film rights to it and took nearly two years to get the film made yet it succeeded for it became one of the highest grossing movies of all time. What made this movie a crowdpleaser is the awesome direction from Spielberg with fantastic script by novelist Peter Benchley who also does a cameo and of course excellent acting, well done special effects and thrills galore made it a favorite among the public over the years.An unforgettable experience of a movie that should be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shark's Landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg's 'Jaws' is a thriller in the true sense. Even though Spielberg is popular for his blockbusters, the man is incredibly versatile and has proved with almost each and every film that he can handle any subject matter and give it life on screen. For many reasons 'Jaws' has become a landmark classic throughout the years. What sets this one apart from the usual monster flick is the creation of tension. It is rather an atmospheric film where the monster only appears halfway through. The director tones down the visual horror by not overdoing blood and gore. There is the shocking sequence of a boy getting devoured by the shark which is so horrifyingly executed. One hardly witnesses a child being killed by a monster in the movies and here Spielberg does it smoothly without being too visceral. The use of a robot shark is highly effective and looks eerily real, much more frightening than any CGI shark. John Williams's score is another plus. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary don't let the shark overshadow their performances. They play their characters like humans rather than caricatures. 'Jaws' is definitely another landmark film by Spielberg. There have been numerous shark flicks ever since but nothing has been as impactive as 'Jaws' which had lead to a small loss in the American tourist industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched Jaws last night for what seemed like the 1st time in eons, my DVD is one of the original region 2 transfers that would not play on certain machines - its fine with my new one though. Sat in the dark with the sound blasting out of my Denon 7.1 system (first time I think I have actually noticed how good the Dolby Digital mix is on the disc) and got to admit it I'm totally in love with the movie all over again.From the opening scenes of Chrissie taking her fatal skinny dip to the survivors paddling the makeshift raft to shore and end credits you are hooked. Yes the shark has aged badly but you will never see a more well rounded and balanced main cast, with whom you find yourself empathising and caring about.With out doubt it's the cast, the music (John Williams at his finest - the music actually becoming the shark at times, as the special effects did not always work) and the scripting that make this such a great movie.Shaw's USS Indianapolis speech (his own words by the way) is as powerful today as it was back in 1975, letting you into the mind set of Quint and his need to avenge his fallen shipmates by hunting sharks. Schneider (best role of his career by some margin) excels as the hydrophobic Brody struggling with and eventually over coming his childhood demons and Drayfus is totally compelling as the rich, eccentric marine biologist Hooper driven by his quest to understand the creatures he as worshiped since childhood.Rumour control is awash with re-make noises; please people leave it alone - because yes it's just that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first modern blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws, the first film to be truly called a blockbuster, with a massive box office return and becoming a cultural phenomenon. It is also one of the first high concept film, when the plot can be summarised in a sentence: a great white shark terrorises a small coastal town.In the town of Amity Island a great white shark starts to end people, including a teenage girl and a young boy, during the run up to busy summer season. The mother of the boy offers a bounty of $3,000 for anyone who captures and kills the shark. The chief of police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), wants to prevent people from going into the water, but the major Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) fears that any move would ruin the town's economy and tourism industry. Vaughn ignores the dangers until it was too late. With the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody goes off to hunt for the shark.Jaws is told in two parts. The first is about the investigation, the local reaction and the rivalry between Brody and Vaughn. The second forces on the hunt for the shark. The plot is basic. What Steven Spielberg did was making the characters believable and let them develop. The characters form friendships and rivalry and you even question some of their actions (in a good way). John Williams gives the film a excellent score and they is a fine editing job (for the most part). Steven Spielberg films some fine action sequences and shows he is the master of his craft.Jaws is far from perfect and is not Spielberg's best film. It could have been about 10 to 15 minutes shorter. But it is a pretty entertaining film.There was no need for 3 sequels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that has aged like fine wine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws has been dissected and analyzed perhaps more than any other cinematic work in history. There are several full-length texts that explore this film's every nuance, and countless articles have been written about the film itself, its birthing of the "summer blockbuster", and its impact on motion picture history. With this in mind, I am fully aware that I will not be able to shed any new critical light on this landmark film in a 1000-word IMDb entry. However, since Jaws is indisputably one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly in my all-time Top 10, I felt that I had to write SOMETHING about it.Few films are perfect. This one absolutely is. Jaws is the rarefied movie that can weather intensive scrutiny of each of its sum parts, and still emerge from this analysis as a clearly superior work in every aspect of its production. The acting is top-notch, and each of its characters are perfectly cast and essayed. The score is superlative, and as key to the horror within as the shark. The story itself is deceptively simple, yet powerful enough to remain both timely and timeless. The camera work and use of environment to create tension are unparalleled in the film medium, and every frame carries an implied menace, even when the shark is nowhere in sight. Every detail of the film-making process is performed here with such groundbreaking precision that the film almost becomes a textbook.Those familiar with the troublesome shoot that birthed this film know all the anecdotes associated with that process, so we'll skip those here. But it is worth noting that the film is actually better because of each problem encountered during the production, which certainly says a lot about the talented crew that put this together, but says even more about what role fate plays in the creation of true art. This film was supposed to be made exactly as it was, and the series of happy accidents and no-show mechanical monsters that forced the film-makers to turn the ocean into a monster with another monster inside of it ended up changing the possibilities of what a horror film could be, and tapping into each of the most potent fears of mankind simultaneously.It's also worth mentioning that Jaws is one of the only films ever made that not only surpasses its source work, but renders it relatively useless. Certainly, Peter Benchley's novel is a fantastic read, but no words can essay the endless possibilities for terror the way that the frames of the vast, mysterious ocean do in this film. While Benchley's characters were well-defined and offered layers of depth, the actors here don't play these characters, they BECOME them. The Amity Island in the book is a well-crafted fictional beach city, but the town and its denizens are so magnificently rendered in the film, we could almost be watching a documentary.But, stripping all that away, Jaws is a monster movie, and on that count it succeeds better than any other film in the genre. The unimaginable horror of being attacked by this monstrous fish and crushed between its titular Jaws conjures up agonies beyond comprehension, and even though we see very little of the shark's capacity for destruction in the film, the glimpses we do get, coupled with our own implicit subconscious knowledge that dying like the victims in this film would probably be about the worst way our lives could end, create a scenario borne straight from nightmares.In terms of this film's impact, I can only speak personally. The honest truth is that I am terrified to this day of the ocean; so much so that when I go to the beach, the only contact I have with the water is when I walk along the coast and feel it lapping at my feet. Now, I'm not necessarily afraid to go in the water because Jaws is a scary movie, even though it most assuredly is. What frightens me is that there ARE sharks out there in the sprawling blue-green enigma, and some of them DO attack humans, and though I am keenly aware that no one has ever caught a shark as big as Bruce, I am also aware that there are depths of the ocean we have yet to discover, and lifeforms down in these depths that we aren't even aware exist... and they probably swim up closer to the surface from time to time.Frame by frame, Jaws is quite simply a masterpiece, and considering the impact this piece of celluloid has had on my life to this day, I would have to consider it the most truly scary horror film I have ever seen. Yes, there is levity, and there are moments of peace buried within the razor tension of the film's core struggle of man vs. beast. But, overlying all of this is the inescapable knowledge that somewhere out there, shark's in the water... our shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains plot spoilers.The small island town of Amity is hit by a number of deaths in the sea. Martin Brody, the local chief of police is convinced that the deaths were caused by a shark. He tries to warn the Mayor who refuses to take action fearing losing tourist money. But when a small boy is killed by the shark, they hire Quint, a professional hunter. Brody, Quint &amp; Matt Hooper, a marine expert, set sail in a small fishing boat in order to catch the shark. But the shark proves to be a formidable adversary."Jaws" is the first true blockbuster, one of the greatest money-makers in cinematic history, the definitive killer shark film. Its success at the box office surprised the whole world &amp; spawned a whole host of killer animal films, from the excellent ? the Australian killer wild boar flick RAZORBACK ? to the downright cheesy ? the Italian rip-off KILLER CROCODILE. "Jaws" made the name of then unknown director Steven Spielberg, who had previously made the brilliant DUEL."Jaws" has gone down in history as one of the best horror films ever made (although there have been a few critics who are not impressed, perhaps having been poisoned by the vast army of rip-offs that have come out, including the sequels). Much of its success is due to Spielberg's uncanny knack of creating suspense &amp; his mastery of red herring shocks. He makes the film go one way but then pulls back at the last minute with a red herring, at other times he distracts you before ramming the shocks home (the scene where Richard Dreyfuss investigates a sunken boat only to have a severed head pop out is a classic example of this).Once the main actors hit the sea in the small boat, the film turns into a sort of imitation of Moby Dick, with some embellishments thrown in by Spielberg. There's a wonderfully creepy scene where Robert Shaw, in one hell of a performance, tells of his experiences onboard the USS Indianapolis, of having survived the initial sinking only to face numerous sharks. It's a scene that really begins to make your skin crawl. The shark's first true appearance (up until that point, you have only seen the shark's fin or its POV), with the shark popping out of the water to scare the crap out of Roy Scheider, is one good shock jump. The film's pace starts to hit overtime when the shark effortlessly destroys the boat &amp; goes after Scheider, who attempts to ward it off with a pistol &amp; rifle, only to kill the shark by blowing it up.The film has some great acting, most notably from Scheider (who portrays a likable everyman-type hero) &amp; Dreyfuss (as the marine expert). But Shaw steals the limelight from his companions, as the obsessed Quint, who tries to make up for his past wrongs by going after the shark with everything he's got, not caring if he dies in the attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As ruthlessly simplistic, incessant and unforgettable as its antagonist - an unexpected cinematic triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974, if anyone had been asked their predictions of what upcoming release would change the course of the industry, it is impossible to imagine there being a less likely candidate than Jaws. A pulpy novel adapted by a 28 year old near unknown director yielding one of the most infamously disastrous film shoots in the history of the medium (a duration of a projected 55 days exploding into 159, with a cantankerous cast, a mutinous crew and a barely functioning shark prop) - all things considered, the fact that the film was completed is a feat in itself. And yet, paradoxically for a film centering around a series of deaths, Jaws instead yielded a succession of figurative rebirths, being credited with singlehandedly pioneering the summer blockbuster and ancillary markets, terrifying and thrilling audiences worldwide and turning its amateur director into one of the most recognizable figures in the film industry - a certain Steven Spielberg. The combination of factors clicked, Jaws wormed its way into the collective unconscious with uncanny speed, and no viewer would ever look at deep water entirely devoid of fear again.The film is a true rarity - a 'monster' film which spends most of the film avoiding showing its iconic antagonist, a horror thriller in which the characters emerge as the most memorable, and a film with the simplest of premises which has yielded countless theories on the "meaning" of the shark (alternatively declared as emblematic of womanhood attacking the film's smrg?sbord of masculinity, cold war nuclear destruction on a small American town, or the entire film as an extensive critique of American capitalism - particularly ironic for such an outrageously financially successful film). Yet Jaws also harbours a real pulsating life beyond being a mere collection of now iconic moments and lines. Scenes such as Brody's trading silly faces with his son at the dinner table and the three protagonists' drunken comparison of scars infuse the film with a genuine heart and emotional attachment, making the masterfully concealed yet still shoddy special effects all the more easy to swallow and the film all the more engrossing. As effective a directorial calling card as any, the film serves to showcase all the attributes which would serve to make Spielberg a cinematic legend: addressing familiar viewer expectations with a paradoxically refreshing immediacy, constructed yet honest emotion, sentiment trimmed of excess sap and credible optimism juxtaposed with real terror. A simple tale of men versus shark is evolved into a larger than life cinematic parable, and, crucially, remains enormously entertaining in spite of its countless other plaudits. Yet what makes Spielberg's film the most intriguing is its ability to accomplish so much with so little. From the skeletal plot to John Williams' timeless yet almost entirely two note musical score to Bill Butler's legendary shark point-of-view cinematography to the script's impressive use of few lines to suggest a wealth of characterisation, the film thrives on minimalism. Spielberg distills conventional story complexity and nuance into emotional chords (fear of water, the unknown, etc.) as primal as the film's antagonist. And antagonist the shark unquestionably is, overblown far past notions of realistic shark size and behaviour into the definitive foe, beyond conventional notions of evil into an unflinching, incessant force of nature, and all the more terrifying because of it. And it is the shark's unpredictable tearing through the picture which chaotically deviates from its minimalism, punctuating its crisp efficiency with bursts of brutal excesses. While Spielberg amps the tension of the pending shark attacks up to near unbearable levels, their sheer ferocity and the camera's tenacious refusal to shy away from the gruesome spectacle still manages to make them shocking and horrifying despite the anticipation. However, Spielberg is not afraid to take his time - after a while knuckled opening fright, the film slows down, allowing copious time for audiences to sit with and take to the down to earth honesty of the characters while slowly but surely moving its plot along, making the bursts of shark activity all the more surprising through having lured the audience into a false sense of security. And while such thrill driven films would normally pale in a contemporary context (and it is likely the film could prove too slow and comparatively bloodless to equally enthrall more gore-saturated modern viewers), Jaws defies such concerns through its sublimely creeping pacing and masterful technical work, making the film as superb an emotional assault currently as in 1975. Roy Scheider's gruff charisma proves the perfect emotional heart for the film, making his aquaphobic Chief Brody not only innately likable but entirely credible, an unshowy yet impeccably realized triumph of a lead. Richard Dreyfus is also wonderfully memorable, his devilish sarcasm making marine biologist Matt Hooper eons away from the stereotypical ranting scientist. Robert Shaw is simply mesmerising as grizzled shark hunter Quint, toeing the perfect balance between being raucously likable and dangerously deranged, with his chilling Indianapolis monologue searing into the memory. Lorraine Gary is also an entirely human creation as Brody's wife, with each action suggesting years of familiarity and chemistry. And Murray Hamilton maintains a gleefully infuriating paradox of being an insidiously hateful character, yet too slickly charismatic and nearly sympathetic to outright dislike as Amity Island's struggling mayor, famously refusing to close the beaches despite the danger due to the income from busy season. As unlikely as it may have been, Jaws proves a truly unforgettable triumph of a motion picture, proving that narrative simplicity and being geared to be enjoyable need not be mutually exclusive from quality film-making. Even years from its initial release the film remains uniformly superb enough to justify the exceptional burst of merchandising and publicity, proving one of those few films as unlikely to be fully shaken from the viewer's head as the collective unconscious. Never again will it be entirely safe to go back in the water. -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Da... dun....Da-dun...Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun Dun-dun - toodle-oooo (those are the French horns)...When Steven Spielberg first heard John Williams's simple, ominous JAWS theme, he apparently thought it was a joke. Now who's laughing? They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Matter of fact, even this film's director, Mr. Household-Name himself, Steven Spielberg, don't make 'em like this anymore. JAWS put Spielberg into the A-Plus List. He has been trying to capture the natural ease and gutshock power of JAWS ever since.Amity Island - a great place to get eaten. A white pointer shark is terrorizing beach vacationers and Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) must battle the tourist-minded Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to keep the beaches closed. Death in the water and death upon land (for the tourist trade) forces the town to employ a grizzled seadog, Quint (Robert Shaw), a funky marine biologist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and aquaphobic Brody to hunt the Great White down.I still cannot explain why Method acting in the 70s was so much better overall than it is in the late 2000s. Look at Brody interacting with his kids (the same interaction is captured by Spielberg in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, 1977); look at the extras, not behaving like they're one step closer to a SAG card, but behaving like hick islanders without a camera filming them; look at the snide asides between the excitable Dreyfuss, the intolerant Shaw, and the frustrated Schieder, inhabiting their characters like scales on fish.Movie deviates from Peter Benchley's book of the same name. In the book, Hooper has an affair with Brody's wife, the Brodys' class issues with the upper-class island community are prevalent, Mayor Vaughn is in deep with the Mob, and Quint dies when a rope lashed to his leg drags him under with the shark (Benchley trying for an Ahab moment?).TV writer Carl Gottlieb was brought in to tighten Benchley's screenplay (of which many drafts were rejected, according to IMDb), restructuring the longwinded book into the compelling movie we love and fear.In 1975, JAWS was not only the highest grossing film of all time (until STAR WARS would wrench that title from its fins in 1977), the head-game impact it made on the world depleted beach trade in the mid-70s; people stopped swimming for fear of sharks; untold shark television specials and documentaries were greenlighted, not to mention Peter Benchley's average novel going "superbestseller" (was that before or after JAWS went supernova?).All on accounta Bruce - the nickname given to Spielberg's temperamental mechanical shark and the unworldliness of his dead, dead eyes and razorkill jaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" is an iconic American film, as pervasive within its generation as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Star Wars", "The Godfather", or "2001: A Space Odyssey". However, it remains a flawed film.So, what's good about it that it achieved icon status? The cast could hardly be better with Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw all at the top of their game. John Williams' score is just about perfect. The dialog and pacing are uniformly excellent for a top-notch thriller.So where does it fall down? First of all, the animatronic shark is somewhat anticlimactic and generally unbelievable. Fortunately, it doesn't get much screen time and what it has doesn't leave the audience too much time to think. And that brings us to the second problem. Spielberg failed to achieve the suspension of disbelief that the film requires. Although the audience doesn't have quite enough time to see the holes in the plot or the shabbiness of the FX, both are lurking in the viewers' collective subconscious.Everyone should see "Jaws" at some point in their lives, but I can understand those from later generations wondering what the big deal was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The British film critic Barry Norman once described Steven Spielberg as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. That sounds like a devastating put-down, but I don't think Norman meant it as such. What he meant was that Spielberg borrowed themes from the cheap and cheerful science-fiction and adventure stories he had known in his youth and then gave those themes the full, glossy A-movie treatment. "Jaws" is a case in point. If a film on this subject had been made twenty (or even ten) years earlier it would probably have had some lurid title such as "The Giant Killer Shark Horror" and have been made on a very low budget with comically bad special effects. It would doubtless have disappeared from view almost completely, only surfacing for occasional late-night showings on specialist movie channels, probably on a double bill with something like "The Blood Beast Terror" or "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". (I am not making that last one up; there really was a film with that title). "Jaws" is set on the island of Amity, somewhere off the north-east coast of the USA. (The film was actually shot on Martha's Vineyard). The film is a mixture of disaster movie and hunting epic. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the disaster should be either caused or exacerbated by human stupidity, negligence or greed, and "Jaws" is no exception. After a young woman is killed by a shark while out swimming, the local police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches, but allows himself to be overruled by the town's mayor and councillors who argue that the girl's death could in fact have been the result of her being struck by a propeller. They are motivated by the fact that the island is a popular holiday resort, dependent upon the income it receives from tourists, and any hint of a man-eating shark in the area would be economically disastrous. (There was a very similar plot line in the 1990s disaster film, "Dante's Peak", although that concerned a volcano rather than a shark). Of course, Brody is proved right and the shark strikes again, causing panic on the beach and killing a young boy. Soon afterwards a shark is caught, and the relieved local politicians announce that this is the one that was responsible for the two deaths. One man, however, is not convinced. Matt Hooper, an ichthyologist, believes from the wounds on the two bodies that the shark that has been caught was too small to have carried out the attacks. Hooper and Brody, who is suffering from feelings of guilt over the boy's death, charter a boat, skippered by a local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down the true culprit. Although the film was made more than thirty years ago, it has dated well, despite the many advances in cinema technology that have occurred since then. Today the shark would probably be conjured up by CGI, but in 1975 Spielberg had to rely upon a mechanical model. As this model frequently malfunctioned, we do not, in fact, see the shark all that often, although this probably adds to the film's effectiveness by making the scenes in which it does appear all the more frightening. Also very effective is John Williams's simple but eerie theme tune; like Bernard Herrman's score for "Psycho" this demonstrates that the most effective film music is not always that which would sound best in the concert hall. Roy Scheider as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper play their parts well, but I have never really liked Robert Shaw's eccentric Quint. Although Quint does not actually have a wooden leg, a gold earring or a parrot squawking "Pieces of Eight", Shaw seems to have fallen victim to the curse of overacting which frequently afflicts film stars called upon to portray members of the seafaring profession. (He was much better in "A Man for All Seasons" and "The Sting"). The film has other weaknesses; at times it appears improbable (could a shark really batter its way into an iron cage so easily?) and at others, particularly in the first half, overlong. Overall, however, "Jaws" is a reasonably good film, and in the second half, when the great shark hunt is under way, manages to be both thrilling and, at times, genuinely frightening. Nevertheless, I certainly would not agree with all those who have voted it into your top 100 films (it is currently at #97). It was only Spielberg's second feature film, and his first major success, and I suspect that its continuing popularity owes as much to its place in the Spielberg canon as it does to its intrinsic merits. I have never been an adherent of the quasi-religious Cult of the Great Director which has grown up around Spielberg; he has made some excellent films, notably the brilliant "Schindler's List", but these have normally been when he has tried to produce something of greater significance than the popcorn blockbusters which have constituted much of his output. "Jaws" is a well-made and exciting adventure film, but at the end of the day it is still only a B-movie made on an A-movie budget. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg has turned Peter Benchley's frightening best seller into a terrifying movie which understandably kept hoards of people out of the ocean in much the same way that "Psycho" kept hoards out of their showers.The screenplay adaptation, by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, is very well balanced and the story is expertly handled by Spielberg as he slowly introduces us to the unsuspecting resort town of Amity, which is about to be torn apart by the most horrible of unseen terrors. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss all give strong performances, with Scheider as the new chief of police who never had a menace quite like this to deal with in New York, Shaw, who is impressive as cynical, wily old Mr. Quinn the shark hunter, and Dreyfuss, who gives a fine performance as hot shot oceanographer Matt Hooper.The special effects are convincing enough, at least enough to cause one's heart to race, and John William's much borrowed, re-used and copied music score is of course very effective.A wonderful, nerve-racking piece of entertainment from Spielberg which builds up from its tense beginning to a real heart-stopping climax, guaranteed to give you sweaty palms and leave your mouth dry, if you can keep your eyes open long enough.Sunday, January 30, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is considered a movie classic. released in 1975, the movie is based on a killer shark terrorizing the beaches of amity, which is based on the attacks of 5 people in 1917, or sometime around then. while this may sound original and bland, this was original. Steven Spielberg took the story of jaws made by peter benchley, and he made a blockbuster movie out of it. what does blockbuster mean? it was the first movie to gross over 100 million bucks, a title coveted by several directors. jaws held this title for two years, until George Lucas took the title, for the release of star wars.If you watch today's modern day shark movies, none of them capture the classic horror of jaws. deep blue sea, red water, none of them take the horror, but somewhat develop more gore than jaws did.bottom line, it's an awesome movie. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably Spielberg's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably Spielberg's best film. Peter Benchley's bubblegum story makes a perfect film. A shark stakes out Amity Island as its feeding grounds and is practically served up a smorgasborg as the town's people don't want to compromise their business to get this killing machine.Spielberg may not have meant to make this film so suspenseful, by not showing the audience the shark until midway through, but it works perfectly for this film. John William's score does an excellent job of adding to that suspense or maybe the score makes the suspense whatever the case it works perfectly.The greatest feature of this film is the great acting and chemistry between the leads, Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper), Roy Schneider (Chief Brody), and Robert Shaw (Quint). The constant bickering between them when they are cooped up on that boat together is great. The shark scenes are certainly great, but the complementary of this great cast is the factor that makes this film so excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me as a child seeing Jaws for the first time definitely left a lasting impression, I probably didn't see this movie till i was 8yrs old and remember being scared out of my wits. It wasn't until I was older that I truly appreciated what an amazing movie this really was, the acting, the directing and even the effects where something to marvel at. I guess this movie to me defined what a true Blockbuster movie should be, I'm not going to give a full review of the movie as it has had already ample of reviews and votes etc.I will say my favourite scene in the movie has to be the speech given by Quint (Robert Shaw) to chief Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)on board the Orca in search of the Great White. Starting of with comparing scars to Quints recollection of his time on board the USS Indianapolis and how him and his fellow crew were subjected to shark attacks when there ship sank. I found this a fascinating story and didn't realise that this in fact actually happened and the author of Jaws had incorporated it into his novel then into the movie. I will leave a link for anyone interested in having a look http://www.ussindianapolis.org/.I will finish by saying that anyone who has not seen this SHOULD as they don't make blockbusters like this anymore, try and get the 25th Anniversary edition as its packed with lots of extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of Jaws is nothing more then an average town in New England, as the towns population is preparing themselves for the 4th of July beach celebration and setting up tourist attractions to welcome new comers. However it is discovered that a number of people have fallen pray to an enormous great white shark.This is Spielberg's first real summer blockbuster. Although he previously directed "Duel" three years earlier back in 1972, this is the movie that really lunched his film making career. Roy Scheider takes the role of the Amity Island police chief, Martin Brody. His attempts to convince the threat of the shark to the Mayor is feeble. However, after a young boy is killed by the deadly ocean predator a reward is offered to the one who has the shark caught/killed.Brody then teams up with shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) and head out to hunt the shark. They take Quint's boat "Orka" out as the three of them venture into the open water. Quint was a survivor of the U.S.S Indianapollis back in world war II, and his climactic story is one of the best ever filmed. Jaws is definitely and forever will be a true classic, and one of the best films ever released.</fullReview>

Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert. Robert Shaw is the seasoned fisherman. Both complement and contrast with ex-cop Roy Schieder. The shark almost takes on a supernatural quality as he menaces the three men in their boat. Great whites grow up to 20 feet. They are killing machines despite the claims of environmentalists. Australian waters have the most shark attacks. The sequels definitely took away from the original. Hollywood needs to quit while it is ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fascination with fright on the Motion Picture Screen has been just about as popular a type of Fare as any-be they Romance, Swashbuckler, Historical Drama, Adventure, Crime, Comedy, Melodrama, Farce or the Biopic even. There seems to a certain attraction of movie goers' fantasies that draws them into identification with whatever Character is "the Baddest." Just how many boys would rather play 'Don del Oro', Al Capone or Darth Vader; than they would Zorro, Elliot Ness or Obi Won Kenobi?As for Scary Cinema, there are several definite, distinct classifications. First of there are the Horror and the Science Fiction divisions, but of course there are a lot that have characteristics of more than one. Those we may call 'hybrids' to borrow a term from Biology Lab.But no matter which way we look at it, JAWS (1975) is a 'Monster Movie', for even though a Shark is not a Mythological Creature, nor the product of somebody's fertile imagination, it is still monstrous to we puny humans.We'd read an old reviewer's write up of one of Charlie Chaplin's Comic 2 Reel Shorts. We can't remember which one, but in the course of the review the author said something like, "?.the Movie Ushers really liked this film, and the Ushers see the Films almost as much as the Cops!" We guess that some things just never change.When this film was released, I was in the midst of my 35 year run as a Chicago Policeman. In addition, employment working Security for ABC-Great States' UNITED ARTISTS Theatre. When JAWS was booked in, we soon had Cops working there from opening till the last showing of the day was over. Previously, we would have 1 guy there on weekday evenings, 2 on Weekends.Well, after a couple o' days, we went to "Plan B". That called for 2 men, coast to coast, all the way. The crowds justified such a change of staffing and necessitated bring in more 'urban mercenaries, more hired guns! You know, Schultz, more Off-Duty Cops! I mean the earliest show at around 9:00 A.M, would be packed!There was good reason for these crowds' seeming magical materialization. JAWS. You see, was a very good film. It was thrilling, dramatic, humorous, literate and it scared the living Hell right of you. All the elements seemed to be there in proper proportions. The balance achieved by Director Steven Spielberg, Novelist Peter Benchley and Screen Writer Carl Gottlieb, seemed to be near perfection. The movie goers were all seen leaving, were both laughing and crying simultaneously (and at the same time, too!). But whatever the case was in any particular instance, people were all talking about their collective and individual cinematic experiences of the previous 2 hours or so, and all of this unsolicited feedback was Positive, Very Positive.The key operative word here is "mood". JAWS truly benefited from a beautiful, haunting and even biosynchronous Original Musical Score from the Maestro (Himself), John Williams. From the very opening, shown from the point of view of the Shark, the subtle irising in on the swimming area, contrasted with the merrymaking on the beach by some of those Teen Agers!! Taking cue from the musical score, I swear our hearts began to beat much more quickly, and our whole nervous system joined in. The various "scary" scenes were done so well, that it did accomplish that need for "Suspension of Disbelief and every Man, Woman, Boy, Girl and Pet who was in the audience shared in the fright and eventual fit of "relief laughter" that followed.The Production Team seems to have struck a really good balance or blend of just the right balance of all those above mentioned elements as to make for a "real scary picher" for all age groups, even the 'Big Kids'.Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

For me it really made me fear and respect sharks but then again I was pretty young when I first saw it nevertheless it is a movie with great acting. I also think it was amazing that they managed to make the movie while the fake shark didn't work until the movie was nearly done. I think you could really see that the people in the movie all wanted other things and I thought it was funny that our hero was scared of water and that he had to save the day meant facing his biggest fear. So I would recommend this movie if u haven't seen it already then.. well I can't find the words but just go and see it.</fullReview>

Two hours of pure entertainment and adventure.I was a child when i saw the movie and i was out the pool for all the summertime.Great Spielberg. the first sequel is a good film (good actor Scheider)but the next ones are quite poor (very bad Jaws 3-D) It's clear that Steven Spielberg opened and closed a genre because nobody will improve this film.I read the Peter Benchley's book and i discovered that the main story is the relationship between the sheriff and his wife,the shark is only other problem in sheriff's job.Maybe the future film "MEG" could add any innovation in shark's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the beauty in this film lies in the way the shark does not appear for at least 3 quarters of the film - it is the music which frightens the life (and continues to) out of the audience.The Central 3 performances and the chemisrty between them is just fantastic, with loadsa tension and comedy and bitterness from the fabulous Robert Shaw toward dreyfuss! LOL I loved the relationship between the chief and the sea and also the utter quotability of the film1 "We're gonna need a bigger boat!" I will give this a ten because it still has the ability to shock and make me laugh and the music is timeless...the performances great and the shark a great monster of the big screen!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this was Steven Spielberg Day or Shark Day.I started the day with Spielberg's first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express. I then watched a really good shark film, Red Water. I ended my afternoon viewing with Spielberg's second feature, the one that put him on the map, Jaws. Two Spielbergs and two sharks. An exciting day.What can you say about this film that others have missed. Oscars for editing, score and sound; outstanding direction by Spielberg; superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss; and a Peter Benchley story that kept your interest throughout.I was just thrilled to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can barely relax in a swimming pool to this day because of Steven Spielberg's ultimate shark movie.I've become a detractor of Spielberg in his more recent years as a director, but "Jaws" represents him doing what he does best: putting fun popcorn movies on screen and using his shameless powers of manipulation to thrill us rather than wrench tears from us. Give me "Jaws" and "Raiders" over "Schindler's List" or "Saving Private Ryan" any day.Acting in movies like this gets overlooked, but I think "Jaws" would not be the classic we remember it as today without the marvelous trio of actors who play the men on the hunt of that pesky great white: Roy Scheider, as police chief Brody, whose sense of duty and obligation outweighs his morbid fear of water and the unknown; Richard Dreyfuss, as a cocky scientist mesmerized by the beauty and the majesty of the creature they're hunting; and Robert Shaw, in an off-his-rocker performance as Quint, loony shark hunter, the Captain Ahab of Amity. These three together deliver one of the best depictions of male bonding ever put on screen.Peter Benchley greatly improved his own book for the screen. The book is full of boring subplots and lengthy passages told from the shark's point of view. The screenplay, on the other hand, is streamlined and crisp, not pushing the story beyond its modest bounds, and reducing it to a basic man against nature -- or man against his own worst fears -- tall tale. It's like "Deliverance" lite.And that John Williams score.....oh, that score......Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful soundtrack, memorable moments, great pacing and a seemingly invincible shark make Jaws something special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Jaws a long time ago; well maybe it wasn't ages and ages ago but several years is more than enough time in-between viewing a film. What I expected from Jaws this second time given the amount of films from Spielberg I've seen since and the amount of films I'd seen as a whole anyway was something a tense, taught, 'slowly building it up and then hitting you' horror thriller. True, I couldn't remember much from the first viewing apart from some of the more memorable moments not only in Jaws but in film history overall; these included the finger nails down a blackboard scene and the now famous 'trombone' shot as Brody (Scheider) sits on the beach receiving a massage as the shark claims its latest victim.Even if what I got was very different to what I was expecting, that still isn't saying I didn't enjoy it after this gap. I found Jaws to be tight, clever, sharp and highly entertaining ? the only real complaint being that the editing has not dated well. Some films are lucky to have anything truly memorable in them at all - Jaws has; in its opening twenty five minutes or so, about three to four things. These things, when either repeated or spoofed instantaneously remind you that it was from Jaws. These are things like the now famous musical score from John Williams, Quint's (Shaw) introduction with the blackboard, 'the' shot of Brody on his chair, the two swimmers in the opening scene and the wonderful point of view shots we have of the shark; allowing us, the audience, to be the killer every now and again.Not only do these events now have something of a 'cult' status but the pacing of each scene within the actual film itself took me by surprise ? Jaws is, in truth, an unrelenting barrage of entertaining and unpredictable situations pieced together in such a fast and refreshing way, I'm amazed it didn't have a truly lasting impression on me the first time I saw it half a dozen years ago. The film really does suck you in, no exaggeration ? and it does this through keeping a strong, steady figure (Brody) at the centre of the film whilst systematically introducing new characters and situations as it pleases. We are shown that Quint is around but his help is rejected although later on they need him, we are introduced to a shark expert from the mainland and find out a bit about him as things carry on and of course, the constant threat of the shark looms savagely making any shot or scene where either beaches or water is involved, truly uncomfortable and simultaneously, disturbing to watch.Not only this; but tension and anxiety is played with very effectively. When the shark expert Hooper (Dreyfuss) has to go down into the water and inspect the bottom of a boat even we are unsure as to whether it's safe. As well as this, when it's realised the shark is in the 'pond' part of the beach, where Brody's children are, we are equally unsure as Brody's children strike us (at least they did to me) as expendable characters ? wouldn't give Brody a bigger and more personal drive to catch and kill the shark if his kids were victims? The scene involving and surrounding the capture of another shark early on is played with very well as some detective work is needed to work out if it's the right one.When Jaws enters its final third, it is quite literally 'man vs. beast' as these three guys are out at sea, no where to go and with a mission in mind: eliminate the shark problem. This is played out using several techniques and situations, all of which score. The sheer unpredictability of the film as well as the action that pops up every now and again is wonderful as guns, harpoons and even yellow tracking barrels are used to try and defeat the monster. When they realise defeating it from the surface is a little too hard, they even try and match it under the water resulting in a heart stopping scene involving a shark cage. It's not all barrage upon barrage on the animal, though ? the shark wins its fair share of the fight. Jaws is very clever in its delivery, pacing and realism. It's also very entertaining and is up there with some of the best work Spielberg has ever done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two-thirds of one of the greatest horror films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody Robert Shaw as Quint Richard Dreyfuss as Matt HooperPlot: There's something out in the waters of Amity Island killing people and eating them alive. Police Chief Martin Brody fears it may be sharks but is told to keep his mouth shut. Soon the creature strikes again, and now he decides to take matters into his own hands and go find and kill what may be the largest shark the world has ever seen.Let's get the problems out of the way first, because I feel as though Jaws, while very decent, isn't as scary as people say it is. Jaws genuinely made people afraid to go out in the water..in 1975. The movie itself does not age well and doesn't hold up to a more modern audience of today, although it still manages to send a chill or two down the spine.Besides not holding up well over time, this movie tends to go too long. Running at a span over a little over two hours, there's a lot that could have been cut out to make it a smooth shark movie. Some of it was character development, and I understand that, but some of it were scenes that felt stapled on or just felt out of place. The scene where the three men sing together comes to mind. Not to mention some of them were repeats of scenes produced earlier. Mainly most of the flaws were in that second half, once Brody and crew go to find the shark.But the first half is one hell of a ride from the quiet opening scene of a teenage girl being attacked while swimming, to the less subtle but more terrifying scene of a boy being swallowed completely while on a raft in broad daylight. Plus the shot of everyone running and screaming out of the water is historic, among other things. Jason or Freddy can't make THAT many people run away from them. Well, Jason did, but it was a bunch of kids. And you could feel sympathy for the creature, it's just doing what comes natural. But they won't let you. This shark will eat you if you go into the water, it's an eating machine!This movie also made me feel for the characters involved. Whether it was the main star, who just wanted to help everyone but didn't have the respect or the support, or the shark expert, or even crazy man Quint. All characters had something about them to make you genuinely care whether or not Jaws had them for lunch or not. It built them all up solidly, even Quint who before he went after the shark didn't have much screen time. This movie, even though it was PG, managed to throw in some gore. It's a killer shark, he's not going to be clean. Gushing blood, severed arm, severed head and a guy gets chewed up. Pretty good for a PG, and quite surprising given the MPAA's strict standards, which were even stricter to horror back then.I would go as far as to say that Jaws is 2/3 of one of the greatest horror films ever made. There are some genuinely terrifying moments, a pretty good adventure story thrown in, but there is 1/3 that could have been cut and just feels unneeded. However, I strongly recommend Jaws, because it's still quite good and this is a historically important film. If you haven't seen it, crawl out from the rock you've been living under and watch it.Rating: **** of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws-Claw Your Way Into This One ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's not "Schindler's List," this 1975 thriller is exciting by the nature of its topic.The first part of the movie deals with the town's lack of response when it becomes quite evident that a shark is on a killing spree. What happens to Mayor Murray Hamilton for failing to act? Hamilton, in a fine supporting performance, depicts that same lack of kindness that he showed 8 years before as the husband of Anne Bancroft in "The Graduate."Roy Scheider, whose career really never took off, hits his stride as the police chief. The late Robert Shaw gives a tremendous performance as the adventurer with the problem that he garbles his words when he spoke. There were several scenes where I found it difficult to understand him.Lorraine Gary, as the wife of police chief Brody,(Scheider) is adequate but she doesn't seem to be caught up enough in the action.The second part of the film deals with our trio-Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw, on board to kill the ferocious beast. While I will be in the minority here, I felt that the film begins to drag somewhat. Yes, the scenes with the shark trying to kill our heroes are great, due in part to the wonderful editing here, but the talk among the central characters is down right dull after a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws is a classic a classic 1975 horror movie that is good for may reasons 1. Class as in it is not just a gory shark movie 2. It does have the good gore that a good horror movie needs.3. It has a storyline thats not just about the shark and 4. It shows that sharks are not bad guys but that mayors are if they are like the one in this movie. The movie is about when a young girl gets eaten by a shark the chief of police tries to shut that beach down but the mayor does not because it is the summer time which leads to death and a great movie. Overall I rate this movie really well especially for a horror flick and has the class that most of them lack so if you have not already seen it see it. I rate it 88%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is the best horror film of all time! It is about something that many people can relate to and can actually fear. One of Nature's most feared animals is the Shark and to create a horror film around that animal, you could guess what the response should be like. It gave viewers something to actually be scared about and that was going swimming. It had the same effect on me when I watched this movie when I was 10. I could not go swimming and although I overcame it and have a passionate love of studying sharks, I still get scared every time I start swimming in deep water (even in a lake or pond). This film horrified viewers and it is no wonder why!The acting in this movie is superb. Roy Schneider portrays a devoted and frightened cop! He fears for the peoples safety when a rogue shark starts attacking and there is nothing he can do to convince the town's mayor to call off people from swimming. Richard Dreyfuss plays a very humorous scientist who is a shark expert. Robert Shaw is absolutely fantastic. He plays his character perfectly! I feel, he has some of the best intensity of any actor when he is playing his character in this movie. Put the three together and you have a great trio that is actually quite funny.Steven Spielberg does so many things to make this go right! One, is the shark. With each attack, you begin to see more and more of the shark. Not yet being exposed to the true size or shape of the shark until the right time has come. The suspense just builds up more and more which really keeps the viewer on edge! And the third attack on the beach is filmed wonderfully! One of my favorite parts. You see the lone girl screaming "SHARK! There's a Shark in the pool!" and you see a lone dorsal fin out in the water. Than it cuts back to Roy Schneider beginning to run and than the good part, where Spielberg shows the size of this shark perfectly without us even seeing most of it. We see the dorsal and tip of the caudal fin slowly start to sink behind Schneider's son sitting on the beach. And the spread between that thing is incredible. When I saw that scene, my jaw was on the floor and I was crapping my pants! Spielberg just does many small things like that to make the movie that much better.And than Spielberg's and the writers usage of quotes. Lines like, "You are gonna need a bigger boat!" never cease to fascinate me! The suspense, the action, the entertainment, the horror, the intensity, and the humor of this film are top notch. This film is not rivaled when it comes to horror movies. It tops the list and 32 years later, this film is still one of the best. It would absolutely stun me if the person reading this comment had not seen the film. You should go buy it now! Don't rent it, buy it! You will watch it again and again! And keep it someday to show to your kids because it will still be a horror then!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What were my parents thinking when, in 1975, they took me to see Jaws at the tender age of 7? Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestselling novel (about a man-eating shark feeding on the inhabitants of a small island) had me squirming in terror for nearly two hours when I first saw it. Even now, 32 years later, this film still has the ability to horrify, nauseate and generally upset me; testament, surely, to the brilliance of its director and the talent of its amazing cast. But it's still definitely not suitable fare for a 7 year old!Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, who has moved with his family from the crime ridden streets of New york to Amity, an idyllic New England island. But when a spate of shark attacks threatens to ruin the island's 4th of July weekend, Brody, along with salty sea-dog Quint (Robert Shaw), and shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), sets out to catch the fish responsible.Opening with a terrifying scene in which a woman taking a midnight swim ends up as fish food thanks to the toothy terror lurking in the deep, Spielberg creates an atmosphere of fear from the word go. After a second attack, in which a child is chomped in full view of the sun-worshippers on the beach (possibly the film's most shocking moment), it becomes clear that anyone is fair game for the Great White prowling the waters of Amity, and the tension becomes almost unbearable.Spielberg's impeccable storytelling and incredible visual style, coupled with amazing performances from practically all involved, plus a fantastic score from John Williams, result in a film that is as close to perfection as humanly possible. Packed full of jump scares, great characterization, nerve wracking suspense, and exciting action, this one really does have it all.Jaws was the film that kick-started the summer blockbuster phenomenon and made Spielberg a household name; more importantly, it was the first movie to completely scare the crap out of me. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go back in the water...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inhabitants of a small fishing and summer resort town are terrorised by a shark and a group of men set off to catch it and kill it.When Steven Spielberg first saw the script for Jaws laying on a desk the thought it was a sign to make the film, as Duel his hit TV movie had the same amount of letters in the title.Jaws created what has become the film clichs you see today, a sleepy town, greedy town officials, the doubted hero and the older wise guru. It was all there in Peter Benchley's novel, however, Spielberg made a few changes for the better and what you end up with is a thrilling suspense movie.Peter Benchley has mentioned that if he had known about the actual behaviour of sharks, he would have never written the book. Also maybe Steven Spielberg may not have made the film as the shark (named "Bruce" after Spielberg's lawyer) was never tested in salt water and caused a troubled and prolonged production. Fortunately this added to the films tense atmosphere and in the sharks case, less is more, as the actors get to show their stuff as the film builds up to a gripping finale.John Williams most memorable score gels the movie together. The acting is fantastic and also from the supporting cast including Murray Hamilton's Mayor, to Quints silent partner. The leading trio are on top form - Roy Scheider proves his performance in the French connection was no fluke, Richard Dreyfuss career was saved with his performance as Hooper and set up his future film work and finally Robert Shaw steered his performance away from a Captain Ahab rehash, to a sailor with a haunted past, Quint's tale of the USS Indianapolis will forever be one of the best speeches in movie history.Watch this movie and experience for yourself why the tagline read 'don't go in the water'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films of Our TIme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people today do not see the genius of this movie and it saddens me. Now saying that, you may think that I am a middle-aged man who saw this film when it came out in theaters and remembers the hype of the day. I'm not. I'm 17, was born in '89, and saw this film six years ago, and loved it ever since.Being 11 when I first saw this film, I only liked the gore and cool shark scenes. Being older and a bigger appreciator of cinema, I understand the amazingness and complexity that goes into this movie. If you are anything more than the average movie-goer, you know this movie is more than a "Dun-dun-duh! Shark is killing everyone! Dun-dun-duh!" The movie is about the responsibilities of the town's police chief and a marine biologist. Or, more simply, it's about characters. Without the amazingly written characters, this film would probably be nothing.The characters are what drive the plot of the movie. The characters are so amazingly written that some of the most memorable scenes in the film don't involve the shark at all. The boat night scene is one of my all-time favorite scenes in movie history. In case you can't remember, it's the scene in which Hooper and Quint share the scars they've received in shark hunting, then Quint tells his story of being on the USS Indianapolis, and the men sing "Show me the way to go home." The scene provides laughs, chills, and tears. Laughs at the cracks the men make while showing scars, chills when you hear Quint's terrifying story on the sinking boat, and tears when you feel the men's desolation on the boat as they sing. And you thought this was a shark movie.But I don't say that in mockery of the movie's shark scenes. The shark is what drives the movie and it provides some of the greatest horror moments in cinematic history. The shark, nicknamed Bruce, is one of my all-time favorite horror icons. But although this movie is driven by and focused on a shark, I do not think it's right to consider this a shark movie. Again, it's about characters reacting to the shark, and how they try to live their lives with this fear of the unknown in the water. Creating a story in that context, creating a movie not about the creature, but the FEAR and the COPING of the creature...that is a challenge. Steven Spielberg, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Benchley...all the writers participated, they delivered that concept in the perfect way ever done. This movie is a triumph that will always stand the test of time.10/10. My absolute favorite horror movie.P.S. Don't see the sequels. Or just don't expect a millionth of the same brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie's the best of the "Jaws" series.I don't know if this is a premonition to the attack at the end of the movie or not, but there's a scene in the movie as Quint, Brody and Hooper are leaving to kill the shark, where the Orca is framed by the jaws of a shark in Quint's window. I never thought of this scene as a premonition until the sixth time I saw the movie. I like the scenes where the three are out on the Orca trying to kill the shark and they start singing "Show Me The Way To Go Home." I also like this way the movie differs from the novel: Matt Hooper survives the shark attack. Hooper's my favorite character in the movie.</fullReview>

When it's in the water, it gives the feeling of a real shark. That is a good sign of film brilliance. Bruce the Shark is up there with the Queen Alien and the T-Rex from Jurrasic Park, its a true movie creature.The last forty minutes are film gold.

		<fullReview>This movie is very simply put a classic! No one can deny that, I still remember the first time I saw it I was about 8 and every time the shark came out my cousin and I would just jump over the sofa because it would scare us so bad. To date I still have a hard time going into the ocean with out thinking that there is a crazy killer shark out there. The scene where the little boy gets killed was one that haunted me when I was little even though I was in the pool. Every time I get on one of those floating devices I have a flashback to that movie. That is a brilliant movie. Who would have thought that a movie that had so many problems like it did would become a cult classic. So many movies have tried to do the shark movie but this one will always be number one. The acting was great and it absolutely draws you in from start to finish. The best line in my opinion is when Brody is about to kill the shark and says "Smile you son of a bitch." Though I'm sure a shark wouldn't have exploded in the way that the one in the movie did... it really just make it one of the coolest endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping shark nightmare flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magnetic thriller that succeeds in being both very frightening and good fun. This 1975 blockbuster-in-all-but-name retains the cumbersome imprint of large genre (war/romance) movies. From the pantomime of Quint's opening speech to large crowd scenes on the beach there is all the stock romance and hysteria a matine audience would expect. The second half of the film becomes a more psychological stand-off, a personal war of attrition between Quint and the fish.Spielberg's grip on the pacing and tension is compelling. What really makes this film the huge success it was though is the treatment of characters. The dread shark has none - Quint's description of a tiger shark's dead eyes 'as black as a dolls' is accurate - but all others all well fleshed out. The shark's presence and its deeds is a constant metaphor for the relations and acts between the populus of Amity. Spielberg's trademark verismo treatment of the ensemble cast whether visually or in the voice-mix is given a full scale run out here. It's highly successful in naturalising the characters, establishing a foil of normality for the extraordinary emergence of the threat.Robert Shaw's Quint is a grandstanding, unstable sea dog... amazingly upstaged by Richard Drefus' blue-blood biologist. Schneider is again the central moral pole that made the French Connection work. Above all a gripping film that thrills without scarring. 7/10</fullReview>

It was something that actors could interact with, do you think all this new CGI crap doesn't look like a cartoon? I don't care how realistic the new KING KONG looks he isn't a real thing!? And you know, you are supposed to take a leap of faith with movies and bring you own mind into it, not have the movie do everything for you and further more THE SHARK IS SCARY and it STILL WORKS because the first hour and a half allows your mind to build it up into the most frightening thing you can imagine to the point where it isn't just a shark anymore and when you finally see the thing you fear it IS freaky...it is less a shark than it is a monster and fear incarnate...Frankenstein doesn't really look like a corpse but it works...so does Jaws and the reason it works is because the actors believe in it and make it real! Quint! Come on, the Indianapolis speech?!!!, brilliant!!! The movie is epic, a trilogy in one film, THE ATTACKS,THE 4th of July and THE HUNT!

		<shortDescription>The ocean will never be the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing that happened for this movie was the fact that the artificial shark broke and couldn't be used much. The audience's imagination is MUCH more powerful than any animatronic gadget ever could be. If it were made today, there would be millions of dollars worth of CGI shark shots and it wouldn't be scary at all. Rubber and pixels don't scare us. Ideas scare us. Just give us a visual taste of shark here and there, that's all we need to scare ourselves silly.It is the idea of the unknown and what could be lurking just out of sight that makes this movie so scary. It's all about the small boat, the big ocean, and the fact that the attack could come from anywhere. And that's what makes it continue to scare you when you go near water years later. If the shark worked and our fear was based on seeing the shark, then at the beach you'd say "well, I don't see a big rubber shark anywhere, so I'm okay". But when it's the fear of the unknown, you go to the beach and say "hmmm, this looks a lot like Jaws", and you think twice about going in the water.Great performances all around, but Robert Shaw as the semi-insane shark hunter Quint is the best and most memorable in my opinion. Every line he spoke was priceless, whether it made you laugh out loud or shiver in fear. It's too bad some of his scenes were cut.This is one of those weird movies that you can watch a hundred times and still not get tired of. It gets you creeped out right from the first scene and never really lets go. Every time it's on TV I say "well I'll just watch 5 or 10 minutes", and before I know it I've watched the whole thing again. A masterpiece, thanks to the broken shark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can i say? jaws is the best film ever made! not only is the plot fantastic, it's believable. the characters have depth and personalities that we can all identify with. as for the shark itself, who knew rubber could be so scary? i snuck out of bed to watch this film when i was 4 years old, hiding behind the sofa for 2 spellbound hours. it is my favourite film and began a fascination with sharks that has lasted my entire life. if i wore a hat, i would have to take it off to Spielberg. this is cinema at its best, well worth the time it took to make. i know it's a bit sad, but i've seen jaws more than a hundred times and thoroughly enjoyed it every time. it was the first DVD i bought and i intend to be buried with a copy of it, that's how much i love this film. i urge anyone who hasn't already seen it to go and buy it. i defy you to not love it as much as i do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting disaster film; also one of Spielberg's first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "Jaws" oh-so-many times. I first seen this movie on TNT back in 1998; then I've seen the 25th Anniversary version on ABC in 2000; and finally, I've seen the 25th Anniversary version again on DVD last summer before starting classes. (The 30th Anniversary DVD is now out, but at the time, my library only had the 25th year version.) From the swimming scene at the beginning and all throughout the film, during various scenes, everything is exciting! Intense! Fun! This is also one of Steven Spielberg's very first films he has directed, and I think all of his films are terrific! Even this one! While the other "Jaws" movies may not be up to par (funny thing; this one's in the Top 250 while the last one is in the Bottom 100), this is and always will be the best of the "Jaws" series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad shark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie makes you believe that maybe swimming in the ocean might not be such a good idea. One of the best shark movies out there. I really like how realistic they made the shark is some points of the film while hiding the fact that it really was a bigmechanical machine. Not bad for a 1975 movie classic. It is amazing how Brody comes out of the movie unscathed because being on such a tiny boat, you would think that it would give some idea to the conclusion of the movie. The setting is a nice quiet place with little public and it is funny to see the crazy fisherman take the 3 on a boat in the middle of no where and claim to know everything there is to know about sharks, he however is sadly mistaken when it comes to his turn to wrestle with the large mammal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was saddened to hear of the death of Peter Benchley, the author of Jaws, and I decided to go back and look at what was his most successful book-to-movie adaptation, which of course was "Jaws". No matter who you are, you will love this film. Essentially the first "blockbuster" (grossing more than $100 million dollars) film to hit theaters, it's surprising how minimalistic the movie really is. It's just three guys and a shark out in the sea for over a third of the film. What makes the film work so well is the performances of the three main actors (Schieder, Dreyfus, and Shaw) and the editing style that Steven Spielberg used to create the atmosphere and tension in the film. We still feel the influence of "Jaws" even today, as it has caused thousands of people to swear off swimming in the ocean due to a fear of sharks. If you've already seen this film, you don't need me to tell you how good it is. It is, by all rights, still a film classic, and it's legend will endure for some time yet.Bottom Line: If you saw it, go see it again. If you haven't seen it, go buy the Anniversary Edition DVD. NOW.</fullReview>

Yes, sharks rom the oceans, but no, we humans are not their preferred meal.Still, without using special effects while concentrating on music and camera positions this movie is a masterpiece in demonstrating how to create scare without overusing the display of the predator. The real predator, actually, is the mayor, who refuses to close the beaches in order to keep business alive. And this is (hopefully) the message that Mr. Spielberg created for the U.S. If not, I am at a loss about this country</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...only saw it as a rental. One critic even pointed out that this is a movie that needs to be seen in a theater. WELL, DUH!!! I saw it during it's first theatrical release, and to see this as a DVD or VHS rental is a waste of time. The only way to enjoy it the first time is in a room full of other virgin viewers while seeing it on the big screen. The initial view of the shark (along with the "head" shot preceding it-you know the one I'm talking about) got such an incredible reaction from the theater...people literally screamed and laughed from the release of pent-up adrenaline following those scenes. You can't possibly re-create the feeling, even on a 60" HDTV. Spielberg tapped a vein when he picked his villain---we're not talking some imaginary fiend like Godzilla or King Kong. Viewers in '75 could relate here because these things did (and do) exist. A thriller works better when one can put themselves in the place of the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Jaws(U.S. 1975)was based on a rogue shark that terrorized beaches on Long Island, and killed at least five people in the summer of 1916. The most likely culprit, which had the shin of a boy in its stomach when caught, was probably not a great white but a bull shark.Finding out this and more this here movie has turned from rocky horror to pure truth in our oceans. More people have been killed by sharks because of this movie. Thank you Jaws, you've brightened my day completely.Police Chief Martin Brody(Roy Scheider), his wife Ellen Brody(Lorraine Gary)and his sons Sean(Jay Mello)and Mike(Chris Rebello)know there is something in those waters surrounding Long Island. The chief is sure it's a shark. And darn well it is.A 25 foot Great White has been stalking the oceans and has killed 5 people already. No one wants to be in the water(swim). And the worst part. Fishermen are playing as if this was a joke. So in comes Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and Quint(Robert Shaw)to somehow save the day.Language and action are a mighty feat for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's first Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1974 before Indiana Jones or Star Wars, before the Discovery Channel, It was a time of laud music and originality in films. The Godfather: Part II was just released the year before and times where different. No one knew the slightest bit about Sharks not even Universal Pictures whom at the time this film was first put into production thought they could *train* a shark. After realizing they where wrong they began to design a mechanical one. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss were cast as the 3 main roles in the film which would later become the FIRST summer blockbuster. When Spielberg came aboard to direct the film he had no idea how big the film would become, he had allot of pressure on him after the huge success of Peter Benchley's book which the film was being made from. Fast forward to 75, Jaws is released and is a massive success. Spielberg is recognized as a talented director and kids are to afraid to go into the ocean for the rest of the summer!Allot of the thanks goes to the brilliant script written by Peter Benchley and the amazing flawless performances from Roy Scheider (Police Chief Martin Brody), Robert Shaw (Quint)and Richard Dreyfuss (Matt Hooper). The story which is now clich, was about a police chief, a scientist, and a grizzled sailor who set out to kill a shark that is menacing the seaside community of Amity Island. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws captivated audience when it was released. It struck fear into the hearts of children (and some adults alike). That's all well and good in the seventies, but what about the present day. Most films from that era, with the exception of Star Wars and a few others, have dated horribly, but not so Jaws. Okay, so you may not be as frightened as you may have been as a kid, but as adults, we can all appreciate Steven's Spielberg's talent.The tension, the suspense, the fear, all of the aspects from the book are here, but the director has also borough photography, music, and superb acting to the movie / film. There is no need to write a long review, just watch the film yourself, and be amazed. Then, read the book, and watch the film all over again. I give the film 9/10, one point being deducted for a pretty rubbish shark. I think we should not have seen the shark until the very end, but that's just my opinion.Simply a masterpiece, every bit of it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that truly launched Spielberg into the public eye, a film which overachieves and overcomes the odds stacked heavily against it. A story about a seaside town attacked by a shark would not seem to be the basis for one of the most loved, respected and successful movies of all time, but Spielberg and the cast make it happen-scares excitement, laughs, good characters and great acting all contribute, along with fluid direction and a now infamous score. The budget was low, the filming at sea extremely troublesome, the shark wouldn't do what it was supposed to, but through all this the story prevails and we are left with a true classic.Scheider stars as Sheriff Brody, an ex-city cop with a fear of water who moves with his family to Amity, a popular sea-side holiday resort. There have been a number of deaths recently, and young shark expert Hooper comes to town to long at the bodies. He believes the deaths have been caused by a Great White Shark which will not leave the are while there is still plenty of food around. He advises Brody to close the beach, but the Mayor thinks it should be kept open for the July 4th weekend, the time when the town makes a real profit. When attacks continue, Brody and Hooper decide to track the shark and catch it. Local fisherman Quint who has met one or two sharks in his time also comes. The three set out on the tiny boat, and the shark soon finds them.There are scenes which have since become the stuff of legends- the opening night attack, the 'need a bigger boat' scene and others. The shark may look unreal now, especially as we all have a far better knowledge of sharks with all the documentaries and underwater technology. However, the tension is still high, and like Alien, we only see it near the end. The relationship between the three men on the boat, their arguments and jokes give the film a unique feel, ensuring the viewer is on the boat with them, and other touches such as Brody's son mimicking him are now a Spielberg staple. The death scenes are gruesome and real, thanks to the acting, and the score will is one of the best anyone has done, suiting the film perfectly. By the last few minutes, as the ship sinks, we are with Brody, waiting for the shark's inevitable return. Much has been made of the 'jumpy' moments, and every part of the film has since been dissected. It remains a film which everyone can enjoy, and one which will stay with you forever.10 out of 10</fullReview>

You know the guys at ILM, it would be a snap! Add a few more scenes with attacks and you would have a brand new summer block-buster at less than half the cost! Think it over! Add a few of the deleted scenes. I, for one, would pay to see it revamped!Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie for it's time. It scared countless thousands out of the water, including myself.

		<fullReview>Stephen Spielberg's 3rd major cinematic hit, `Jaws' certainly holds the suspense?.even watching it today. From the very beginning of the introduction with the haunting menacing music by John Williams, leading up to the first incident??the viewer knows they're in for one hell of a movie.I don't know what it is with 70's films, whether it's the format or cinematography techniques they used back then, most times you can guess correctly if a film was from that decade. (maybe it's just me or something)The cast was perfect, the 3 leads; Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw all very capable actors in their own right. 'Jaws' to me is the ultimate duel between the savage of the sea and the savage of the land. The only thing is this battle is on his turf?.the open sea. Some very important issues were documented coinciding with this film.It will leave an impression on you long after you've watched it, my recommendation; a "must see"....9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Summer Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfect. Although not a word most reviewers ever dare put on the printed page for fear of its literal translation, I cannot think of a better word to describe the 1975 fish-in-the-water film Jaws. Perfect.Directed by a relative unknown film geek named Steven Spielberg, Jaws opened in the summer of 1975 with reasonable expectations. Universal Studios at first thought very little of the movie during production, but the reaction from the test audiences was electric. What resulted, sparked change in the movie industry and revolutionized the summer box office for years to come.Jaws begins innocently enough as a group of young men and women are drinking and singing around a beach campfire at dusk when two people decide to go for a late night skin-dip. As the male passes out on the beach, the female dives into the waters off Amity Island where suddenly she is pulled under like a bobby on a fishing line. Looking both terrorized and confused, she does not scream right away. Within seconds she is being torn from side to side screaming relentlessly for help. Suddenly she is pulled under and the quiet calm waters overshadow the chaos that just ensued.The next day, the young man who accompanied the girl to the waters' edge searches the beach with Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) in hopes of finding his lost companion. A deputy's whistle leads them to the gruesome discovery of a hand lying on the beach. The mystery was over, the girl was dead.This was the opening scene in Jaws, an adrenaline pumping few minutes that incorporated sex, nudity, terror and horror. The game was afoot and Spielberg was on his way to establishing himself as the master behind the camera.Adapted by the best selling novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a story about hunting. A police chief, a marine biologist and a gruffy sea captain hunt the shark while the shark continues to hunt and terrorize the community. When the beaches remain open and a little child becomes the second victim, Brody enlists the help of Matt Hooper (Richard Dryfuss) to help convince the mayor of the town that the beach is unsafe. Unwilling to close the door on tourism revenue during the holiday season, the mayor keeps the beaches open and Hooper, Brody and expert fisherman Quint, take to the sea in hopes of locating and capturing their lurking predator.Twenty-years later, more is known about the making of Jaws that makes it even more enjoyable viewing. For instance, we know that the shark created for the film was never tested and sunk to the bottom of the ocean on first trial. As a result, Spielberg used a camera angle that gave us the view from the shark instead of producing the actual beast itself. The result was pure terror as most of the thrilling scenes had a predator that was more implied than exploited.The new collectors edition DVD features many interesting extras that give us a glimpse into the hell that was the making of this film. A documentary featurette titled 'Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws', details how Robert Shaw had a temper, constantly fought on set with Richard Dryfuss and that he showed up for some scenes intoxicated. We also learn that Lee Marvin was Spielberg's first choice to play Quint, and how John Williams' contribution of the score was the icing that packaged the cake. A recapping of the test audience by Dryfuss takes you back to a golden age of movies when reactions were more commonplace, and how Spielberg handled the pressure of the studio executives when the film's production time ran from 55 to 155 days. Fascinating stuff.It actually amazing to see the documentary and watch the film again with the knowledge that it was only Spielberg's second real shot behind the camera after The Sugarland Express. To see him handle the drunken Shaw, the drowning Bruce (the name given to the mechanical shark) and the feuds between cast members to produce such a flawless film, is a precursor to what Steven became in later years.Almost thirty years later the affects of Jaws are widely accepted as commonplace. Jaws was the first ever film to cross over the $100 domestic growth plateau that is now used as a benchmark to rate the overall success of a films popularity. Over 65 million people went to see Jaws in 1975, which made it the first summer blockbuster, and it was one of the first films to report and have widely publicized the weekly receipts totals.1975 was indeed the year of the shark. From Time Magazine to local newscasts, sharks were everywhere, and thanks to Spielberg, they were in our nightmares too. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has lost something...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" has lost something over the years, particularly in the last 4 or 5 years (or so it seems). I used to count this among my all time favorite movies, even quite recently. Today I watched the movie again after awhile (9 months or so?) and it's starting to look very dated and somewhat silly to me. The first part of the film (before the shark hunt) is really rather dull and uninspired, if you think about it... nothing very interesting happens, a few shark attacks and some resort town politics. The scenes in the boat before the finale (particularly Robert Shaw's famous speech about the Indianapolis) are as inspired as ever, but then things get very silly and unrealistic. The shark chases the boat, purposely attacking? A shark intelligent enough to desire revenge...? Please -- give me a break.Overall the movie is still fun, but either I've changed recently or the years are just increasingly unkind to this film. It no longer looks like an inspired work of genius to me, just a decent and rather cheesy mid 70's action/adventure flick. I wouldn't expect today's audiences to get terribly excited, and am curious what the reaction would be if "Jaws" were released today with nothing much changed but the special effects. I suspect it wouldn't get a tenth as much attention as it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest (despite the shark)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all remember the first time we saw JAWS. It is a strange quirk that a film so scary is committed to the earliest memories of so many of us.We all remember being taunted by the score. We remember the fear and admiration when Hooper goes down in the cage, and we remember the absolute horror of Ben Gardners eyeless head screaming out at us.From its earliest screenings on TV, through the video boom and beyond, JAWS has somehow been left to wallow towards the 'family' end of the film listings. Perhaps it is Speilbergs subsequent output, or maybe it is the increasingly bad sequels that have given JAWS this peculiar 'spin'.I would argue that the well documented production problems encountered by speilberg and his crew, not only contributed to the films success, but also helped to create this unusual positioning of the film within the public psyche. Speilberg was unable to use as much footage of the mechanical shark as he had hoped. Salt water, and the sheer ambition of the animatronics involved conspired to hold up production and force re-write after re-write. It was during this process that the films ebb and flow (apologies), evolved.It was here that the lack of shark would manifest itself as the prolonged sense of foreboding within the film. What developed was a real sense of the fear of the unknown, and this is where much of the films success lies. It tapped into the fear of what might be in the closet, or under the bed. The monster that we know is there even if we cannot see it.It would be interesting to see if our memories of how old we were when we first watched JAWS are correct, or whether it is in re-living the real childhood experience of the hidden monster that makes us believe that we were younger than we were.It is certainly true that Speilbergs youthful brilliance, and Williams unforgettable musical motif carry what could have been an enjoyable B-movie on to a much higher cinematic plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Summer Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I think one of the best things I ever did when I was a kid was going to see "Jaws" at the Drive-In (the ultimate way to see "Jaws"!). I was nine years old when this film was released on June 20th 1975. This film is a first in several catagories. It was the first film to ever gross one hundred million dollars (this was when movie tickets cost about $2, which means to make that much money everybody and their brother saw it!). It was also the first "Summer Blockbuster" and paved the way for all of today's summer blockbusters. In my opinion it was the first and best summer film of all time. Like I said, I feel very lucky to have seen it when it was originally released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was made many years ago, yet still so many people are frightened to go in the water. This movie is directed so greatly that I don't think anyone could have done a better job. The plot is that a killer shark has been feeding on local islanders on Amity Island. So, the Chief of Police, a scientist, and a fisherman set out to kill it. The suspense that the movie builds up is incredible. This movie doesn't compare to anything from the past decade. You don't see movies like JAWS made today. The acting is done greatly. Richard Dryfuss definatly stands out in this movie. This was the highlight of Steven Spielburg's career also. This is a 10/10 movie. I will be seeing JAWS 2 in the next week or so, followed by JAWS 3, and JAWS 4, but I don't think any of them will compare even close to JAWS.** A MUST SEE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>************************SPOILERS AHEAD***************************** This movie was a milestone in filmmaking because of the special effects with the shark. It's suspenseful at times and on occasion will make you jump.When a girl is killed by a shark while swimming at a beach in a resort town, the sheriff wants to close the beach but the local town officials don't want to ruin the summer tourist season and they override him with disastrous results. Soon a young boy is eaten by the shark and the hunt is on. The sheriff (Roy Scheider), a crusty old fisherman (Robert Shaw) and a scientific type (Richard Dreyfuss) set sail in a boat called the Orca on a shark hunt and it's a battle to the finish. Not everyone survives and I won't spoil if for you by giving that part away.The main downfall of Jaws is that it is a very unromantic movie. The characters seem a bit shallow and are presented as nearly one dimensional. They go through the motions of their characters in a somewhat perfunctory manner. The actors seem to do the best they can with their lines, especially Robert Shaw who does the best with making his character seem like a real person. Richard Dreyfuss isn't too bad either and I like his sense of humor. It almost seems to me that great attention was paid to technical aspects of the film while the story line and character detail suffered a little.Nonetheless, Jaws remains an entertaining adventure/suspense move and is interesting to watch. I give it an 89.0/100. I liked Jaws II better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd think twice before going to the beach on summer vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1975 introduced "Jaws" where not only did it make Steven Spielberg a star as a director but made blockbuster history where we'd never thought nature would bring fear to a whole new world.The film starts out with a pair of young people who meet at the beach while everybody else is having a good time. The young love birds decide to go skinny dipping on the beach where after the young guy falls flat on the sand beaches too drunk to follow, his female companion goes into the cold water in the dark where she swims out too far before feeling something underwater and being pulled under to her death.The next morning Amity police chief Brody (Roy Schinder) gets a phone call about the missing girl before heading to the beach. He meets up with the young lover's boy not until they see that what remains on the beach is parts of the victim where she's been devoured to death. Nobody believes Chief Brody that it was a shark attack as the mayor (Murry Hamilton) and everybody else hides it until an incident at the beach claims a boy's life where he's eaten in whole.With a reward at stake and a funeral to be arrange, all the shark hunters including local tough guy Quint (Robert Shaw) want a piece of the action to kill the animal; however Quint doesn't want a name for himself since he's already got a rep for demanding too much including getting all of the money the town makes in tourism and other stuff. Also invited on board is marine biologist Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not convinced that the shark the first hunters killed is the actual beast where he's still on the loose.It's not until the mayor decides to open up the beach on The Fourth of July weekend where the shark returns to the kitchen to get more snacks and almost killing Chief Brody's eldest son where it now becomes a personal vendetta for the chief where he hires Quint and Hooper to go after the shark. From there "Jaws" becomes an adventure filled with energy and thrills to make you jump out of your seat and go back for more.I bet it'll make you think twice before going to the beaches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an impressive film but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have never been a particular fan of Steven Spielberg's work I admire some of his films. Esp. his first feature TV film "Duel" is a stunning piece of film. The main idea is brilliant (you never get see the enemy, the driver of the tractor-trailer, and you do not know his motif) and the effect is more frightening than most horror movies turn out to be.It is a low-budget film in contrast to "Jaws" which became very expensive and broke the record at this time."Jaws" came out in 1975, 4 years later. Like in "Duel" the huge talent of the film maker is obvious. The first half of the film is so well done, that it must be impossible to do it any better. Not only the way the suspense is built up but also the way it is filmed... to give just one example: the scene at the beach when Roy Scheider is observing the sea.In style and esp. in the style of the music there are a few minor similarities to Hitchcock (and his main composer Bernard Herrmann).By the way: The music by John Williams is very strong and adds a lot to the film!As I would rate the first half of "JAWS" for 9 or 10* of 10 points - but I'd give the second half of the movie probably 2* out of 10 points.Maybe I am the only one who sees it this way but I really think it gets a lot weaker in the end.The final on the small ship with the three men and the shark takes much too long in my opinion. It seems never-ending and always repeating and it is too explicit for my taste. There are one or two moments when you get the impression that you must be watching a B-horror-movie. (It is a lot like a horror film anyway, although you may call it a thriller or something else. There a lot some drastic shock moments.)The shark imitation is not to blame, it looks pretty good. But after not seeing the shark at all in the beginning, there is too much of it in the end.And why do I always think that some parts of the hunting were better done in "Moby Dick"? There are definitely some parallels.I watched the film on video with the "Making Of" which was very interesting and is worth seeing.</fullReview>

Due to its excellent ratings it brought about three sequels which there should have only been two the last production was disgusting. The film has an excellent cast and a great script and story. This movie is especially cool for my generation because it was an extremely well-made movie for its time and is still great to watch.

When I was old enough to appreciate the beauty of this film, my theater showed it on the big screen. Once again, I was shocked at how well this film was made and directed. Almost every scene was perfect. The use of suspense and the viewers imagination rather than showing the shark was a grest suspense trick. Now that the Aniversery DVD is out, I have been able to really appreciate this film even more because I got to find out how hard it was to make this film. There really isn't much more to say on this, except that it is perfect. I mean, for a long time, it was the highest grossing movie of all time. Eat that Citizen Kane!!! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was I think the first scary movie that I saw in my life. I was about 10 years old and I had nightmares for two maybe three nights. Because of this movie, I developed an interest in sharks, especially the Great White. As I grew older, my knowledge about sharks widened and because of this my opinion about the movie Jaws changed. In a lot of ways this is a unbelievable film (especially how the shark behaves at times). But besides this the film is very effectively shot and the acting is more than well. The film's score by John Williams is also very effective. I think that he's one of the greatest (film-)compo- sers that exists these days. My favourate moments of this movie were especially the "cage- sequence" and when Roy Schneider found the corpse in the sunken boat at night (very scary!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did Such a Young Director Create this Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admittedly think Steven Spielberg is a rather overrated director - he seems to make quantity over quality - but boy, this film certainly falls into the quality category, and we need to remember this was one of the director's first few movies.It amazes me that we got such a great film when there were a lot of problems on set, the most significant one being the mechanical shark not working properly. I believe they also weren't on schedule and definitely went over budget for this film. Spielberg was very clever to compensate for the mechanical shark though - he turned to suspense, a la Hitchcock, to frighten the audience by not actually showing the shark until halfway through the film, which was a brilliant decision. Who knows? Maybe the film would have seemed more quirky if more of the mechanical shark was shown if it wasn't malfunctioning.The character development of Brody is simple, yet really strong and smart for the context of the movie. When you're up against a giant shark to defend an island community, what a train wreck it is to be afraid of the water. At the conclusion with the closing line "I used to hate the water, I can't imagine why" we know he's come full circle - if Brody can take on a monster of the sea, what makes you think water would still scare him?Jaws also has some really good humor, a lot of it stemming from the character played by Richard Dreyfuss. The quirky shark-studier is a great character to balance out the tension between a man who wants to protect his community and a man who has a personal vendetta against sharks - who by the way delivers one of the best monologues in film history.One thing that bothers me is that Brody is blamed for the first couple of victims when the mayor of the town puts heavy pressure on Brody to keep the beaches open in order to turn a profit. It doesn't bother me in the sense that it is a bad aspect of the film, it just seems unfair, and you sort of sympathize with Brody since he wanted to protect the community and he let the community down. If anything, this is a great aspect of the film if it gets you to sympathize with Brody like it did for me.Even though this film is PG, maybe hold off on showing it to kids (unless they close their eyes at certain points) as it can upset them easily - I was terrified of Quint spurting out blood at the end of the film as a child. In general though, this is a movie everyone should see in their lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changed Cinema For the Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think its any argument that this can go down as one of the most influential films of all time as it set Hollywood on a road filled with blockbusters. At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems. There isn't much character development and the movie relies heavily on its shark attacks to keep the movie moving forward. But there isn't much arguing the movie's overall significance in the history of cinema.The first few scenes are quite a thrill even with it being almost 40 years later. Once you see the blood cover the water it instantly sends chills down your body. It takes a while for Richard Dreyfuss to get to the screen, who is by far the best part of the movie. But I would still say that the 3 men who are chosen to kill the shark aren't that interesting. But in terms of the look of the shark, I was stunned at how real it appears to be. There are some movies made now that have worse effects than this. It also amazed me at how dumb the people in this movie can be. The people on the beach are ALL aware of the recent shark attacks but yet they still feel they need to swim in the ocean. It reminds me of the citizens of New York during the Spider-Man movies. People in the world aren't that dumb.I was also taken back by the idea to break their only communication to the world on the boat. I still don't know why they destroyed it with a random baseball bat? Why is that on a boat? Nevertheless the movie did a lot for cinema and cemented its impact on special effects used.+big impact on cinema today+Richard Dreyfuss-dumb citizens and unrealistic choices7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we reconsider this three man crew. - we can come to the conclusion that Quint, even though he was the owner of the boat, was the man who stuck out like a sore thumb on board. Brody and Hooper both wore glasses and Quint did not. Do you think that they should have taken advantage of their position and overpowered him? Strength through unity? One man without glasses would not be much of a problem for two men in glasses. These observations can be extended further if one looks close enough. Hooper had a full beard Quint just had a moustache Brody had neither. But he did have glasses. The amount of facial hair decreases from Hooper down to Brody. Or if we look at it the other way - the facial hair increases if we go from Brody, through Quint up to Hooper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's there to say that hasn't been said in praise of this great film? Spielberg's classic about a great white shark terrorizing the small community of Amity Island. It's an effective powerhouse thriller with terrific direction and an iconic score by John Williams. It's based off of Peter Benchley's terrible novel. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw give the performances of their careers. Let's not forget the underrated Murray Hamilton as the Mayor. He brings sympathy to a part that most would have played as a straight-up mustache-twirling heavy. Despite all the variations and ripoffs through the years, Jaws hasn't been matched. That's because it's not just a movie about a killer shark. It's a movie about people. All of the imitators seem to forget that and just try to make a movie about a shark or bear or fill-in-the-blank-animal killing as many people as possible in gruesome ways. Today's CGI-addicted filmmakers could learn a thing or ten about storytelling from Jaws. It's definitely a classic and, in my opinion, easily Steven Spielberg's best film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For an estimated $8,000,000 dollars in 1975, I can certainly say this is definitely a must watch, and most certainly is a milestone for '70s cinematic releases. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg, and arguably one of his best. The film is probably best known (to most) by its iconic dramatic score by John Williams, which won an Oscar in '75. The score is unquestionably tenacious making Jaws even more gripping, as soon as you hear the tune you see yourself perching on the end of the seat wondering what is going to happen next. Roy Scheider as Brodymakes tremendous Sheriff, and crew member of "Orca", which is Quint's boat. Quint played by Robert Shaw absolutely smashes the role, making the tense moments even tenser ? Quint with his vast knowledge of sharks and anecdotes makes the scenes seem darker. Richard Dreyfuss stars as "Hooper", he makes some of less tense scene seem more comedic. Overall, the film for its time undeniably deserves a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg first MASTERPIECE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the cinema before this film? A sublime art that attracts attention of critics that could be rather positive or negative, and that people would rarely see only as a hobby. And the rookie Steven Spielberg, who was known for only 2 films with good reviews but commercial flops, and television directing episodes of unknown TV-series, found a dropped script and made a landmark in cinematic history.The story takes place in the peaceful community from Amity Island, where a young girl is found dead on the beach, in what appears to have been a shark attack. The new town sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) decides to give the order to close all the beaches from the island, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) prohibits the order at the request of several merchants of the island, because the city's trades relies on summer tourism. But when the mysterious shark attacks become frequent, the sheriff hires a marine biologist from the Oceanographic Institute, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to help him find and kill the mysterious killer shark. And for this hunt it joins the mysterious local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offering his boat. But the small group barely know they will need a bigger boat.This movie had everything to go wrong. Costs increase in the middle of the production of 4 million to 9 million due to several flaws in filming with cameras being damaged and problems with the mechanical shark. The Company was willing to give up the movie, but the young Spielberg insisted he wanted to go through with the job. And who would have thought that what was the predictable failure eventually end up grossing over 400 million dollars, no film before had hit that mark at the box office (which would reasonably up to 10 or 20 million). This film was the 1st blockbuster of cinema history, way before "Star Wars".Pity that nowadays people just see this film as a mere classic and nothing more. Nothing to compare with today's movies, right?! WRONG! This masterpiece (yes, masterpiece), has qualities of any great movie. "Jaws" not only marked just for have been the No. 1 blockbuster in film history, but its history also left critics and audiences amazed. The story is not just about three men chasing a white shark, well, it is, but how it is constructed. The screenplay by Carl Gottlieb and Peter Benchley (who wrote the book on which the film was based) building realistic and relatable characters, no film had ever done that before, bringing human reality to the film. Getting to make a realistic narrative characters, and several hilarious moments, bringing the film an excellent entertainment.But even with laughter, the film brings terrifying moments when the hunt starts. And Spielberg delivers one of his best directing debuts provided with excellent chilling scenes to breathtaking action scenes. And that's why Spielberg proved to be so talented, managing to have a large variation in he direction, ranging from sublime scenes of dialogue to the terrifying scenes of shark attacks, and the chilling last 30 minutes of the film. It also thanks the classic and terrifying soundtrack of John Williams, who will live forever and frighten us by his "dandan dandan dandandandandandandan" with the mysterious monster getting closer ever more.And also the performances are no bat at all, actually they are all superb. Almost the entire cast came from movies and unknown plays and even in the case of Robert Shaw as the magnificent and unforgettable Le Quint Dickey (which serves almost as a parody of Captain Ahab and his hunt for the white whale Moby  Dickey). This film also has also secured the fame of both Scheider and Dreyfuss entering in other films which would guarantee their first Oscar nominations and here they won their first fortunes.If you wonder why Spielberg is so well known and appreciated today, see this masterpiece. The master with this film not only mixed a loyal adaptation of a book with humor and horror, but redefined modern cinema forever. Thanks to this film, actors and directors today earn fortunes, people line up to see and be entertained with a movie, which gave us cinema of quality cinema. All thanks to a terrifying soundtrack from John Williams and Steven Spielberg, with "Jaws", one of his first of many masterpieces.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film in America to make over 100 million US dollars domestically. Steven Spielberg's "Jaws", to this day continues to be one of the most entertaining summer horror movies ever made. What was harassed at the studio as "That fish movie", production had began without a script (It would be eventually be co-written by the original author Peter Benchley), a cast and even a shark. Constant malfunctions hindered the use of the mechanical fish, so "Jaws" was a movie that adapted and decided to use those problems to its advantage. By taking what is undoubtedly John Williams most iconic piece of music, and toying with the audiences security to such perfection rarely a thing has been mimicked since or prior."Oh the music is starting! The sharks gonna appear", "THERE IT IS!!!", "Oh it's starting again! Wait where's the shark?"Some of the many reactions you would get from the audience, "Jaws" literally had me terrified of ocean water when I was 6 years old (Smart time to watch it right?). Growing up I got over that fear, and just enjoyed how laid back and cool Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are taking on such a demanding mission. Even older and a little more wiser, to see the naturalism come from Robert Shaw's performance is just phenomenally captivating. Seeing the shark again to which so many people will dismiss as fake (Duh!), I still think it looks more than impressive even to this day (Beating any CGI shark of recent time). Seriously, I don't think there has been a shark as impressive in the movies ever since, even when this shark does stuff sharks don't do like ram boats. Next to all that, some of Spielberg's camera set-ups are just brilliant (I don't even want to imagine how hard it must have been to film in the ocean). From uncomfortable close ups, POV's and compositions where the shark looks down at the oceanic floor, this movie really has ingenuity written all over it.Final Verdict: The story that scared a little town ended up scaring an entire Nation. It's been analysed to death, and some of the theories you can research are downright ludicrous. This is the template of how Blockbusters should be made, now I'm going fishing! 10/10.</fullReview>

And because of this it was a lot more scary because you new that the shark was their but you couldn't see it so it provided suspense. The idea of using a mechanical shark in the ocean seemed easy to do at first but it failed so many times but with the expertise of Steven, he made the movie look awesome. Last but not least Quints Indianapolis speech was the best speech in movie history and Brody's line "We're gonna need a bigger boat" is the most iconic line in the movie and second best line out of all the movies next to Darth Vader's line "I am you're father". In the end Jaws was a awesome movie and even in 2013 it is still better then most shark movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1970's was the very first to start the blockbuster trend? Yes no prize for guessing, it was the 70's, let me illiterate once more if you haven't got the message ? the 70's was the greatest decade for film, like ever! So what film and director started it all off? Well that prize goes to a little known director named Steven Spielberg and the honour of being the first blockbuster film goes to..drum roll (queue drum roll- well at least you tap the desk) please .. It is ? Jaws a film that made every resident of a small town, scared to go into the water. Yes Jaws was officially regarded as the very first film to coin the term blockbuster. It was the summer of 75, and a little known director, with just $9 million in his back pocket had a little film called Jaws that he wanted everyone to see, of course it doesn't take a genius to guess what a film with the name Jaws would be about. Would be about a killer shark? ? but wait your wrong, it isn't about just your average shark, no in fact it a giant killing machine shark! Ha never saw that coming did you. Well anyway to cut a long story short, Spielberg took that little known film, and with a clever marketing campaign, we was able to turn $9 million, into $450 million and became rich and successful, then he decided to release a little known film in 77 called Close Encounters of a Third Kind, which made$340 million from $20 million, then from there he became even more rich and successful then he was already. How nice for Spielberg. But what I think made Jaws so successful and a completely chilling watch, was the fact that during the entire film, you rarely actually get to see the shark full on ? which abides to the rule of all good horror film, DON'T SHOW THE MONSTER! Although technically they didn't show the shark because at that point CGI was not in use, so they had to use a rubber shark, and let's be honest who is scared of a rubber shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line "Stop playing with yourself Hooper" to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Spielberg's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got this movie because I am a huge fan of Spielberg's earlier movies. I thought to myself, "Man, I better get this movie on DVD and watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered." It was definitely worth it. It brought back the action and scares of back when I first saw it back in 2007. It does start out slow, but it gradually builds up to the climactic last 45-60 minutes. I'll start out with the acting. It was great. The actors worked very well with the script, and they kept the movie entertaining the first 60-75 minutes. I will say, the beginning was kind of boring, and I was just waiting for the end hour. The end all together makes up for it though. The special effects were awesome for the 70's era of movies. How they made the shark that moves and bites down and stay in the budget of 8 million dollars, I don't know. Although, money was a lot different back in the 70's. I don't know. Anyway, Everything about this movie was pretty good, especially for the 70's, when film wasn't always high-quality like this. In fact the only reason this movie gets a 9 is because it had a boring start. I don't really know what else to review. OH! How about the story? Pretty clich'd these days, but probably original back in '75. Today, there are poopy shark movies where they can fly, walk on land, and can stay still, and everybody who knows about sharks know they can't stay still (except one species) or else they suffocate. Syfy really messed up the killer shark genre. Like Sharknado, Super Shark, Dinoshark and 2- headed Shark Attack, just to name a few. It's kind of hard to come across a decent shark movie like this one nowadays. Anyway, I still really like this movie. I give it a 90% because it is realistic for it's time, and is one of the most creative, original killer shark movies I've ever seen.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was the first frightening film I saw when I was a kid, at that age, it gave me a lot of nightmares. Is an important and very special movie for me, it contains the best scariest speech in cinematic history: The story of U.SS Indianapolis that is related by Quint (Robert Shaw), this scene is an instant classic, is one of my favorite scenes of all time, but the truth is that after seen the movie, I made a presentation of various shipwrecks and one of theme was the Indianapolis, I related the story of the Indianapolis and I spoke like Robert Shaw, in a moment I thought that I was him, an iconic character for me and, of course an iconic and symbolic scene. Jaws have also memorable scary scenes, Sheyder and Dreyfuss do a great job but the hero for me is Shaw, probably his best role. Another important thing is the soundtrack, the main theme is considered an absolute classic by all. It the was the first time that a soundtrack caused so many fear and panic to people of getting in the water, that means that Spielberg did his job. Jaws is a masterpiece that you can't get tired of see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little wonder that JAWS has become the quintessential summer movie: it's big and scary and a boatload of fun- STILL, after all these years. It wasn't until I migrated South that I caught my first glimpse of a real-life shark. It was an overcast, rainy day, and The Wife suggested we go to the beach. I don't "do" the beach ("Drowning," as Roy Scheider's Chief Brody explains in the movie.); fell asleep on the beach one day and woke up three hours later with golfball-size blisters on my shins. But I gave in and we went. I was sitting on the beach, watching as She swam out into the choppy waters. She rolled over, belly up, and started drifting toward a nearby pier. I was watching, not really interested, when something broke the surface of the water on the far side of my wife. It was a momentary thing, but I clearly saw the arched back- and the fin. I stood up and shouted a warning. She waved me off and continued to drift toward the pier. I followed, searching the surface of the ocean for another tell-tale sign of you-know-what. When she finally came ashore, I told her what I'd seen. She argued that I was just lying to scare her out of the water so we could go home. She went back into the water and I spent the rest of that day watching for the attack I was convinced would come. There was no attack- but, the very next day, not one but THREE sharks were hooked by fishermen fishing off of the pier toward which my wife had drifted. After learning of this, she decided to never again take a dip in the ocean. I could sympathize: after seeing JAWS, I vowed NEVER to get in the ocean. If Man were meant to swim, he'd have fins...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED this film! It was very exciting. It had to do with Chief Brody, who does not like the water because his fear of drowning. One night, a girl goes missing and her body parts are washed up on the beach. Chief Brody thinks its a shark, but the mayor thinks its something else that killed her. One day a young boy gets attacked by the shark and is killed. Then a shark hunter named Quint says that he will kill the shark. Chief Brody meets a man named Hooper, who studies sharks. Hooper sees the girl's body parts and says that a shark DID kill her. One day while swimming a teenager also gets attacked by the shark. Quint, Hooper and Chief Brody go on the Orca, a boat, to set out and kill the shark. Hooper goes in a cage in the water to see the shark, but the shark breaks the metal cage and gets stuck, giving Hooper a chance to get out of the cage and hides from the shark, still in the water. Later on, The shark breaks the boat and devours Quint. Chief Brody throws a tank in the sharks mouth. The shark tries to kill Chief Brody, but Brody shoots the tank and blows up the shark, killing it. Hooper comes to the surface and Hooper and Brody swim back to land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes things do not go as plans and turn out better than you ever could have hoped. Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a movie about a killer shark but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies of its generation. I'm talking, of course, about Jaws. This thriller has a very simple premise but turned out to be one of the best movies ever made. Filmed on Martha's Vineyard, this film was a pain to shoot, but the reward was well worth it.Jaws had a really strong cast with Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss. Chief Brody struggles to convince his summer town that there is a killer shark in their waters. The big problem is that it is 4th of July weekend and they need this weekend because tourists bring in all the money the town needs to survive. If word gets out of a killer shark that means no money which means no survival. Murray Hamilton plays the foolish mayor who won't listen to reason. The shark kills a few people and push comes to shove. Brody brings in Matt Hooper, a shark expert, and they figure out the shark is a great white. This thing is a cold blooded eating machine. "All this fish does is eat, sleep, and make baby sharks, it's that simple." Eventually, the town hires Quint, a local fisherman and Brody, Quint, and Hooper venture out to kill the shark. That is our story and it really is done so well.Jaws is based off a book and they are similar. The basic story is obviously the same, character relationships and development is very similar. The only difference is that Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. In the movie itself we see them get along and build a relationship and its interesting how Spielberg threw a little tease n there for fans of the book. Also the endings were both different which I also find interesting. The movie ending was way more explosive and enjoyable.As I said this movie was terrifying when it was released in the 70s, but it was scary by accident. The mechanical shark they used was named Bruce, but the thing never worked. To make up for it they only showed parts of the shark. It takes a long time to see what the full shark looks like. Sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, it's what you don't see, and that is what worked so well. We see a girl screaming for her life and getting dragged around, but we don't see what is doing it. It is almost disturbing but it worked and films have copied this tactic time and time again. There were also a lot of problems filming on the open sea. I mention this because any real fan of film would appreciate to know how hard it was to make this movie and how dedicated the filmmakers were to deliver.Along with the scary images of a torn leg, a decaying face, and blood being spit out of a mouth while the jaws of the shark pierce into the abdomen are horrifying, John Williams makes it ten times worse with two notes. Everybody knows the Jaws theme and how it starts out slow and picks up. As it gets faster and faster the shark gets closer and closer, and finally strikes. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time, and John Williams proves it once again, and he did it with two notes. Towards the end of the movie all the focus is on Quint, Hooper, Brody, and the shark. Hooper and Quint's relationship is really hysterical. It is old school verses new school. Quint is the rugged fisherman who just makes it up as he goes along. Hooper is the rich college boy with a plan. They butt heads a lot and their sarcastic remarks back and forth are very entertaining. My favorite scene in the entire movie is towards the end when the three men are on the boat telling stories of how they got their scars from sharks or whatever. Then Quint tells a true story of the USS Indianapolis. The USS Indianapolis was a cruiser that sank and all the sailors were in the water and over a few days sharks attacked and killed mostly everyone. Quint was on that ship and he tells the story. Robert Shaw gives one of the best speeches I have ever seen in any movie. The way he tells the story. "And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes." He describes sharks really well and that story was not something I expected form the movie. The true story takes the audience out of the movie and you feel sadness. We dig into Quint's character and even the way the camera just focuses on Quint and how he tells the story. This is a scene I watch twice every time because I love the way he delivers the speech. The only problem I have with the movie itself is that there are two scenes that scare the daylights out of me and I still can't what, and it is impossible to understand what Quint is saying without subtitles.Overall, Jaws is a classic and I love the way it was made, the people in it, and the movie itself. The movie works and it is nearly flawless. Jaws is a movie everybody alive in this world needs to see at least once. I bought this on blu ray and it was the best up converted movie I have seen so far. The picture was perfect and the sound was amazing. Sometimes I find myself constantly changing the volume of my surround sound but not with Jaws. Jaws easily gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer Blockbuster at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg take a bow. This film has it all (except aliens and cowboys). Set in a sleepy summer beachy town terror lurks in the depths. The tempo is what I like best building around unforgettable characters and its display of power struggles from mayor to chief to captain! Suspense at its finest. The 3 pivotal characters are introduced in heir own right and end up walking the same line. The cat and mouse game not only between shark and man but between hooper quint and brody is a delight. Not wanting to get too technical but for a fuller appreciation of the movie I recommend watching the making of the movie too. Back to the film itself the locations and sub story's all tie in greatly to the bigger picture. With minimal effects and maximum joy it's a movie that you'll enjoy watching over and over again. Just as good when I saw it he first time. The standout scene has to be quints speech about the USS INDIANAPOLIS. I've watched this film many times and it always gets my full attention. On my last note who can forget John Williams. Did he make he beast even more frightening the music score is timeless. Most deserved Oscar winning performance. You'll never swim the same again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a quick note on Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece Jaws: Everything works. Yes, the whole background story on the movie came out years ago, their mechanical shark kept sinking, etc, but as for the final product: (let me repeat) everything worked. Score, acting, dialogue, suspense, realism, plot development, urgency, you name it. I have read the book, and of course there were changes ? anyone yet comment on the missing love affair between Brody's wife and Hooper? ? but, all novels change from page to screen. What Spielberg did was amazing. He didn't create a horror movie. Nor a shark movie. It was a movie concerning a small town 100% reliant on tourism and if anything goes against that, whether economy, weather, bad publicity or in this case, shark attacks, the town could go under. I never labeled this movie as a horror or monster movie. To me, it was an adventure and a suspense movie reliant on one man, an outsider, to battle something that will destroy both the local economy but also the islanders themselves. You get rich history and depth from the Mayor, Ellen Brody, Hooper, (especially) Quint and of course, Chief Brody. Heck, the whole town's inhabitants are rich in character. Honestly, skip the sequels. As a kid, I loved Jaws 2, but as an adult, watching all 4 (so far) films, only the original Jaws was worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 Years On, Still A Haunting Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely regarded by critics &amp; viewers alike as one of the greatest, scariest &amp; most influential films of all time, Jaws is Steven Spielberg's breakthrough feature that didn't only catapulted his career to great heights but also ended up establishing the modern Hollywood business model by becoming the first blockbuster in cinema history.Set in a fictional Amity Island, the story concerns a town sheriff, a marine scientist &amp; a local fisherman who team up to hunt down a gigantic great white shark which has been terrorizing their small island community but once they set out to sea, they only end up discovering themselves as the ones who are being hunted by the great white.Produced on low budget, the masterful creativity of director Steven Spielberg is at full display here as he didn't only film it with great emphasis on plot &amp; development but brilliantly amplified the tension as well by not explicitly showing us the shark for the majority of its runtime while not denying its presence either and when he did show it, it made many jump off their seats.Also supporting great direction is this film's tense screenplay, honest performances from its entire cast, great use of camera, superb editing and finally, the biggest contributor in turning Jaws into an absolutely bone-chilling experience, John Williams' tense score which elevated the horror to new heights &amp; made the film twice as effective.Nearly 40 years have passed since this fright classic hit the screen &amp; yet, even after countless imitations, it retains its ability to frighten the viewers with the same fervour as it did in the 1970s. A haunting masterpiece that made an entire generation afraid of ever stepping into the ocean again, Jaws has very effectively managed to stand the test of time &amp; will hopefully continue to do so for many more decades.Immortal for its contribution to the genres of horror &amp; suspense and a watershed moment for cinema itself, this unforgettable chiller remains one of Steven Spielberg's finest achievements in the film industry and without a shadow of a doubt comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are a part of my life. They consume it but I love them. The one that stands above it is the great classic that does it all and then some: Jaws. From when I was 2 years old, Jaws has been everything that other movies have not. The reason this still stands so strong is very simple: the human story does too. You actually care about the characters, such as Brody is simply an ordinary father and husband thrown out of his element to give the community he's sworn to protect a summer they deserve. Hooper is a similar role, being both funny and a genuine friend to Brody. The counterpoint to both men is Quint, the old man of the sea. He's grizzled and tough, and he doesn't let anything get in his way. The shark is the thing that stands in front of them and brings them together and forces each of them to their limit, sometimes beyond it. This is what goes into creating one of the most exciting and best movies period. Such a simple story with so much more depth. This is why Jaws is at the top, for me at least. It shows depth and throws the audience, especially me, for a loop all the way through. Stunning then, stunning now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deserves all the plaudits it receives, the rousing and climactic attacks and the epic finale are worthy of the mega status it garners. It only loses credibility through the incessant comparisons with inferior products, and being considered the mothership of shark movies, will always suffer for its subsequent associations. The presentation of the shark isn't always realistic, but then in 1975, we didn't have shark week to saturate us with the real thing.The principal trio, despite their apparent off-camera 'issues', have a likable rapport (albeit sometimes strained, consistent with the narrative), and though I'd favour Shaw's performance for its hero and villain dichotomy, Scheider and Dreyfuss still perform well above their weight in experience at the time.Music, dialogue, suspense, timing and photography - it's the complete package in my opinion that totally immerses you in fear. I'm not sure how it translates to the younger audiences of today, used to a more explicit depiction, but it's a lesson in the "less is more" tactic when showing the protagonist, for itself the eponymous squalis is not absurdly proportioned like the more recent "Megalodon" movies, and still convincing enough to keep me on terra firma indefinitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The blockbuster of all blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that epitomizes the word "blockbuster". It is a thrilling, potentially haunting work, brilliantly sewn together by Spielberg's direction (despite his youth!), John Williams' riveting musical score, and the performances of the actors. Roy Scheider excellently portrays Martin Brody as an everyman who conquers his deepest fears at the realization of his guilt for the calamities on the waters of Amity Island. Richard Dreyfuss brings a lot of fervor and energy to the role of Matt Hooper, which is key to that character's scientifically inquisitive nature -- yet he also has an amiable side, forming a friendship with Brody which forms a strong backbone for the story. Quint (Robert Shaw) is a legendary character -- a man both simple and mysterious whose fearlessness is nothing short of inspiring. His soliloquy about the USS Indianapolis is among the most spine-chilling that I have ever seen in a film before. It truly shook me to my core with trepidation and awe, which is precisely what a film like this should aim to do.What Spielberg did especially well was conceal the monster throughout the first half of the story. By not showing the face of Jaws during the first few encounters, tension was able to mount until finally the shark was glaring right at us several feet away from Brody. This was done while Brody was throwing bait into the water, and right on the heels of a joking line! Absolutely perfect timing! Plus by this time we'd become accustomed to hearing that low-pitch music whenever Jaws was around, thereby making the appearance even less expected. The element of surprise was employed masterfully by the screenwriters and cinematographer throughout Jaws -- in the early scenes on the beach I was on the edge of my seat with anxiety, just waiting for an innocent swimmer to be pulled beneath the water!I also got a kick out of Brody and Hooper's constant feuding with the mayor of the town (Murray Hamilton). That just goes to show you that politics and protection of the citizens are not always one and the same. Hooper's insistence on the tiger shark that was caught being "a shark but not THE shark" in the face of adversity very much drew my respect.I also saw some extra behind-the-scenes footage of the production of Jaws, and learned that when Spielberg first heard Williams play the theme music of Jaws, he laughed at its simplicity, only to later come to appreciate that aspect of it and applaud it. This is a wonderful lesson on how simple things are not always necessarily dull or clich -- sometimes they meet the demand perfectly, and that is the case here, as I'm sure I'm not alone in claiming I can't get that music out of my head!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an intense movie, a powerful movie, a very entertaining film, and a very good one. "Jaws" works because it packs a strong punch, deftly directed by a young Spielberg, a man who made some interesting choices to make the film, and the end result couldn't be more satisfying.The film tells the story of a monster white shark that terrorizes a New England beach resort. The nightmare escalates as the number of victims increase, and a hunting party runs into a series of problems. This leads to more fatal results. Eventually our trio of heroes gets a chance to fight the shark, which proves to more challenging than expected.Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are three very different men and actors; yet in this film their work is remarkable in both their individual scenes and as a group. It is their group work that stands out because they are almost in every scene in the second half of the movie. They are excellent in their quiet moments as we learn more about each character's background, and also while combining their expertise to kill the beast.Spielberg filmed almost all of the water scenes in the open ocean, making it difficult for the entire crew, but the film looks and feels real. Had technology been more sophisticated, the film would be perfect in its technical aspects, but it might be those challenges that drove Spielberg to become more creative while planning his shots, telling the story. What amazes me is how little we see the shark. I wonder what it'd be like if the movie was made now. It'd still have his mark, and his ability to direct has remained constant, always trying to give us quality in a variety of genres.Many people were scared enough to stop swimming after seeing "Jaws". It worked because it is direct, about a real creature, and not marred by the overuse of technology. Proof of its quality is that since it came out, there have been few stories that even came close to what "Jaws" achieved. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies have such a powerful effect on someone that it makes them take action. Or, in this case, not take action. For instance, after watching "Jaws", I may never go into the water again. And if I do, splashing is not an option. The first time this was a few years ago and frankly, I remember it being boring. I am here to say I no longer think that. Yes, it is a bit slow at times but as a whole, that takes nothing away from this movie. Martin Brody is a police deputy on a popular resort island. One morning, he discovers a woman has been killed by what looks like a shark. He panics and plans to shut down the beach, but the mayor just dismisses it as a boating accident. When another shark attack occurs, a search team goes to find and kill the shark but a specialist named Matt Hooper discovers it's the wrong one. This leads to another bigger search involving a man named Quint and together the three men go on a mission to find this shark. With good acting, a good script, and an excellent plot, this is a fabulous film that is definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edgy, Suspeseful and Scary. It's still awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I have been told to stay away from this movie. Later I was told to watch it. After watching it for the first time today (via NetFlix). I saw it and I loved it. Hello and welcome to "Matthew Praises." Where I get to praise the heck out of something that is worth the watch. After 25 years of parodies (specifically in cartoons e.g. Mr. Jaw in THE PINK PANTHER SHOW). Now I finally saw it and boy it was like an answer to the question, "What if Alfred Hitchcock made a monster movie?" I like the way we get introduced to Quint. In the scene where the crowd is clamoring at the town meeting, we hear and then see, Quint's hand scratching the chalkboard slowly, and they all shut up. I was like, "Whoa! That is so edgy." No whistle or yell for attention. No. Just scratching nails on a chalkboard. That got spoofed in an episode of SOUTH PARK where Cartman did it when Randy Marsh was having a meeting. John Williams' score is catchy and scary. The mechanical effects are rather clunky by today's standards, but back then, it was awesome and realistic. If you want to make a horror film or learn about film making, then this is for you! Bottom line: It's edgy suspenseful and scary. Go on give it a watch, I highly recommend it. Rated PG for language, scary and suspenseful scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Hollywood Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have the aptitude to inaugurate generational relevance. Jaws, is one of those films. Released in 1975, Spielberg's film resonates with me as one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Jaws instills fear by enabling you to imagine the horror that lurks beneath the surface of the water. There's no paranormal activity in this film, no mad man with an axe, and no certifiable maniac that employs a game of death. Jaws exhibits an impracticle, but substantive scenario. You're at the beach, decide to take a swim, and suddenly see a four foot fin submerge beneath you...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most terrifying films of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a small New England seaside town becomes victim to several attacks from a Great White shark, the police chief, a grizzly seaman, and a young shark expert go out to sea in order to try and stop the shark from attacking.Based on the Peter Benchley novel, this film manages to take the relatively simple plot and make so much more out of it. This movie's insane success supposedly jump started the type of film known as the summer blockbuster. With this film, Steven Spielberg became a household name and one of the world's most famous directors. Spielberg manages to create a Hitchcock-style thriller while putting his own unique touch on it. Indeed, just like how Hitchcock's PSYCHO made people afraid to take a shower, Spielberg made people afraid of going swimming. Spielberg doesn't show the shark on screen for a great deal of the film, which works to the film's advantage. When he does show the creature, he gives it the right amount of menace and terror to make it believable. Besides being incredibly frightening, Spielberg creates a fascinating character study. He sets the last third of the film on-board a small fishing boat, which allows the three main actors to play off of each other and create natural performances. Roy Scheider gives a natural performance as Chief Brody. Schieder makes Brody feel like Everyman, a person you'd know in real life. Robert Shaw gives an incredibly intense and raw performance as Quint, the grizzled seaman. His intensity matches the film's tone perfectly. Richard Dreyfuss has some funny moments as Hooper. What review would be complete without mentioning the music by the legendary John Williams? His main theme for the film is one of the most recognizable in film history, and right up there with Bernard Hermann's score for PSYCHO as one of the best scores for a horror film. Followed by three sequels, but the original is by far the best of the lot. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when a giant great-white shark starts munching on swimmers in a small coastal town? A blockbuster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this movie!!!! I think it is the best movie of all time!!! Jaws was a original and exciting novel that became an jaw-dropping thrill-ride of a movie from start to finish. It should have way won more than just 3 Oscars!!!! With its thrilling and terrifying script, excellent special effects, and amazing cast and crew, Jaws was easily an instant classic. The astonishing Robert Shaw gives a legendary performance as Ouint, the fearless shark hunter. Roy Schieder gives one of the greatest performances ever!!! The wonderful Richard Dreyfuss is magnificent as Matt Hopper. Together, the make the best trio of all time. Steven Spielberg did a more than fantastic job directing this masterpiece. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb did the best adaption of a novel ever. John Williams score is scary and unforgettable. Every who made this should have been given an award, even the extras!!!!! Jaws successfully combines horror, action, and drama into an original, suspenseful thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat and out of the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Steven Spielberg was in production of Jaws, he thought that this would end his career. Little did he know what a masterpiece he would create.Everything about this movie is great. Especially the suspense. The movie uses the POV view to such great affect, and not showing the shark only adds to the terror.Also, there is the score. What can I say? It's one of the most famous scores in film history and still one of the best. If it weren't for the score, I don't think the movie would be as intense as it is.The setting itself can be suspenseful. Especially when Brody, Hooper, and Quint are on the boat The Orca. Being alone in the middle of the ocean and not knowing when the shark is going to come is pretty scary.The actors all do a great job. Especially Robert Shaw as Captain Quint. I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for best actor because this is seriously the best performance I've ever seen by an actor. The scene where Quint talks about the U.S.S. Indianapolis is the scene that really shows how good he was.And at last we have the shark, or Bruce as he's known. The special affects were pretty well done on him. They made him look and act like a real shark (despite the shark not working on countless occasions). Other times it was a real great white shark filmed by shark experts from Australia. These shots blend in perfectly with the shots of the robot shark, and in the heat of a great scene, you wouldn't even notice.Jaws is one heck of a thrill ride. I'm saying this lightly. It's really one of if not the best movie ever made. If you haven't seen it, go rent it or buy it. It's well worth your time.10/10 *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amity Island, a small community whose main business is its beaches. When Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. This doesn't sit well with the Mayor and several of the local businessmen. Brody backs down to his regret as that weekend a young boy is killed by the predator. The boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fisherman hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon Quint, Brody and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are at sea hunting the Great White shark....This is the film we have to thank for blockbusters like ID4, Jurassic Park, and Robin Hood: POT. It's also responsible in some way for Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth. It's basically the movie that started the summer blockbuster, and it's so easy to see why. Spielberg has crafted easily his most entertaining movie, with real shocks, laughs and some of the most emotional scenes in a big movie like this.From the USS Indianapolis speech, to the opening scene, to the scene with Brody and his son, to the brilliant use of the camera in that scene, to the immortal lines 'gonna need a bigger boat' and 'smile you sonofa .....' there is something here that everyone loves.And seeing it on the big screen just shows how terrifying the film really is compared to DVD. In some instances the film can be seen as an insight into consumerism, and the fact that traditional celebrations are vanishing. The shark could be a metaphor for the changes in economy, taking away part of the July 4th celebrations of Amity, encouraging regulars to go elsewhere in future, scuppering local business.But it's still a fun movie, with the film being infinitely better once it's the three men on the boat, being stalked by Bruce.An excellent film by all accounts, wonderful performances, and the film that you always think about when you go for a swim.</fullReview>

From Wikipedia: "At 12:14 a.m. on July 30, 1945, the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Philippine Sea and sank in 12 minutes. Of 1,196 men on board, approximately 300 went down with the ship. The remainder, about 900 men, were left floating in shark-infested waters with no lifeboats and most with no food or water. The ship was never missed, and by the time the survivors were spotted by accident four days later only 316 men were still alive.

		<fullReview>In 1975 a film off one of the worlds most popular books was made into a great film. And they trusted it into the hands of a 26 year old man. And since then a great name has been around in cinema history. Jaws is one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It is also one of the most frighting and edge of your seat thriller's. But the film's ain't as scary as the book. The story is pretty simple. A sleepy town which goes to panic pretty much like all crap modern day horror. But Jaws isn't crap this is brilliant. The acting is great the best is clearly by Robert Shaw. A great English star. The worst thing about this film is that it caused the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that still remains creepy to this day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was probably around 8 or 9 when I saw Jaws, which would have being perhaps 2002/2003. Of course, I both enjoyed it and was creeped out by it. Spielberg has used excellent techniques in filming and writing. The three main actors are really good, the highlight probably being Robert Shaw for his portrayal of Quint, the grizzly, shark hunting war veteran who is able to persuade us and hook us (excuse my pun-after all, he is a fisherman!), and I especially enjoyed his U.S.S Indianapolis monologue. Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss, along with Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton, also captivate the viewers. Scenes such as the attack on Chrissie Watkins or the scene in which the head pops out of the ruined boat are amongst the scary and thrilling scenes Jaws has to offer, and lines such as "I think we need a bigger boat" ave gone down as iconic lines in film history, along with such quotes as "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse" or "Here's Johnny! I sincerely hope rumors about a remake are false. Such an idea would ruin Jaws timeless legacy, as it's dismal sequels Jaws 3-D or Jaws the revenge did (Jaws 2 wasn't so bad) So if there are any filmmakers considering to redo Jaws that stumble upon this comment, please, for the sake of this film, don't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitome of Tension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of this comment will, I realize, be meandering, spotty, and anecdotal, but what with more than 500 reviews of this movie already on file, how much can be lost by a bit of negative entropy? I think we can skip the story except to say fish eats man, man finally kills fish. The fish was called Bruce, or was it Moby Bruce. Roy Scheider is the chief of police of a resort fishing village on an island. He's the local authority so often found in monster movies. Murray Hamilton is the superior who doesn't trust or believe Scheider. Richard Dreyfus is the requisite scientist -- often but not always a toothsome babe. In this case the expert can be a man because Scheider is already happily married, with children, as the first half of the movie establishes. Robert Shaw is Quint, an anomaly, the rough, tough shark fisherman who has contempt for ordinary people. Usually that's part of the police chief's role.The movie was a HUGE popular and commercial success, and for good reason. The visuals and special effects are perfectly realized, the music nail-bitingly suspense inducing, and the characters are not cardboard cutouts as they so often are in routine action thrillers.Take Scheider's sheriff. He has a family and he loves them but the bond is projected in everyday ways. A cheaper script would have him telling his kids, just as he's about to leave on a suicide mission, how much he loves them and if he doesn't come back -- well, just remember to do what your mother tells you and don't forget to brush your teeth regularly and visit a dentist twice a year and stay away from women with barbed-wire tattoos. Scheider does none of that, and if he ever even kisses his wife, I managed to miss it this time around.Furthermore, unlike so many action/science fiction/horror protagonists, Scheider is flawed. Not seriously, but still -- afraid of being on the water? So phobic that he must consume a couple of bottles of wine and get drunk in order to board a boat? It's played mostly for comic effect, but Scheider isn't given any excuse for his fears either. He didn't watch his Dad drown or get waterboarded as a prisoner or anything like that.The most interesting character, though, is Shaw's Quint, the crack shark hunter. We're talking major league Hemingwayism here. Shaw wears a fishing cap just like Papa's, he's vulgar, he dislikes college kids, he drinks home-made "hootch", he's been through a war -- a man's man in every respect. And when it comes to Bruce, he is wrong at every turn. He makes all the mistakes in the book out of an excess of self confidence, smashing the boat's radio, deliberately burning out an engine bearing, and paying for it as a Hemingway hero would. Gulp. There has rarely been a more interesting case study of overreaching.Sharks as a group aren't evil in themselves. As Dreyfus explains, all they do is eat and make little sharks, only one or two incremental evolutionary units below humans in those respects. Hordes of three-foot blue sharks used to come up in our chum stream off Sandy Hook and I used to reach into the water from our outboard, grab one by the tail, and flip it flapping and spinning overhead. They're like pussy cats. It's only when they get bigger that they get spookier. I was on a fishing boat anchored about fifty feet of Olosega Island in Samoa and a couple of guys dived overboard and swam ashore in the most casual way. I happened to look down over the other side and there, barely moving through the electric blue water, was a dusky monster I estimated at about eight feet. I was tickled pink I wasn't swimming along joking and laughing with the others. In this instance, Bruce gets his just deserts. He's got an explosive CO2 container lodged in his cheek. The enormous blast fills the air with tiny chondroblasts.The director and composer haven't misjudged their audience often in this movie but they get carried away in one noticeable scene. Now get this. Bruce has eaten several people and has just revealed himself as more of a whale than a shark, and he's performed incredible feats of strength, enough even to impress Quint, who has seen everything. Now Bruce has a couple of highly buoyant plastic barrels attached to him and he's plowing through the water paying no attention to the drag. Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfus are pursuing him in the fishing boat, its engine full out, barely able to keep up with this man-eating beast. And the musical score suddenly switches from its well-know THUM THUM -- THUM THUM -- to light-hearted happy music, as if we were watching two youngsters having an exciting but tame adventure, an exhilarating horse race through the woods. I wonder if anyone else felt the music was a little discordant. I'm happy though that Shaw, for all his faults, used the word "hootch" in this movie. It means "illegal liquor" and it comes from the language of the Tlingit Indians who live along the mountainous northwest coast of Alaska and Canada, a cheerful, industrious group. Not enough Tlingit words have been borrowed into English. "Cayuse" is the only other one I can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's finest film is Jaws , which is saying something considering he's probably the greatest director that ever lived. Jaws is not simply a monster movie, it goes right in to the heart of an island community Amity Island, which is terrorised by a man -eating shark which staked its claim in the friendly waters of a New England island community. The rich characterisation of every character is sublime. The suspense is unbelievable, and the sense of fear adventure and wonderment of the open water is also evident in this film. This film made me terrified of Sharks, and the water since i was a child- thats a mark of a great movie right there. The editing in JAWS was Oscar winning, and deservedly so- it had masterful cinematography, and the score from Williams is probably his greatest even above Indiana Jones and Star Wars, and the score to Jaws the 'bah-bum-bah-bum' is possibly the most famous piece of music you will ever hear in a motion picture. All this combine to make this if not the greatest film of all time- pretty darn close to it, due to every individual element of film-making at its very best throughout this picture. The opening attack, is the most shocking beginning to a movie your likely to see...with the highly documented problems in production with the mechanical shark undoubtedly makes this film so special as Spielberg got to do what he does best. Create suspense without actually seeing the perpetrator. Think about the T-Rex in Jurassic Park we knew his arrival with the thud and the vibrations in the mud or a glass of water for instance. Spielberg does similar here, we know the shark is there with the use of an underwater camera taking the sharks POV and John Williams famous music. IN this opening scene the vulnerable girl is killed dramatically from something from below...the camera work follows her legs from the depths as the camera takes the Sharks POV and the music begins, and the camera gets closer and closer then the attack...a masterful piece of suspense film-making. The rubber shark itself isn't terrifying, but the seamless editing and Spielbergs masterful direction makes it so. One scene which deserves an in-depth look is the scene where the young boy on the raft is killed. What is great about this scene and what makes Spielberg truly great and at his height of his suspense craft is how he set up this scene. The premise is the chief Brody paranoid of another attack so he sits in his beach chair focusing obsessively on the water; the camera is focused entirely on him, as people walk past him and talk to him either off frame or in the shot, meanwhile Brody is entirely still focused on the water; Spielberg further sets various scents- the dog playing fetch; and the shrill screams in the water which we think is the shark but is a couple playing...so Spielberg throws us off the idea of an attack especially when a young boy enters the water on a raft, its basically a rule that young people don't get murdered in Hollywood movies right? No character is safe in this movie, which makes it all the more scary. Suddenly Spielberg puts us right on the scent as the dog owner can't find his dog suddenly...could it be? then the camera does does the under water cam and suddenly we realise its the shark- as it attacks the boy on the raft. What is genius is the camera pans at speed to Brody's sensitised reaction of panic, as the whole beach is in chaos. That was just one scene of many on how Spielberg sets a scene as well as any director alive. As mentioned earlier the characterisation in this movie is wonderful, whether it be the main guys or the co-actors every body has their own distinct personality which makes this movie special. Even in little moments of humour, or fear we get distinctly involved in the characters and the impact this shark has on the peoples lives. After we see the effects the Shark is having on the community 3 men the dangerously un-hinged fisherman Quint (Shaw), Dr.Hooper the rich Shark expert (Dreyfuss-probably his greatest role) and the main character, everyman chief of police Brody terrifically played by Scheider. They set off on a tiny boat on to the open seas to face this Shark once and for all...this is where the adventure element comes in and where the film truly becomes elite. The actors clearly work off each other in the intimate scenes, especially in the dinner scene where they compare injuries and Quint does the amazing story of the USS Indianapolis. Key to his characterisation. Also The music when the boat chases the shark with the barrels on him, is filled with exciting swash buckling adventure, as i said before this film has everything. Suspense, adventure,humour in the flaws of the characters- everything. Its as close to a perfectly put together movie you will likely see. The ending is rousing and exciting as Bordy conquers his fear of the water and faces down the on coming shark, as his boat is barely above water, he's alone with one bullet left to hit the tank he stuffed int he sharks mouth...."Smile you son of a B...." BOOM!!! This movie is the granddaddy of all suspense movies, and we can see Spielberg at his finest and craftyness creating suspense out of nowhere. You know when you've finished Jaws- you have witnessed as close to a perfect film as humanly possible, an absolute joy and terrifying to watch even 32 years later.</fullReview>

Those are the six reasons why I think this is Spielberg's best film. when I was younger My parents thought RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was the best. well they are so totally wrong! Besides they should like this movie and LAST CRUISADE more. But any way that does not mean that I hate his other films.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure I've seen this from start to finish since I'd really learned about film-making. In all honesty, I used to watch Jaws 1 through Revenge regularly on TV in my childhood (I remember staying up really late for USA Network marathons and being scared out of my wits ? thank God for commercials!), and I wouldn't have been able to tell you that the original Jaws was the definitive, and only worthy Jaws movie at the time. Seriously, Jaws 3D was just as thrilling (and I didn't even know it was supposed to be in 3D!), and I vividly recall, having seen the first three of them several times, how excited I was when Jaws: The Revenge first appeared on TV (I was probably around 10). I wonder if I would have been happier had I remained just as ignorant. Hmm? Anyhow, I'm not, and, damn it, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg's Jaws is one of the single most amazing feats of film-making ever. It's just astounding how ingrained some of these images are in my head. And just how chilling the film remains after 30+ years. There is one moment that I wish I had forgotten, just so that I could experience it again for the first time: when Roy Scheider is shoveling chum into the water, facing the camera, and the shark jumps out of the water to catch some. This is the first time in the film that the monster appears without his trademark John Williams score (arguably the most well known score in the history of movies), and it's just a jump-out-of-your-skin moment. But, of course, I was expecting it to come, so I didn't exactly jump out of my skin. However, one moment I did forget made me do that: when Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, giving the film's best performance) is pulling the shark teeth out of the hull of the boat and that corpse pops out. Cheap scare, definitely, but, man, was I ever wound up just for the fact that he chose to check that boat out in the water! There's a little to complain about, mostly the completely ridiculous behavior of the animal. It begins to act completely unnaturally, seeking revenge, when, no matter how large it may be, any animal's going to flee that kind of onslaught. I doubt a shark is even this smart, but that creature, at best, would assume that the boat itself was the danger, and since the boat is much bigger than it, it would swim the hell away. At least it's not like Jaws: The Revenge, where the shark, the offspring of the original shark from Jaws, swims to (what would be uninhabitable) Caribbean waters to take its revenge on Roy Scheider's son! This was definitely one of the best theatrical experiences I've ever had. A ball and a half!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg's first great success...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it hadn't been for Jaws, Steven Spielberg would probably never have become the success he is today. His direction is truly brilliant - capturing the horror and sudden shock of shark attacks in a way that has not been equalled yet. The special effects are good, even by today's standards - the blood actually looks half convincing even if the mechanical shark itself isn't exactly top-class. Jaws was a simple idea - a shark plaguing a beach and killing the civilians - turned into a great film that inspired several followings (this isn't exactly a cult film) and several less-than-brilliant sequels. Steven Spielberg owes all the success he has today to Jaws - 30 years on, people are still loving it like it's still the 70s. And it is actually quite harrowing in parts - lots of fake blood and screaming. Jaws' death at the end is massive - an image that will stick in your mind long after the screen in front of you goes blank. And that is Steven Spielberg's greatest talent - creating monumental images in film. From the menacing start to the action-packed end, this is, in every sense, a classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I think Spielberg did a great job of directing this movie especially with the special effects available in the 70's. This was the first movie to reach $100 million dollars and if it came out today it would have made a lot more. Jaws is an excellent movie that includes a wonderful cast of characters. Robert Shaw was awesome portraying the character of Quint. It is also neat to see a young Richard Dreyfuss play the geeky marine biologist. Roy Scheiner was good in both Jaws and Jaws 2. A scary scene for me in this movie is when Quint tells his story of the sailors on the U.S.S. Independence being eaten by sharks. Another scary scene is when Jaws raises the boat up and Quint slides into his mouth. This is a movie that I have seen over twenty times and every time it comes on TV I still watch it. Finally the music used in this movie is still recognized in today's society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jaws' is considered a classic, and not only a classic but an enjoyable classic. It's a wonder it took me this long to get around to seeing it, and I have to say I really found it to be quite great. Even After 30 years, 'Jaws' is still an entertaining, engrossing and even a bit scary motion picture. Sure, it has lost a lot with age, but it still manages to pull it off after all these years. This is one of the brilliant Steven Spielberg's first films and he knocks it out of the park. It's a damn shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this. Roy Scheider is great as town Sheriff, Brody, while Robert Shaw is ultra-creepy as the weird sea captain, John Quintis. A very young Richard Dreyfuss also does a superb job as the marine biologist flown in to this small summer town to help track down the man-eating 300 ton great white. The film features excellent action sequences especially the last 15 minutes of the film which could be considered masterful. The film drags a bit towards the middle, but everything else is very fast-paced. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent a class movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first looked at the cover of this movie i thought yes this is the one me and i was right. Jaws is the number one movie of all time. A police chief a scientist and a grizzled sailor all set out to kill a shark that is terrorising amity island. The shark looks so realistic. You just wont get bored of this movie even watching 20 times or more. If you don't like sharks that much you will definitely love this movie. Roy Scheider plays a brilliant part as Martin Brody and his character actually suits him. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out whether or not they will kill the shark. The front cover makes a terrific job of the viewer interested in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Jaws for the first time, I was so happy. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and this is coming from someone who watches a lot of movies. It is a movie that anyone looking for a thrill should watch. To start, i am a good swimmer who has always feared water a little but has never really had a fear of sharks. After watching this film, the next time I went to the beach wasn't the same. I remember cutting my foot and not wanting to go back into the water because of the blood, I usually will go out pretty far, but this time I stayed in very shallow water. This is what the movie does to you. I can take a person who loves swimming a turn him into someone who fears going out. Anyway I may be exaggerating a bit but it did change things for me on that trip.The movie itself is very well made. There are several jump scenes but they are suspense jump scenes. The characters are all very likable and intelligent and FUNNY. The acting is great! The only thing about this movie that isn't perfect is the facts. Sharks don't attack humans or boats or hunt down people. And then there is the thing with how close the shark comes into shore. Oh well no movie is perfect. SPOILER Okay so the basic plot to the entire movie is,woman gets attacked by shark police chief Brody finds mutilated body and figures out its a shark, shark attacks more people "blah blah blah" fourth of July comes and the mayor won't shut down the beach "blah blah blah" man is killed and Brody's son goes into shock "blah blah blah" Mayor hires trusty sea-man Quint to hunt down shark with Brody and marine biologist Hooper. And so the hunt begins SPOILER ENDMy final words on this movie what you probably want to hear. WATCH IT its a great film. It has some scary scenes and the shark will scare young kids probably and their is language but its fine for anyone 14+. My last words are if you watch this movie and then have any uneasiness when going back into the water Steven Spielberg has done his job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot think of anything I would change about this movie. The acting is first rate. Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider are all exceptional, one of the best matching in any film. The screenplay is well written, following Peter Benchley's book fairly closely, but dropping a needless romantic subplot, instead focusing more on the shark itself. A funny scene with the three men sharing a laugh on the boat one night while comparing scars perfectly segues into Shaw's chilling monologue about the USS Indianapolis, in another of the film's best scenes. The film next shows us the book's climax, about a half an hour before the real ending of the film- it very successfully tricks the audience into thinking the end is near, but then pulls the rug out from under our feet, and adds another act of (exceptional) new material. It leaves the audience members who had read the book prior to seeing the film wondering "That's how they killed the shark in the book, now what? Now what are they going to do to kill it?" The screenplay follows the book's story closely, but adds enough quality material to keep it unpredictable, and keep the audience guessing how it could end. The shark effects are well done, and we don't see the shark very often, leaving our imaginations to run wild with ideas about it. But when we first see the shark full on, as it jumps out of the water as Scheider is throwing chum overboard for it, and his startled, yet deliberately calm reaction is priceless. A good jump scare, as well as being intentionally funny, which is not an easy combination to pull off. One of the best scenes ever filmed. I had the pleasure of watching this in a cinema in 2012, and I, and the rest of the audience, laughed and applauded this scene.A victim's leg slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean always stands out in my mind as well.A thin story, basically an update of a 1950s monster movie, made into a classic film, with more suspense than it has any right to have, this is one of the finest ever made, one which I never grow tired of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" was a revolutionary motion picture for its time. Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise.The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator.Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor.Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination. Another absolutely essential part of the film's allure is the iconic theme music. John Williams' score ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree.Ultimately, the movie brings together fine actors and a compelling script, guided by a master director just beginning to come into his own. The effects may not be absolutely perfect but given all of the difficulties faced, that's no surprise. Minor imperfections aside, "Jaws" is undeniably a top notch thriller that could very well make you afraid to go into the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>every other is a felony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every shark movie after this (except for Deep Blue Sea) is a felony.Wow! Talk about captivating, Spielberg was at the top of his game here with this movie that cost $9 million dollars and made over $470 million dollars. It was also responsible for introducing the idea of summer block buster releases as the movie was shown in over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, but Spielberg focused on the main theme "the shark" removing all the other subplots. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, mostly due to the mechanical shark's malfunctions, it also overran its budget and ran past its schedule, and some of these reasons are why some believe Spielberg opted out of being involved in Jaws 2.The movie plot was thus: During the summer break some teens were having a night party on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island. One of the girls went skinny dipping while her friends continue to party on the beach. While waiting for a boy to come join her she got pulled under by something that leaves only you the view with the idea that death came.When pieces of her body washed ashore, the Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) feared that it was a shark attack and wanted to close the beach for the town's safety, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) disagreed.His point being, the town's people survived mainly on tourist trade and the July 4th holiday was also approaching so he refused to close the beach.He soon changed his mind after a boy and a man also died due to shark attack. He then decided to hire Quint (Robert Shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White.The movie score is something that will stick with you and it resembled that used by classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. To overcome some of the difficulties encountered Spielberg mostly used an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances.Jaws have had three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley.Jaws also won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost it to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (which starred Jack Nicolson).www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce almighty. Give me a mechanical shark over CGI any day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made over the years since Jaws first took the world by storm of the overall naffness of the mechanical shark, a.k.a Bruce. Watching it back in the year 2012, nearly forty years since it's release, it's amazing how good it actually looks. In a world overrun by computer generated jiggery pokery, seeing the raw ambition and physicality of an actual on location effect is an infinitely more rewarding experience than seeing some weightless digital manipulation which is an all too present feature of many modern mainstream blockbusters. Jaws is and always was far more than just a film about a giant shark terrorising a vibrant beach community. Based on Peter Benchley's bestseller, it owes a huge debt to Hitchcock in the way it implies threat and employs clever camera techniques to heighten tension. In collaboration with Benchley, Carl Gottlieb's superb screenplay is fleshed out beautifully with great performances including some wonderfully improvised moments that ground the film and give it surprising humanity. Richard Shaw's 'Quint', the stubborn old sea dog, Richard Dreyfuss' 'Hooper', the nerdy enthusiastic science puppy and Roy Scheider's 'Brody', the slightly neurotic worrier create a hugely likable trio that in the second half of the film come into their own in the hunt for the monster. A Jaws review without mention of John Williams' genius musical score is not a proper review. As with many other celebrated classics, Williams' music is the star of the film. With a few simple notes, Williams created something truly iconic that lives strong today in the vast subconsciousness of the world. I have nothing negative to say about Jaws, it still shocks, it still surprises and it'll forever be a classic piece of cinema from a talented director with the ability to use his influences to create his own brand of magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws (1975) - You're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest thrillers in cinema history, "Jaws" is one of the many masterpieces that made Steven Spielberg become a household name. "Jaws" is adapted from Peter Benchley's suspenseful novel of the same name, and it tells the story of a great white shark searching for innocent prey on Amity Island, and it's up to the Chief of Police, a fisherman, and a oceanographer to help catch and kill the shark. "Jaws" is truly one of the many cinema masterpieces, and it's also one of the most thrilling movies ever to scare the life out of you. Steven Spielberg delivers an astounding job of directing such a suspenseful feature, besides all the trouble, or "living hell", that has been caused on set while filming. The cast is pure genius, and it's filled with such talented actors. The late great Roy Scheider brings a golden performance as Chief of Police Martin Brody, Robert Shaw delivers fine acting as Quint, the shark-killing fisherman, Richard Dreyfuss portrays an incredible performance as Matt Hooper, the oceanographer, and Murray Hamilton does a great job playing the mayor of Amity. Also, John William's fantastic score helped set the suspense, and it helped raise the tension. Bill Butler's astounding cinematography, Robert Mattey's incredible shark effects, Verna Fields' groundbreaking film editing, Ron and Valerie Taylor's astonishing shark footage, and the excellent use of sound helped create the world of "Jaws", and it brings a lot of art and hard work to the picture. "Jaws" is a spectacle of thrill and horror, and it never makes you back into the water. Trust me, I really can't go back in the water anymore. "Jaws", in my review, "an astounding spectacle, Spielberg entertainment at its finest".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Ask For Anything More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How would one even begin to criticize this? It's a brilliantly put together, fast moving and extremely scary movie. It features one of the greatest and most iconic pieces of theme music in movie history, it features tremendous performances from the cast and perhaps the scariest thing about it is that it isn't really a "horror" movie as you would normally define "horror." There's no "monster" in this - just a large great white shark that has developed a real taste for human flesh and takes up residence off an East Coach beach on the fictional community of Amity Island to feed. There's no wasting of time on this. The movie grabs you by the collar in just the first couple of minutes with the truly frightening first attack - made even more frightening by the fact that (although you know what it is) you never see the attacker. A young girl is just grabbed by something and disappears screaming in a pool of blood. It was a brilliant and very effective opening that ensured that the viewer would never lose interest, and indeed the shock of that opening means you don't take your eyes off the screen for even a moment.The first part of the movie deals with the efforts of the local sheriff (Brody, played by Roy Scheider) to convince the town to shut the beach after that first attack. He's convinced (and the local ME confirmed) that it was a shark attack. But the town is about to host thousands of tourists for the July 4 holiday. Under pressure from the mayor and town Council, the ME changes his report to a boating accident, and Brody isn't allowed to shut the beach, because it would cost the town too much money. A marine biologist (Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss) is brought in and confirms that this was a shark attack by a huge shark, but still the town won't listen, and disaster occurs. Finally, the mayor - stunned by the carnage that ensued - agrees to pay Quint, a local fisherman played by Robert Shaw, a bounty of $10000 to hunt and kill the shark, assisted by Brody and Hooper.It's marvellously put together. Maybe the only thing I could have done without were some of the male-bonding scenes between Quint, Brody and Hooper on board the Orca as they sing songs and compare wounds. But that's nowhere near enough to detract from the overall power of the movie, and it's in that scene that Quint shares his story as part of the crew of the USS Indianapolis, an American ship sunk by the Japanese in the closing days of World War II, with many of the crew being taken by sharks while they waited to be rescued. I had never heard that story before, checked it out after watching the movie and discovered it to be very true. The climax of the hunt as the trio is finally able to locate the great white is a tremendous fight. There are really very few moments in this that give you much of an opportunity to catch your breath. It may well be the best movie of its type ever made, and one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shark was a blessing in disguise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can usually expect a lot from Steven Spielberg. Actually, most people do. He's really a great filmmaker. Everything he touches turns to gold. And though some of his most recent works weren't great, we can still look back to the ones that were. So, i'm going to review most of his movies. I'm going to do the best I can. He's done a lot.The first on my list is Jaws, which was probably his first feature. When Jaws came out in 1976, it became the first Summer blockbuster, and it gave people heart attacks. And a lot of morons out there will say that "Its not scary the shark is too fake". Well, they are obviously braindead. It was the 70's. They also don't think its that scary because you don't see the shark that much. But i'll get back to that one.The plot is simple: In the peaceful town of Amity, a shark has attacked. A couple of times. Chief Brody(Roy Schneider) has been trying to save the townspeople, but the moronic mayor has put their lives in jeopardy. So, Brody, Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss), a marine biologist, and Captain Quint(Robert Shaw), a lunatic with experience, to save the townspeople from this killer shark.Your first viewing of Jaws, it will frighten you. After that, not so much. But the fun is still there. It's fun to watch all of the memorable moments, because, well, there are so many of them. My family and I watch Jaws every Summer, and it has never gotten old.The reason why Jaws worked so well was actually a blessing in disguise. While filming, Spielberg claimed that the shark messed up a lot and was an inconvenience, and that is the main reason why you only see it in the last twenty minutes. But to be honest, that was probably a miracle. Jaws wouldn't have been such a great movie if the shark would've worked.The main thrill of Jaws is not being able to see the shark. Not being able to see the shark makes the film more thrilling, making you wonder whats really out there(though its pretty obvious). Spielberg is such a great filmmaker that he thought outside the box, and because of that, Jaws has been claimed as one of the best films of all time, and that it is.A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Violent, nasty, crude. There was nothing in the picture (Jaws) that was personal to me. It was a calculated movie. I made each cut with glee, knowing the effect that it would have on the audience. I don't ever want to be involved in another picture like that." ? Steven SpielbergBeginning with point of view shots of a "killer" stalking a group of naked teens, "Jaws" is part of a group of slasher flicks released in the 1970s and late 60s ("Black Christmas", "Targets", "Blood Feast", "Psycho", "Birds", "Halloween", "Peeping Tom", "Chainsaw Massacrew", copious zombie flicks, "Scream Bloody Murder", "Silent Night, Bloody Night" etc).Like many of these films, "Jaws" is at times a cruel, dehumanising film, focusing entirely on relentless audience manipulation. Take, for example, the difference between Pal's "War of the Worlds" and Spielberg's 2005 remake. The difference between the two films is that Spielberg identifies with the aliens, just as he identifies with the shark which terrorises tourists in "Jaws". Spielberg is the shark/alien/camera trying to scare the wits out of us. Nothing else engages his interests.Many filmmakers operate in an imaginative space somewhere between artist (giving formal expression to his/her ideas and feelings) and entertainer. Spielberg, however, is entertainer incarnate. Yet he is a curiously joyless, sadistic entertainer, always holding in severe check emotions of his own that he doesn't trust. This results in the saccharin and sentimental quality of his films. Films that rely on bogus feelings rather than searching out and expressing genuine emotions.Unsurprisingly, two of Spielberg's great loves are John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock. Spielberg is like a hybrid of the two, the reactionary tendencies of Ford merged with the gleeful sadism of Hitch, with a little Capra hypocritically thrown in as penance. In one scene in "Jaws", music from Ford's "The Quiet Man" is played, whilst elsewhere Spielberg hits us with Hitchcock's "Vertigo Zoom". The film's all-male hunt against an unseen enemy further recalls Ford's "The Lost Patrol", whilst its elaborate last act recalls "Lifeboat". And of course "Jaws" is a virtual remake of "Creature from the black Lagoon", from which it takes its famous "duh duh duh" musical score, as well as numerous scenes, shot for shot. But most of all, "Jaws" beats the path of "The Godfather", a film that pioneered, in Hollywood, the pornographic technique of manipulating the audience into a state of delighted anticipation of each subsequent but oh-so-artful act of violence.Prior to "The Godfather", Hollywood films generated, or at least tried to generate, concern for their vulnerable characters. With "Jaws", though, Spielberg appeals instead to the basest elements in our nature; in his hands, we cannot wait for the shark to claim another victim. Indeed, beginning with "Jaws", Spielberg made cold-hearted audience manipulation, in various guises, his signature track. Since then, the whole way in which popular entertainment operates has coarsened, the social and political consequences of which have been enormous. Of course Spielberg was simply part of an emerging trend. The true model for the cold-blooded cinema that "Jaws" exemplifies can be found in another time and place. The Third Reich created the approach; in its propagandistic works, audiences were encouraged to savour each new incidence of derision and abuse that befell Jewish characters.Thematically "Jaws" is light (the shark's effects on local trade are quickly dismissed in favour of mechanical thrills). Where the film excels, where it breaks away from the 50's monster and 70's slasher genre, is in its masterful final act. Here, the haunted house goes out to sea in search of the slasher, our adventurers picked off "Halloween" style (with the genre's obligatory false-deaths) before a Moby Dick modelled showdown.It is here where the film's characters - police chief Brody, goofy marine biologist Hooper and Quint (Robert Shaw), an Ahab-like fisherman who is obsessed with slaying the beast ? develop. The last of these, Quint, is given a long histrionic speech, written by John Milius, in which he reminisces about a WW2 experience that plunged him into shark-infested waters (the passage links the film to pulpy movies of the 1950s, where atomic energy upsets Nature). Spielberg's inability to keep a reign on his older actors (Shaw was frequently drunk) and the input of Milius' pen (the rest of the film was written by Benchley, Gottlieb and Spielberg) created a mutiny of sorts, the result being the most well-drawn characters in Spielberg's filmography.Ultimately, though, "Jaws" is a middle class, cosy version of "Moby Dick". The monster cathartically dies (Melville's whale survives), Quint is killed, and post-War virtues survive, Brody doggy-paddling back to his wife and family. Like "Deliverance" we are offered versions of threatened manhood, only here, Quint, a self-reliant, working-class, antiquated, thoroughly sexist, ruthless, raunchy and mad figure, is seen to be the anachronism. Quint is too powerful, too independent of traditional social ties, too prone to excess, too much a symbol of bourgeois independence, as dangerous to the social fabric of Amity's comfortable "liberalism" as the shark itself, and so he is cast aside.In Spielbergland, paternal authority must always be restored, but not by Quint. Hopper and Brody on the other hand, are the mirror images of Quint. They are symbols of technology, genteel, inherited wealth, whilst the shark ultimately becomes another Spielbergian guarantor of domesticity. Be it dinosaurs, aliens, terrorists, Nazis, sharks, trucks, Germans, slave-traders or pirates, Spielberg's "monsters" are all symbols of paternal/national duty. Slay the beast for country and family, and all will be well. Family values, patriarchy, a kind of middle-class submissiveness, must always be restored. And this is the offencive thing about all of Spielberg's films: the absolute insistence on taking on the responsibilities of fatherhood, and thus restoration of a 1950s nuclear family, as an unquestionable and totally redemptive gesture. 8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great characterization but predictable story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "Jaws" succeeds at anything, it's in making the viewer really start to question what's in the water with them. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that wouldn't give this movie some thought before ever heading into the ocean again. This story is essentially a man versus nature tale, and serves as a reminder that although we are the most intelligent species on the planet, there are forces of nature bigger than we are."Jaws" succeeds in establishing a dynamic group of characters whose interactions with one another are interesting to watch. The war veteran turned fisherman gets his rocks off by teasing the intellectual scientist, the chief just tries to keep peace to save his community...the dynamics of the relationships were interesting enough. Where I feel "Jaws" fails is in the story department, because although we have some interesting multi-faceted characters, the plot is still that of a B-movie. The story of a shark terrorizing a coastal community could easily have been a Roger Corman production. Spielberg manages to elevate the material to A-level status with his use of great actors and a script that fleshes the characters out more than any B-movie would attempt, and his direction produces some genuine moments of suspense, but it's predictable fare. There are few surprises for the viewer, and anyone that believes the movie will end with the shark still alive hasn't seen enough Hollywood films.I commend Spielberg for making entire generations afraid to go into the water. But nevertheless let's not forget this is a popcorn film, elevated slightly by a good set of characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty well made. The Directing was good, as was the filming for the most part. The score was perfect for the movie. So kudos to Spielberg and John Williams. This is probably John Williams greatest soundtrack, (probably not Spielberg's greatest movie though). Those shots at the very end where The Shark is sinking the ship were especially good. The acting was also good. Richard Dreyfuss especially. It's not a film I would particularly want to watch again though.One viewing is enough to terrify one of the water, which does make Jaws serve its purpose. This might sound a bit nit picky, and I know this movie took place on the beach, though a lot of the scenes were just too bright. There was a glare in most of the beach scenes. The lighting was perfect in the scene they were trying to catch the shark with bait though. But that's not why I gave it a 6. The concept of Jaws has never really interested me; a giant shark that terrorizes swimmers.I found a couple of the scenes in Jaws to be overdone. Now I realize, these scenes were supposed to shock the viewer and add to the horror, though the movie would have been just as scary without them. I am not referring to the scene with the head popping out of the canoe, or whatever, that was well-done. The scenes I am referring to are the opening scenes; the first attack the shark makes, on the one girl swimming alone in the ocean. I thought it was one of the weakest scenes in the movie. It just went on for too long. To me, the scene could of been much better if the girl disappeared under the water, once the shark arrived. Instead we have to view her flailing and screaming for about 20 seconds. The producers did make this scene more frightening by not showing the shark in this particular scene.Another one was the scene towards the end when the shark swam onto the ship and tore that fishermen to shreds. I mean, come on was it really necessary to show the shark biting him that many times?, with streams of blood spewing out of him? I think a little editing would have been very good for Jaws, as it is a PG movie. How it was rated that, is beyond me. PG does suggest "parental guidance", though only moderately. I think the parental guidance that would surround the viewing of Jaws, for children, should be much more than moderate.I also like for a horror movie to hide some of the violence, a lot of times it makes the movie more suspenseful. Jaws actually does do this in some scenes. For example, between all of the attacks, the shark is only shown a few times in the movie. So when the shark actually does appear, its all the more terrifying. These were the only scenes that bothered me though, everything else was well-done. I agree that Movies like this are classics (despite my six)and worth watching during some point of a persons life. Probably after they left all their beach years behind, as I saw this movie months ago, and have not swam in the ocean since. I was already scared enough of the ocean as it was, but Jaws just brought it too a whole new level. (I have to give it some credit for this)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still remember sitting in my grandmothers garage when my cousin showed me the cover of the Book, Jaws. And how the movie version just came out. And to great reviews. I was like, do i want to see something this scary looking? Well we did. And seeing in the theater back than, when there weren't many mega theaters. Just single, huge theaters where u had to wait online for an hour. And get the real movie experience of seeing it in the theater with 500 other people. And boy, was it scary. Still remember a girl a couple rows in front of me chucking her popcorn in the air when that head pops out in that boat scene. Now many years later, i finally caught in on cable (real cable, not those bs channels that have commercials every 5 min. and there stupid pop up add adv.) And it still holds up. Great acting all across the board. The filming is perfect. I even tried to look for flaws in the shark itself, and it looks real to me, with the one exception of the scene where the shark land on the back of the Orca and starts to sink it. But thats a minor gripe. Whenever i'm down the Jersey Shore, I still have this image of Quint singing the Fair Spanish lady song. For a horror movie, There are funny scenes like that also. A true classic from Mr. Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout Spielberg's career he has a seemingly easy time translating novel to film like Schindler's List and Jurassic Park. As a child when I first saw the film, Jaws I was immediately frightened by the unseen terror that pulls the human psychosis to the depths of the ocean, literally. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, an attractive skinny dipper suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time.One of the many joys of this film is the cast. Roy Scheider is perfect as the cop who first realises that chewed torsos washing up on the local beach may be a good reason to keep people out of the water. The film is very reminiscent of Moby Dick with the boat and the Shark/Whale and to conquer this wild beast. The sound was good with many layers adding this effect as if it was in reality and that we were there. The shot with the trombone shot was excellent and is the best I've seen. The dialogue was funny like in many of Spielberg's films. It is also probably the "Quintessential Spielberg Film.". It was so successful that it spawned 3 other sequels the first sequel was good but not as good as Jaws and the other two, well...... The film is highly influential with the storyline, humour, narrative structure and the technical side of things like the camera techniques and the design of the shark. Like the design of Alien in Alien this is tremendously good. I liked the POV shots of the shark. I also liked the sound when the boy was being killed as the camera was bopping up and down in the water which gave it a natural effect. People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think it looks better as today it would definitely be done by CGI and would look fake. This film is one of my favourites, used to like it but now being re-introduced its one of my favourites. I think that the reason why the film is still largely popular is because of its music, visuals, narrative, actors, dialogue and camera techniques. The music is obviously a strong standing point in cinema history for its irregular tone and notes in the piece. The low pitch gives a feeling of calmness but with the motion being quick giving a strange sensation that everything going to be OK but at the same time a certain element of horror. The visuals are great the settings, the way the locations look, making the shots look wonderful. I think that the idea of a shark attacking a small community effected the reason why as no ones ever seen this before, although they must of seen a murderer rampaging a bunch of tarty teenagers in a small community. This influenced a whole bunch of other not so great shark films like the most impressive film since Jaws2 which is Deep Blue Sea with some nods to the sequel to Jaws. The trombone shot is a major technique that has been used since Hitchcock's Vertigo with the sense of unreality or to suggest that a character is going into realisation. The technique is used a lot but never as well done as this, Vertigo and the Goodfellas. The dialogue is very much I feel in the genre of Comedy trying to make the horror disappear quite quickly and to reassure the audience. My favourite line is 'we're gonna need a bigger boat.' That's kind of reassuring the audience well actually isn't seeing that the shark is bigger than we expected. I definitely feel that the opening sequence is a great way to start a film off. The opening sequences have few parallel to today's cinema. Like the shower scene in Psycho they will haunt a whole nation. A lot of scene I liked and is hard to some up another scene. Spielberg builds up tension by slowly revealing the shark to audience with a few glimpses of the shark when it attacks but never actually seeing the shark up close. I think that the less we saw of it the more realistic the shark become and frightened audience with the idea of what you can't see can't hurt you well may be more like what you can't see can hurt you and probably kill you and the strains of John William's unforgettable score which was used as the mechanical shark that was used kept sinking but I feel that this made the film better and made it memorable.This is not your average fish story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the "horror" films that are released in Hollywood today, there really are none that can compare with Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws. Starting out as a pure horror tale about a killer shark terrorizing swimmers on the New England coast, it coasts through until we come face to face with the man-eating machine itself. The cast is terrific with Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss all giving one of the best performances in each of their distinguished careers. The real star, of course, is the shark, and Spielberg does a marvelous job of maintaining the suspense despite not seeing the shark at first. The film does have minor flaws, as it bogs down a little with too much footage of the shark hunt before quickly trying to cover back and make a strong finish, which it does. Nevertheless, this is true horror at its finest. It isn't particularly graphic, but some fantastic direction combined with John William's immortal score makes this one of the best films of the 1970s, of Spielberg's career, and of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To this day one of the scariest movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the harrowing opening scene when the young girl dives in the water and gets tugged under by an unseen monster, we know this is no light and fluffy ride. Stephen Spielberg films his opening nightmare sequence so effectively that you'll be shivering until the final credits. But don't let me get ahead of myself."Jaws" stands as one of the scariest movies ever made, even by today's standards. Okay, maybe it's a little outdated, but it still packs a wholloping bite and it still sends a shiver down my spine. The story, based on the intriguing novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, is simple, following a police chief named Martin Brody as he and the entire community of Amity Island is terrorized by a Great White shark who doesn't seem to want to leave. Spielberg keeps the story at a perfect pace and the plot stays tight and gripping, with some genuinely scary shark attacks and effects that still hold true today. Especially at the exciting climax where Brody, Matt Hooper the marine biologist and shark enthusiast, and a ragged old sailor named Quint go to tackle the beast in the blood soaked waters, Spielberg masterfully combines suspense and action and "Jaws" leaves you shocked and afraid of the ocean long after it's over."Jaws" is a thrilling experience in underwater terror that started the "summer blockbuster" and still remains one of the pinnacles of modern American horror. Fans should look into the new 30th Anniversary DVD which includes two hours worth of interviews with the cast and crew plus footage from the making of the film. "Jaws" still grabs a hold of the viewer today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic man-beast struggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Jaws in 1975 and found it one of the most thrilling movies I'd ever seen. It became one of the most parodied movies of the 1900's because of the use of a huge mechanical shark that was more funny than terrifying. I can honestly say, however, that the movie still is great entertainment. I think it panders to our innate fear of what is unseen and lurks under the surface of the water. In fact, the glimpses of the fin and the outline of the creature under the water were more effective than the closeups of that huge, fake mouth. In the movie, the small resort town in Maine is the victim of the ocean monster which pops up in its major tourist attraction, its ocean playground. Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfus were just starting to make their mark and both excelled in Jaws. Director Stephen Spielberg went on to create many more great productions. Robert Shaw's performance as shark hunter Quint is memorable as the character who has a love-hate relationship with killer sharks. The movie is about a small resort town terrorized by the 25 foot shark at the start of the summer tourist season. The sudden crisis pits police officer Brody, played by Scheider, against the town mayor (played by Murray Hamilton) and the local merchants. The first attack takes place unexpectedly in the dead of night. The police chief is unable to get authorization to shut down the beach and the death toll mounts. The audience is gripped with tension every time the camera zooms in on the swimmers. In his quest to hunt and kill the shark, Scheider is aided by the erratic and foolhardy Quint (Shaw) and Hooper (Dreyfus), a trained shark expert who is often at odds with Quint. The incredible size of the shark stuns both Hooper and Quint but the challenge raises their resolve to fight and the two men become comrades in their fight against the beast. Scheider marshals the talents of Quint and Hooper and draws on his own substantial reserve of courage. What follows is a classic man vs. beast struggle. At one point we get some comic relief on the boat as Quint and Hooper compare battle scars, while drowning their fears in alcohol. Quint also tells a harrowing tale where sailors perish during the war in shark infested waters waiting for help. Note: Robert Shaw, who played the shark hunter, died only three years after the release of this move at age 51. He was a writer and an alumni of the British theatre scene, who also played in movies alongside Sean Connery and Richard Burton. Shaw lived a full life and as well as his career as an actor, he was married three times and had ten children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great watershed moment in the history of film. Jaws is prototypical summer blockbuster. Get out of the water and watch this film! It will take a bite out of you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Peter Benchley's best-selling novel, Director Steven Spielberg's 1975 shark saga set the standard for the New Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening millions of moviegoers out of the water. Jaws was a mega blockbuster at the time, becoming the highest grossing film at that point and changed the way Hollywood release and marketed movie. Both the film and the novel was inspired by the historic event of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. The movie starts out with the infamous scene of a moonlight skinner dipper getting drag under the ocean. In the morning, the town of Amity Island finds out that she was attacked by a shark attack. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) orders Amity's beaches closed, but is overruled by mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton), fearing it would hurt the summer tourism on which the town's economy is heavily dependent on. When the deaths continue to pile up, Brody brings in ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the killer Great White Shark once and for all. Quint is larger than life and even cartoonish because the story needs this character. Quint is the ring leader for the great "Boys" adventure which is the turn this movie takes in the last third act of the movie and the best part. Quint, Brody, and Hooper. They laugh, they argue, they are tested, they bond, and it work. Robert Shaw does a great job in the role, and the whole USS Indianapolis speech was amazing. His overt bravado and Machismo was greatly needed to play counterpoint to Hooper's nebbishes. He is the story's Captain Ahab. It was one of the things they change from the novel. Another is cutting most of Benchley's many subplots, like Hooper having an affair with Brody's wife, which is great in my opinion. In my opinion, Richard Dreyfuss was the weakest of the three main characters. It was so unlike the character from the book. Still, Hooper should had the same ending as the novel. It was disappointing. I do like Roy Scheider as Brody. I love Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line "You're gonna need a bigger boat.". I just wish his fear of the open water was explain. It was generalized and non-specific to fit the expected fears of most of the audience. Brody is the everyman character so he must be most generalized, least brave throughout, least in control throughout. He does not become "heroic" until he is finally all alone and must do whatever he can to kill the beast, which he does the vicarious triumph of the audience through him. The film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. Due to that, Spielberg rarely show the shark, until the third act. The shark instead is shown by camera point of view of the creature looming in the ocean or close shots of its fin. John Williams's orchestral theme, the creepiest since Herrmann's Psycho also plays a part. Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. The music gives it a pulsing heartbeat. It ramps up the tension from point to point and brings the film to higher and higher plateaus. Due to the lack of shark presence, so critics might say, this is the greatest B movie ever. I disagree. It's not a B movie. It's a movie that follows the same structure as B movies. B movies are not necessarily bad. They're cheap and they put the premise before character and plot development. The two things that separate Jaws from B movies are the deep characters and the insane budget. The writers cared so much for who the characters were that it could not be a B movie. I just recently saw the movie again and I am amazed how well it holds up. Spielberg was a master at showing his skill and awareness to story, setting and character. Then the art! There is a shot of Brody looking out the boat window while reflected in the glass is the yellow barrel being dragged out to sea by the monster shark. Brilliant! It is sublime in illustrating the magic and exhilaration of this great "Boys" adventure! The reason why Jaws works as a good horror movie is because who can deny it? Great White Sharks have killed people in the past, and aren't creatures of morality. Great white sharks are apex predators. Their physiology and whole lives even are centered around killing. Nature can be scary and brutal; why not show it as it really is? Great White Sharks, although they are indeed misunderstood creatures who don't outrightly kill people for pleasure or even sport like humans do. They have been known to kill people under the perception that they have mistaken swimmers as wounded prey. Hence their attraction to loud noise and splashing. They are indeed a force of nature, but as humanity has learned time and time again, nature is a dangerous thing, and great white sharks are some of the most deadly the ocean has to offer. Some people got offended because it portray sharks in a bad light and help cause some species of sharks to be nearly extinct due to hunting. New studies have shown that the danger great white sharks pose to humans is greatly exaggerated and I agree, they are dangerous, but it's rare to have shark attacks. What isn't exaggerated is how popular the movie got after the released. Its spawn horrible sequels, and a few Universal Studios rides. In the end, Jaws is a pretty good horror movie. Filled with terror and adventure, Jaws continues to make new generations of fans afraid to go swimming. Let Jaws take a bite out of you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eye For Profit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg didn't get to be so successful by being bad...nobody does. But he did achieve success by deriving all of his imagery from even lesser sources and convincing audiences they were seeing something new. The lower the overhead cost, the greater the net profit, and this is where he first raked it in.There's nothing complex here. He simply uses the eye of "Creature from the Black Lagoon", and gives Amity and its birdbrain inhabitants the mechanics and IQ of so many 50s monster flicks. This is relatively good compared to the rest of his catalog, because the narrative is held together by someone else - here, the writer - who simply usurps the "Moby Dick" story...right down to the "Farewell and adieu..."...Shaw's Quint as Ahab. The absurdity works because of the Williams score which is straight out of the "Psycho" playbook; also the rubber shark ("Bruce") was uncooperative half of the time; it surely saved this by forcing Spielberg to show less of the creature. He had to tighten the tension in other ways. Although this is cheap and simple, that's what makes it ideal for commercial consumption. Just don't call it art - that began and pretty much ended with "Duel".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The terror. The music. The actors. The dialogue. THE SHARK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The terror. The music. The actors. The dialogue.THE SHARK! Those elements sparked a newfound interest in the nature vs. man genre back in 1975 when "Jaws" was first released.It follows the story of a man named Brody (Roy Scheider), the sherriff in a pleasant little town named Amity, which is seated right by the ocean. Nothing ever happens in Amity. It is the same little routine every day for Brody. Wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, wake up, go to work, etc... But all that changes in one moment of disbelief.But after some vicious incidents occur in the water outside his town and home, Brody investigates and finds that the killings were no boating accidents, but shark attacks. After calling in marine biologist Matt Harper (Richard Dreyfuss) and hiring a mysterious man named Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody takes to the seas to hunt for the Great White Shark...and defeat it.Steven Spielberg got his big break directing this film. It brought him to fame and he since went on to create many more popular movies, including "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and such. But it is his direction that makes this film's tension work so well. Granted, the reason the shark was never shown was because the fake shark robots wouldn't work, but even if they had shown the shark in the beginning, Spielberg still does good here.John Williams' score is quite possibly one of the best film scores ever performed, ranking right up there with "Psycho" and Alan Silvestri's "Back to the Future" theme. It is moving, frightening, and all around completely emotional. The thing that is most impressive about the score is that it revolves around a few keys on a piano being hit over and over and over again.Roy Scheider quite possibly gives his best performance ever in this film. He has dropped out of the limelight lately, not being in any films as of recent; but everyone will remember his performance as Brody in this film. Always.Richard Dreyfuss is also at the top of his game here. I think it is interesting to note that like Scheider, Dreyfuss has not been in many films recently. Maybe it's post-"Jaws" effect. I'm not sure. But I know that the only time I've seen a performance as good as his in this film was a little comedy with Bill Murray called "What About Bob," which is an excellent comedy.I read the novel "Jaws" by Peter Benchley, and it is one of the few novels where the movie is better. Benchley lost my interest halfway through the book when he stopped talking about the shark at all. He introduces it in the beginning, and uses it a little at the end, but most of the story is all about character development and has nothing to do whatsoever with a great white.That is what is so nice about the film. It keeps character development going while keeping interest in - and not letting the audience forget about - the shark out in the water.All in all, "Jaws" is one of the best films ever made. It easily combines horror, comedy, thriller, mystery, comedy and drama into one little bundle called a film. It's a masterfully crafted thriller that never stops delivering.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get this movie. A giant shark terrorising a beach on a small Island must be killed in order to continue making money on tourism (well, of course it's NOT only to be killed in order to make money on tourism, it just gave me this impression). This is the story? Or did I miss out on something? I'm sure someone could have come up with a better and more original script.I had to see this movie twice to complete the whole movie since I fell asleep the fist time watching. Almost nothing exiting happens in the 125 minutes that it lasted, no suspense at all. Maybe I have a short attention span, but nothing scared me either to keep me awake or keep me interested. This was probably partially because the shark seemed very fake and unrealistic but the score by Williams really tried to cover up for this, and he almost succeeded. There's not much to say about the acting, Richard Dreyfuss did best but he wasn't mind-blowing, though above average. As of the rest of the actors, they were simply average. Some tell me to give it another chance (just saw it again yesterday), but as I do it only gets worse. Surely not a movie I can recommend to any. Maybe I'm being too hard on the movie but it just doesn't appeal to me.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd love to teach the screenplay of Jaws to a bunch of fresh-faced young'in film students, who may or may not have seen the film before (I got introduced to it at about the right age, 12 or 13, and watched it steadily over the years, including once in a marine biology class in high school - why I don't know, but it was an annual tradition for the teacher, funny especially that the film gets some things wrong biologically speaking but whatever). It's a script that thrives on character development and interaction, and shows that a three-act structure is not really a cut-and-dry thing.Actually what is so lovely about the film is how it's really a two-fer, a kind of prototype of what one might see Tarantino do later on with some of his films - From Dusk till Dawn, Django Unchained - where it's really two movies: first is the quasi-horror-mystery as to what this shark is, which shark ("THIS IS NOT A BOAT ACCIDENT!") and how the politicians - namely the Mayor (who has great hair btw), a spineless weasel who kinda, almost, sorta gets a sympathetic moment in the hospital ("My kids were on that beach too") if it wasn't so pathetic - screw things up. Spielberg, by proxy of a shark machine that didn't work so great, went for what would later become a (over-used?) staple of horror films, especially serial killer flicks, where *we* become the killer in a sense, floating around, looking for victims, and then BAM.The other movie is an adventure movie where the character hinted at in the first half - Surly Mr. Quint (and really, thanks to Robert Shaw, isn't it one of the two or three most 'something' characters in modern cinema? a "Working-Class Hero" with a lot of layers and demons and a lack of AA sponsorship) - takes center stage as our other heroes, Brody and Hooper, are almost at his mercy, and yet help him and collaborate on this hunt.And what makes the film is that both films work unto themselves, and yet are all of a piece. In an odd way even though sharks ARE very important to the story - where else would we get the Indianapolis story without em - they could be hunting anything really. I don't mean to marginalize the location, the Orca boat, the sea-bound sense of what has to be done physically on the ship ("Know how to tie a sheep shank?" "You didn't say how short you wanted it." God this movie is quotable), but if they were out like, I don't know, hunting a mountain lion or a big bear, it would still be the same great characters and the same stakes of life-or-death as well as life-or-death for anyone else.I can't really think of a better man vs nature film, can you? Certainly not any without Murray Hamilton. or John Williams, who made such a score that you could put it on (like other classical Spielberg tracks) a classic-baroque music station on the radio and it'd fit completely in. Matter of fact, it's surprising the shark's theme- 'dun-un (repeat)' doesn't just come out of the shark's mouth!PS: the Shark was named "Bruce" after Spielberg's lawyer. Guess when you need to take a BITE out of a contract, make sure your teeth are shot-glass sized, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has its moments of tension, like when Brody (Roy Scheider) feeds fish into the ocean and, as he is chatting, quite unexpectedly the head of a giant shark pops up out of the water next to him. "You're going to need a bigger boat", Brody then ominously warns Quint (Robert Shaw), skipper of the rickety old fishing boat they're in. This sequence shows up in the second half, where most of the film's tension is. And the cinematography in this second half is quite good.But overall "Jaws" is a silly, made-for-kids adventure that is not remotely plausible. The shark keeps coming back to the crew's boat, as if the shark is out for revenge. Referring to the shark, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the third of three crew members, says: "he's chasing us; I don't believe it." No, I don't believe it either. Natural predators are not capable of revenge.Of course, to advance the plot and keep the audience engaged, the unlikable and stupid three-man crew does all the wrong things. On-board chaos results. But the film's shallow (pardon the pun) premise and plot sells the popcorn, no "deep" themes needed.The story setup is way too long. Lots of talky dialogue, crowds of beached whales (or rather sunbathers), a parade, and a greedy mayor who is more of a villain than the shark render a boring first half. Director Spielberg could have used the shark to chop off most of the script's first half."Jaws" is a big budget Hollywood production with some tension out on the open waters. And it has some good underwater footage. But a too simplistic premise, precious little subtext, vapid setup, and unlikable, overwrought characters sink the film into the dregs, the production appeal veering sharply toward viewers pacified by frothy, Disney-ish cheese.</fullReview>

So the sheriff and a shark expert and a big game fisherman have to kill it. This is a very scary movie. It is very intense. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This a true horror classic. All the Jaws movies are must sees. Roy Scheider was a great actor. This is one great monster movie. Richard Dreyfuss is a great actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable,Thrilling,Suspenseful And Terrifying Classic From Steven Spielberg.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,thrilling and suspenseful classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast and an iconic and terrifying film score and with those elements Jaws is one of my favorite films and is cinema and Steven Spielberg at their best.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley and set on the fictional town of Amity Island,Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody(Roy Schneider),the new Chief of Police in Amity who discovers that there is a great white shark attacking and killing people in the ocean and menacing the community of Amity. Out of options and nowhere to turn,Brody enlists the help of Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss)and shark hunter and sea captain Quint(Robert Shaw)to hunt down the shark and kill it at all costs.What can be said about Jaws that hasn't been said before? It's one of the greatest and most iconic movies of all-time that is apart of Pop Culture,it was not only the first Summer Blockbuster but was the movie that also introduced film audiences to one of the greatest and most iconic Filmmakers of all-time in Steven Spielberg. Scary,frightening and unforgettable Jaws did for swimming in the water and ocean like Alfred Hitchcock's Masterpiece Psycho did for taking showers. Right from it's shocking and terrifying opening Jaws is a truly brilliant and amazing cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and power constantly putting viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time with white hot suspense that is like a tightrope and is an assault on the senses. The suspense and terror is Jaws is powerful and sensational and handled with great timing because the movie not only scares viewers with the idea of going into the water and being eaten by a shark but with fear of the unknown because we never see the giant shark that attacks but only the shark's point of view when it attacks for the first hour and the terror feels real. Spielberg and others have said that the shark didn't work right at first which was a blessing in disguise for the movie because it added to the intensity and dread of the film. The beauty of Jaws and why it's such a great film is the way the story is told and how the film is shown in two parts. The first half-hour is an examination in terror and fright giving viewers the set-up and showing us various characters while the shark terrorizes the beaches and waters putting you on the edge of your seat. The second half of Jaws is a sea Water Action-Adventure with Brody,Hooper and Quint trying to kill the shark while being on a boat in the sea with the same terror and fear of the first half. That's One of the things that I love about Jaws is that with those two different half's of the film the movie crosses into many different genres it's a Suspense-Thriller,a Sea Adventure,an Action movie and a Horror film all in one giving viewers the best of all of those genres with such excitement and great energy that never stops for over two hours. The three main characters in Jaws Brody,Quint and Hooper are some of the best characters in movie history and when you first see them you will love all three of them immediately and I think the main reason all three characters are likable is because they are real characters with humanity and depth and you will see that throughout the film. It's because of Brody,Quint and Hooper's humanity that when they are on the boat trying to kill the shark we are not only rooting for them but afraid for them as well because the three of them are in the ocean in the middle of nowhere trying to catch a shark where anything can happen. Brody,Quint and Hooper are three classic characters you will never forget. The shark in Jaws is one of the greatest villains in movie history not because the shark is an animal but because the shark is a killing machine who will not stop killing and you can't talk to it or ask for remorse because if Jaws sees humans or blood in the water the shark will eat and slaughter it's prey with no remorse or pity because the shark doesn't care one way or another. Jaws is a study of man vs nature and it is told in a classic and powerful way. The ending of Jaws is one of greatest and most intense endings in film history and you as a viewer will be thrilled,scared and happy with the results of what happens at the conclusion. A classic ending.The cast is amazing. Roy Scheider is excellent,memorable and heroic as Marcus Brody,with Scheider bringing depth and intensity to the role. Robert Shaw is brilliant and unforgettable as Quint,a sea captain. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific and humorous as Matt Hooper,the marine biologist. Scheider,Shaw and Dreyfuss are amazing and have great chemistry together. Lorainne Gray is fantastic as Ellen Brody,Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton is wonderful as Vaughn,the mayor of Amity.The direction by Steven Spielberg is brilliant and memorable,with Spielberg constantly moving the camera and bringing a great atmosphere and intensity especially during the scenes involving the shark. Terrific direction,Spielberg.The score and theme by John Williams is outstanding,frightening and iconic and one of the most famous scores in film history,with Williams' score being intense,scary and adventurous. Classic score,Williams.In final word,if you love Steven Spielberg or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Jaws,an excellent,suspenseful and terrifying classic that you can watch again and again and will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" starts a new era of thriller movies and a new trilogy, this movie has to do with a gigantic great white shark which begins to menace a small island city. Then a police chief, a marine scientist and grizzled fisherman starts a fight with this shark to win.I liked this movie because of the plot which for those times were really unique and prototype. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of the actors and especially Roy Scheider's who played as Brody. Another good interpretation made by Richard Dreyfuss who played as Hooper. I believe that Steven Spielberg did a really great job in the direction of this movie and made it a must see movie.Finally I have to tell you that "Jaws" is a really a movie which is the definition of a thriller movie and I think that if you are a fan of thriller movies and not only for them, you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A string of fatal shark attacks have beached on Amity Island's doorstep in the week leading up to the 4th of July weekend, the Island's biggest tourist attraction of the year. Local Deputy of Chief Police, Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider), struggles to get the Mayor to understand that the beaches must be closed to prevent any more deaths. Unfortunately, Mayor Larry Vaughn fears the opposite; closing the beaches will ruin Amity Island's summer tourist season, the town's primary income source for the year.It's not long into the film before we and the terrified people of Amity Island discover that this creature of the sea is not one to be messed with. Unseen for the majority of the film (mainly the first half) Steven Spielberg creates a fear of the unknown. And who doesn't fear the unknown? Clever use of the camera and iconic musical score hints that danger is nearby but for the poor guy on screen, they have no idea what's lurking underneath them. It captures the feeling of helplessness I have every time I swim in the ocean, or even when I was younger just in the local swimming pool. Maybe it was Jaws that made me feel this in the first place!Throughout the film, floating objects are used to portray the sharks sense of direction. One scene in particular shows an old wooden dock being snapped out of place and dragged out to sea by the shark before turning and charging back to a panicking swimmer. By using the wooden dock not only can we see the unknown but also register it's sheer strength. It's a monster.I had to wonder who the 'villain' of this film really is. The man-eating killer shark doing what it can to get by or the 'putting everyone's life in stake for profit' Mayor. One shocking scene halfway through the film shows a crowded beach with nobody in the water. The Mayor walks over to a friend, a father with his family, and forces them to get in. They do so unwillingly, their faces read pure fear but eventually it leads to a sea filled buffet for the shark (I don't refer to the shark as Jaws because that's just the name of the film, not the shark itself). It may be shocking but it was a shockingly great way to make the Mayor even more of a douche.Martin Brody soon teams up with shark enthusiast Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint. There's some tension between them which is escalated with the fact they are alone on a small boat out in the ocean. It creates exciting chemistry when they are risking their lives trying to catch this beast. Despite having more camera time in this part of the movie, the shark looks and moves incredibly well for a film from the 70&#x2032;s. It definitely still holds up today.It's been almost 40 years since it's release and still Jaws remains as one of the best suspense/thriller film ever released. If you haven't seen this film for whatever reason you need to check it out. If you've already seen it before, maybe it's time to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film it had an enormous impact on me and I still think that it is one of the best films ever made. One of the things I like in this film is the use of obviously 'real' townsfolk in many of the scenes: it's hard to imagine Spielberg doing this now. I'm sure even the most minor character in his recent movies are played by actual actors. I think that this is a shame as, rather than reducing the worth of the film, using real people in some of the smaller roles added verisimilitude to the story. The direction, music and acting in JAWS are all very, very top-notch. This well-crafted film is outstanding. Simply outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different skill to the hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a theory of why Jaws is such a frightening film for so many people. It is because we are challenging the shark which maybe the most perfect killing and eating machine in nature in his own habitat. We are land creatures, we cannot breath in water, we can only hold our breath going under for a limited time. Even with scuba apparatus we are no match for the shark in the place where he lives and breathes. So when one of them gets real close to our land habitat and starts killing off swimmers we frighten easily because any one of us could be his victim if we dare venture in the water.It's this terror that Peter Benchley's novel and Steven Spielberg's film exploits to the max. Jaws is almost like two films put together about the same subject. In the first part when the first shark victim shows up, Roy Scheider as constable of the small island town of Amity Island on the New England coast, he wants to close the beach. But the city fathers led by Murray Hamilton say no way. This is the summer tourist season which the town lives and dies by. Of course a couple of good lawsuits would truly cripple the town, but that fact never seems to enter anyone's thinking. Spielberg truly shows the greed of humankind here. Of course when more shark death occur, then the professionals have to take over.Those professionals are Scheider, oceanographer Richard Dreyfuss and fisherman Robert Shaw who has a boat they can use for shark hunting. He's got first hand experience with sharks, he spent some time in the water as a sailor in the Pacific War with sharks picking off his mates one by one. They each bring a different skill to the hunt.These three are not the most compatible shipmates ever brought together for a common purpose. In fact the conflicts between all three leads drive the film in the last half. When the big great white shark comes calling though it's a tough battle to put him down. Jaws won three Oscars in technical categories, music scoring, sound, and film editing in addition to being nominated for Best Picture in 1975. But it's as much the actors as well as the technical virtuosity of Jaws that make it the great film it is.Centuries from now Jaws will be scaring the pants off people because we're still afraid of what lives in the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first shark movie. I think at least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie directed by my favorite director Steven Spielberg is amazingly fun, suspenseful, and scary all in one. I just love it like all other Spielberg films. Well apart from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I think everyone knows the premise. A giant killer shark is terrorizing a town. So a sheriff, a scientist, and a fisherman go out to hunt it down. It starts out with the shark just going around killing people. But once Martin, Matt, and Quint get on the Orca the movie officially begins. It's kind of like a part 1 and part 2 movie. My favorite part is when Matt and Quint are having dinner, and they are drinking to their wounds. Then the mood changes when Quint tells a story when he was on the USS Indianapolis. Then they start singing. And then all of a sudden they're attacked by the shark. Jaws is a real wild ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have watched this film a hundred times and then some. It's my favourite film, ever. I have analysed it a dozen times and there is always something new to find in it. I remember my Grandad reading the book to us years ago and not realising what it all meant. The film, released in 1975 when I was six years old, didn't make an impact on me until my local club, who gave 'big screen' film nights every Tuesday a month, played this film. I was hooked! It's the start of Spielberg's glittering career and tells the tale of a New York cop (Brody) who has become the chief of police on small island hoping for a quiet life with his wife, Ellen and two kids (here's where the book, written by Peter Benchley, and the film differ greatly). A great white shark decides it quite likes the cuisine served up by Amity Island and it becomes Brody's job to stop it. For a cop that hates the water, it's his biggest challenge ever. If you haven't seen this film, please, don't read the book first and the make comparisons... just watch the film. It's addictive, trust me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small sea side town is terrorized by a giant great white shark. A fearful but determined police chief, a grizzled hard edge fisherman, and a enthusiastic marine biologist set out to stop and destroy it.A film that is a classic for many reasons, the film that made Spielberg a household name, and a film to this day that still resonates with popular culture. At one point in every persons life they fear whats in the water around them and this film is that reason. Superb acting and pacing that not only terrifies the audience but slowly builds the tension of this film and delivers at its conclusion. The shark is not show for a large portion of the film and for good reason as it helps to build the pay off when it is finally shown. The soundtrack and Jaws theme is one of the most memorable to ever grace a film, and is composed by the master John Williams. Everything about this film is wonderful and it rightly deserves its place as a classic among cinema. Spawning 3 less then impressive sequels, as the original is based off the bestselling novel by Peter Benchley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary thriller that builds suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original summer blockbuster, "Jaws" is a great example to use to display Steven Spielberg's ("Raiders of the Lost Ark", "E.T") knack for film making and directing. "Jaws" is a one of a kind movie because the formula that it used to make it so scary and suspenseful has been attempted many other times on countless projects and usually failed.After a young girl is killed while swimming, Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) teams up with shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzly fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the killer beast before it can do more damage. All three actors deliver great performances, making their characters very memorable and creating a bond between them and the audience.Underneath the suspense and fear that the shark causes, there is a subtle but good message dealing with ethics. While Sheriff Brody wants to close the beach for fear of the lives of those in the water, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep the beaches open as it is the primary source of money to come into the community. A good thing that comes with this is that it could have easily made Mayor Vaughn out into looking like a horrible, unlikable person, but instead it makes him out to be a leader who made a choice for the greater good of his community that turned out to be the wrong move.The best part about the film that no other film, including the three "Jaws" sequels, could pull off is the suspense. Originally, the shark was going to be seen more, but due to technical difficulties with it, the usage of the shark had to be dialed back. Instead, we just get glimpses of the shark when it attacks. The audience does not get to see the shark until the very end and instead all we have to work with are the brief glimpses we get of the shark and the description of the shark that is given. With that, the film adds another layer to the horror as the audience is building this horrific image in their mind of what the creature looks like. To keep that suspense, we only truly see the full shark within the last five minutes of the movie.With superb movie making and a killer soundtrack by John Williams, "Jaws" is a classic and one of the scariest movies ever made. How can I say it is one of the scariest movies ever made? Try going back into the water after watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvelous Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this movie at least ten times every year, simply because I love it! Before watching this movie, sharks never really scared me. I just regard them as creatures trying to defend themselves, sometimes resulting in unintentional deaths of humans. My summer vacation with my family always took place in July. And where else would it be but at the beach. I can still recall always hearing the theme song from the movie in my mind whenever I felt something brush against my leg. I was terrified of going into the murky waters, afraid that some giant, man-eating shark would come and devour me. However, one never did, otherwise I would not be typing this review! I also believe that this film gave the world a fear of creatures that we should not honestly be afraid of. We just simply do not understand the true nature of the sharks yet. They eat to survive, and attack because they feel threatened. They do not do it for sport, or any other reason. Humans often refer to them as evil things, and creatures that should not be allowed to live. There are a few, however, that understand the shark's nature. They cannot help the way that their brains were wired. We humans call them beasts, but they are just trying to survive.This movie, however, is one of my absolute favorites. It will remain one of my favorites for as long as I live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preparing for a day at the beach? Well don't go in the water. 'Jaws' the ultimate shark film has been the most frightening film since its 1975 release to audiences. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint on the hunt for a killer great white who killed and devoured a young woman and little boy. The film is suspenseful with a spooky score by John Williams to match (if you hear the music get out of the water). Many viewers are so frightened by the film that they develop the misconception that all sharks are killers and will eat them. That is true in only 100 cases where great whites do kill humans (this is actual scientific data), but this is not entirely true. There's no need to fear sharks all the time. Anyway, Steven Spielberg shows off a spectacular film that will make you fearful of going into the water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jaws" was a movie that set standards for current movies and for a film that is more than thirty-five years old, it is still popular today. Based on the motif of a shark that has gotten hungry and now it must find a place to feed. While getting ready to feed is the other thing this film is responsible for, which is the simple yet very well known little two note sound that signifies terror is coming. Set on an island in the north east that depends on the summer season to draw tourists to their beaches. This very way of life is about to be impacted by a very large predator.Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) finds the remains of a victim attacked by this shark and in the interest of public safety is trying to close the beaches until the shark can be taken care of. He is meeting great opposition from the mayor, and the mother who puts up a ransom for the shark also creates great chaos amongst the townspeople. Quint (Robert Shaw) is a shark hunter who comes into town and offers to kill the share, for a price of course. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) was a young scientist who was interested in studying sharks.Quint, Hooper and Brody all take to the sea on-board the motor vessel Orca, owned by Quint. While on-board, the team starts their hunt and fairly quickly are finding themselves face to face with the largest Great White shark any have ever seen. Lighting is very important in this film and is effectively used while on the boat. Night has fallen and the only noises left are the waves slapping against the hull, a dim flickering light casts shadows among the men as they sit telling stories, building the mood and then, the sound. The team tries many ideas in an attempt to capture and kill the shark. Many of these methods prove to be unsuccessful leading them to try another. Finally, Hooper ends up in a cage trying to stick dart into the shark when the cage is attacked and torn apart. Hooper drops out of the cage, and disappeared for awhile. Quint and Brody continue to battle with the shark that is continuing to tear apart the very boat they are on. Camera angles play a very important role in this scene building anticipation and showing the distress on Quint's face as the shark pulls the transom off of the boat.The boat cannot operate normally without the stern so it starts listing to severely which creates a steep slope. Quint starts sliding down this slope until he meets his end, leaving Brody all on his own. Some quick thinking and remembering something Hooper said finally saved Brody's life soon followed by the surfacing of Hooper.</fullReview>

Gary Oldman as 'Brody' Zach Galifianakis as 'Matt Hooper' Robert Duvall as 'Quint' Martin Sheen as 'Mayor Vaughn' Jada Pinkett-Smith as 'Ellen Brody' Colin Hanks as 'Officer Meadows' ...and most of all... Elisha Cuthbert as 'Chick that gets eatin by the shark' (aka Chrissie) And Spielberg would come back to direct. I think that since we are in the age of the reboot and remake era Jaws would be the perfect candidate. Among other things I think this cast would be a great ensemble to the original, yet have something fresh to newcomers. Too, bring back the original shark team. Their work in the first film is undeniably the best outta any shark movie I've seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's monster of the ocean took over the summer of 1975 and has remained a pop culture staple ever since. Half on land, and half at sea, the film is as much from the horror genre as it is adventure. The concept of filming from water level and from the sharks POV, combined with the infamous score and spot on acting, Jaws is sealed if not fully digested into our memory banks. 35 years later the script still holds my attention and the terror returns with almost every shot of the enemy, both "Bruce" and "Quint", sans the obvious mechanics of the shark and drunken machismo of Robert Shaw. The trio is filled out by Roy Shreider Richard Dreyfus and the voices of common sense and oceanic reason and the tension between actors is only overtaken by the drama of the adventure at sea. Should've gotten a bigger boat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hardest decision I have ever made in my life was whether to watch Jaws or Jurassic Park as both were on TV at the same time? One of Spielberg's first movies yet one of his most memorable, Jaws will forever be known as the greatest shark thriller ever made. Let's face it every other shark movie since Jaws has been a dud (with the exception of Jaws 2).Quint as the iconic captain of the ship, Chief Brody as the police chief, and Hooper as the scientist all find themselves fighting for their lives from the shark known to the cast and crew as "Bruce." Jaws basically coined the phrase, "We're going to need a bigger boat?" Spielberg, frustrated by the mechanical shark's ongoing mechanical failures relied on using the camera as the point of view of the shark. This added an element of suspense that was topped by no other movie.Spielberg somehow found a way to make this movie work and created a film that gave all viewers a fascination with sharks. I will always remember watching this movie with my parents on VHS (yeah?VHS!) and having to close my eyes every time I heard "dun dun..dun dun?."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 'Jaws' is a classic. The first person shark cam was a fresh idea that came about purely by accident, and caused a million horrible copycat films with first person monsters. The plot is interesting, and the characters and their presentation are as well, especially Quint with his USS Indianapolis story. The special effects when we finally see the shark... could have been better. The shark actually probably looked better in later movies, but they just weren't any good here. That said, the technology at the time taken into consideration, I guess it's not bad. And i still prefer animatronic over CGI in some Cases. CGI just looks so fake when it's not done well.This movie was so good, that at the time it made people afraid to go in the water. Unfortunately, it also created many negative stereotypes, as generally, sharks rarely attack people.(Revised Form of my Review from RottonTomatoes)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique kind of horror movie, in that the danger it portrays is very real. Unlike most horror films that rely on fantasy creatures, monsters, or otherwise unrealistic events occurring, Jaws brings the horror in the form of a creature that does indeed roam the depths of the oceans - the great white shark. Because sharks actually exist, this movie has a unique kind of scare factor to it, one that lingers long after the movie is over. There are several people I know of who were afraid to swim in the ocean after watching this movie, and I myself have thoughts of sharks lingering in the back of my head anytime I go swimming. The fact that it is in an area so large (the ocean) it can be almost untraceable until it attacks adds even more horror to the film. I love this film, and would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Above all, Jaws is two memories of my childhood: first, it's a shark toy. It was big, very look-like and mean, with white hard teethes on a articulated jaws: the game was to retrieve things inside of its jaws, a sort of Dr. Maboul. Then, I have also a Playmobil yacht and with my star wars figurines, it was hours and hours of play. The second is the Benchley's book that I have found in my father's things. I suppose he had bought it in 1976 at a time when my brother and me couldn't speak yet. We were only jaws then. The only difference with the movie i recall is a crude sex scene between Hooper and Brody's wife. I think my father was a fan because we also went to "Jaws 3D", maybe my first experience of 3D on screen, with the fingers of the body stroking my face. Back to the movie, as a lot Spielberg's, I discovered it on TV and maybe VHS tape so this was my first viewing on screen. Honestly, this time the magic didn't devour me. Sure, it had a great cast, great locations, great score and suspense but in some way, I feel alienated: Maybe it's because i know it by heart, I find it fast, really fast. Then, it was too much a men's hunt. I think that if Spielberg has a weakness, it's that women are often not his focus and Jaws is his best example. In all cases, this movie was the really first to star a killer animal but actually this idea has leave the family and holidays feeling that Spielberg has impulsed to plain gore, blood and blood.Pairing: "Jurassic Park": another kind of jaws and again a book adaptation...NB: With Google help, I have found the shark toy and I was surprised to see it's actually an official product of the movie: it's the Ideal game and it's just the best piece of merchandising ever. Wish I could find it again and have kids to make them a good gift!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ultimate Summer Blockbuster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jaws is an incredible movie. So good in fact, I have always had a fear of the ocean ever since. I will not go snorkeling, surfing, or scuba diving because of it.The casting was superb. The greatest compliment one can pay to an Actor is---that they truly became the character in question. Robert Shaw could not have been better. Roy Sheider and Richard Dryfuss were equally outstanding. They just don't make em' like this anymore. No movie has ever equalled the downright hysteria that this 'Jaws' created back in the Summer of 75'.....If a bigger blockbuster comes along---I hope I'm around to see it. Some movies may have grossed more $ dollars than "Jaws" since its release--but don't forget....it only cost $1 to see it back then ! I give 'JAWS' a 10.And you will never see me in the ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see how gifted Steven Spielberg is simply watch the second film in the "Jaws" franchise, a fairly entertaining movie. I do not know how he maintain such faultless narratives; I have never analysed his film closely, but watching them I have a sense that nothing too much is ever there andnothing too little is left out. In a sense, I do not want to learn too much. I simply enjoy his work.I appreciate that, though his kind of film making might have undermined the making of small films, Mr. Spielberg has always been conscientious about celebrating good movies. The interplay of simply effects (or simply looking effects) such as the classic line, "You're going to need a bigger boat." I am not profoundly impressed with some reviews and analysis of this film, though some ideological criticism amuses me. Again, I avoid too much analysis here. The finale of the movie with two protagonists swimming in from the sea has a lightness of tone and humour that crowns a splendid summer outing. I had not seen the film until now (2012).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see how people can see this film as anything but a cinematic sensation, even by today's standards the use of camera angles to capture the magic moments in this film are unbelievable. Of course the shark is nothing like the special effects you see on avatar but considering the age of this film I would say that the shark is still pretty believable. This film should be seen by anyone before they die, it is not just a story about a man eat shark but symbolises facing fears and human nature. Steven Spielberg strikes again with another break taking movie with moving acting from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I thought this movie was gonna be bad. When I saw a preview of it, I thought it was just one of those low budget movies with a fake looking shark. I was wondering why it was such a classic. Well, I saw it on HBO a few years ago and damn, was I wrong.I watched it when I was probably 13 or 14. I easily scare but this one really got to me. I never thought that a movie about a shark terrorizing people would be so scary. My heart was pounding while watching the movie. Heck, I even had a nightmare the night after watching it. It was so horrible that I woke up with tears in my eyes. That had never happened to me so it was a real shocker. Definitely recommend this movie to all thrill-seekers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than a thrilling blockbuster ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** "It's all psychological. You yell barracuda, everybody says, "Huh? What?" You yell shark, we've got a panic on our hands." These words come from the mouth of Mr. Vaughn, Amityville's irresponsible mayor played by Murray Hamilton. Maybe he's right to a certain extent: "It's all psychological" but the tremendous talent of Steven Spielberg, a precocious 28-year old director, was to translate our primal fears into this terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions.*** "Jaws", #56 in the American Film Institute's (AFI) Top 100 Films ***A position even more impressive when you realize that "Jaws" was doomed from the beginning. The movie had a monster-type villain, not really realistic, a B-movie plot premise, some colorful characters that confine to caricature, all the ingredients to be in the best case, a spectacular but unsubstantial success in the same vein than "Towering Inferno" or "Poseidon Adventure". But "Jaws" hid all these flaws thanks to a very masterful editing and combined the talents of many professionals at the top of their game for an effective result, and I still wonder why Spielberg didn't get an Oscar nomination for this is the true measure of his real talent. Anyways, in 1975, "Jaws" became the most successful film ever, with an indisputable classic feeling, and one film can't reach such an iconic status, only thanks to a successful marketing campaign. If it worked, it's because it succeeded on the basic premises of a horror and thriller film, to scare and to thrill the hell out of you. *** Jaws", #2 in AFI's Top 100 Thrills ***I didn't say "A terrifying experience that challenges all our perceptions" for the sake of it. The film plunges you in the hostile ocean's depths inhabited by a mysterious and threatening presence. Spielberg emphasizes the notion of 'presence' playing with our instinctive paranoia, basically what scares us the most is 'what we don't know but feel', or 'what we know and can't see'. The cinematography depicts the vastness of the ocean in an oddly claustrophobic way, suggesting that what we see is from the bottom, from the shark's perspective. Since our empathy is fixed on the people swimming, there's a disturbing feeling of an approaching danger when the camera slowly zooms on the victim. And when the first contact happens ? well, I wasn't born at that time, I had the luck to hide under a table when I was 10, but I can imagine the effect of these bloody outbursts, high-pitched screams or disturbing gurgles in the movie theaters. I can see people jumping out of their seats, their hearts guided by the film's iconic score.**** "Jaws", #6 in AFI's Top 25 Scores ***Each death is memorable in its own way, and as we get more familiar with the shark, the level of graphicness gets more and more gruesome. The dosage between the 'seen' and 'unseen', is so skillfully handled that the parts without the shark are sometimes more terrifying because we know the surprise is to come. As Spielberg said, half of the film's success is due to John William's score. Basically, they are only two simple notes repeated over and over again, with dramatic variations, adapted to the situation but these notes form a music that efficiently conducts the anguish in our blood till our hearts, like whispering, "he comes ? he comes ? he comes" or "danger ? danger ?danger". Like "Psycho"'s screeching violins, the Oscar winning score conveys the perfect feeling of an approaching, and yes, imminent danger: the shark coming straight, from the bottom, the mouth open-wide to welcome you.**** The Shark, #17 in AFI's Top Villains ***Spielberg broke every rule regarding the deaths. My mention of two disaster films earlier isn't fortuitous since one of the genre's most stupid yet respected codes is to spare the beautiful scared girl, the kid (generally annoying), and the pet animal. Well, in "Jaws", they are the first three victims, like the hell with conventions. The shark in an animal killer, who doesn't select his victims on a demographical basis, and this is the scariest aspect of the film, no one can be spared, the simplicity of the film presents the shark as a villain, while it's just an animal who eats for its survival. But when a shark kills such innocent creatures, how can you perceive it differently? The horrific poster alone embodies this traumatic vision of an animal ferocious and big enough to erase you from the face of the sea in one bite.*** "You're gonna need a bigger boat", #35 in AFI's Top 100 Quotes ***The sentence describes a particularly insurmountable situation or an unbeatable enemy. But is the boat too big or the humans too small? It's the eternal fight between Men and Nature, Nature that affirms its God-like strength and human their right to colonize every space in the world, even the ocean. And the three characters, the first top billed actors embody the three different faces of this eternal fight. The Chief of Police Martin Brody (Roy Sheider) is responsible of the security, Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) is the oceanographer, who respects nature and dedicated his passionated life to sharks and Quint is the colorful and scene-stealing veteran sea captain (Robert Shaw) the man who learned from nature the way the animals should be treated. The protector, the observer, the fighter, each one feels involved with that fight, until they unite their forces for an exhilarating adventure: to kill the shark.*** I mentioned many times "Jaws"'s recognition by the American Film Institute, but what works so well is that the film is extremely well-acted, involves endearing characters, inspiring our sympathy. It's indeed about survival instinct, and a reminder that sometimes courage is about dominating one fear. This is the noblest purpose of horror films, and "Jaws" succeeds more than any other?</fullReview>

It is quite possibly one of the most tense films ever to be made!This films breaks all the horror rules, and it does it brilliantly!We have no masked killer hiding in the woods. In fact Jaws will just come right up to you and chew off your leg. The shark does not target gangs of randy teenagers. She kills anyone who happens to be handy at the time.Three middle aged men are the heroes. No drop dead gorgeous male model types here, these are real men! Apart from Chief Brody who is pretty much afraid of everything.Jaws is just as comfortable attacking you in broad daylight, with the sun shining, as she is sneaking up on you and ramming your boat in the dead of night.This is probably the first horror film I ever saw, and it scared the living daylights out of me (I was probably a bit too young to be watching it!). Anyone who has seen Hooper get the fright of his life whilst examining the abandoned boat will know exactly what I'm talking about!I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't like this film, and I'll bet most people will know at least one quote from it. If you haven't seen it, go and watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again!You're gonna need a bigger boat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were made to watch Jaws in film studies at college... and I sat there bored out of my mind.IT wasn't actually part of the course, our teacher just wanted us to watch it, and I just sat there like ''ok someone's been eaten by a big shark. More people are like 'We have to stop it!' another person gets eaten 'We have to stop it!' then people come along who can stop it...''So they throw a load of chum in the water and suddenly, in a very predictable move, the shark pops up behind them. Then there's the most famous line of the film 'WE're gonna need a bigger boat'. Eventually some very well dragged out I-don't-even-want-to-know-how-long minutes the shark swims around and they watch it as it swims around with a yellow barrel on it. OK I suppose that's one way to track a shark, but they watch it swim for AGES. The only part I liked about it made me laugh:When the shark exploded in a big red mess.Everyone in my class could see how it was good for it's time, but it's 2011 now, films have moved on. People who saw it at the cinema, fair enough. But compared to effects nowadays? It sucks!...Well all that and probably because I hate the whole 'water' or 'sea' or 'pirates' theme.

		<fullReview>Jaws is my favorite movie. Out of all the excellent films I've seen in my life(ex. The Two Towers, Guardians Of The Galaxy), this is the gem of them all. This movie has everything: suspense, drama, comedy, horror... EVERYTHING! The story is simple- man vs. shark. But somehow, Spielberg made a basic plot work entirely! First off, the characters are not only lovable and hilarious, but they give the sense of heart and fear for them. The shark scenes are consistently thrilling and fun to watch, close-up or not. The humor is filled with extremely witty one-liners and a few mature jokes(coming from Quint). The acting is fast- paced from start to finish, one of the biggest reasons why the characters are easy to connect with and like. Overall, Jaws is the greatest movie of all time in my opinion because of its fantastic cast of characters, intense shark sequences, smart humor, and a huge heart in the core of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Chief of Police Brody (Roy Scheider)'s first year on Amity Island. It's the all important summer holiday season and the 50th annual regatta. When a girl gets eaten by a shark, Brody wants to close the beaches. Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) has a different opinion. When a little boy is killed by the shark next, Brody closes down the beaches. There's a private bounty of $3000. Local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to do it for $10k. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute answers Brody's call for help. The bounty brings many yahoos and they catch a tiger shark. Only it's not the right shark according to Hooper. Mayor Vaughn reopens the beaches for the 4th of July despite Hooper and Brody's strenuous objections. When the shark attacks again, mayor Vaughn relents and agrees to hire Quint. Quint isn't impressed with Hooper, but he's forced to take both Hooper and Brody on board.There are so many great things about this movie. It holds up even compared to more modern movies. The trick or the luck of this movie is to not show the shark for much of the movie. It is director Steven Spielberg's first big hit in a long line of big hits from one of the most prolific directors. The movie zips along with ease. It is the quintessential popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impeccably-made summer popcorn thriller where the characters are as important as the creature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a movie monster that is genuinely, viscerally scary is not easy. Making it scary in broad daylight, when artificiality cannot be hidden away in shadow, is even harder. Hardest of all is creating movie characters that archetypal enough to become iconic yet human enough to connect with each other and with the audience on more than a surface level. "Jaws" makes all of these things look ridiculously easy. It's such an engrossing, enjoyable (even when startling) experience that its quality is something you feel on an instinctive, subconscious level rather than something you can think about and convince yourself of. Only during an umpteenth watching might you be able to pry yourself out of the moment long enough to consider why it works so well. I think the crucial ingredient in the alchemy, more than the life-like and glassy-eyed shark robots that famously never worked during shooting, more than the heart-pounding zoom on the beach as Chief Brody realizes that the shark and his child are both in the pond, more than the brilliant and artful editing in the next scene as he runs faster and faster through the crowd of beachgoers while the camera jumps closer and closer to him, and even more than the John Williams score that is surely the most imitated among his oeuvre of unlikely hits... more than these, I think it is the characters and the casting that seal "Jaws"'s place as one of the best movies of all time.Roy Scheider is Chief Brody, a serious cop type with the rather obvious quirk of hating the water, but he plays the role with a method-esque realism that allows us to imagine ourselves in his shoes. Scheider plays Brody on the edge, well shy of neurotic but definitely bottling a lot in, and it doesn't take much to tip him over into anger, fear or, finally, joy. He's up against two much less method-y, much less bottled-up actors and characters: Richard Dreyfuss's nerdy, cocky scientist and Robert Shaw's... well, adjectives fall short of what Shaw creates for Quint, the captain of the Orca. Quint is the broadest, most familiar archetype in the film, a salty sea dog who reckons experience over book-learning, but Shaw fills the character to overflowing with history and personality. His monologue about the real-life 1945 sinking of the USS Indianapolis, filmed in a long unbroken take that feels eerily still and breathless, is the highlight of the movie. Slow, quiet monologues are NEVER the highlights of thrillers, horrors, and summer popcorn fare. But "Jaws" is unique. These three characters bounce off each other and at any moment can and do explode into conflict, but they also have enough depth that each one can lock in with the others in interesting and unexpected ways. Sometimes it's Scheider and Dreyfuss's grounded characters against the unstable Quint. At other times it's the landlubbing Brody who's out of the loop while the two experts trade fish tales. We probably wouldn't want to join them on the boat, but they're always great fun to watch on screen. Spielberg's cameras are arranged so that three men can almost always fit in the same frame at the same time.It's impossible to imagine "Jaws" without its supporting cast, too, especially Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody and Murray Hamilton as Mayor Larry Vaughn, but it's the three principles who are indispensable and irreplaceable. Their absence is a big reason why none of the three Jaws sequels work or really even count. If "Jaws 2" is tolerable, it is only the presence of Scheider that makes it so. On the other hand, even a reunion of all three main characters from the first movie couldn't have saved the stupefyingly stupid script of "Jaws 4: The Revenge" of "This Time It's Personal" infamy. Perhaps it is the highest testament to the quality of "Jaws" that people went to see those later movies, in the ever-vanishing hopes that they would recapture even a glimmer of the glory of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dare I call it Spielberg's greatest film ever? I'm sure I wouldn't be alone in such an assessment. Many say this film, along with George Lucas' Star Wars, was among the movies to really set in motion the summer movie movement. You know, rampant marketing, familiar characters and stories, ridiculously huge box office draws. However, there is one thing that sets this film apart from most contemporary duds: character. The characters here feel so real to one that you feel you know them. Roy Scheider (Brody) is just fantastic, Lorraine Gary is also pretty good and Richard Dreyfuss is pretty awesome. Who can forget Robert Shaw's (as Quint) entrance with the nails on the chalk board? These characters have been so ingrained in our psyche that we often do not even realize when modern films and TV shows pay tribute to them.It's also Spielberg's greatest attempt at horror. Though he's had some relatively close ones like 2005's "War of the Worlds", it still doesn't compare to his work in this one. And duh, John William's score is just BAD-ASS. That theme is probably one of the composer's most iconic themes ever, but there also many quiet moments that create splendid tension. And our friend the Great White, surely one of Hollywood's greatest movie monsters most definitely.An unbeatable classic.</fullReview>

Its not a horror film - its a thriller. Suspense and shocks perfectly paced are what it is about. That and some fantastic performances. Robert Shaw produces the performance of his life. Over the top - perhaps but he pulls it off and it is impossible to take your eyes off him. A previous reviewer expressed disappointment that 'the genius behind Men in Black' produced this poor film. I stopped reading that review right there. JAWS is genius film making. I have watched it many dozens of times now and I can never stop watching until it is finished.

		<shortDescription>There Is Only One Shark Movie: Jaws -- Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Amity, New York, there is a new police chief in town: Chief Brody. And he has one mission: protect the people of Amity. So when a great white shark invades the beaches of his city, he is left with no choice but to take desperate measures: the shark must be captured and destroyed at all costs. Let the adventure begin.What can you say that hasn't already been said about a film that is not only one of the top horror films of all time, but also one of the top films of any genre (even in the top 100)? There really isn't very much, but I just have to sing my praises for this film anyway."Jaws" comes to us from director Steven Spielberg, whom I've had my issues with. I've often found him to be a weak director, not a risk taker and obsessed with little boys. His films can be categorized into two columns: those about aliens, and those about Jews. "E.T.", "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Jurassic Park" are alien movies. So is "Jaws" -- an alien creature invades a peaceful small town. A town where the chief has two young boys (although this is played down).I actually watched "Jaws" for the first time rather late in life, but was already a fan before I ever saw it. I am and have been a huge fan of Kevin Smith since 1995 when I saw "Mallrats" opening day. Smith has used "Jaws" references in almost all his films, putting the injury discussion scene into "Chasing Amy" and naming many of his characters after Jaws characters. "Mallrats" gave us Brody, Bruce, Quint... and later we'd have Hooper. (Bruce is the name of the shark.) And we have a young Richard Dreyfuss. How does that not make a movie by itself? Robert Shaw is great and Roy Scheider was fine, but Dreyfuss really steals the show. And a score from the legendary John Williams? Never a bad idea. Especially now in hindsight, thirty-two years later. Even if you haven't seen "Jaws", you know the theme song.Oh, that Richard Dreyfuss. The scene where he is slamming coffee to compete with Shaw's beer, and crushes the cup... awesome. Best cup/can crushing scene ever, even more so than "Lone Wolf McQuade". And who can deny this film is very quotable ("head, tail, the whole damn thing" and "you're gonna need a bigger boat" come to mind). That makes a film iconic, when quotes from it show up in popular culture.How do you end a review about the greatest shark movie ever? A movie that vastly eclipses "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" and "Hammerhead"? You simply can't do it enough justice. This film is everything a movie should be, and it has a shark. What more do you want?</fullReview>

Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) is dead set against it. Then the attacks continue and Brody, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) go after it.I remember seeing this in a theatre back when I was 13. It was a HUGE hit when it came out. It came out in the summer and the PG rating (with a severe warning saying the shark attacks might be too brutal for younger viewers) had kids pushing to see it. Back then this was pretty gruesome stuff. The attack scenes are bloody and there's a scene where you see a man get eaten...and it's not pretty. Back then this scared me silly. It doesn't scare me that much now but it's still a great thriller.Director Steven Spielberg shot it in beautiful Martha's Vineyard (right here in MA) and perfectly caught the feel of a summer community. Also the film is always moving with overlapping dialogue and the editing zipping the film along (it deserved the editing Oscar it won). Also the acting is great--Scheider is perfectly cast as Brody; Dreyfuss hit it big with his performance here and Shaw is just great in one of his last performances before (sadly) alcoholism killed him. There's also strong support from Lorraine Gary (as Brody's wife) and Hamilton as the mayor. A rare case when a lousy book (by Peter Benchley) became a great movie. And there's John Williams Oscar-winning now-classic score in here.It's incredible how Spielberg got such a great movie--everything went wrong!The weather never agreed with them and they had hellish problems with the mechanical shark (which kept malfunctioning). And Shaw's drinking held up production also.Basically this is a top thriller which still holds up almost 30 years later.A must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. The special effects, acting, and script were all well done. But perhaps the key to any great suspense film is the pacing. And this particular "great" suspense film, was slow to a crawl. It should have picked up, but it didn't. In fact it got SLOWER after they got onto the boat! I was waiting for a lot of action scenes with the shark. Instead I got Robert Shaw musing on his experiences as a hunter. It wasn't a thriller so much as a meditation on the potential danger of a shark, and of trying to catch one. Having started my Spielberg experiences with ET, I was used to a standard for his films that this one didn't meet. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to take a more pre-Star Wars perspective. But I couldn't. Sorry all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best fish movie on the market</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When going to the beach, most people think about strolling on the boardwalk, soaking the sunrays and enjoying the water. What lurks below the water line is probably the least of people's concerns. But after viewing this film, people might not even get close to the shoreline. Sharks have always fascinated and terrified their admirers simultaneously. With their sharp teeth, deep black eyes and insatiable appetite, meeting one in person probably wouldn't be a comfortable experience. Luckily, no regular civilian has this type of job. That is unless, there's no other choice and that's pretty much how this thriller part horror story heads in. When a great white starts making the beachgoers of Amityville its regular meal of the day, it's up to a sole Chief of Police to find a way to get rid of it.The Chief is played by Roy Scheider, who's probably best known for this role even though before this he was in The French Connection (1971). Scheider as the Chief, with a fear of water performs competently. His portrayal as a concerned man about his family and other families' sake feels real and genuine. Unfortunately, swaying people not to swim puts just as much stress on him as just thinking about it. The mayor (Murray Hamilton), wants to keep the beach open. In some respects, the mayor has good reason to (revenue wise) but on an ethical level - yeah he should see a psychiatrist. The good thing about the mayor is that it gives Scheider's character the ability to develop as the main lead, which is great writing.Helping the Chief have a better understanding with what he's up against is Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a marine specialist who's main focus is on sharks. What's funny is that although Dreyfuss demonstrates that his character can become extremely frustrated and nervous with little issue, his actions may come off more comical than serious. That's not to say they don't entertain nonetheless, Dreyfuss is good here. Then there's Quint played by veteran actor Robert Shaw. Quint is an old sea dog who has a narcissistic attitude and enjoys the thrill of the hunt. His scenes are perhaps the most interesting because of either how commanding or mystifying his dialog can be. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb who constructed the screenplay did a fine job at defining each character differently and equally giving them proper development.The only thing that is illogical about the story is the way the shark is portrayed. Sharks do attack swimmers from time to time, but none have the brain of this particular shark. Gottlieb and Benchley try extremely hard to characterize this shark like most others by having it perform actions close to what has been researched and is known; such as following blood trails from chum. But there are times where they slip; some in logic, while others in factual information. A logical error is the shark having what seems to be a strong memory bank. I'm not sure if they remember that much. Another example is that sharks do not attack humans intentionally at sea level or just for the sake of. We are not their diet. Also if a shark is stuck with a barb, how do they suddenly get it off themselves? Of course, when watching this, most viewers will be far more interested in the outcome, then these minor errors.The editing is tightly woven by Verna Fields so not to reveal the shark too much until the end and it's crafted effectively. Fields also edited for George Lucas' American Graffiti (1973). Bill Butler's cinematography looks amazing. The beach and out at sea shots help show how easily accessible the ocean is and how close the shark is as well. And of course, last but not least, who could forget one of John Williams' most popular scores. With a simple yet effective two-note theme, the tune that is parallel to what the shark sees when it lurks is extremely creepy. However, this isn't all, Williams also has tracks that are much softer in tone. These particular scenes involve either family related or adventurous-like moments that would seem exciting if one were in the picture. The funny thing is, the score still works if you want it to be a horror score. Overall with its small factual errors, it's still a great movie.The story is misleading about the actual behavior of sharks, but audiences will be too invested in the story to even notice. Its characters, music and suspense work extremely well for its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaws was boring, but was a good film, especially when the Great White started coming up to the beach and eating people for lunch and other places! But the film had stupid dialog like after Brody says 'the kids must be in the yard.' Ellen says 'when you're in Amity you say they're in the yahd!' how stupid! Plot: Chrissie Watkins and boyfriend Tom Cassidy go swimming at three in the morning, Tom passes out and Chrissie goes in the water by herself, she is attacked by a great white shark, and more and more people are eaten by the shark at the beach, and many close calls. Brody must go hunt the shark down with a scientist who studies sharks, and a man who like to hang shark jaws on his boat to presumably scare sharks away. And it's with the three to convince the mayor to let them go hunt down the 25 murderous, man-eating, shark and save the town of Amity! the shark is pretty convincing, the death scenes are basically things that could happen, and with a bucket of blood this film is a film to buy of the internet or rent it from a video store.I'm glad i got the thirty anniversary edition packed with extra-extra features! 7/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me - The only times that the movie "Jaws" ever came to life and became somewhat worthwhile to watch were only during the scenes that showcased the shark's attacks.And since these attacks happened so few and far between, that about rendered the remainder of this ultra-silly monster movie as being nothing more than one big, long yawn, for the most part.And another thing - Yes. Of course, I do fully realize that "Jaws" was "just-a-movie" - But, all the same, I'm hardly convinced that a shark (especially one of this predator's apparent cunning) would ever behave as this one inevitably did in its hot pursuit of Quint and his 2-man crew on-board the Orca.If you ask me - This great white rogue of the ocean was just too obviously dumb for words. Believe me, this blood-thirsty beast was just asking to be killed. (And, yep, in the end, its wish came true) In conclusion - From where I was sitting - 1975's "Jaws" was yet another one of those ridiculous, big-budget movies that (now 40 years old) still manages to be grossly over-rated for reasons that I'd say are, for the most part, quite unfounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out Of The Water!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most iconic horror/ adventure films began life as a book written by shark expert Peter Benchley. Based loosely off a real-life incident that happened in New Jersey, it scared readers out of the water. While some of the book's content left much to be desired, along came Universal Studios. And a young director by the name of Steven Spielberg was given the chance to make the book into a summer fright film. The rest is cinematic history. By now, we all know the story, so here's the overview: A monstrously-large great white shark has come into the waters off Amity Island, feasting upon swimmers. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) along with shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and salty fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) are tasked with hunting down and killing the shark. Everything about this movie works wonderfully from the beautiful cinematography to the fast-paced editing and the legendary Jaws theme. Forgiving some fake-looking shark effects, the film will at turns chill you and thrill you. The finale is particularly nerve-racking. Watch it if you dare, even though it might keep you out of the water for a while!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You haven't truly experienced Jaws until you've seen it in a movie theater. Films like these really aren't made anymore, what with the replacement of actual special affects for CGI. The environment you see a movie in, also, really affects how focused you are into the film. If you watch something on your TV at home in the living room or on your laptop or phone (God forbid), you're opening yourself up to a lot of distractions, which is really kind of a disrespect for films like these.If you see a film (especially a classic blockbuster movie like this (indeed THE classic blockbuster movie)) in a movie theater, however, all your attention is forced unto the giant screen and you really do pay attention to every nuance the director and editors and actors, etc. intend. John Williams' score and Spielberg's direction and especially seeing the GIANT great white on a GIANT screen is absolutely the greatest and most intense viewing of this film you could ever experience. I'm 100% not exaggerating.</fullReview>

I loved that scene. I am glad that they went out onto the boat with Quint, because that made sense for him to have at least a small crew. His character shows a passion for what he does, and that makes us love him even more. I only wish that he could have made it back to land somehow and lived on to fight another day. Quint was an interesting character because of his unique personality, and because of that he was a refreshing character to watch.

The plot of Jaws is universally known, a classic along the lines of Moby Dick. Man is menaced by a monster of the deep. Man takes umbrage and vows to track the leviathan to a watery grave. What some have forgotten in all this splashing-good, red-water fun is the sensual presence of several well- rounded rumps and sleekly contoured thighs frolicking beneath the surface of the shallows. No wonder the big fish couldn't resist taking a bite!Oscars for editing, score and sound; outstanding direction by Spielberg; superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss; and a Peter Benchley story that kept your interest throughout. I was just thrilled to see it again. Skintastic Moment: Skinny dipping at the beginning of the film, we got a nice peek at Susan Backlinie, but the shark got an underwater full frontal view.</fullReview>

Full to the brim with brilliant dialogue, strong performances from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, tension, suspense and Spielberg's excellent direction this really is a must see. Jaws itself is really terrifying, but even more so was the truly haunting score from John Williams. If you think the shower scene motif, played very high on the violins from Psycho is scary, and it is, I am still traumatised from watching that scene, or in the wolf's french horn theme in Prokoviev's Peter and the Wolf, the great white shark theme played by the basses in this film is even scarier, it never fails to give me goosebumps. Technically this film can't be faulted either. Overall, a must see, and is most likely to have you biting your nails. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Jaws bites you in the butt with the jaws of boredom, not the jaws of life. For one thing, it's not scary. It's just really gross, like with all the blood in the water. And that bloody corpse underwater. This film has to much blood to be rated PG today. It would be PG-13 or even R today. Another thing that makes this film crappy is that it is completely unimaginative served with a side of boredom. If you still want a will to stay in the water, avoid at all costs.

		<shortDescription>A landmark film that loses much of its impact in modern times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't tell you why I waited almost 30 years to see "Jaws", but I saw it today, celebrating both my and Spielberg's birthday. I'm just a bit older than he is! "Jaws" is a fine movie, but I can't see why it has received so many votes of '9' and '10'. It is the 4th of July celebration coming up on Amity Island ( fictional beach community was actually Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts) and someone thinks they may have seen a shark. Local businessmen don't want to scare away the vacation crowd and all their money, so attempt to underplay it. But the shark is real, and the threesome of Roy Scheider (Police Chief, Martin Brody), the boat captain, Quint, played by Robert Shaw, and a young Richard Dreyfuss who plays Matt Hooper, a shark expert sent to help out band together to neutralize the beast. The most that this movie can claim, in retrospect, is that it will make you think a couple more times before you go swimming in an ocean. It is the movie that gave Spielberg his jump-start, as well as composer John Williams.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW, you may want to quit reading. The movie starts with an overnight beach party, and two teens head for the water for a swim as the sun is poised for rising. The girl goes in, the boy is too drunk and falls asleep, the next day they find her mangled body washed up. It isn't clear why the hungry shark didn't just eat all of her. In a day or two, when lots of people are swimming, a young boy on a raft gets eaten. The first half of the movie establishes the risk, with the struggle between those who want to shut down the beach and protect the people, and those who don't want to lose business. The second half is the hunt, the three men in the fishing boat, to harpoon and kill a very persistent and strong Great White shark. The old captain gets eaten, but the Scheider and Dreyfuss characters survive. The old shark is finally done in by an air tank in his mouth, and a gun shot breaks off the valve, exploding the shark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A killer shark throws a seaside town in to chaos.In my movie writing I tend to be benign about movie that seek only to entertain the popcorn munchers, because they keep the industry going. However there are good popcorn movies and bad popcorn movies.(Indeed there are popcorn movies that fall in to the middle.)I was in the playground when this movie came out and the school morons thought this was fantastic - "did you see that naked woman being bitten in half - wasn't that great. All that blood in the water - fantastic!" They said, wide-eyed with wonder. (In most movies rated PG women are not bitten in half, so congratulations to Steven S for getting a horror movie stunt shown to kids. And he repeated the trick in Jurassic Park!)I am sorry that special effects were anything other than special in the 1970's. Yes the shark looks as dead as a dodo, but sharks do look a bit like that anyway. I have been to one of the few places where you can view sharks close to in safety and they do look a bit dead-in-the-eye. They like to come very close just to see you!At the risk of starting a "I'm right - you're wrong" debate, let us look at what this is: A cheap thrill ride. Psycho and The Shinning were also cheap thrill rides, so let us not knock it for that, but it is worthless as any kind of document about sharks. A few rouge and hungry sharks kill humans, but they really don't like us much. Of all the food in the sea we are among their least favourite!(Does Steven S ever think how much misinformation he has given the world with this film?)The opening shots are, as our school moron said before, skillful and shocking. John Williams is a genius and produces more fright with a chamber orchestra than Spielberg does with a film camera! A master craftsman at work. Sadly the script is flabby and indeed it is just an exercise in filling time before the next cheap thrill or even cheap thrill that never happens. When this film moves it moves well - but Schneider's paranoia is one note and pointless. We know he is right and the town-folk masses are wrong. A better script would have made him doubt himself.We have read about how difficult life filming "on the boat" was. The steady cam - not available at the time - was designed to overcome these problems. It looks like they quit early, they could (and should) have extended the climax having kept us waiting for it for so long. Films like The Perfect Storm show that you can keep a scene going longer than they realized in the 1970's.What I learned from Jaws is that films can get away with the murder if they open and finish well. What people who own the video or DVD do in the scenes that involve Schneider's troubled domestic life I don't know - probably hit fast forward I guess.Most blockbusters are actually poor movies: Spiderman, Superman and Batman got a lot of hype and word-of-mouth - but future generations will see them as the flimsy flashy trash that they really are. What is the legacy of Jaws - spreading a load of c**p about the nature of sharks and making teenyboppers - who have even seen a real horror movie - scream?Yes - there are plus points. Lots of pros at work both behind and in front of the camera and a great score - but all these people working their hardest cannot disguise that all they are working with a third rate pulp novel from a third rate novelist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shark attacks off an East Coast retreat equal bloody massacres in the water. All the shark killings in the first hour of Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" have the same mentality of the slasher movies that became vogue sometime in the late '70s. But this is what sold tickets--and made Peter Benchley's source novel a huge bestseller--yet the carnage isn't so much scary as it is depressing, and Spielberg displays no remorse for the victims (he's too anxious to show severed limbs). Police chief Roy Scheider, scientist Richard Dreyfuss and bounty hunter Robert Shaw sail out to capture the shark, and the machismo and male-camaraderie turn the film into something headier: a character study with art-film flourishes (and indeed, some of those shots from the fishing vessel are beautifully done). It's a gripping, compelling film without being a lot of fun. Dreyfuss' brainy nerd gets laughs, though his nonchalant sarcasm is overplayed (and his final act re-emergence is a crowd-pleasing though dunderheaded move); Scheider is a terrific Everyman who isn't afraid to sink into the background; and Shaw is dead-on in his bloodthirsty portrayal of a hunter obsessed. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining? Perhaps....Good? NEVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until recently, my feelings about this movie were ambivalent. The first time I watched this movie was when I was still a child by that time I really enjoyed it. Although, I never considered it -not even then- as a horror movie but more as an action, thriller/adventure movie. Lately, I saw Jaws rated as one of the top 10 horror movies. I got confused for I didn't remember it as that good; thus,I decided to rent it to see if I discovered something new. Quite honestly, I ended up disappointed because this time I watched it from a much more mature, less sensationalistic, and more critical perspective.The result? I found it utterly boring! There were very few good moments and the actors' performances were OK, but they were never great. In fact, Jaws was fatalistic, totally unrealistic, and very slow . The first 30 minutes were truly tedious. There was not a story, just a shark moving around, and killing people out of nothing. Oh...! this too! Was the mayor so stupid to believe that hiding the presence of the shark from the press and public would not affect tourism? Honestly? How ridiculously silly is that??? Even the greediest businessman would have actually done the opposite,for ignoring the danger would have meant his ruin and the ruin of the whole town if someone else got killed!!! But of course such idiotic behaviour can be seen only in bad movies, and we should not forget that Jaws was based in that nonsensical plot.Furthermore, the shark wasn't really horrifying or threatening but it looked pretty fake. Don't misunderstand me...that wouldn't matter much to me if the plot was logical and attractive -but it wasn't- or if the characters were interesting and well developed- but that was not the case either. Sadly, I never felt particularly connected to any of those characters...I never cared about their fate, because there was no depth there; they were almost caricatures of real people!.So, yeah, JAWS is a classic, and perhaps for many, it was a great movie. Personally, I believe its popularity is due to the fact that it was the first big 'horror' blockbuster; however, there are lots of thrillers/horror movies even older than this one that show much better plots, characters, photography, and are also much more original and interesting than this film (e.g The Birds). Perhaps many of the reasons why people still find it so 'great' is because of the romanticism associated with the idea of the 'classic movies'. We tend to idealize them. Jaws is indeed a classic; nevertheless, if you think JAWS is the BEST movie ever, then you need to watch more films or pick better ones!..and if you think real sharks behave like the one in JAWS, come to Australia and talk to us, see them yourself and talk to those who know (i.e Marine biologists). Sharks are certainly dangerous, but they are not JAWS! Overall, Jaws, is mere fantasy...and if the movie was meant to be just that, then it wouldn't be as bad, but it was meant to be a thriller (or horror!)and that is precisely why it is so disappointing and so poor! Jaws...an entertaining film? Perhaps... Good? NEVER!...Would I watch it again? No, I will not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't go in the water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw JAWS on the big screen. I was too young to see it when it was originally released in 1975 so I had to wait 2 years before catching it during a second run in a dingy theater. I was 9 years old and it only cost 50 cents to see it! Those were the days. Anyway, I enjoyed JAWS back then for what it was but nothing more. In fact, even at 9, JAWS didn't even terrify me. It's a crowd pleaser for sure but I just don't see the big hoopla this film generated back then and still today.The big problem with JAWS is the "terror" aspect of the story: the killer shark can only kill people if they're in the ocean. So the solution is easy enough: don't go in the water. That's it. No more terror. This obvious fact always seems to go over the head of everyone. It's not like you step out of your house and bam! a shark attacks you out of nowhere. The shark lives in a specific area where no one lives in. People swim in for fun or maybe fish in for work but a body of water like the sea is not terrifying to someone who lives on solid ground (unless they can't swim...arf). I figured this one out when I was 9 years old. In order to generate a story or terror, the characters in the film put themselves deliberately in harm's way. Because of this, it's very difficult for me to empathize with their plight. As opposed to something like HALLOWEEN, THE BIRDS or even in a faraway science-fiction world like ALIEN, were the characters are in constant danger since the killer lurks around every corner of their lives, not just in one specific area that is easy to avoid. I immediately respond to these kind of stories because the threat is more credible to the on-screen characters' lives. Not in JAWS. The threat of a killer shark was an artificial plot-point made only worse by the characters' actions.In other words, I'll always be more scared of a psycho with a chainsaw like in the (original) Texas Chainsaw Massacre than a great white shark in JAWS. Because of this obvious weakness in the film's story-line, and in the light of its ranking among critics and fans alike, JAWS is certainly the most overrated film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly overrated...but definitely a trend-setter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" is a tense, intelligent and compelling adventure that still counts as Steven Spielberg's second best film, after his downright brilliant debut "Duel". Nonetheless, apart from the terrific idea to introduce a "creature of nature" as an invincible nemesis, this movie lacks a few essential aspects to be labeled masterpiece, in my humble opinion. That, of course, doesn't mean that it isn't a must-see film! "Jaws" is an exhilarating movie-experience and also an excellent reminder that Spielberg used to make gripping films for adult audiences, rather than dull and childish epics with an overuse of sentiment. The clever screenplay (mostly written by Peter Benchley) neatly divides this film into two parts. The first part is really splendid, with the quiet island community of Amity slowly growing aware of the fact that they've got a serious water-problem on their hands. The first (and severely mutilated) bodies of shark-attack victims begin to wash ashore but the obnoxious mayor initially refuses to acknowledge the problem out of fear tourists will stay away during the summer-opening weekend. This first half is very suspenseful (the opening on the tunes of John Williams' world-famous score!!), the camera-work is exquisite and there's some nice hillbilly-humor in the script. The second half has three specialists going out to sea in order to hunt down and kill the great white shark. Police chief Brody (Scheider), independent sea-hunter Quint (Shaw) and oceanographer Hooper (Dreyfuss) play cat and mouse on open water with an impressive monster they yet don't properly know the enormous proportions of (hence the classic quote "You're gonna need a bigger boat" when Brody first beholds the shark). Personally, I think this second part is a bit overlong and overall not as involving as the first. However, the character-drawing of our 3 heroes is brilliant and Shaw's "Indianapolis"-monologue is still very chilling (it took three additional scriptwriters to perfection this legendary speech). The film's climax is very bloody and therefore a rewarding ending.I guess the main reason why I love this movie is because of the trend it started. Steven Spielberg and his film single-handedly launched an endless series of ripoffs and outrageous creature-features that nearly turn every animal on this planet into ravenous monsters. I make a hobby out of tracking down the films that were obviously inspired by this milestone. The sea-monster movies remain the coolest, for sure. There are a lot of worthwhile rip-off's to be found; like "Orca ? Killer Whale", "Pirahna" or "Alligator" but even more stinkers like "Tentacles", "Tintorera - Tiger Shark" or "Killer Fish".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jaws" Just Couldn't Keep Its Head Above Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This decidedly heavy-handed, $8 million monster movie (which earned back 25x its production costs within its first year of release) actually had me yawning uncontrollably within its first half-hour.Following the very first shark attack (which was, by far, the best of the lot), Jaws' story steadily lost serious momentum as the dramatic edge of this tale spiralled hopelessly downward at a constant rate.It's really hard for me to believe that Jaws actually thrilled audiences to pieces back in 1975. If you ask me - This Spielberg "Creature Feature" has got to be one of the most over-rated and undeservedly praised horror movies of all time.And what made Jaws even more difficult to enjoy was that the principal characters were all impossible to like. I mean - As an example - Can you imagine a mayor (who was well-aware of the shark attacks) actually pressuring citizens to get back into the water regardless of the great risk that this posed to their very lives? All-in-all - I'd say that Jaws came very close to being a total dud, in my books. And, besides the laughable, old-school shark effects, I thought that Quint's inevitable demise was one of the worst staged moments of ultra-violence that I've seen in a mighty long time.In conclusion - Spielberg, as a director (then &amp; now), is certainly far from being the genius film-maker that so many of his devoted fans make him out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest thriller films ever made based on the best selling novel by Peter Benchley (also assisting screenplay), from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Steven Spielberg. The film starts with a girl swimming in the sea and being dragged under water by an underwater creature. Roy Scheider plays Police Chief Brody who is determined to investigate this incidence and find this creature. A man named Quint (Robert Shaw) is a shark catcher and believes that after a boy is killed in the same way on the beach that there is a shark on the lose, he is determined to catch it. Finally Hooper (BAFTA nominated Richard Dreyfuss) is a shark expert and believes he would be helpful with identifying the type of shark it is. Then, the mayhem begins as they head out to sea and try to capture the shark. Spielberg has done an excellent job of making tense and terrifying moments, seeing the shark and guy with an eye missing are examples. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Track and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Robert Shaw was number 42 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, The Shark was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("You're gonna need a bigger boat."), it was number 6 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 14 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Films.

I was fascinated by sharks - to this day they remain among my favorite animals and remember everything about them, even though I'm as far from biology and zoology as can be! And then I learned that most people's reaction to "Jaws" was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of "Jaws" was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of "Jaws"!To sum it up - I would give the movie 9 stars for its value entertainment and minus 100 stars for what it did to sharks. My final verdict, then? I give it (? :) stars. As for the advice, I would tell you to read a few good books on sharks and watch a few good documentaries before seeing "Jaws", especially if your opinion on sharks is not favorable.</fullReview>

This film might have made a good episode of "Sea Hunt" or "Baywatch", but there wasn't sufficient plot for more than 30 minutes of celluloid. To add insult to injury, Spielberg completely disregarded a potentially great subplot, exposing the political intrigue and greed behind keeping the beaches open.

		<fullReview>I really hated this movie. I'm sorry I know I am definitely in the minority here, but I have to be honest and I really don't see what so many people see in this movie. Maybe it's because I only just saw this now and movies get worse over time? I know my mom and dad liked the movie and actually thought it was scary, but I just thought the whole thing was boring. OK so there's this shark and it's huge and it's terrorizing a beach community in New York. Great, so that should be scary except we never really see the shark (I know people will say that's what is scary is that we don't even see it especially for the first attack and that's supposed to somehow make it more terrifying, but the truth is they just couldn't get the shark to work so they shot around it, and I found it to be about a zero out of ten on the scary scale), and then when we do finally see the shark it's a total joke! It looks so incredibly fake and moves around almost not at all and looks very awkward and unreal. The only part that was cool at all was the captain fighting the shark to the bitter end. Richard Dreyfuss hiding at the bottom of the ocean from the shark was also stupid, just so they could avoid the sadness of seeing him die? Dumb. I read the book and it was great but this movie is just boring. Very predictable ending too with how they took out the shark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jaws" was definitely a huge box-office success when it was first shown and it won three Oscars. Nevertheless, I was not contented with the movie.Firstly, the film was featuring as "Super-Thriller". However, there were only four shark attacks within 120 minutes. The scene that the first victim killed was quite thrilling while the following attacks were minor. In every attack, the movie captured the scene before the attack. There was gush of blood on the water surface and it then abruptly changed to other scene. There was no struggle between the victim and the shark and hence the intensity of excitement was very low. The film used low filming technique because the most exciting scenes not filmed. It also lowered the cost of making the movie.Secondly, the film also featured realistic special effects. I scarcely thought that it was a realistic movie. The terribly made model shark was not vivid. I doubted if the filmmaker had spent much money on special effects. Moreover, the ending of the film was ridiculous and irrational as Hooper could hide safely from the shark after it gnawed the cage.Lastly, the theme song composed by John William was undoubtedly a success, but the music did not match the film. For example, when the shark was attacking the ship, the background music was folk music. This made the atmosphere very strange: neither exciting nor relaxing, was very confusing.To summarize, I thought "Jaws" was not worth three Oscars nor could it enjoy such a high recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this poorly written movie, we are expected to believe that a fish that relies on thousands of pounds of fat would stay in New England and eat a few people. Yet, people seem to believe it. The story line is very poor, and there are several rip-offs of Moby Dick. For example, there is an obsessed fisherman that was once attacked by sharks, and toward end he dies after the shark destroys the boat! The ending is also bad, and it would only be good for an extra action sequence. In fact, there is very little possibility that a man could shoot an air tank that is underwater, in a shark's mouth and fifteen feet away. There are only two good qualities to this entire movie: fairly believable acting and a few quotes, several of them ad-ins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a scary movie, this movie fulfills. It did such a great job that, on many vacations to Mexico and Hawaii, as well as to Australia, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, etc., I didn't go in water past my knees. Ever. And I'm not alone in knowing it traumatized an entire generation of potential swimmers, divers, et al.I thought I'd challenge myself this summer and face the fear head on. I took an open water dive course (where I didn't think of sharks once underwater, knowing that my 'buddy' was more of a danger) -- and then watched 'Sharkwater'.If you're terrified of sharks because of 'Jaws', I implore you to watch 'Sharkwater'. Our Stephen Spielberg did a hell of a job in scaring the crap out of people, and I'll give him that. But the world' s shark population has decreased by an insane amount in the last 10 years because people don't care about these animals -- not pandas, not elephants, not cuddly -- but millions killed for fins, and trust me, peeps, sharks are incredibly important to the planetary ecosystem.'Jaws' did a great job in terrifying people, but it's not real, and it's not the truth.</fullReview>

For one, the shark atacks everyone in sight. Movies such as "SHARK!" before it used this cliche. Second, the mayor is more concerned about dough than people's lives.

		<fullReview>Sure Jaws started a massive monster movie craze which has lasted all the way up to the present day, an was undisputedly a huge box office success worldwide, but that isn't saying it's necessarily a great or necessarily good movie. I always found this film good in places but overall the viewing experience is an overlong and generally unpleasant one.This film has all the essentials of a good shark movie, the 3 R's... yeah Roy, Richard, and Robert. Yes, the acting in this film is surprisingly top-notch for the genre, even Shaw who almost overdoes his thick seaman drawl to the point where it often becomes hard to understand. There's also a classic musical score by John Williams, who with the Star Wars and Indiana Jones tracks has become one of the most successful composers in history, film or otherwise. Probably the best aspect though is the photography which looks even more mystifying at night-time with an almost silvery-great look to the water than it does during the day.There, so it's a good movie but the hype surrounding it is totally overblown. First of all, there's not really much in the way of action in this film. There only are 4 actual shark attacks over the course of the film's 120+ minute running time. The film slows down terribly near the end with the three men endlessly bantering amongst themselves ending with several repetitive scenes of them shooting harpoon after harpoon into the shark. Maybe it's just the overfamiliarity of the subject matter that has come over the years, but the scene has very little in the way of tension. The mechanical sharks look awfully cheesy during some of the close-up shots revealing some wrinkles in the rubber nose. On top of that, the ending was completely ridiculous, in that there was no way the guy could have gotten out of the cage and hid from the shark for several minutes.So to conclude, this film is a good movie, but it never was really worthy of the classic status its overblown hype has brought it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one has the distinction of being the first film to reach (and surpass) the $100 million mark during its initial theater run. If you haven't seen it, then you've probably heard something about it. Some of Jaws' best scenes of fright / suspense (1 voting point for each scene) occur when we merely imagine the great white shark (25 feet long!) may soon surface and bare several rows of jagged, triangular teeth. When we finally get a look at the man-eating fish, it turns out to be a machine with unconvincing--and unnatural--dewlaps that form around the corners of its mouth during rare moments when the shark is not shown chomping into tourists. I saw this one at a tender age. I was glued to my seat when, in the film, a beach full of terrified swimmers race over each other after somebody spots the all to familiar dorsal fin poking out of the water. During production, the machine-shark was dubbed "Bruce," after Spielberg's lawyer. All in all, this suspenser is worth a viewing... too bad computers in 1975 weren't sophisticated enough to erase those goofy, over-lapping hinges on 'Bruce's' mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It constantly astounds me that this film is held in such high regard by so many people.In fact, I might add, I find it equally astounding that Steven Spielberg has earned such a good reputation for his endless series of childish and idiotic films. Anyway, I digress. Firstly, let's get the special effects off the table: I don't care that they're terrible. That doesn't influence my opinion of this film because there are plenty of films with poor special effects that I enjoy. A genuinely brilliant film can survive such a flaw.The trouble with this movie is the same kind of issue which plagues 99% of Spielberg's work: It's childish. There's no menace, nothing genuinely scary. (And no, I don't mean it requires gore to be scary. The Omen is a fine example of a fairly gore- free movie which is utterly terrifying.)It's simply boring. The characters are entirely impossible to like or care about. The music - as one might expect from a childish composer like John Williams who is so aptly suited to a childish film maker like Steven Spielberg - is abysmal. It's trite and idiotic and never even approaches anything menacing of fear-inducing. (In fact, here's yet another moment to use The Omen as a contrast: Jerry Goldsmith's score was possibly the most brilliantly terrifying film score ever written.)I've watched this mountain of crap on more than one occasion, trying to find some shred of merit in it, but I can't. There is nothing good to say about it. Ironically enough, I did actually enjoy the book as a bit of quick entertainment. But whatever appeal there was in it, it certainly didn't translate to the screen.The 70s produced some fantastic horror films. But it also produced some complete and utter garbage. Jaws belongs in the latter category. It's one of those intensely overrated bits of bile that is best left forgotten rather than immortalised.As far as Spielberg goes, Duel (1971) is actually far more deserving of praise than Jaws ever will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second time I've watched this i seriously had doubts in Steven Stielbergs skills as a director, but then again it was made in 1975. This music was unbearably boring to sit through. Directors must realise that blood and gore in a film isn't what makes this type of film good. in 1975 m y opinion will have been a lot different, but its 2006 now and it bores me to watch this film. The only part of this film that was at the least mildy frightening was not frightening at all, it gave you a shock. Nothing more. People who love this film have the right to their opinions, but in my opinion this is one of the worst of Spielberg. Go watch War of the worlds or Close Encounter of The Third Kind. These are the true greatest Spielberg films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Do Not Let Your Kids See This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen, no one should see any horror movies ever, ever, ever, because when it comes down to it, they just breed or perpetuate fear inside us all ALL. That being said, if you choose to subject yourself to such destructive media, at least have sense enough to protect the innocent and Do Not Let Any Child Watch Jaws Or Other Horror Films. I speak from experience when I say these words. At the tender age of 10 years old my dear mother allowed my sister and I to eat spaghetti (of all foods) on TV trays as we ignorantly watched Jaws mesmerized by the suspense and gore only to our demise as potential ocean lovers. I am 31 years old now and am still working hard to rid myself of "sharkaphobia" (or whatever the psychological term is). Have some common sense parents!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wake me up when this film gets interesting. All the talk about this film made me watch it for the first time. I only made it half-way before literally falling asleep. Sharks aren't frightening if you have enough sense to stay out of the water, plus the negative stereotypes perpetuated by this film probably killed more sharks than can be imagined. A predator is a predator, nature needs them films probably don't though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>worst story, paper-thin plot, worst effects, worst music. I can't understand why more than 25% of the votes on this movie votes a 10.... few options; they are all liars, or don't know anything about quality-motion-pictures...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Everybody I know likes this movie, and they all say that it is a classic. Please, this movie is so boring. The movie is supposed to be about the shark, right, and we hardly see any of it, and my brother told me that the reason for that is, that it is supposed to add to the suspense. What suspense? Before Alex gets killed, we see a bunch of kids playing with a fake fin, and there is no music. Then we hear John Williams music, and we see some of the actual shark, and then we see the Alex's leg, and you know the shark is going to kill him, so where is the suspense. There is no suspense at all, you know the shark is going in for the kill, so it's just a matter of seeing him die. The movie is very boring, and the 3 main characters give nothing to liven up the very dull, and simple plot for a " classic.'' I know that in movies your suposed to have character devolpment, but in this movie there is too much of it. Instead of showing the shark, they show them dirnking wine, and eating dinner, and there is no point to it. They could be showing something more important to the already THIN plot, but no, instead they show people eating, and drinking.Through out the whole movie Speilberg hides the shark, and in the end, you see it's face. It's more like an unveiling, and of course we a regular shark, nothing to go WOW over, just a regular shark. Come on, people no what sharks look like, so why hid it the whole movie. The last 50 minutes of the film is nothing fancy, it's not even entertaning, it's just a matter of finding the shark, and killing it. Then we find out that they didn't know how big the shark was, and how stupid is that, and they didn't even pick a big enough boat, are they really that stupid. I also did not like the ending, I thought they could have though of something more complicated. Brody throws the air tank at the ahrk, and it happens to land in the perfect place for him to shoot. Well I just plain hated this movie, it far, far, far from a classic and even further from being a godd movie. It's nor scary, or entertaining, and Robert Shaw thinks that he knows everything about sharks, and that's the arrognace that kills him. 0/0, 1/10, thumbs way way way down, well you get the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shark twice as big as a normal shark?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely boring. The shark in the movie is as twice as big as a normal shark and he's so smart. Spielberg is one of the worst directors ever. The shark gets out of traps. To tell you the truth, I haven't seen the whole movie in a long time, but from what I remeber it's boring. Very bad acting. Don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some terrible movies in my time but this one really takes the prize as one of the worst. As for suspense, I'm more scared by Monsters Inc and the shark is so fake and unrealistic its pathetic. At least Deep Blue Sea had sharks that looked real and could actually install some element of fear in the viewer. And the actors looked as embarrassed starring in the film as I was watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shark plays tag-team with three guys before blowing up. Mneh. Doesn't sound too special, does it? It shouldn't, because it's not."Jaws" (1975) is considered by many to be Spielbergs bonafide classic. That's giving Spielberg a bad name. With titles like "Schindler's List," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," and "Saving Private Ryan" under his belt, he's certainly a respectable filmmaker. "Jaws", however, isn't a particularly respectable movie.In fact, it's terrible. NOTHING HAPPENS. Shark attacks. Yeah. Mneh. People panic. Shark attacks again. Whoo hoo. Exhilaratin', really.Come on, people, don't hail this as a bonafide classic. You want a classic? Watch "The Conversation." "The Godfather." "Psycho." "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." "M." "Chinatown." "All the President's Men." "Laura." Even watch a modern classic like "Fargo," "The Usual Suspects," or "The Shawshank Redemption." But please. Stay away from this boring travesty of a movie.I hate to diss popular films. But some flicks are just plain over-rated.JAWS: * (out of Five)</fullReview>
