		<shortDescription>O Lucky Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see this film again has been a monumental thrill. Lindsay Anderson, what an extraordinary director. IF. THIS SPORTING LIFE. BRITANNIA HOSPITAL. THE WHALES OF AUGUST. So very few films, but each one of them, a journey of discovery. Entertaining but angry and provoking. His repertory of actors, from Malcolm McDowell his star and, I imagine, his lover to Arthur Lowe. The Anderson-McDowell collaborations deserve an in depth study. Very rarely a director and actor can bring such glories from each other. De Niro and Scorsese. Von Stemberg and Dietrich. Kazan and Brando and very few others. The joys of Rachel Roberts, Ralph Richardson, Helen Mirren, Mona Washbourne and a cast of a thousand glorious British character actors. The film is so filled with surprises that you don't want ever to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overlooked, strangely upbeat satirical masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remarkable, often overlooked film deserves a higher critical reputation than it has largely received. It represents a blossoming of the themes introduced in "if..." (the previous film in Anderson's trilogy) and a playful, even strangely upbeat reworking of those ideas."if..." was an explosion of the subconscious, repression fermenting into fantasized revolution; in "O Lucky Man!" the repression has matured into deep, abiding social, political, and economic corruption-- but the fantasies have matured as well. Mick Travis's journey through early '70s England features calamity after calamity, atrocity piled onto atrocity, but it feels lighter than air. It rises like a joke-filled balloon. That vantage point gives the viewer the two advantages unavailable to Travis: wisdom and perspective, and the film's humor comes from the distance between us and the characters scurrying below. (But the film is not, I think, cynical; the road to enlightenment may be hard one but the film makes it clear that it's not unreachable.)Surrounding Malcolm McDowell's indefatigable Candide of a hero, the supporting cast flows in and out of their multiple roles like a comic repertory company, in which the same actors show up in scene after scene shuffled into a new assortment of scoundrels, con-artists, victims and sages, climaxing (don't worry, I'm not going to spoil it) in a beautiful, subtle joke which has to be seen to be understood.From the silent-movie pastiches through Price's terrific songs (the music is used admirably) through wild, spontaneous moments of parody, uninhibited symbolic flourishes, and a few small scenes of genuine poignancy, "O Lucky Man!" deserves to be recognized as one of the great films of the 1970s, and perhaps of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favorites. Movies, I think, though bigger than ever, have become smaller and smaller at heart; more films should have the ambitions this film does and deliver on so many of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Test Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It became my favorite film the day I saw it for the first time, 22 years ago! It still is. I saw it again on video a week ago and here it is, traveling through my brain as a familiar song with constant new messages. Malcolm McDowell and Lindsay Anderson had blown us away with "If..." a couple of years before. But if "If..." was the courting, marriage and honeymoon of two great artists, "O Lucky Man" is a confirmation of a great love story. I know there are a few other members of this menage, David Sherwin for instance or the amazing group of superb British character actors from Mona Washbourne to Helen Mirren but the incomparable presence of McDowell inhabiting Anderson's universe makes this "O Lucky Man" one of the happiest movie adventures of my movie going life. As you may have noticed, I haven't told you anything about the film, I just wanted to share my thoughts hoping to wet your appetite. If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A coffee salesman takes a rambling tour of 1970's Britain.There comes a time when you think you know something about movies: What is good, what is bad, how things should go, how things should work, etc., etc. Thank goodness a movie comes along now and again that says "no you don't - you know nothing!" Oh Lucky Man! is like Pulp Fiction and High Hopes - it is a smarter film than you are a film watcher.After a build up like that you might expect for me to say that this is a perfect film or that everything works. But it doesn't. The story rambles and pauses, moves left and right and tries to keep the audience on its toes. The humour is mostly black, but very true to life. People are often selfish and acting for themselves - while Travis (our hero - if we can call him that) is quite kind and thoughtful. Like an Adam that has been put in to the modern world rather than the garden of Eden.I have seen this film twice. Like many films, once when I was too young to understand it. It is quite sexual graphic at times and that stuck in my memory for a long time. In one scene a black man plays out a scene at a sex club - and to this day I am puzzled as to what this represents. That the entirely white audience see the black as an entertainer to laughed at or cheered. That this is his only place?Most anything-goes films are comedies, and while this has plenty of black comedy, I see it as social comment. Life has moved on from the 1970's, people have escaped their own class more, women have more of a role to play, people get away with things less. But no one can say - even viewing today - that it doesn't tell plenty of home truths about the UK.(People that live outside the UK and never visit must be puzzled by what goes on here. I bet you would have to answer hundreds of questions if you watched it beside, say, an American.)Lindsey Anderson sees all authority as being violent, ugly and corrupt. This is the kick in the balls society that existed before CCTV in police stations and human rights acts. Where people were fitted up for crimes that the police knew they couldn't have committed. I never wanted to walk down a time tunnel to 1970's Britain and this film is probably the last tie I have to that ugly and desperate decade.Oh Lucky Man! is one of the best films ever made. It has something that few films ever have - instant cult appeal. You could watch this over and over again and not get bored with it, see something different and learn something new. They should bring it back as a musical or a stage play. While not every scene works and not every tune pleases, it is cinema from another world that we never quite had - but might have had if only the money men of Hollywood hadn't made their ugly mark on the world.If you think film is about anything more than simple entertainment Oh Lucky Man! is a must-see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone is going through changes - No one knows what's going on. -And everybody changes places-But the world still carries on. (Alan Price)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson + Malcolm McDowell + Alan Price = O, Lucky Me!What films do we include in our top lists? The ones that affected us in some very personal way or changed something ? not, maybe our lives but the way we watch movies. "O Lucky Man!" (1973), directed by Lindsay Anderson (with Ralph Richardson, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren) is a constant source of joy when I watch it again and again. Off I go with Mick Travis (McDowell) in his crazy surreal journey up and down, back and forth, "around the world in circles" along with the Alan Price's band that provide the music commentaries in the traditions of a Greek Chorus or Brecht's Theater (whichever you prefer). And in the end we find themselves in?. Well, can't tell you. You have to find out for yourself. I saw it again yesterday, and it still stands as one of my favorite films. This time, though, I noticed that it was much darker than I remember. The good things and the bad things happen to our hero, Mick Travis, and I think that he really changed - he started to think more and smile less. The look on his face in the end of the move after asked to smile was not that charming, winning smile that he had in the beginning. It was pain, confusion, and anger. Wonderful film - I am never tired of it. Even though, I know all the turns on the Mick's way to the top and back, it is still so interesting to watch him. I believe it was best McDowell's performance. I know that his most famous one was in Kubrick's Clockwork Orange but my favorite is the everyman Mick Travis who just wanted to succeed. Young Helen Mirren was lovely as Patricia who traveled in her own crazy circles; the rest of the cast did great job, each of them playing more than one character. Alan Price - I love his songs to the film very much. Possibly the best use of a rock soundtrack in a film. I am a proud CD owner and I listen to it constantly in my car. It is short, unfortunately.(sigh)"O Lucky Man!" is one of the best unfairly forgotten films ever. I remember when I saw it for the first time in the theater, I did not know anything about it ? I just liked the title. The girl who was next in line to the box office said to me, "You will like it ? it is a very cool movie, I saw it already." Where ever she is today ? I want to thank her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and Interesting; Surprisingly Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say the least, this is an odd movie. It has no real "plot" per se or at least not a continuous , cohesive storyline but, in a manner somewhat reminiscent of La Dolce Vita (and I mean pretty loosely), it follows one man as he drifts through various events and people, and how those experiences do or do not affect him. The events are also rather surreal, often very strange, brutal, or sexual, and at times a bit disturbing. The commonalities or unifying elements throughout, aside from the character, are constant social commentary, often rather harsh; the fact that the whole film is a series of apparently random experiences, each by happenstance leading to the next, and an ultimate conclusion; and the fact that in the end the events change the character.I won't say that this is one of my top choices of films to watch on a regular basis, at least not if I just want to relax and have a good time, but it certainly is interesting and strangely compelling. Despite the often tense situations and some humour, etc., I douybt most people would find the film particularly fun or exciting, so one should certainly not expect that. Nevertheless, there is something about the film, perhaps a mixture of the oddness, the apparent randomness of it all, the impacts of the events and people, and McDowell's great portrayal of a seemingly clueless but sympathetic character, that draws the viewer in to care about the events. The result is that the viewer does want to keep watching throughout the roughly 3 hours to see what is going to happen next. There is something gripping about the lack of a particular story line so that the viewer wants to see what seemingly random, unconnected event will follow and whither it will lead. In the end, the viewer does see a progression and how the film ends up with essentially a counterpoint to the beginning.In addition, everyone is enjoyable to watch. This is particularly true of McDowell, of course, since he is usually great and is the one constant person throughout. He wonderfully portrays his character Travis and Travis's transformations.At the same time, the viewer also constantly encounters numerous points, images, events, etc., that work themselves into the viewer and make the viewer think, even if not right away.The film also has a great soundtrack that I think really helps the film. The songs have a way of deeply embedding themselves in the viewer just as McDowell's character and the events themselves do. The lyrics are also quite telling and catchy.This film is certainly not for everyone and I'd say that the average moviegoer would probably not like it or at least be confused or bored. But, for some, at least, this will be an enthralling and gripping film. I also think that any thinking person who takes the time to sit through this film, even one who does not especially enjoy the movie while watching it, will at least appreciate, and be affected by, parts of the film. There is a lot here to ponder, some extremely obvious, some almost unnoticeable. Some of it is in the specific events or characters themselves, some in the apparent randomness of these haphazard events leading into each other and ultimately changing McDowell's character, Travis. This latter element is clearly seen in how he changes from the very beginning to the very end.Ultimately, this is a movie that I doubt anyone can fully appreciate right after viewing it, much less while actually viewing it. I think that full appreciation requires at least some time to digest the film after wards and possibly another viewing later. I won't say one could ever fully understand all of this film, as I don't think anyone can, while there are probably many ways to interpret a lot in this film.I recommend that anyone who likes "different" or thought-provoking films, etc., to try it, be patient, and aftewards just think about it or let it wander around in your mind for a while without actively trying to think about it. I think that the film will work itself into a viewer's mind and stay there, without any effort on such a viewer's part, and that even someone who wasn't sure about the film right after watching it will be affected and appreciate something from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic - often overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something intriguing about this film. It won't suit everybody, but if you are in a reflective mood you'll find yourself drawn into the story and becoming fascinated by it.It is a journey through life and its experiences directed with a deftness and real respect for the material. The points are all made with a lightness which somehow makes them all the more effective. You watch the story unfold and are reminded of your own life's progression.Malcolm McDowell contributed to the script and is just superb in the lead role. He uses exactly the right touch in a perfectly judged performance - it is difficult to imagine anybody else in this part.A classic often overlooked by mainstream film critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some films do not date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen both versions (there was an edited version in the late seventees that did not include the rescue scene) of "O Lucky Man" several times. I first saw it in London in the mid seventees as I was very impressed by Lindsay Andersons earlier "If", not to mention a fine performance by Malcolm McDowell. The surreal quality of of Andersons allegorical perspective of life in England at the time was reflected in one of the films great lines, "Try not to die like a dog?" Having seen the film several times since (and turned some friends onto Lindsey Anderson), I was truly surprised at how this film has, not only, not dated, but actually has more relevance now than it did some 27 years ago. England, was about to undergo radical changes in both government and economy. The naivety of the care free sixties was well behind us. Major strikes were frequent. Punk was about to explode onto an exhausted music scene. And, soon there would be a new regime of economic rationalists running the country. The mood and pace of "O Lucky Man" seemed to reflect a sense of innocence lost. Troubled times ahead. A sense of fear and mistrust of the prosperity that is so often associated with capitalism and free enterprise. There are even blatant stabs at genetic engineering. But most of all the sense that England was no longer in control of it's own destiny. Through out this vision of uncertainty are some of last centuries finest comic performances. Most notably Aurthur Lowes' 'Dr. Munda' was, and still is, brilliant. WARNING!!! Even though this film does not follow the normal codes and conventions of narrative structure, my next comment is about a scene towards the end of the film. So, if you have not seen "O Lucky Man", but would like to, stop reading now. The best line of all that sums up the mood of this film is delivered by Mick Travis during the audition scene. After being slapped in the face by Lindsay Anderson when he was told to 'smile', he looks straight at the camera, sneers, and says, "What's there to smile about?". All these years later, still brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always nice to find a worthy film after being a movie watcher for three decades. I remember when this movie was in the theaters. I was a teenager then and didn't go see it. I decided to watch the video and was immediately drawn into this surreal Bunuelish kind of British made movie. Malcolm McDowell is superb as the forever optimistic young coffee salesman. No matter what happens to him, he keeps his good attitude. Don't miss it! But, don't expect absolute narrative</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O lucky me, that I was able to see this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie, cutting edge yet soft and subtle, with none of the over-the-top excesses of modern-day "American Pie Me Myself and 007 Who Wants to be a Charlie's Angel" Hollywood. I guess that's what I like most about this film, is the awesome power of the movie which you discover is wrapped in nothing more than quiet, unassuming garb. Christ-like in its presentation.Today's movies are all schlock and junk with wretchitudinal amounts of sex and violence and plastic surgery, back-flipped liked a trained aquarium dolphin across a polished screen just to keep you riveted to the screen and perhaps interspersed with the convenient lull to allow you to go buy that ten-dollar tub of popcorn ? which ten dollars could probably feed a family in Kazakhstan (or wherever in the world they're hungry) for at least a day and a half. But I digress. No, wait, I don't, that's just my whole point. The world is still primarily a hellish sh*t of a place and today's movies from Hollow-wood ? great escapist fun though they may be ? nevertheless leave you feeling that they offer no exposure to the real world, no chance to ponder, no effort at questioning the path. What is the path? I don't know, nor will this movie definitively answer that question for you, though it will pose the question, and take you on a sometimes brutal, sometimes hilarious thought-provoking journey in the process. You won't have the same experience watching, say "Gigli", now, will you?Cinematography is remarkably fresh and current looking. I was amazed to see this film was dated thirty years ago, 1973. You won't believe it. Oh, and you do get to see some ample naked breasts here and there, and Malcolm McDowell actually SMILES a few times. And yes, he DOES have eyes like Steve McQueen. "Smile!" "Why? What's there to smile about???" Watch this movie and have a good time, have a good think. And remember, revolution is the opium of the intellectuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bizarre Critique - Of Everything It Seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first hour or so of this movie, everything seems pretty straightforward. Michael (played by Malcolm McDowell) is a young coffee salesman who's just starting to climb the ladder of success. His slow rise is sometimes humorous, and - with its sexual content - was somewhat reminiscent of the later American movie "The Secret Of My Success." At about the hour mark, though, this turns increasingly bizarre, beginning with Michael's arrest at a military installation. At that point his identity as a coffee salesman seems, for some reason, to simply disappear, and for the next two hours (yes, this is slightly over three hours long!) the movie takes on a darkly satirical note, critiquing pretty much everything: capitalism, religion, socialism, intellectuals - "the system" in general. No doubt the critique has some validity. I appreciated its balance in skewering pretty much everything, and truly appreciated that it took on the left as well as the right - so that Marx's famous dictum about religion becomes rephrased as "Revolution is the Opium of the Intellectuals" and Michael ends up being not only rejected but attacked by the homeless he tries to help; I took from all this the suggestion that socialists are often quite disconnected from those they claim to represent. The critique is valid, then, and the movie does make you think. It's also quite rambling at times, though, and often seems to lose its focus - or perhaps its better to say that it never really found its focus. In the end, it leaves little hope for redemption of any kind. If everything is as bad as this movie portrays, then frankly Mrs. Richards was right - and I'll say no more about that; you can watch the movie to find out about Mrs. Richards. In the end, I found this to be a rather dark and even depressing movie. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're seeking something highly original, stylish and TOTALLY unpredictable to sink your teeth into, you will barely find a more ideal movie than this.This is a quasi-sequel to "If..." (1966), which is perhaps even better than OLM. Pretty much the same (or very similar) cast, with Malcolm McDowell playing Mick Travis again. However, there isn't much about Travis's characterization in OLM that reminds of the Travis n "If...". However, apart from the cast, there are other major similarities between the two movies: neither has a major, clear, entirely coherent plot to speak of, but both plod along, hypnotizing the viewer with amazing style and weird characters, dialogue and situations. The photography, the visual quality is phenomenal. The soundtrack is good. OLM has that 70s European feel to it, with the difference that it's a terrific picture, unlike most of the crap that came/comes out of Continental Europe.OLM evokes a gammut of emotions/reactions. It has a fair amount of humour, some well-disguised satire, but also several very dark moments. The most shocking scene is what Travis sees in a hospital room in a place where experiments on human subjects are being carried out. This is one of the most morbid/difficult scenes to watch, matching the most graphic horror films. Like it or not, truly unforgettable stuff.There is a longer, 170-minute version, which includes a 10-minute segment with a housewife that wants to commit suicide. It doesn't make a major difference plot-wise, and this is not one of the movie's highlights. As of this writing, I'm not even sure the DVD has been released yet. That's a shame, of course. You can get junk like "A River Runs Through It" in any store, whereas to find a copy of OLM or "If...", in any format, you probably need to travel to the Moon or sell your soul to Satan...Oh, yeah, and the stunning Helen Mirren is in this one, at the height of her beauty.The third installment in Lyndsey Anderson's trilogy (loosely termed) is "Brittania Hospital" (1980), but although a good movie, it doesn't come anywhere near the quality of the first two...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time, hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am astounded every time I watch O Lucky Man. I cannot believe it is not more well known. This over three hour excursion is full of fantastic subtleties, juxtaposed with endless irony. There are also many instances of absurdity to keep the tone lighthearted, while still a bit heavy. The Yin-Yang of films, it really has everything. It puts life into perspective better than any film I've ever seen. The use of actors in sometimes more than six different roles throughout the movie is almost unheard of. Alan Price's score and periodic appearances are great, as well. Malcom McDowell turns in an Oscar worthy performance, as does just about everybody else. Every time I watch this, I wish it would just keep on going and going, it doesn't drag at any point. You'll notice something new every time, too. This flick is just perfect. I would recommend it endlessly. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not like any other movie really - this is mostly a very good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of O Lucky Man!, a three-hour epic black-comedy on one man's journey through self-discovery in 1970's Britain, is a little odd off the bat. We see some old documentary footage on the making of coffee beans (maybe it's real, maybe not), and it leads up to some coffee farmer in a bad mustache played by Malcolm McDowell getting his hands cut off for thievery. I suppose this is to introduce McDowell's character as a coffee salesman early in the film, but see how it cuts away from this to the rock band led by Alan Price plays, in a studio, the opening title song for the film. This is not just something that will happen once, but as something of a theme, like a rocking Greek chorus (or, perhaps, like Godard's Sympathy for the Devil). But then again, this is the simplest thing about O Lucky Man! This is a complex nut to crack: on the one hand it's whimsical in its telling of Mick Travis (the same, or a variation, of the Mick Travis from If....), who starts off as a coffee salesman, then has a little bit of a road movie for the first half, then tries to become successful with a big-shot London businessman, and then after a stint in jail... becomes an actor, one supposes, much like McDowell in real life (albeit the only similarities one could see is that he sold coffee and became an actor). But on the other hand with the whimsy and dark comedy, sometimes bizarre (the "Pig-Man" at the laboratory Mick walks in on, the breastfeeding bit, the in-jokes on Clockwork Orange), sometimes political (the torture scene with the fascists), it's also an existential drama of sorts.Of sorts I mean that you come to this conclusion when the film ends. As O Lucky Man rolls along and we see a story unfold that could only happen in the conflicted 1970s. Lindsay Anderson, by way of his writer and McDowell too, is presenting us with a clear-eyed double edged sword: how does one have a free will and have fun and games with women and rock n roll and be successful in business at the same time? Mick changes by the time he's released from jail, but in those final scenes he's still unsure where his life will go. Anderson's character can do whatever he wants- float along, get rich, fade away, become a star- and all the matters, perhaps, is that he does it with a smile.McDowell is game from the get-go, and this is perhaps his most charming and (at times) subdued performance. There's little of the menace and devilish-side of his Clockwork Orange, nor that repressed revolutionary in If... Instead here it's a mix of gentlemen and Lady's Man, suave spy and lost soul, and McDowell does any and all the script asks of him with such joy and interest. That's the other curious thing: McDowell makes us really care about this guy Mick Travis, even when he seems to be heading towards real greed "at the top", which makes it easier (or just more fun) to take in awkward and surreal scenes, like when the man jumps from the window and the boss calls for a 15-second moment of silence. As it's a trip through British society as a whole, rich and poor, science and military, music and women, we need someone to bring us along, and McDowell is perfect to do it.O Lucky Man is a long trek though at three hours, which sometimes passes by like nothing at all and only a couple of times drags (the long scene of the slide-show for the African businessmen is one of these), and it is very much of its time and place (one or two of the songs are dated, though on the whole Price's songs are excellent and even moving). What makes it work for any time period or place past 1970's England is the essential conflicts and contradictions this protagonist faces, and the inventiveness of the film-making. Where else will we see facts about the number of people in the world in prison in text-scrawl during a 5-year transition? It's bold and audacious, and just clever enough to keep us grinning along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the surreal journey of Mick Travis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's kind-of-sequel to 'If...' puts everyman Mick Travis, again played brilliantly by Malcolm MacDowell, into a surreal world in which he takes a journey (inspired by Candide) through scenes and situations which have an impact on his life.A large cast support McDowell, many playing multiple roles. Most memorable are Arthur Lowe, Rachel Roberts, Ralph Richardson, Helen Mirren, Alan Price (who also supplies the music), Graham Crowden, Peter Jeffrey, Mona Washbourne, Dandy Nichols, and Michael Medwin. It's all very weird and perhaps half of what's on screen misses the mark. It is more a cycle of images which stay in the mind than a coherent film. An attack on capitalism? Anderson would return to the theme (again with Travis as the central character) in the misfiring 1980s film 'Britannia Hospital'. The best of the trio remains 'If...'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film has only grown better over time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films that came out of the 60's and 70's were full of the vim and vigor of the times and often were full of themselves. Those were heady and frothy politically charged decades and films so often mirrored only those times.Lindsay Anderson was already a well known and respected theater director when he directed Malcolm Mcdowell in "If". This trail blazing and outrageous drama held up the English private school system to an embarrassing scrutiny and the depiction did not look wholesome or attractive. The film made Malcolm an overnight sensation. How fortunate was he to have a life long friend and mentor in Anderson. The film "O Lucky Man" is based on an idea of Malcolm's. The soundtrack was, from what I gathered of Alan Price's comments on the DVD, something that had a life of it's own. If I am not wrong, it might just have been that the music was often written first and the scenes were shot afterward to match the essence of the songs. I will have to look into that....OLM is such a charming and hilarious romp. Anderson's trademark use of actors in multiple roles (that re-appear from the film "if" -giving it yet another tongue in cheek twist) is very funny. The plot is unbelievable but so enticing it doesn't matter. It is much like a play on the screen; we know that it is not how things are in the real world but who cares? The film sometimes takes great liberties with reality and careens into the surreal; a fine example is the trip to the "hospital" were our poor hero discovers some things are horribly wrong with the medical research. I won't spoil it for you. Another example of a fairy tale flourish is the next scene where Malcolm awakes in a church, famished and after having been scolded by a young mother, she offers him her breast to suckle from, telling him that he's just a boy. It is so ridiculous and preposterous, you just have to laugh out loud.Each scene in the movie, divided up as like a play, is worthy of shot by shot examination. What you come away with is the sheer love of life that underscores the "awakening" Zen slap on the face at the very end; the hero awakens to see the truth in all its naked simplicity. That slap leaves the hero with a calm but subtle joy of "realization" on his face. Nirvana and bliss? No. Seeing things clearly for the first time: perhaps. It draws this hero home to celebrate his awakening with a cast party free for all.The music is the best material Alan Price ever did: period. These many years later it is still so foot tapping joyful and colorful....that the soundtrack is worth a purchase on it's own: I own it and listen to it regularly.One odd disappointment with the DVD. There is a special section where Malcolm and Alan reminisce and they don't have much to say. Malcolm clearly expresses his love and admiration for Lindsay but they could have gone into more detail about other film trivia. Other than that, this is a film that has waited way too long to transfer to DVD. Although Anderson did 3 films with Malcolm that are only loosely related by theme, the first two are more closely aligned. I highly recommend this film to those who want to see movie making at its most creative, daring, outrageous, beautiful, entertaining and uplifting. A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very long, very strange trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has never been made, nor ever will be, a film like O Lucky Man! I saw this as a young child and when I viewed it again some 15 years later it was like deja vu with each new scene. This is remarkable since the movie has no outright plot nor does seem to go any one direction. Just when we're movin right along with mick travis up the ol countryside Alan Price butts in and offers his rendition of the goings on. Alan Price... in his studio...recording "folksy-stuff"...as we watch in real time....I would imagine a few people in the editing room may have objected. That said, the Alan Price offerings eventually fit in as a myriad of twists and turns lead Mick to traveling with the very band that has been intermittently appearing on the screen. I won't attempt to pitch this story in 25 words or less, as with most McDowell pictures, but will say that it's truly one of the most inventive, original, and stimulating films I've seen. Helen Mirren's performance especially stands out as her one character reaches so many ups and downs alongside Mick. Mick Travis is the quintessential "hero" of a film and of course is a reflection of Malcom McDowell himself, having wrote the story and previous two in something that resembled a film trilogy. O Lucky Man gets better with each viewing, a great one to own. Michealangelo Antonioni's "Blowup" may be one of the few films that can rival O Lucky Man in both the weirdness and uniqueness departments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biting, Knowing Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"O Lucky Man" reminds me of the need to assume personal responsibility for one's experience. The "play" is already "in progress" when we enter the "theater," and it's up to us to make "life selections." When we act only upon face value (as did the character of McDowell) we can sometimes get "burned." Indeed, all that glitters is not gold, as this scenario graphically demonstrates. The condemnation is broadly based, with all stratas of society coming under its ax . . . from the high lifestyle to the lowly. All have the potential for "game playing" and Travis plays into its fold with wildly fluctuating results. Anderson touches a remarkably wide number of areas and topics to satirize, and the film's length tends to accommodate them in quite biting manner. His opus here joins "If . . . " as challenging pair of thought-provoking works. McDowell lends his unique presence to the lead role. Actually, his Travis doesn't have that much dialogue, yet McDowell dominates the film every inch of the way.We'd better try and get as much solid information as possible when we made important decisions, and not get fooled by "surface shine"--or we might end up like Travis. An astute social commentary, this "O Lucky Man," which promises to provide intellectual stimulation on repeated viewings--for those with enough patience to focus in on and prune its mammouth three-hour presentation.</fullReview>

I caught this movie on VHS and wish that ,in the age of the DVD someone would remaster this title,so I can retire my old beat up version. I've watched this movie a dozen times and love the journey. I didn't always appreciate the soundtrack BUT one reviewer aptly calls it classic; the movie would not be the same without it. The surrealism of using actors to double roles, the jumpy nature of his journey and the metaphor going on in that cold war installation joined with the crazy dark experiment scene! You won't find a statement/image like that in many movies, underground or mainstream. What a shocker! This is a great movie. A DVD version has just got to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the counterculture films of the period have the feel they improvised on the fly and are horribly self-indulgent. But where some hare-brained films like Easy Rider can win you over through the characters, soundtrack, technique, or dialogue (never mind that Easy Rider campfire diatribe, the Fifties were just as crappy as the Sixties politically), this film is dated and borders on cheesy. For some reason there is a guy in black face, because, it was metaphorical or something. Again, it's a counterculture film, they can make eccentric choices and film scholars can explain the brilliance of the casting choice later, that's their job. Also, the soundtrack is a huge part of the film, so if you don't like it, you will probably be annoyed. After the third song you will realize whether it will grow on you or not.It's hard to say that the film really works because the message is broad and unfocused. I don't think it is saying anything. The film is so absurd, erratic, and uninterested in developing characters you get the impression they either worked to fill out the plot by brainstorming ideas in all-nighters and intentionally shrugged off narrative or character arcs, or they filmed six hours and this was the most coherent cut they could salvage. Rarely do you invest three hours in a film and are left utterly apathetic to the character, who he is, why he is, or what it all means. You'd mistake this for a light-comedy for the ease this guy falls ass backward into willing sexual partners, but it isn't funny. However, satire, is too strong a word, so it just hovers awkwardly in the gap between.The film has an edge, the only reason Warner Brothers supposedly authorized it was the success of A Clockwork Orange but oddly it is not really shocking or entertaining though that was surely what it was going for. It doesn't date very well, most "edgy" farces don't. I have to reiterate, this whole production has the feel of a director who keeps saying "hit me" to the dealer on 18, and each time gets a seven.Jerry Lewis invented the "trick" ending and for some godawful reason the avant-garde community has never let go. I can't really say more without getting into spoiler territory, but the ending pretty much ends up justifying your suspicion that you've wasted your time watching a bunch of people have fun in front of a camera, instead of filming a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O lucky film! It's a film I once saw in 1993 still as a teenager in the Spanish sideline Channel La 2, although I haven't managed to see the first minutes yet. It was in the small hours that I found it on TV unexpectedly and got captivated right away by the inquisitive and somewhat bizarre main character (superbly played by Malcolm MacDowell), who in his quest of life travels into different circles of society bumping into most extravagant characters, experiencing surrealistic and often extreme situations. He finds Patricia, who appears and vanishes in the plot time and again, a part out of which Hellen Mirren squeezes the most, and a remarkable performance.He, the same actors coming out once and again playing various roles and Alan Price's music band playing on the background with lyrics related to the matters developed make up the thread of the film.In addition, there's a whole idea driving the plot that unravels during the film, which can keep you intrigued for days, trying to work out what the final message was actually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, bafflingly surreal masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film after coming across it very late one night, and found myself unable to stop watching. It seemed to go on forever, and it's a testament to how compulsive this film is that i sat through the remainder of it's running time- until around 4.30 am! Make no mistake, at almost three hours long the running time borders on the masochistic, and it has no real narrative to speak of; the film is a loosely structured surreal musical that critiques seemingly everything from the criminal justice system and corrupt politicians, to some stuff that seems to border on the Freudian. However, one fact remains, the journey you take as you follow Travis on his adventure is one you will struggle to leave prematurely.If you've ever seen 'If', also starring Malcolm McDowell and with the brilliant Anderson directing, you will have some idea of what to expect (indeed, though not a sequel in the normal sense McDowell plays the same character he did in 'If'). 'O' Lucky Man' is constantly surprising; you find yourself unable to stop watching because you have simply no idea what will happen next. The film is brilliantly shot by Anderson; oddly timed jump cuts and other subtle visual tricks, along with the films episodic structure, combine to create a wonderfully off-kilter experience. This is only enhanced by the films excellent performances, particularly Malcolm McDowell's that may be even better than the one he delivered for 'A Clockwork Orange'. The script is also top-notch, and the musical soundtrack superbly complements the changing tone of the film throughout the lengthy running time. Having said all that, the reasons I love O'Lucky Man doubtlessly mean it isn't for everyone. It has no real plot to speak of, and it is wilfully bizarre, very long, and quite slow going in places. But if you want to watch a darkly surreal satire / comedy / fairytale / exploration of almost anything, if you take the time to pick apart the layers of this film, washed down with plenty of irony, it's a must see. Odd, compelling, and brilliant; one thing i can promise anyone who watches this film is that they will never have seen anything quite like it.</fullReview>

This movie pulls off the unusual feat of being both cynical and optimistic at the same time. The satire is biting, but it makes you feel that Lindsay Anderson's take on humanity is more bemused than angry. Like 20001: A Space Odyssey, the ending leaves itself open to personal interpretation. For me it says, "Sure, life is rough, but you have to laugh anyway. We're all in it together -- we might as well have fun." By the way, the version that's available on video contains a couple of scenes that weren't in the American theatrical version, and the movie makes more sense intact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To refer to this 3 hour monstrosity as simply "self-indulgent" would be an understatement of breathtaking proportions. I write this brief review as a warning, and nothing more. To waste time critiquing its many pointless scenes would be useless, since many are just forgettable. But what we have here is a very talented cast wasting our time and theirs with several useless, random scenes barely intertwined into a dated critique of capitalism. And don't believe what you've heard about the music, either. Even that is bad. The basic plot synopsis that you will read on this site and in many film review books covers only a small fraction of what this film actually contains. It plays like a series of twenty minute short films, held together only by McDowell, and the little rock band. As good as McDowell is (and he acts well here too) even he can't sustain your interest. I mean this film is BAD. About the only other positive aspect of this is a young Helen Mirren who looks kind of like Jennifer Lawrence in American Hustle. That's as good of a compliment I can come up with. That's how bad this is. Don't see it! 3 stars is all I can muster. Only for McDowell and Mirren.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is a coffee salesman trainee who is put into a prominent position after the previous salesman in the Northeast runs off. He finds a corrupt system in decline. He gets lost driving in the North. He runs across a military installation and gets tortured for a confession. He escapes when fire breaks out. Then he gets involved with medical experiments by Dr. Millar. He escapes and lives with Patricia (Helen Mirren) in London. This is dated. The surrealism is interesting for the first half hour. I get the general rant against the world. However the movie loses tension as each weird thing seems to randomly occur. I lose interest in the narrative. It's a fascinating bit of 70's British film. They are obviously throwing the traditional playbook out the window and trying something different. In addition to McDowell, it's fascinating to see Helen Mirren in her 20s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you have a friend on whom you think you can rely, you are a lucky man!" sings Alan Price at the start of this sequel to 'If....', which reunited director Lindsay Anderson, writer David Sherwin, and actor Malcolm McDowell, reprising his role as 'Mick Travis'. Mick has joined The Imperial Coffee Company where he is training to be a salesman. He catches the eye of Gloria ( Rachel Roberts ), who finds him charming. When Oswald, the firm's man in the North-East, quits, Mick is sent out to replace him. So begins a surreal, satirical odyssey through an exaggerated '70's Britain.So what happens? Well, Mick witnesses a fatal car crash and is threatened with arrest by the police investigating it, is accused of being a Soviet agent while seeking directions near a power plant ( and almost blown up when it catches fire ), is breastfed in church by a vicar's wife ( Mary MacLeod ), volunteers for scientific experiments at the Millar Institure, run by psychotic Professor Millar ( Graham Crowden ) who is grafting people's heads onto animals' bodies, falls in with a travelling musical group ( led by Alan Price ), sleeps with the lovely Patricia ( Helen Mirren ), is made assistant to ruthless tycoon Sir James ( Ralph Richardson ), arrested by the Fraud Squad, sent to jail for five years, and, on release, becomes devoutly religious, resulting in him being attacked by vagrants who don't like his soup. Finally, after auditioning for a part in a new film called 'O Lucky Man!', he gets it, and is whacked over the head with a copy of the script by none other Lindsay Anderson himself.'If....' was tightly controlled, whereas 'Man' is painted on a much bigger canvas, with Sherwin, Anderson and McDowall taking pot-shots at various aspects of modern life such as business, medicine, religion, science, the military and the permissive society. As Michael Palin noted in his diary after viewing a rough cut, some scenes work better than others. There is a strong 'Python' feel to the whole enterprise; people fall out of tall buildings, joke captions appear on screen, comical authority figures abound along with loads of bad taste and gratuitous sex. And it is nearly three hours long! Not to everyone's taste certainly. But it is never less than fascinating.The usual Anderson repertory company ( Peter Jeffrey, Arthur Lowe, Mona Washbourne, Graham Crowden ) is augmented by the likes of Dandy Nichols, Geoffrey Palmer, Bill Owen, Michael Medwin, James Bolam, David Daker, Michael Elphick, Helen Mirren, and Ralph Richardson, many of whom are cast in more than one role. Lowe even appears blacked up in one scene. It is a little uncomfortable now to watch Rachel Roberts playing a suicidal housewife - the actress took her own life in 1981.Travis is no longer the rebel we saw in 'If....', but more of an innocent abroad, reacting to events rather than helping to shape them.Alan Price's songs pepper the course of the narrative, serving as a wry commentary on the action.'If....' caught the mood of the time, but 'O Lucky Man!' works for different reasons. Travis returned in 1982's 'Britannia Hospital'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting films of my youth, my opinion has changed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My somewhat slow, long-term project of revisiting films of my youth that impacted me took me back to that staple of campus films societies at Wisconsin-Madison in the late 1970's, O Lucky Man!, where I first saw it. Unfortunately, it has not dated well, at least in my opinion. (I know, I used to have a romanticized memory of the movie in my head as well.) Seeing it again after many, many more years of film-viewing I see this movie as being too long by at least a third. I think it could have really benefited with stricter editing choices and a firmer hand on the story -- which is ironic since Lindsay Anderson himself allegedly kept telling Malcolm McDowell (and presumably the crew) that they needed to do that very same thing. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious -- and normally I'm a sucker for an ambitious "failure," ESPECIALLY by Hollywood standards -- but they lost the story for some of the anti-establishment points they were trying to make way too inconsistently to hold focus or interest. There are too many other reasons for falling short to mention here, but not the least of them is that it features the high-water mark of the career of Malcolm McDowell who was at the peak of his international fame between the two Lindsay Anderson films and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (although also very good later in Time After Time). Once his stock fell after the collapse of the British film industry and he was displaced to the United States (along with a very nasty cocaine habit), his career never fully recovered and seems to have tainted some of Anderson's legacy with him. History, as they say, is written by the winners and McDowell (though, admirably, he cleaned up and turned his life around) hasn't been on the winning end. And just to be clear, I like McDowell. The cast is terrific (including a very young Helen Mirren who looks amazingly similar to Jennifer Lawrence of today) which is why I give it a 5, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than for film history purposes (British New Wave film, the 1970's, Lindsay Anderson, etc.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's "O Lucky Man!" is easily one of the best films ever made. It has virtually no plot to it at all, and these kinds of movies are the ones that I especially enjoy (other example: "Five Easy Pieces"). They're the kind of movies where you watch them for the acting not the plot, because, let's face it, how many times do you want to watch something like "Speed" again? You know what happens! You know that dork Keanu Reeves and everybody else are going to make it over that gap (even though that would NEVER happen in real life!) What really intrigues me about this spectacular film are the many little really REALLY weird things. Some examples: the half-man half-sheep creature Mick finds in the bed; that whole explosion incident at that weird place; and, my favorite by far, that guy flying out of that high-rise building after a struggle. That just completely took me by surprise. (Unfortunately, I haven't seen this film in about four years, and it doesn't look like I will any time soon.) Another thing about this film that rules is its AWESOME soundtrack by Alan Price. The "title track" is really one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. And, of course, there's Malcolm McDowell, who I think gives his best performance ever (yes, even better than "Clockwork Orange") as Mick Travis, who I think shows up again in Anderson's "Britannia Hospital", another VERY weird film. Bottom line: Five stars out of five. A milestone in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cupcakes and Orwell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brief review of "If", "This Sporting Life", "Britannia Hospital" and "O, Lucky Man!", four films by director Lindsay Anderson.One of the defining films of the British New Wave, "Sporting Life" revolves around Frank Machin (Richard Harris), a short tempered guy who becomes a star on the rugby circuit. Eschewing the style of Anderson's later films, which tended to be stylised satires, it offers a gritty portrait of a Northern England rife with failed relationships, class anxiety and human despair. As Anderson cut his teeth as a run-and-gun documentary filmmaker, the film crackles with the energy of post-war Neorealism."This Sporting Life" would prove a big influence on Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull". Replace Scorsese's boxing scenes with Anderson's frenetic rugby brawls and swap the tough-but-dim Jake LaMotta for the equally tough-but-dim Frank Machin, and you have virtually the same tale. Both also make extensive use of flashbacks, are shot in black and white, are preoccupied with masculinity and personal anguish, feature violent romances, mix poeticism with realism, follow the same narrative progression and are about men who express their inner turmoil through external violence.Where "Bull" differs from "Life" is in the former's refusal to put Jake within a larger social context. This is a direct result of a broader shift; from modernism to post-modernism, from art as social engine to art as social withdrawal. And so in Scorsese's film, Jake LaMotta essentially has no external motivation. "I didn't want to give LaMotta any motivations," Scorsese would say in interviews (not quite true; LaMotta is reduced to a Catholic body bag, a suffering Christ who exists to absorb penance for his earthly sins), before going on to state that "all motivations are clich". "Reasons? We never discussed reasons!" he would tell the New York Times in 1980. Scorsese's dismissal, the unconscious stance of post-modernity, is chilling.But "understanding" is not necessarily "cliche", rather it is the essential component of character. La Motta's boiling anger in Scorsese's film does not make him a human being, especially once you've read how articulate and self-analysing LaMotta is in his autobiography. That makes the film, for all its power, somewhat shallow. In comparison, "Life" has more direct ties to the Neorealist movement. It portrays sporting clubs as the playthings of the wealthy, shows how club owners become Mephistophelian menaces, is resoundingly class conscious, portrays the sports community as being intertwined with the mining community, shows how celebrity and sports are seen to be a form of financial and psychological escape etc etc. And so Anderson's films are, at their best, rebellions against the inherent conservatism of British culture, akin to the plays of Harold Pinter and Arnold Wesker, and the contemporary working-class novels of John Braine, Alan Sillitoe, Stan Barstow and David Storey, the screen adaptations of which, in the late 1950s and early 60s, ushered in a new era of British film and formed the core of what was to be known as the British New Wave.Scorsese has never spoken of "This Sporting Life", but in the late 1970s he did mention to David Sherwin that the name of his central character in "Taxi Driver", Travis Bickle, had been chosen as a homage to Mick Travis, Malcolm McDowell's character in Lindsay Anderson's "If". It should be no surprise, then, that "Taxi Driver" is essentially a remake of "If", now set in New York."If" is about life in a highly authoritarian British boarding school. We watch for an hour as teachers, prefects, priests and various other authority figures essentially make the lives of the students miserable. One young outcast called Mick Travis, however, refuses to put up with this any longer; he finds a stash of guns and, during a climactic, pseudo-fantastical sequence, guns down the school's staff from a clock tower.It's a great film, though it does, like many similar films of the era, degenerate into a simple revenge fantasy, revolutions - unashamedly cathartic - brought about by bullets and violence. Compare this to fare like "The Magdalene Sisters", Jean Vigo's "Zero De Conduit" or perhaps "Clockwork Orange" and "Zabriskie Point", where the "fantasy clich" at the end is reversed and the "anarchist" is absorbed/enfolded/manipulated into the very fabric he lashes out at."If" found Anderson developing a new aesthetic. He employs Brechtian distance and an acerbic, satirical tone. He'd develop this style further in "Hotel Britannia" and "O, Lucky Man!", both of which feature the Mick Travis character. A precursor to Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", both are also dystopian fantasies preoccupied with revolution, anarchists and abuses of state/corporate power. Attempting to portray life in a capitalist society dominated by powerful mega corporations, "O, Lucky Man!" (1973) was the more popular of the two films. "Hospital" (1982), though, was the more ambitious. Using a hospital to encapsulate the social mores and ideological underpinnings of pre-Thatcher, mid-1970s Britain, the film tackled everything from class bigotry to imperialism to problems of equity to Britain's love affair with monstrous dictators. Ironically, the film's release coincided with the "Falklands War", and so was sunk by a rise in nationalistic fervour."This Sporting Life" ? 8.5/10, "If" ? 8.5/10, "O, Lucky Man!" ? 7.5/10, "Britannia Hospital" ? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard that If... and O Lucky Man were two must-see classic movies, but I regret to say I couldn't connect with either. I saw If... years ago and don't remember anything about it beyond my disappointment, but I still gave O Lucky Man a chance.A dark satire of England (as best I can tell), the movie follows the adventures of a likable and enthusiastic coffee salesman who meets a series of corrupt caricatures. While the movie aims for sharp satire, there is something half-hearted about it all. The pace is sluggish and the movie seems to wander here and there with little purpose.Some of it works. Malcolm MacDowell is quite good, and the movie perks up when Ralph Richardson is on screen. But I just couldn't keep interested.About a third of the way through my Internet went out. Had that not happened, I would have kept watching in hopes that things picked up. But I am not at all inspired to continue.I like satire, I like surrealism, I like the cast, and I love the songs by Alan Price (I have the album). But I don't like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lindsay Anderson mixes "Candy" with "The Magic Christian" while Alex meets Dim again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968's "If...", Lindsay Anderson focused on the brutality of the UK's boarding school system. He followed that up with "O Lucky Man!", in which Malcolm McDowell's character Mick Travis enters the labor force. Told that he would be a big success in the corporate world, Travis gets ripped off every step of the way. I should remind you that this movie is a comedy, falling somewhere between slapstick and black comedy.A trick that the movie uses is casting every person in multiple roles. This trick reminded me of Christian Marquand's "Candy". But some of the most impressive scenes are the musical interludes with Alan Price. And the rest of the cast? Aside from the man known as Alex the Droog, we have Ralph Richardson, Helen Mirren, Philip Stone (Alex's father in "A Clockwork Orange" and Grady in "The Shining"), Rachel Roberts (the headmistress in "Picnic at Hanging Rock"), Warren Clarke (Dim in "A Clockwork Orange"), Vivian Pickles (Harold's mother in "Harold &amp; Maude"), Brian Glover (the hostile tavern patron in "An American Werewolf in London") and Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett in the "Star Wars" movies*).But the important thing is that the movie indicts the exploitation inherent in the corporate world. A similar movie that I recommend is "The Magic Christian", starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr. You're sure to love it, not least because of the great soundtrack.*This is the second time that Malcolm McDowell appeared alongside a "Star Wars" cast member. David Prowse (Darth Vader) appeared as Mr. Alexander's caretaker in "A Clockwork Orange".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>commentary on hog-man scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish to put in this tabloid a small commentary on the scene with the hog-man, stanza a. 1h 15 min, from the film at hand. Now "O Lucky Man" is a most remarkable film indeed. Besides its complex plot and its considerable length, the movie offers a real gem in the field of allegory. On broad canvas Mike (the main hero) is just another young man from the lost generation in 1960s. Me being a slightly later offspring from the same cold war epoch and a curious kid from the 1970s, was a real shock to watch a film like this one on the wide screen. I remember that by the end of the movie half of the cinema hall was empty since the "grown-ups" had left the saloon bored. This was then socialist Bulgaria, people could hardly perceive a social satire that the film was and really a small number of spectators could perceive this movie as just another Orwellian "1984", whatsoever. I want to return to my primary idea about the hog-man. It came smoothly and unexpectedly in the narrative of the film; that maybe was done purposefully to gain maximum effect and embroilment. It was not such a disgusting scene to see creature with a head of man and a body of hairy pig. I have seen much more disgusting movies of blood spilling and cannibalism (for instance, playmate Rogero Deodato does such kind of cinema). Instantaneously, here you go with an outcry and everything is over. If you are impressed, you have to find the movie on a tape and watch the same scene over and over again. "How much did they paid you", says Mike and turns away the sheet that covers his shivering companion. That's all.Elementary ethics condones the spectator to think about where did the scenario get the idea of such a plot. I have watched thousands of movies and as much special effects, but never have seen such an grotesque image of a clinic where people are castrated and turned into living animals. I know that Mr. McDowell wrote the script himself based on personal experience and maybe its a secret that he prefers not to reveal to public. I wish him all the best and many more creative years in the future! Thank You.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central idea of Lindsay Anderson's bizarre and sometimes frustrating political satire seems to be that ideals inevitably come to grief when they fall into contact with humans and human society, which are invariably corrupt, petty, stupid, selfish and cruel. This is a pretty dark message for a comedy, even one as black as this, but it helps that the main character manages to cling to his ideals for as long as he does. The story comes from McDowell's own experiences selling coffee in the 'territories' (ie. the parts of England that aren't London), but the plot runs fairly close to that of Waugh's Decline and Fall, as we follow the fortunes of a naif through the blood thirsty world of capitalism and eventually into prison and beyond. Along the way we encounter every class and type of Britisher, every UK institution and we watch as idealism crumbles in the face of pragmatism and the failings of human character. Ex-Animals keyboardist Alan Price provides often clever, sometimes intrusive or annoying sung commentary on the action and on England herself, which makes for a somewhat uneasy mix, but then the whole film is like that. Anderson pulled out all of the stops and dares the audience to put up with the results. Hollywood won't do this now, but directors in the early 70s and especially those working outside the big studios could get away with it. At almost three hours length, and with a picaresque story that is never about just one thing for more than twenty minutes, this movie is a bit of challenge to sit through.Make the effort. Movies like this don't get made anymore and we're oh such lucky men to have this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful tragedy.There's nothing to smile about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'O Lucky Man!' is a brilliant modern day tragedy befitting the times and culture in which in it was made. It is often very cynical and damning in it's critique of basically everything from capitalism, religion, and government. In many ways I found it more depressing than Anderson's masterpiece if... where we were first introduced to Malcolm McDowell's Mick Travis. 'O Lucky Man!' is a challenging film, it has really no plot or coherence to it. It is surrealist as it is described the only constant being the very naive Mick Travis is broken and broken by a society that eats up people who view the world with good and idealist eyes. Do we really like Travis? It's hard not to like Malcolm McDowell in anything even in the midsts of him playing sociopaths in if... or 'Clockwork Orange'. The thing about Travis that really draws the viewer in though is that his own personality s part of the surrealist landscape. No one is as hopeful or bright eyed of the world as Travis is. The great irony about 'O Lucky Man!' stems from taking this character and placing him in this hell. What I really appreciate about this film and if... that preceded it is the idea of Travis being an everyman. The societies in if... and 'Oh Lucky Man' are exaggerated to be sure but they offer an interesting exploration of these ideas. if... was a film about the young and old and how they violently collide and yet I find 'O Lucky Man' much more troubling. Essentially the film is about the breaking of Michael Travis. It's about money, the young and the old, and more importantly about finding an ideology to live by. Travis thinks he can make it in this world and the film mercilessly says that one cannot make their own destiny. That is what 'O Lucky Man' is about.. I find the soundtrack and even the irony of Travis eventually becoming the lucky man fascinating. Anderson has created a comedy of the blackest sort. Society says one thing and we see another.Michael Travis eventually gets his luck but at what cost? He signs his life away several times over the course of the film and the bright eyed youngster is reduced to a broken cynic by it's end. When the world eventually finds some use of Michael Travis, Michael Travis ceases to exist. I love that Anderson portrays this as a light hearted comedy because it is in actuality a very very dark film and that's what makes it all the funnier. We are asked to laugh at dreams and laugh at Travis because he resists cynicism. And of course the film ends when he becomes a cynic, brilliant and frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Lucky Viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson is undoubtedly the greatest film director in Great Britain, and of his famous trilogy ("If..." ,"O Lucky Man!","Brittania Hospital" ) the "Lucky Man" is the best:it is not only a bold and grotesque picture of our society today,but a warning of the worse to come... The adventures of a young coffee salesman is just a frame to show different aspects of life:corruption,lack of moral values,cynical manipulation of human lives, the absurdity of the military,power of money,etc. The protagonist, Mike Travis,is not a victim, but an avid participant in "all that jazz".He wants to get his "room at the top" at all costs, but his naivet (which is akin to stupidity, at times)throws him into the most unbelievable, indeed, dream-like and surrealistic situations.A special mention should be made of the brilliant cast and superb soundtrack. The main value of the film is that it makes us, the viewers, ponder the simple and inevitable question:"How to live decently and with dignity in this mad,mad,mad,mad world?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, you get tortured because you pop in on a secret nuclear facility? Welcome to waterboarding: it's just friendly persuasion. So you witness an accident involving 2 deaths and the cops threaten to charge you with manslaughter if you don't beat it (there is a lot of merchandise on the truck that they can take if you're not involved).The constable and the chief justice of a town are some of the participants in the after-hours sex club, where they have a chocolate sandwich on the stage. At least there was no minister there and Anderson was too naive and innocent to represent the pedophilic nature of modern day priests, denied the normal sexual outlets. For a man who despised the corruption of power, he did an outstanding job showing it ...all depicted as a very natural thing. The maid who delivers the tea, just as naturally unlocks Malcolm from the chair to which he is held prisoner.Such a great movie. Tonight I go back and see the commentary which certainly (by Malcolm) makes this a lot more sensible. Seeing Helen Mirren, the great lady of the English stage, acting as a young girl in many different parts gave you a real idea of the heights that she would come up to..</fullReview>

And the soundtrack LP I purchased back then still triggers warm feelings of nostalgia when spinning on my ancient turntable.One phrase from O Lucky Man! is never far from my lips, and is appropriately inappropriate for so many occasions. Mary Ball bids farewell to Mick from the upper landing as he walks out the door, saying "Try not to die like a dog."

		<shortDescription>Lindsay Anderson's film trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intent of this film review is to encourage the viewing of this underrated film O' Lucky Man, by a largely neglected English film director Lindsay Anderson. Readers should be aware from the onset that it may be considered a spoiler providing too much information, it's a fine line between too much/ too little information and I hope I've struck the right balance.Lindsay Anderson directed a trilogy of films around the central character of Mick Travis; they follow his travails through lives vicissitudes. The first film if... relates to his education in the bourgeoisie class ridden English education system. The second film O' Lucky Man covers his experiences in the world of work how he attempts to cope with having to make a living for himself in the dog eat dog world of 1970's England. I have to correct the misstated description here on IMDb of the film being a 'musical', it is NOT a musical, this is to clear up any misconceptions of people who could easily be put off watching it by taking this literally. Musicals in the popular consciousness conjures up the considerations of Oklahoma, and Mamma Mia where the films characters sing about their lot, whereas O' Lucky Man uses music as a 'soundset' to set or underline film scenes in an organic way with the musicians featuring an integral part of the film as characters in the films story. This is an important and not semantic delineation of the use of music as an essential element in the films storytelling.The third film of the trilogy is Britannia Hospital a savage satire of 1970's Britain of the fault lines of contemporary society, where no side comes out completely unscathed from Lindsay Anderson's biting criticism. It features Mick Travis as an investigative journalist endeavouring to undertake an expose of the Hospital to uncover its 'secrets'. The Hospital really stands as a metaphor for British society containing all of its foibles and idiosyncrasies.The three films don't need to be viewed in sequence they stand as individual works in their right they merely cover the journey of self discovery of Mick Travis through the formative period of his existence. I thoroughly recommend all three of them to anyone familiar or not with Lindsay Anderson, they can serve as an introduction to him and his abilities as a film director as well as providing a prism through which to view contemporary English/British society of the latter 20th Century or at least the decade of the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderfully self indulgent director Lindsay Anderson was. This movie was the result of a concept spring boarding from the bowels of the subconscious straight onto the silver screen with precious little intervention from the conscious mind. I also think that he had a wonderfully warped and colourful sense of humour. I loved Artur Lowe and his three wonderful roles, Malcolm Macdowell's characters always seem so much more real and substantial than he is, a true actor I guess. I quite lost my heart to Helen Mirren who is a goddess. I also loved seeing Britain in the early seventies, a country that, at the time, was still uniquely quaint, contrary and individual. Even though I don't live there I found myself hungering to be there at that time. I loved this movie even though it was gorgeously weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do rather love this film - it's my version of chocolate, or a bottle of wine - when I've had a day so bad that I want to bury myself, I stick O Lucky Man on.Whether it's the hippy groupie Helen Mirren, who comforts us (I mean Michael, the 'Lucky' Malcolm MacDowell) but then returns as a posh daughter of an exploiting tycoon but is then on the streets in another twist of fate, or the lovely and great parade of every English character actor of the period, again not just dressing up as one person, but appearing as another, later.Or maybe it's the rubbing shoulders of the rather bizarre with the comforting normality and homely - MacDowell driving round the country in an old rep-mobile, a Ford Anglia, should be boring and not work, but it does. Arthur Lowe 'blacking up', after being his usual uppity businessman just couldn't happen today.Or is it Alan Price, providing (&amp; seen playing the songs) that add a likable continuity throughout, bridging the classes? He and his band are Mirren's idols, as their old Dormabile (is that how it's spelt?) as their tour van almost run our hero down, in the middle of the night.Many topics that pop up in 'A Clockwork Orange', in which MacDowell starred, of course, are found here - youthful aberration, retribution and Society's responsibilities toward those and how far must a government go in the fight for a happy, homogenised population. But, O Lucky Man is an all round sweeter and more palatable fare than the acerbic and often nasty A Clockwork...Many don't get this sprawling epic, that spans both discs of the DVD here - and that's fine. Just take the occasional Pythonesque gags with the societal paranoia, throw in those odd but so-familiar character actors, the naffness of the period - clothes, hair, cars - and you do have a Cult (in my opinion) minor classic. O! Do Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often overlooked classic from the 1970's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply one of my favorite films, and shows that just because the studio system was long dead by the 1970's, that doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of worthwhile classics from that decade and beyond. This movie is unique, and yet to watch it is to see something that was very typical of films in the early 1970's - film trying to reflect in some way upon the world as it exists or is heading. Then came CGI and the cartoonish escapist fantasies that comprise the vast number of films we have today. This film really requires multiple viewings to get it. It basically follows the moral journey of an initially smiling coffee salesman (Malcolm McDowell) as he has his ideals smashed one by one. McDowell was himself a coffee salesman as a young man, and the whole film is from an original idea and script of his very own. I think it does a perfect job of describing the 1970's, which was basically a bridge decade between the idealistic 1960's and the "If it doesn't contribute to the bottom line then it's expendable" mode of thinking that began in the 1980's and just gets more entrenched as time passes. This film isn't for everyone, and although the two movies have completely different story lines, I'd say if you liked "Harold and Maude" you'll like this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British cinema's master maverick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I re-approached Lindsay Anderson's Michael Travis trilogy, ("If....", "O Lucky Man" and "Britannia Hospital") with a certain amount of trepidation. Films that belong very much to their age so often become dated almost to the point of embarrassment. Imagine my delight when these scored two out of three. I suppose there was never much to redeem "Britannia Hospital", a strangely unfocused attempt to swipe at Thatcherite Britain and the monarchy that somehow lacks the savagery needed to bring it off. By finishing Travis off toward the end in a welter of Hammer horror gore it all becomes unforgivably silly. The first of the trilogy, "If...., on the other hand is nothing short of a triumph. In its indictment of privilege through studying the hypocrisy and cruelty of of public school life, it has that very element of savagery that makes the introduction of the revolutionary element culminating in the final Speech Day massacre absolutely inevitable. I tingled with a real sense of rediscovery on re-seeing this fine film. To a certain, if slightly lesser extent, my excitement carried over to "O Lucky Man!" in many ways the strangest and most ambitious of the trilogy. Here the revolutionary Travis of "If...." embarks, as a coffee salesman, on a picaresque 'Pilgrim's Progress' journey of Britain in the early 70's. The stages of his 'pilgrimage' never quite add up (something shared with the Bunuel of "The Milky Way" and "The Phantom of Liberty") but with their endless variety of unexpected incident they always intrigue and satisfy. Part of the fascination is the way Anderson's stock team of actors turn up in different guises playing as many as two, three of four characters. By punctuating the various chapters of this 'road movie' with Alan Price's songs that reflect on the action like a Greek chorus, a very satisfying sense of unity is achieved in a work that might otherwise have seemed diffuse. Add to these elements a cleverly diverting ending in which Malcolm McDowell auditions for his role in the film and you have one of the most perversely brilliant works by someone who, like Bunuel, was a real maverick.</fullReview>

I liked so much more than if...! It gets some aspects of the capitalist world spot on, and it mocks it in a really over the top manner, making the plot line change continually. It still didn't make me crack up, but there's another aspect of the film that makes watching it worth while: the soundtrack is one of the best ever! It has a few Alan Price's songs throughout the film, that are written for it and performed in the studio. The band even gets a part in one scene! It's really an incredible soundtrack, amazing songs. So even if this movie is not for you, you'll at least have enjoyed the lovely music Alan Price provides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surreal, often hysterically funny, sometimes surprisingly sad, full of sly political and social satire, and jammed with wildly brave film-making choices, along with one of the great movie song-scores of all time by Alan Price. Its Candide meets 1970s Great Britan as a young man rambles through life in a series of absurd adventures, with the great supporting cast (Ralph Richardson, Helen Mirren, etc.) having the time of their lives playing multiple roles.The three hour running time may sound daunting, but it flies by as we watch our hero Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell, whose real life pre-acting experiences were the jumping off point for the story) slowly become wise to the ways of the world through a series of bizarre encounters, arrests, love affairs, and everything else that can befall a young man on the road. A must see film for anyone who appreciates unique films and British humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best movie I ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Oh Lucky Man in 1974 and was blown away. I've seen it about once every five years or so since....(I have a video copy). It stands the test of time. The Alan Price soundtrack is one of the best ever. It is about the journey of life with all of the foibles and fantasies attached to it. Brilliant work. To me the greatest line and one that I have remembered throughout my own life is that you must wear knowledge "like pearls instead of chains".... The work of Malcolm McDowell in this film is his very best. He is more celebrated for other films but none are better than what he did in this one. The work of Helen Mirren, Rachel Roberts, Ralph Richardson, etc. easily stands the test of time. It is over 35 years old now and still resonates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am a lucky man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel I am a lucky man, just to be able to see this movie. Especially now letterboxed on DVD, since it's not a movie you very often get a chance to see in the theater. You don't really hear a lot about Lindsay Anderson in America, which is a shame because I really feel like he's a great director. He is a master director because he has a firm and total grasp of realism and the documentary use of film, which he's then willing and able to take into surreal territories -- but only when appropriate to the film itself and never as an egotistical or political tool. I've seen a good amount of Anderson's stage work such as "Home", as well as his first film "This Sporting Life", and his fascination is with small, real and observable moments of emotion. When he makes bigger films like this, he just takes those same kind of moments but makes them feel epic somehow. Like in this film, when Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is given the golden suit by Monty (Ralph Richardson), and told "you'll find it surprisingly warm." Anderson makes it feel like Arthur just pulled Excalibur out of the stone, and does it more with the pauses in the action and dialog than with anything that specifically happens.I first became aware of "If...." through Monty Python's skit about the exploitation director, and then I later saw it because I read that Kubrick had cast McDowell in "A Clockwork Orange" based on his performance. "If..." became one of the movies of my teenage years, a couple of my good friends and I probably watched it a dozen times. But for some reason I never watched "O Lucky Man!" until about a decade ago, when I was in my 20s. In a way it's too bad, because I would have liked it at the time, but it was actually a perfect thing for me to be able to take up the story of Mick (or Michael as he's called in this film) Travis when he's in his "eager young man" days just like I was at the time. I'm just now rewatching it because the DVD is available, and it's confirming what I felt when I first saw it -- it's probably even better than "If...." and certainly sort of the ideal vehicle for McDowell, who created the basic story and worked on the screenplay, based loosely on his days as a coffee salesman in Northern England.What's so great about McDowell in this role is that he's not a hero or a villain; he's this guy who's trying to play the game, who thinks he's already as cynical and violent as the world around him but who finds a lot more irrationality and chaos than he expected. It's the story of how a certain kind of cynicism is like our version of naivet in the modern world. "You're so old fashioned," says the spoiled daughter Patricia (Helen Mirren), and he truly is like Tom Jones or something to our modern age, just this charming rogue whose most comic trait is the way he thinks that he's more evil or corrupted than everyone around him, mistakenly so. The movie is styled almost like a travelogue, with wide shots introducing the various areas of England where he travels accompanied by deliberately crude and generic "North" "South" roadsigns. The ultimate destination is a place where Mick can basically lose his belief in his ability to control the universe around him, or in other words a strange British approximation of Hollywood with director Lindsay Anderson himself holding court. At this point the line between Michael Travis and Malcolm McDowell has become very blurry, with shots of Travis holding the iconic machinegun from "If..." for the director in posed shots and so forth, and Anderson slapping McDowell into awareness as a metaphor for the process of humiliation and objectification that McDowell endured and prospered from at the time when he made "If..." and "A Clockwork Orange." Of course there's also a kind of beauty with closing the circle. "Britannia Hospital" is rather superfluous, unfortunately.There is simply too much to say about this film in the space provided... the music is another very notable aspect of the film, all written and performed inside and outside the context of the film itself by the Alan Price Set. Alan Price's voice and style are very suitable to both the urban and the rustic portions of the film. The way the music is used adds to the stylization of the whole film, along with Anderson's alternately soothing and jarring cuts between scenes. It creates an effect that reminds me once again of "Tom Jones", the novel moreso than the film, the way the chapters have their own sort of integrity. This is also similar to "A Clockwork Orange", and there are many of what seem to be deliberate references to that film in this one -- I think it's safe to say after digesting the ending of the film that it's all part of the gradual integration of Mick Travis into the actual McDowell. There's a line of graffiti clearly visible which reads: "revolution is the opium of intellectuals." This is a comment on a certain worshipful tone surrounding the reception of "If..." and "Clockwork" by some people who missed their satire completely. This sort of simple cynicism, very much like Mick Travis', that assumes the ability to enjoy watching the apocalypse is the same as being able to laugh at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very English surreal film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malcolm McDowell stars as coffee salesman Mick Travis in the second film in the trilogy of films from Lindsay Anderson, following 1968's If, and followed by Britannia Hospital in 1982. This film is a surreal journey across England, where Travis stumbles into many weird &amp; diverse situations. He is tortured by the MOD, and stumbles into a hospital where a patient's head is transplanted on to an animal's body. The film is added more surreal flavour because some of the actors play several roles. A very English surreal film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a huge film of much fun and genuine weirdness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of both If.... and Brittania Hospital, I had been wanting to catch this film for a while, until I got my chance yesterday. And it was not a disappointment. O Lucky Man! is simply one vast, weird, intelligent and funny movie. It provides some great food for thought on survival-of-the-fittest style capitalism, through Mick Travis's increasingly unexpected adventures. Not to mention his use and subsequent abuse by the ruling class.If you know the other two films in the trilogy, it becomes much fun to see other faces from If.... and Brittania Hospital pop-up along the line....especially since many of them are playing multiple roles!!! (eg Graham Crowden, Peter Jeffery, Mona Washburn etc etc) - in this instance, spare a thought for the actor Brian Pettifer, who plays wimpy, dorky young men (known as 'Biles') over the three films. Poor guy. And while not in the the other two movies, Helen Mirren appears here and is excellent as usual.Check it out. Despite it's running time, this is not a movie which has any dull moments. Ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kitchen Sink Surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A social satire that works more in the form of an absurdist deluge, "O Lucky Man" suffers like its protagonist from an excess of ambition and an absence of common sense.When we last saw Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell), he was shooting up an English boarding school in "if..." Now, a few years later, he's trying to make it in the rat race as a salesman for the Imperial Coffee Company, with the whole of north England as his beat. But strange things have a way of happening to Mick. He finds himself alternately interrogated by the military, threatened by a mad scientist, and a pawn in capitalism's greedy game."There are thousands of ways of making it," Mick naively tells his ladyfriend Patricia (Helen Mirren). "It's only a question of picking the right one."As a big Malcolm McDowell fan, I really wanted to like this one. He never did get another star vehicle like this again, and it's a shame. But "O Lucky Man" is a hard film for me to love.It is a brilliantly shot film, with a solid rock score by Alan Price that sounds a bit like Badfinger did. What grates is its dyspeptic, nihilistic tone, not to mention a catch-as-catch-can randomness and assorted left-field oddities. It's bizarre hearing McDowell in the DVD commentary talking about how director Lindsay Anderson kept railing about tightening up the story's construction; the final result on screen is as slapdash as one can imagine, with Travis sent in every possible direction without apparent motive.One quibble: Why is he playing Mick Travis again? The character here is nothing like the antisocial character we saw in "if...". McDowell barely seems to be playing the same character from scene to scene. He's alternately an eager go-getter, a cynical corner-cutter, and a wide-eyed innocent. The basic idea was taken from McDowell's own experiences as a coffee salesman, but the coffee-seller angle is abruptly dropped so the movie can have some fun with Mick being captured by the military, falling unconscious in a church, and then hitching a ride back to London, his job forgotten for the rest of the movie.Anderson and screenwriter David Sherwin want to pack everything in they can think of, and then twist the reality around to confuse and challenge the viewer. I don't think you can challenge a viewer before bringing them along somewhat, like getting them into the story or else liking the protagonist. The story never stays in one place long enough to develop momentum. Worse, McDowell never finds the character that would impel us to take his side, the way he did with "if..." and "A Clockwork Orange." He's slow and dull here.The film's restless spirit does keep things hopping, and so does the brilliantly eccentric Graham Crowden in three roles, each madder than the last. The acting is pretty solid around McDowell, and there's a good moment here and there, like an interrogation scene where Philip Stone, one of McDowell's castmates from "Orange", asks Mick if he believes in the "brotherhood of man". Mick says yes."Think carefully about your answer," the interrogator warns.If "O Lucky Man" offers any answer, it's to keep your mouth shut, believe in nothing, and enjoy yourself as best you can while you can. It's an answer some can take to heart, but "O Lucky Man" lacks the craft or apparent interest to sell it to the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind Of Interesting....But</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A general knowledge of 'Candide' will certainly be of considerable help to get one through this rather confused film. Malcolm McDowell works in this film about the ups &amp; downs of a coffee salesman. This film was the second in a trilogy that started with 'If' (1968),that itself is a remake (of sorts)of an old Jean Vigo entitled 'Zero For Conduct', about an overthrow in a boy's school. I actually didn't get to see 'If' until some years after I had seen 'Oh Luckey Man', so some things that went over my head were cleared up. When 'Man' isn't focused on the Michael Travis character,it seems to cut back &amp; forth to a recording session featuring Alan Price (ex-Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals keyboardist). Although the music does act as a pleasant diversion, it kind of bogs the plot down,and manages to pad the already overlong film out more. Worth a look,if you can get your paws on a copy of it (as far as I know, there's no DVD of it as of yet,so VHS may be your only solution).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An eternally bizarre satire on the British justice system and achieving success in the real world, it is a bit all over the place, oddly comic at times, and in general it is just hard to know what to make of it. The film consists of live action with snippets of music edited in, and many of the actors play more than one role, which makes the film rather unique at the least. McDowell however is the best of the cast, with the rest playing underdeveloped characters, and he is able to carry the film through on his shoulders. The slow pacing and the extreme length of the film are problems, but it is certainly one of a kind, and it is bizarre enough to keep one interested at least most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, chaotic, unfunny, and interminable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a line in Ira Levin's film "Deathtrap" where failing playwright Sidney Bruhl describes to his wife a play written by one of his students. "How good is it?" asks Bruhl. "So good even a gifted director couldn't hurt it." Was Bruhl referring, perhaps, to Lindsay Anderson?Anderson was a prime representative of the nihilistic, self-loathing traits one finds in those parts of the British population that hate their jobs, their prospects, their cities, their neighbors, their country, their sexuality, and their accents. And of course, anyone who happens to be successful in any normal profession or calling. In "If...", his lad Mick Travis rebels against the cruelty of the upper classmen in his school by staging an armed rebellion, complete with firearms, and ends up killing the headmaster and himself. Cute, neh? In "O Lucky Man", the violence is more surrealistic but equally driven by Anderson's various angers and hatreds. I'm not surprised that British intellectuals would like this stuff ("Revolution is the opium of the intellectuals"), but to me it's quite tiresome.What we have in "O Lucky Man" is a sort of Richard Lester parade of absurdities without the comic genius that Lester brought to his work. The strangest thing about the film is the number of people (many of them contributing to these reviews) that have found 183 minutes of this rubbish worth watching.Apart from these general observations, I have two specific complaints. First, the studio music sessions that punctuate the film contribute nothing to its flow, and are far from wonderful as music. Fortunately, with the DVD you can fast-forward through these interludes and not have to listen. Second, the film features two interesting actresses -- Rachel Roberts, still hot at 46 when the film was released, and Helen Mirren, smoking hot at 28 -- but neither of them do nude scenes. Anderson reserved that honor for female bit players and extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie -- yes. Music -- no.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the Alan Price band segments to be an annoying distraction during the film. The music itself (cheap Who knock-off) was not THAT bad, but was only palatable when played behind the story and not when we had to sit through the "concert session" footage. It served to break up the action in a distracting and useless manner.As for the film, it was interesting to see Warren Clarke with Malcolm McDowell after "Clockwork Orange." Ralph Richardson was perfect, absolutely flawless in his two roles. McDowell's performance was very much reminiscent of his role in "Clockwork Orange." I was also reminded of "After Hours" and Chaplin's "The Tramp."The film is fearless in its over-the-top insanity and some of this may be offensive to some, but always hilarious. I'm glad that the director unapologetically went over the top. This is a classic -- hands down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over ambitious message film that fails a bit too regularly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second of the Mick Travis in the working work as a salesman for Imperial Coffee. When he is given the sales job for the North-East of England he finds himself drawn into a series of situations where he is forced to strive harder and harder to overcome obstacles to get success.This is a satire of 1970's Britain that if nothing else is ambitious. Where If.... was a clear satire on class in Britain this doesn't seem to have any clear target. It has digs at the work ethic, prisons, police corruption, charities, religion etc, some of it makes sense and is on target. However much of it is senseless, amusing and pointless. Much of the film is imaginative but most of it steps too far and loses it's point - such as the whole incident in the Scottish military base and the experimental hospital. This makes Anderson's anger very difficult to understand and takes away from the film. Just as If... was a good social message but mixed film, this is a disoriented plot that has confused comments on society.The cast give roundly good performances McDowell is good and a host of British faces take on multiple roles in support including Brian Glover, Arthur Lowe, Helen Mirrem and other faces familiar from If...Overall a confusing and occasionally daft film who's message is only clear a couple of times. Overly ambitious but an interesting piece of new wave British cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, we have another "intelligent" movie; so "intelligent" in fact, that it's smarter than its viewers.That's what makes me confused. I know for a fact that I'm intelligent, and yet I consider this movie to be little more than 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.I formed this theory a long time ago, that books and movies too weird to be understood are in many cases almost automatically deemed too great, too smart or too deep. After all, they have to be, because otherwise regular people would understand them, right? Critics spend ages on these movies trying to pick apart every insignificant little detail and blow them up to be something transcendental or at least deeply thought through. I highly suspect that this movie is one of those.I know only one person who likes this movie, and - I kid you not - he's mentally ill. He enjoyed it immensely, though, so who knows; maybe I'm just the wrong kind of intelligent... or the wrong kind of sane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this political satire for British imperialism, for the second time Lindsay Anderson casts his favorite Malcolm McDowell, whose insane gaze even when he is sane could be the major reason to make the film worth watching. But after McDowell's mind-blowing performance in A Clockwork Orange, Anderson appears to suffer the inevitable influence from the Kubrick-McDowell collaboration-- the audience can easily trail many similarities between these two films. McDowell's La-Dolce-Vita-esque odyssey, a pile of random episodes, tediously continues forever. Casting a rock band (which briefly takes a part in the story) as a narrator contributes to the encapsulation of the era's atmosphere, but it increases tediousness at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(band) = musical scene of Alan Price's pop-rock bandPART A: (band) The film opens with an old black-and-white film of a coffee picker who is caught stealing coffee beans, found guilty, and for punishment has both his hands chopped off with a machete. This illustrates justice in the past, in preparation to show justice in the future. Then the story switches to the near future. From a noisy machine room, workers for the Imperial Coffee company are called into a salesperson meeting, whereupon speaker Mrs. Rowe tells them the value of smiling. One of the company's salesmen, named Oswald, has mysteriously disappeared, and Michael is chosen to be his replacement. (band) While traveling alone on his first sales trip in his new position, Michael comes across a car accident where the police act suspiciously and threaten Michael with charging him for causing the accident if he doesn't leave and keep quiet. Michael arrives at the Sutherland House Private Hotel, goes through Oswald's old belongings, and meets an elderly gentleman resident named Monty. Michael goes on a sales trip the next day, and is immediately invited to a businessman's party where the mixed audience watches a stag film and a live sex act (done in underclothes) on stage. That night upon arriving back at his hotel room, Michael is interrupted from a sexual encounter by a phone call from his company saying he is now also responsible for business in Scotland, and has to drive 200 miles to make a 10 a.m. meeting the next morning. Michael gets lost en route, uses a pair of binoculars to see the government property where the road ends, government vehicles immediately appear, abduct him, and electrically torture him into signing a confession of presumably being a spy. During the interrogation, an alarm goes off, the facility suffers what seems to be a nuclear accident, everyone flees, Michael runs up a forested hill as explosions go off behind him, and the entire area is burned of vegetation. It starts to rain, and Michael finds his way to a church while a service is going on. He wakes up from among the pews, hungry, tries to take food from the altar, but is stopped by a church woman, who instead nurses him from her breast. Children show him the way, he finds a busy motorway and attempts to get a ride, the first motorist who stops tells Michael he can make some easy money by volunteering for medical experiments at the Millar Research Clinic. He volunteers, is sedated, but fails to fall asleep, overhears a conversation about sterilizing him, attempts to leave, comes across a patient in another room who has been turned into a half-sheep, he flees, is pursued by guards with dogs, but eludes them on bicycle. However, his bicycle is nearly hit by a van with traveling musicians, but he isn't hurt, and he gets a ride with them. Patricia, a lady with the band, falls in love him en route to London. PART B: (band) The next morning Michael finds out that Patricia's father is the wealthy tycoon Mr. Burgess, and Michael is eager to make contact in order to further his own career. Michael disregards Patricia's warning, he quickly launches a fraudulent scheme to meet Mr. Burgess that day, while he's waiting at Mr. Burgess' office, Mr. Burgess fires an employee with 15 years at the company, the employee commits suicide by jumping from the office window, and takes another employee with him. Michael becomes Mr. Burgess' aide, they attend a meeting about investing in the country of Zingara, but Mr. Burgess is worried about the country's stability due to rebel activity. He and Colonel Steiger make an agreement that the British government's chemical weapon called PL-45, or "honey" for short, will be sent to Zingara to spread gruesome death to the rebels hiding in the miles of jungle territory. The next day there is another meeting of the investors and Zingara leaders, but the meeting is interrupted the British government's "Fraud Squad." Mr. Burgess tells Michael to trust him, and tells Michael to hide the papers in his pocket while holding a briefcase full of gold bars. One of the military men from Michael's earlier encounters joins the Fraud Squad, recognizes Michael, Michael is arrested, beaten by police en route to the jail, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to five years in prison. The judge, after sentencing Michael, walks into a private room, strips down to his underwear and is whipped S&amp;M style by a woman of the court. (band) Upon being released from prison, Michael comes across a Christian street gathering, he generously donates money to them, is immediately pick-pocketed, then people start mysteriously hurrying by with a ladder. It turns out a woman named Mrs. Richards in a nearby apartment building is about to kill herself. Michael climbs outside her window, attempting to dissuade her by reading poems and philosophy from a book he obtained from a prison warden. However, he falls from the wall as a pipe gives way, and wakes up at night with a policeman shining a light in his face. (band) The policeman tells Michael he is trespassing, and to "piss off." It's still nighttime when Michael volunteers to serve free soup to the homeless street people of the city. There he meets Patricia as one of the street people. When Michael attempts to preach to the crowd, they become angry, stone him, and roll a barrel down a hill at him. Michael survives, and during the daytime comes across a man handing out fliers to audition to be a movie star. Michael auditions, is selected and photographed, but the director has great difficulty in getting Michael to smile, in a reminder of the earlier scene of the company's motivational speech about smiling. (band) Michael manages to smile with great difficulty, and the film ends with all the characters from the film dancing together to Alan Price's band as balloons fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'O Lucky Man!' was hit-or-miss for me, and it's my least favorite film from Lindsay Anderson's Mick Travis trilogy. The songs by Alan Price have dated poorly, I think, in the same way that the Cat Stevens music from 'Harold and Maude' has. It was a substantial distraction, given that it appears quite often in Greek Chorus style and contributes a lot to the tone of the movie.Malcolm McDowell's Mick Travis character is the same person in name only, across the trilogy (which begins with 'If...' and ends with the underrated 'Britannia Hospital'). His smiling, vacant coffee salesman here seems to have little to do with the angry youth from the first film, and despite the epic length of 'O Lucky Man!,' the movie is an episodic satire without much resonance. It's very funny, at times -- my favorite sequence concerned a medical experiment for which McDowell is offered money -- and highly ambitious, superficially similar in some ways to 'A Clockwork Orange,' but in the end, it's too broad, aims at too many targets, and doesn't have the cinematic flair to match the energy of its satirical free-for-all.</fullReview>
