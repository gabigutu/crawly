		<shortDescription>Even Money sleeps in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film ever since I saw the teaser trailer of Gekko getting released from prison. It has everything you need for success. Iconic characters, interesting subject, good acting and great cinematography. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed by snooze fest with a meandering story with no focus and some strange "green" message.The movie starts off trying to set up LeBeouf's characters motivation. But even that is never clear. Is he financially or morally invested in some fusion project or both? Does he want to get his girlfriend and her father back together for her or because he wants a new mentor? Is he a greedy Wall Street guy with great ideas or is he some Eco-warrior trying to change the world? And then there's some half assed revenge plot against some financial tycoon who ends up embodying the entire financial meltdown.Through out the film the audience is drug along as these plots come and go. At one point the most important thing to the main character is getting revenge against Brolin's character and ends up working for him. But instead of getting revenge, he try's to get an investor in green technology. When his boss, who's he trying to take down, doesn't invest in the green technology LeBeouf's character breaks down and quits. So he forgets revenge and returns to getting his girlfriend back together with her father Gordon Gekko. At some point Gekko mentions he left his daughter $100 million which, strangely enough, is the exact amount that he wanted his last boss to invest in the green company. So he starts tricking his girlfriend into signing all the money over to her father who has promised to give it to the green company. LeBeouf's character is the only person on Earth who doesn't know that a guy who went to prison for insider trading might not be trust worthy. So surprise, surprise Gekko runs off with the money and we are treated to a ripoff of The Usual Suspects as LeBeouf thinks back to all the situations that showed Gekko is lying. So he goes back to revenge.So all of that along with more uncomfortable close ups of a girl crying then I can count, a number of strange transitions and the worst cameo I've ever seen with Charlie Sheen showing up as Bud Fox. He appears out of nowhere for no reason with two girls on his arm acting more like Charlie from Two and a Half Men than Bud Fox.All of this happens at a snails pace and makes you wonder if Stone has seen the first film in 20 years. I'm waiting for the sequel to Platoon where we skip the battle scenes and focus on a girl crying and some general who makes weird bird noises after every line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps isn't the sharp, critical film that its makers want you to think of it as. The sequel to the supremely influential, endlessly quotable original from the 80's is a dull whimper about what triggered the present financial meltdown and though it's cut from the same cloth as the original, it possess all of the bark yet, sadly, none of the bite.Gordon Gekko is a name that defined an era. Played by Michael Douglas twenty three years ago, he reverberated in the minds of viewers as a ruthless, amoral investor without a soul. Years later, the sequel finds him released after serving his prison sentence. Cut to seven years after his release, and its 2008, the dawn of the financial crisis. Gekko is now known as a speaker publicly vilifying the notion of greed in corporate America while simultaneously, and some would reckon quite ironically, publicizing his book inspiringly titled "Is Greed Good". A loner who travels in subways, he is estranged from his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan, androgynously unglamorous) who is engaged to a young trader named Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). Jake bumps into Gekko at one of his speeches (the films finest scene) and the two form a mentor-protégé relationship that irks Winnie but allows Jake to benefit by plotting revenge from Bretton James (Josh Brolin, the films principle villain), suspected of being responsible for the suicide of Louis Zabel, a close friend and confidant of Jake.If the film sounds like a mess of relationships, then it is. As muddled as Stone's own political activism it has no clarity on what its trying to say. From trying to rationalize the reasons behind the market crash to the impulsive nature of human behaviour, it doesn't get either right. Not helping are the actors that Stone assembles. It's a mystery to me why Shia LaBeouf is constantly being thrust down viewer throats in film after film by studios convinced he is the next best thing. He is not, and despite being dressed up in expensive designer garb, cannot pass off as being anything more convincing than a working intern. His relationship with Gekko has none of the enticing quality that Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox did and a cameo appearance by Sheen only underscores this disparity. Douglas himself has none of the limelight. He has some powerful lines, but feels largely sidelined by the revenge/relationship/murder subplots and behaves uncharacteristically, especially in the very last scene (these were probably added as an afterthought). After showing some promise of returning to his incendiary, often infuriating filmmaking style and point of view with his previous film W, director Stone seems to have gone back to being comfortable working with drab studio approved material.Not only was the original Wall Street a tremendously entertaining film, but one that was blessed with the critical foresight of its maker. The sequel partially entertains but does not have a new perspective. It is neither critical nor insightful and could have, with the same script and actors, been the work of a lesser director than Stone. The films themes are also impersonal - none of the characters suffer directly from the financial crisis the way they did in the original, they suffer from their own incompetent decision making, a sharp departure from how the original handled and fused stock trading with personal loss and gain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first twenty minutes were very promising. Then it got boring. Extremely boring. There just isn't any plot. Gekko (Michael Douglas) getting together with his daughter maybe was touching for a moment. But the girl crying all the time got on my nerves. She is supposed to be an adult. In stead she is acting like a little child. I like Shia, but what on earth was he representing. At least Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox had a clear objective. (Speaking of which, his cameo as the guy we know from Two and a half men is so in contrast of the character Bud Fox that completely diminishes the first movie. I could not believe that they would make a parody of his role). Shia's character was a guy who was ambitious but stuck with his green energy project. While any men or woman with common sense would bail on it. No, it is the right thing do. Oh, please. Now, this isn't Shia's fault. But I blame Oliver Stone for this, what happened to you. He used to be brilliant. This movie is not even a good depiction of the economic crisis the world is in right now, so it is not even enlightening. If there was one thing you could count on it was how meticulous Oliver Stone was when it comes to history and actual topics. In this film that is completely absent.I can't recommend this at all. In the first place there should have never been a sequel to Wall Street. That tale was ended. Secondly how is it possible that a sequel directed by Oliver Stone ruins the the spirit of the original one in every way it can. This is an incredible waste of time and celluloid. Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great... Until The Third Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie until its final thirty minutes or so. During those thirty minutes you realize that Stone and his team of writers were searching desperately for a way to end the movie on a positive, hopeful note. We are left to plod along with them on this implausible track. Also, during the ending Gekko's daughter's character consistency is shot to hell and she appears as venal as the characters against whom she rails.Those moments are especially disappointing because I believed that this movie had the potential to be Stone's best film ever. Carey Mulligan and Michael Douglas in particular delivered great performances. Shia Lebeouf is "good enough." The writing is fairly unpredictable then everything seems to be tied into a nice bundle near the end. The problem was that Stone couldn't quite bring himself to put the bow on that bundle. He wanted to add a bit of glitter to it, which seemed gaudy and completely out of place.Bottom line: if this movie had ended on a somewhat dark note it would have reflected the reality of modern day Wall Street, and it would have made for a tighter, better movie.It's worth watching, and if you liked the first Wall Street it probably won't disappoint you. You might want to leave during its third act, though :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise spoiled by too many plot points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wall Street Money Never Sleep had a great premise at the beginning - return of great characters from the original and very interesting subject matter (worst financial and economical crisis since the World War II). While the movie succeeds in taking us through the financial crisis as it gradually unfolded, it is constantly dragged down by way too many plot points, but mainly the hardly believable revenge and very slow paced love story subplots.Let's get one thing clear at the beginning first. It is an immensely difficult task for the writers to portray the financial crisis into a movie for general masses, while explaining the workings of the crisis, not bogging down the viewers with too much financial jargon and at the same time keep the movie entertaining. This is the part that you can see the makers have made their homework and is something to be appreciated about the movie, such as the Bear Sterns inspired collapse of Keller Zabel.My biggest problem with the movie is that the character with the most screen time, Jacob Moore, is not a believable character. It might be due to casting Shia LeBouf, who for one looks too young and too soft to be earning $1.5m bonuses and living in a $6m apartment. Second, he is a "prop trader," which means that his job is to constantly trade stocks on his company's account. Yet, we see him trying to raise $100m for a renewable energy source, which isn't the job of prop traders. Even he is pitching the idea to Chinese investors, which is nonsense, since he would have had nothing to say about the company unless he was an equity analyst responsible for the energy sector. This brings the obvious question, why was he so interested in the little fusion plant project? His job is to make money not save the world.And than there are the inconsistencies and plot holes: At the beginning of the movie Jacob invests $1m from his bonus on 50% margin into his firm Keller Zabel and keeps his position even as the stock is plummeting putting him into sizeable amount of debt (film hinted $0.5 mil). Now, first firms usually prohibit employees on speculating on their own stock due to the possibility of having insider information and second if Jacob was such an excellent prop trader he wouldn't have touched the stock if there were rumors of its impending collapse. This alone is hardly believable and our intelligence is assaulted again when the film somehow forgets his debt (before he even admits the debt when proposing to his girlfriend), when he writes his mom a check for $200,000 without a second thought.Jacob spreads rumors about an African oil rig being nationalized in which Bretton's company has a big stake, which ended up costing the company millions. And Gekko ends up explaining to Jacob that it was illegal because he pushed other people to make traders based on false information, so Jacob realizes that the two are alike. How can a Wall Street rainmaker such as Jacob not realize that he manipulated the markets, which is illegal? Other problems: Gekko's London hedge fund growing from $100 mil to $1.1 bil during Winney's pregnancy? At one point, we saw workers dismantling the fusion plant, would it have been too little too late to give the $100m to an empty factory site?To conclude, this is a revenge and redemption movie with Wall Street and market crash as a backdrop. If they had cut down the crying-girl scenes, to improve pacing, maybe it could have turned out better. This way, it's just plain bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is Good, Redemption is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What actually happened to Gordon and Bud?" That was the question I asked myself after seeing "Wall Street" for the first time. The film, set in 1985, had an amazing loose end outside of a courthouse that lasted 23 years."Wall Street" and its "Greed is Good" mantra set a standard for the future stockbrokers of America. It was the epitome of dog-eat-dog. Speaking of dogs, one of the best lines from the film was, "If you need a friend, get a dog." It set the tone for the era; love will betray you and money will always be loyal."Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" set in 2008, right before the financial bubble burst, is Oliver Stone's sequel to his original. The title of the sequel takes its name from a line uttered by the legendary corporate raider Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas, who also won an Academy Award for Best Actor in the first film).The story begins with Gekko being released from prison into a world that has forgotten about him in 2001. Fast forward to 2008, we are introduced to a young couple Jake Moore (played by Shia LaBeouf) and Winnie Gekko (played by Carey Mulligan). Jake is an ambitious Wall Street investment banker. Winnie is an online activist and also Gekko's estranged daughter. The investment firm Jake works for is about to go under and his mentor, Louis Zabel (played by Frank Langella), is making some bad decisions for their firm.Gekko doesn't reappear for another 30 minutes when he gives a grand opening speech at his alma mater to promote his new book. Greed is legal and everyone is doing it, that's Gekko's message. He lets us know it's not solely the banks' fault, nor is it entirely the government's fault. It is the consumer who helped put us into this dismal recession. Wait, so is greed bad? It's starting to sound that way.The story turns back to Jake. After Louis passes on, Jake is distraught and wants vengeance. He blames Bretton James (played by Josh Brolin) for pushing his mentor out of business. He also wants to bring Gordon and Winnie closer together. He devises a plan to take a good chunk of money from Bretton while simultaneously trading information with Gekko about both Bretton and Winnie. The plot does mirror Bud Fox's (played by Charlie Sheen) ambition in the first film. Both characters have the willingness to deceive those around them in order to succeed and also to gain Gekko's respect.Stone has changed the pace of the film from the original. In "Wall Street," the scenes of trading and the under-handed behaviors were intense and fast. There was the moment of Fox and Gekko bartering over stock on the phone that just jumped off the screen with tension and energy. It had the same feel and excitement of action shots from an "Indiana Jones" film.In "Money Never Sleeps," Stone takes his time and uses long brush strokes to paint his modern pictures of high society. We are no longer wearing power ties and eating steak tartar for lunch (by the way lunch is for wimps). We are going green and eating less red meat. Stone understood the dynamic shift in the culture on Wall Street and captured that change on film.I am not a financial guy; I know very little about Bulls and Bears. The great thing about Stone and the reliable cast is that they model for the audience the changes in the market. If you are still lost after the visual aids, you can follow the actors' reactions to the events. We comprehend the tension in the room in a scene where the leaders of the top investment firms are sitting around an enormous oak table inside a boardroom arguing about selling off a company. The ardent back and forth at the table set the mood that things were not going improve for the economy.The story continues with several double cross events and even some heartfelt moments that we didn't see much of in the first film. The film does its job of being a sequel. It tells us what happens to the main characters (including a fun cameo by Charlie Sheen) and shows us more than one dimension of Gekko's "Winner Takes All" attitude.Should you see this movie? If you need closure on Gekko's corporate odyssey, then yes, go see it. If you want a snapshot of how we got into this economic mess two years ago, then go ahead and see it.However, I am disappointed in the title of the film. It's a powerful, attractive title. I went in thinking it was going to be a film about money, power and greed, but it is a film about human relationships and redemption.Beware of the ending; it's un-Gekko-like and even un-Stone-like. The message was that love is more powerful than money. Maybe the hippies were right. Maybe all we need is love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It diminishes it's excellent predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mentioned before that director Oliver Stone seriously thought about retiring after Natural Born Killers. That movie took so much out of him (and I think the previous JFK did also in the aftermath of that film), that he said: "I don't think I have another one in me". At that time I thought he was crazy. But looking back at what he has made since NBK. Maybe not? Stone's new film has 3 maybe 4 good scenes and all of them were in the trailer. The scenes of the release of Gekko are well done and set up for a nice premise. But it all just falls apart. Or it really never gets going. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps fits perfectly in the new Oliver Stone trend. Before 1994, his films were raw, edgy and a little rebellious. World Trade Center, W. and Wall Street 2 all have the appearance of politically engaging or hard-hitting films. But they are not. Tame would be an understatement. Pleasing would be better. Oliver Stone has lost his will to fight. He's got bills (probably a big house, swimming pool, alimony and stuff). He just wants a job and please the studio and the audience. It almost looks like he doesn't want much hassle with his films after they come out.Wall Street 2 is such a disappointment I don't know where to start. Maybe the biggest let down was in the smallest amount of celluloid: the cameo of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox. His character Fox was a character we could relate to. Especially in his scene with his father Martin Sheen. But his cameo was so wrong, so out of place, so not Bud Fox, it diminishes the entire first movie. Bud Fox is now Charlie from Two and a Half Man.Let me go on with the characters: The successor of Bud Fox is now Jake Moore, a kid who doesn't blink when he gets a 1.5 million dollar bonus. Off course, in the banking industry this is normal. So, it is authentic that Jake doesn't flinch. His girlfriend has an Iphone, does something with a website but other then that they really don't have to work for a living seeing the house they live in. Live really has no challenges left for these two. So maybe that why Jake has such a hard on for his 'Green Project'. But I'm just guessing here. Bud Fox wanted to be filthy rich, he wanted to be a player. Jake Moore doesn't want anything. And we should watch for him for 2 somewhat hours? Josh Brolin, the actor with the single most dangerous look in Hollywood, comes off as such a whiny boy. You do not believe he is the successor of Gordon Gekko. One or two times Shia LaBoeuf's character Jake Moore went head to head with Brolin and I couldn't help but think: "This is so unbelievable. Brolin's character should clock this spoiled brat right on the nose". If anyone can tell me what value or what message I should take from the motorcycle-scene: you can e-mail me.Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps misses edge, a believable script and ditto characters. It is a missed opportunity at best, and a total failure if I am really honest. It demises it's classic predecessor, has a weak script where the cutthroat mentality in the banking industry is played out in such a cliché manner. Josh Brolin is grossly underused. Shia LaBoeuf is overplayed, because he's not that great an actor. Not as a serious adult anyway. But that's Stone's fault. Charlie Sheen isn't a great actor, but 20 years ago Stone could direct him in a way that made him believable. That Oliver Stone is no more, as you can see with the awful cameo of Sheen. The problem for this sequel is that it totally diminishes the first film. It takes all the good things from the first film and throws it out. What's left is chewed up, spit out and rehashed. Money never sleeps, but the audience does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful opportunity wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Stone was filming a sequel to Wall Street, and that the subject matter would be based around the collapse of Lehmans and Bear Stearns, I was very excited indeed. What an excellent opportunity for a tense, clever financial melodrama, just like the original. Unfortunately, Stone sold out. He instead decided to provide a back story around the daughter that Gekko left behind, and that a human interest tale would be sufficient. I was shocked when Gekko wept for his past crimes. He came across as a wimp. This was not the way it should have been. Gekko should instead have come out of jail all guns blazing, behaving the same way that he did before he went in, and then come a cropper as a result of the financial collapse. I am also appalled at the casting of Shia LaBeouf as a top stockbroker. He doesn't act convincingly at all. Josh Brolin has great screen presence but he is cast in the role of a villain, with no decent lines or material to get his teeth into. We don't get to see any shadowy business dealings that would give flesh to the premise that he is one of the bad guys. Instead a very weak plot line has Frank Langella play a mentor of the LaBeouf character, who is betrayed by Brolin and commits suicide. This becomes the basis for LaBeouf's revenge. The revenge when it happens is not great. LaBeouf rats Brolin out to the authorities for insider trading. Hardly The Sting. Also when Gekko finally betrays his daughter, it doesn't convince either.The ending was disappointing, with it's Waltons sucrose sentimentality. This shoddy sequel makes it hard to watch the original Wall Street now without a bad taste in the mouth. One of the most objectionable scenes was the appearance of Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, the playboy, with a model on either arm, boasting about how much money he made when he sold Bluestar airlines, and completely betraying the important life lessons he had discovered by the end of the original film. Thanks for taking a wrecking ball to my memories of your original Oscar winning film, Oliver. Please don't do any more sequels, or further destroy your CV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If pushed, I'll give it a three/ten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels rarely come out of a comparison looking good - and this one's no exception. The original Wall Street was a classic on several planes, but "Never Sleeps" just isn't.Douglas, as usual, gives a strong and perceptive performance: he is backed up by the rest of the cast. The acting throughout is good.So are the camera-work, the lighting, the sets and the locations.The problem is in the direction: at 133 minutes this film doesn't have the meat to fill the time out. Twenty minutes could be cut and there would be little effect on the storytelling, there's so little of it. Visual metaphors come in chunks and, yes - we *do* get them. It's just that they don't advance the action: it's almost as if we've suddenly turned up at a powerpoint presentation.And what on earth possessed Stone to spend so much time on aerial shots of the city? This isn't a travelogue, for God's sake. And exactly why is a slightly competitive motorbike ride brought into it? Because a couple of bikes happened to be available and the trees were turning? This is year 12 film club stuff, Oliver.I gave this movie four out of ten, but, thinking about it i have come back to edit my review to a three. I'd better stay clear of IMDb or we could end up with one.....The general feeling of drift was, for me, not exactly helped by a pretty ordinary soundtrack. Some of the dialogue is indistinguishable from the background track and, at times, the score is also a hindrance rather than a necessary part of the experience.I have had to walk out of several films this last year: there are so few movies being made that justify anything like the moolah being spent on them. I stayed to the bitter end of "Never Sleeps" and will give it a generous four - but it won't be on my DVD Christmas list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sterile film making at its worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course i did not watch this hoping for a retread of the original. What would be the point of that? But all you are left with after watching this is two hours and thirteen minutes of further evidence for the terminal decline of Oliver Stones career. The current banking/financial crisis forms the backdrop for Money Never Sleeps but is barely explored. The story is lumbered with relationship issues centred around Gekko's daughter which only serve to slow the film down and dissipate what little interest the movie generates. Josh Brolin is served up as the villain but when the only victims of the villain shown on screen are fellow members of the financial services industry this hardly generates much in the way of sympathy. Stone also adds into the mix the 21st century tee shirts of political correctness and environmental issues. Yawn. As all the leading actors are horribly miscast contributing bland performances it's left to Michael Douglas to save the day. Alas an older and wiser Gekko is not what i particularly wanted to see and although he pulls off a sly trick three quarters of the way through Stone bottles it with the redemptive ending. So in comparison, the original Wall Street was an engrossing rags to riches to rags morality play with characters you cared for including an unintentional anti hero. Money never sleeps is a corporate, empty, superficial snooze fest from a once great, but no longer, director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After spending a while not watching "Hollywood" film and wandering into foreign, animated.. all sorts I was actually looking forward to seeing a good old glossy, high budget, ranging Hollywood offering complete with expensively shot skylines (obligatory), oak desks (necessary for most involving offices of power) and currently loved actors mixing with some old stalwarts.. and I was not disappointed in any of those respects... except the actual film part.. I cannot comprehend how anyone can view this film as anything except completely awful. It is thin on characterisation, scrambling about in 12 year old Power Ranger style films for plot ideas and wholly bereft of any sense that I was watching something aimed above that age group. The parts where Lou commits suicide and all is made well by the agreed marriage is almost as puerile as the part where the separated couple are reunited implausibly by the man credited with jointly ruining their lives. The end credits are laughable and the pastiche of 80's "feel good" romantic comedies is almost perfect.. although I am pretty sure unintended. Michael Douglas must have wished he could turn back time and leave Gordon in jail, at least there he was safe from making a complete ass of himself. Please Mr Stone, please no more, put the camera down, step away from the camera .. please. Can't see myself braving a Hollywood film for a while..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call me Gekko.. Gordon Gekko!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Stone's 1987 film "Wall Street" had taken it's viewers into an exotic world. 23 years later, Oliver Stone returns with it's sequel. Apparently this is the first ever sequel Stone has directed. First movie was a huge hit as came at time when financial news was just a news for everybody and suddenly there was this movie on banking that looked like thriller. This time there's nothing exotic about it anymore. Its based on the nightly news on unemployment corporate downsizing.But, it is that rare sequel that took its time-23 years and not only it advances its story but also has something new to say. Stone and his sawy writers Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff, have crafted a tale that takes advantage of viewers' newfound knowledge and cynicism. Stone has cast his movie well with Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin and Carey Mulligan to attract younger viewers, and Michael Douglas' return as Gekko can't help being a major lure.The story settles quickly on young proprietary trader Jake Moore (LaBeouf), who just happens to be in love with Winnie Gekko (Mulligan), Gordon's estranged daughter. Despite Gekko's attempts to warn Wall Street of the economic downturn and stock market crash no one takes him seriously because of his early crimes. Then Gekko tries to rebuild his relationship with his daughter who always accused him for her brother's suicide. In the mean while, global economy is on the verge of disaster, Jake, a young Wall Street trader joins hands with Gekko on a two tier mission.Can you win two Oscars playing the same role? An actor rarely gets the opportunity to revive a breakthrough role in a way that allows him to rethink the character and to reflect on where fatal flaws once lay. Douglas does this brilliantly. LaBeouf is top notch. He nicely balances his character's idealism and shrewdness. Mulligan and Brolin deliver strong supporting roles with attention-grabbing characters.Stone has tried a different way of direction this time. His camera work can be either praised in a great manner or people might be turned off. Either ways, no one can ignore the class he has put in the movie. As stated earlier, camera work is glittering and glossy. Background score is scintillating.To conclude, I would just say that go for it to experience Gordon Gekko after 23 years and of course the class of Stone in a movie on finance, thrill and banking and the brilliant camera-work!My Rating: 8/10Thanks &amp; Regards</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNINGI'm afraid I have to add my voice to the others who have made negative comments on this film. I finally got to see it on HBO and just barely got through it. An absolutely dreadful sequel.The story should have picked up where the first left off. I actually felt sorry for Bud Fox at the end as he walked into prison. Now I find out that everything just went swimmingly and he's now a multi millionaire after selling the airline that was so much a focus of the original story. A huge insult to all of us and an embarrassment to Charlie Sheen, as if he needed another one, in a cameo that had no point other than to wreck the character from the first Wall Street.Don't like any of the actors here. Really miss Martin Sheen who always adds something in whatever he is in. Have no interest in the main characters this time around and I agree that Michael Douglas looks as if he can't stay awake and I don't blame him.Sequels are virtually never any good. Once you catch lightning in a bottle, you don't go out and stand in a field in a rainstorm hoping you can do it again without getting electrocuted. Oliver Stone did himself and his reputation nothing but harm in this pointless, witless and uninteresting tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring and very disappointing. I expected much more with such a talented cast and director. For me, this film fails in just about every respect and has absolutely none of the excitement and drama of the original Wall Street. I thought the plot was dull and plodding and the film staggered to a predictable conclusion. Michael Douglas didn't do his best work in the movie and that could partly be because he was feeling the effects of the cancer he is battling so he has a good excuse... but what's Oliver Stone's excuse for directing what, in my opinion, is at best a B movie? On the plus side the scenery and New York setting did add what little charm this film had. Too bad the script was formulaic and not worthy of the talent that produced and directed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curse of the Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who loves the first "Wall Street" for anything other than 'greed is good' quote, will not like the sequel. No memorable quotes or anything really compelling. The original "Wall Street" had so many elements that could be used for a sequel, plus the recent meltdown of the financial markets, this was a GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY to make the sequel. Instead what you have is a movie that tries to be something to everyone. The dialog by Aaron Sorkin is excellent, but the movie is flat, shallow and not engaging at all.Let's start with the obvious - a central character in the new movie is the daughter of the villain Gordon Gekko, but she didn't exist in the original. Gekko had a son, Rudy, who is discussed but he's now dead. He's discussed briefly and then, oh well! The daughter is a blogger, with a liberal blog and her boyfriend/fiancé is a trader. Yawn. The actor, Shia Lebouf, to me is not a great actor or interesting to watch.Gekko is older and wiser and the scene of him getting out of jail is the best part of the movie. Now he's older and wiser and time is more important than money. He writes a book in prison and goes around speaking about the over-hyped markets and how it is all going to come crashing down. No one will listen and that part of the story line isn't really fleshed out. Too bad.The movie tried to include elements of the world we live in, concern over energy for the future and investing in 'green' technology; the real estate bubble. Individual characters are also used to represent current events and ideologies, for example: Shia Lebouf is big on environmental companies and money isn't that important to him; Carey Mulligan (Gekko's daughter) is a 'modern woman' who also writes a liberal blog - the new 'Wall Street Chronicle' used to manipulate the market.Susan Sarandon as Shia Lebouf's real estate investing mother. Over leveraged when the market starts to crack, but she USED to be a nurse! Selfish, narcissistic, she is the new greed. Why be a nurse when you can flip houses for more money? Hey, nurses make real good money AND help people, that's why.The NEW villain, Josh Brolin is no Gordon Gekko. Instead he is BP Oil, Goldman Sachs, and George W. Bush. The scenes with him and Shia are a yawn.The NEW hero/mentor/older wiser guy with good values is Frank Langella. He represents Lehmann Brothers and the 'old way' things were done on Wall Street. 'Old' meaning the previous movie.There is too much time spent trying to tie the first movie into the second because two of the three main characters weren't even BORN when it was made! To add insult to injury is the cameo of Charlie Sheen. Basically you get Charlie Harper instead of Bud Fox.</fullReview>

No, I thought come on Oliver won't do that to Gecko. And he did. For 2 long hours he killed a ruthless man you loved to hate. He made him into a despicable douche. Oh and for fun, he tossed in some horrid love story about as sexy as my grandma's tales of romance. Thanks Oliver.My wife and I worked on Wall Street and the original was a good jab at a situation people could understand. This movie made even myself confused at "subprime" and "CDS's" and what they really had to do with the movie? Gordan then opened a Hedge fund in London?

		<shortDescription>One Of The More Meaningless Sequels I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Wall Street was OK. It didn't blow me away, but I thought it was OK. But "OK" movies really don't need or deserve a sequel, and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps proves that rather well. To me it seemed little more than an opportunity for folks like Oliver Stone to cash in on the financial collapse of 2008. I can almost see all those responsible for this sitting around a table and saying "Hey! The market collapsed! What a great chance to bring back Gordon Gekko!" So they did. But it didn't work.A big chunk of this seemed more like a soap opera than anything else, as Jake (Shia LaBeouf) tries to reconcile his fiancé Winnie (Carey Mulligan) with her dad - none other than Gordon Gekko himself, once more played by Michael Douglas. Gekko is just released from prison as this opens, having served time for insider training, and his relationships with everyone - including Winnie - are destroyed. Now, in Winnie's case, that's not surprising since I don't remember Winnie from the first movie. What sort of relationship did they have to begin with? But that aside, I didn't really care if they reconciled. It didn't matter to me. I didn't care much for the reflections on the market and for all the "insider" stuff. I just really didn't care much for this movie. I know the markets collapsed in 2008. I lost money because of it too. I really didn't need a movie to remind me! (2/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here are a list of things I disliked about the movie: 1- the use of amateur cut-aways: e.g. in the scene where Jake is describing the Fusion project to the Chinese...all those cutaways of the sea and illustrations were too cheesy for that kind of movie; 2- Irrelevant scenes: e.g. what was the point of the scene between Charlie Sheen's character and Gordon???; 3- The Fusion professor: it seems this part of the movie was just there to make the reconciliation between father and daughter at the end of the movie, work??; 4- The Ending(s): It seems the director and writers had at least five different options for an ending...and they went with ALL of them...by the 3rd ending I was like "end already"! The movie should have been more serious and focused on the recession and the dark side of Wall Street, and less of the gimmicky side stories and cutaways. They lost focus of the relationship between Jake and Loius and simply didn't use the 'revenge' angle well.This could have been a strong movie..unfortunately it gets 4/10 from me</fullReview>

The film is testament to a case of extremely poor casting, bad writing and the most embarrassing cameo in the history of film (Bud Sheen). A movie that self destructs on an impact it never makes; it should never have been made solely on the basis of a hand full of silly human- interest plot devices.

		<shortDescription>Another Part Two That Doesn't Live Up to The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing what Oliver Stone &amp; the ensemble he got together could do with an updated version of an even greedier Wall Street that was gambling with obscene amounts of money &amp; making their own rules that the S.E.C. didn't do anything about or even try to understand it seems.I was very disappointed. This follow up didn't fare well against the original...which is almost always the case. But with Stone directing again &amp; Douglas in again...I thought this may have a chance. Some part 2's are just laughable...I guess they make money or they would stop doing them. The big exception of course was "The Godfather part 2".Anyway - this movie just didn't have the snap, crackle &amp; pop of the original. And I think the movie spent way too much time on the Jake &amp; Winnie relationship played by Shia LaBeouf (wasn't that Glenn Campbell's name in the original "True Grit", well....maybe it was LaBeef) &amp; Carey Mulligan. By the way...very sad about Campbell's Alzheimers admission.When I saw this movie I knew that LaBeouf had been in a lot of Hollywood movies &amp; must have been well thought of....but it was the 1st movie I had seen him in. I thought he did OK with the part he was given. But Mulligan was such an annoying character as Winnie....or was it Whiney? Every time she was in a scene it was like fingernails on a blackboard. Did anybody else feel that way about Mulligan's performance? And as others have said...the ending was just not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected sequel that is unexpectedly bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely is such a great film like Wall Street followed up with such a craptastic squeal. I'm not real sure what Oliver Stone was thinking, other than he wanted to make some dough at the expense of the public, not unlike the majority of the characters in the film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps does everything it can to paint Wall Street as a collection of evil, soulless tyrants that were solely responsible for the recent economic downturn.The biggest problem with the film, and there are a lot of problems mind you, is that there are no less than four distinct story lines that are inelegantly and, at times, ham-fistedly mashed together to form a disjointed central narrative. One story follows Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglass), the central (and most interesting) character from the previous Wall Street, as he gets out of prison and tries to put his life back together. A second story follows the young hotshot Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf) and his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) through the financial meltdown. The third story is that of Winnie Gecko (Carey Mulligan) and her fiancée Jake Moore and their personal life and how Gordon Gecko's release from prison affects it. A fourth story follows Jake Moore as he begins working for his mentor's longtime rival Bretton James (Josh Brolin) in the cutthroat world of alternative energy acquisition and development. These plot lines are so ineptly woven together that it is possible to make four completely independent short films out of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Additionally, because of this plot diffusion, none of the story lines have any kind of emotional appeal or resonance with the audience, there just isn't enough there to latch on to. The movie also reaches a logical climax and ending almost 30 minutes before the film's actual end, and then reaches another, then another, eventually leading the audience to wish for an actual end to the film and completely destroying any sense of satisfaction or closure that might have been achieved by tying off the film sooner.The story is fractured, the message trite and unimaginative, the camera-work is at times questionable, and Gordon Gecko is a mere shadow of the Academy Award winning character from the original. Sometimes it is best to sit on one's laurels and not attempt to relive the glory days of yesteryear. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should never have been made and will hopefully be quickly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of a great opportunity for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it 2 but sort of feel bad about it because at least Stone did make a sequel, but somehow I don't think his heart was in it.I watched it last night on DVD for the second time; the first time I was totally confused by it, but thought I'd give it another go.But it truly is a confusing, meandering film with a plot, dialogue and character motivation that is just so hard to follow (even if you could be bothered to care enough).The original Wall Street was a truly great movie where the storyline, financial background and motivations worked so well. Even then, some of the financial jargon lost me, even though I am an MBA and have worked in finance. In this film, it just sounds like so much nonsense, and I find it hard to believe there were any real advisors from the markets on it.And what a waste. 2008 was the greatest time to set the sequel in, even better than the pre-87 crash days of the first one. Then, even taxi drivers had share tips (and in the film even high-priced hookers were in the market), so it was obvious something had to crash and burn, but everyone was trapped by greed and the idea they might miss out. On the day of the 87 Crash, I was lucky I was holding no shares. I had been trading on account with money I didn't really have but had still been making a profit. That's how real Wall Street was for me.Then along comes 2008 and people are not just buying shares when they know nothing about it, they are buying houses they can't afford. The film unsuccessfully deals with this by shots of Jake with his realtor mom, but she is trading in high value NY houses, not cardboard boxes in Detroit. But the film doesn't reflect this properly, being obscured by an irrelevant love affair with a weepy wimpy girlfriend who is Gekko's daughter.The only good spots (possible spoiler) are Gekko's return to the confident old Gekko later in the film in London, however improbable the rise in his fortunes so quickly, and the return of the original realtor who sold Bud Fox his overpriced Manhattan apartment (which of course he sold at a loss, but which would be worth ten times what he paid for it now - middle class people in NYC are now living in Brooklyn, Manhattan is so expensive). I'd like to have seen more of her, and it was a pity they didn't use her instead of Jake's mom for the real estate collapse story. Oh, and the mobile phone scene when Gekko gets out of prison. it was that clip that made me think this would be a good, clever film.Totally didn't understand the Graydon Carter thing, and the Bud Fox cameo could have been so much better and would have been better much earlier in the film. Indeed, why didn't they use him as a main character.And as for Eli Wallach. Oh man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing sequel to the best finance movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the reasons why the original "Wall Street" was IMHO the best finance movie ever was that it was plausible. As I worked on dealing floors at various times for Barclays, Citigroup, UBS, HSBC and Nomura, this matters to me.Ambitious salesman (Fox) gets attention of big shot trader (Gekko) and becomes loyal sidekick. Well, of course: Gekko wants someone to do his dirty work for him. Who better than a young man blinded by ambition? Plan eventually backfires when Gekko tries corporate raid on Fox's father's company as Fox, suddenly gaining a conscience, reports him to the authorities, even though he is likely to go to jail himself as well. Simple plot, really, but works well, especially as the technical details are right.Now ... fast-forward to the 2010 sequel. Profitable young energy trader (Jake) at Keller Zabel (based probably on Lehman Brothers), gets a bonus of $1.45 million. Quite plausible. Not plausible, though, is that it is given to him in the form of a cheque by the company chairman Lou Zabel - a bonus that large would be paid in stock, and in instalments. Also, junior traders do not get to talk to the chairman - there is a management hierarchy to respect, and Jake's line manager would have reason to be angry if he/she was bypassed like this. A bear raid by Churchill Schwartz (based on Goldman Sachs) sends the Keller Zabel stock plummeting, and Lou Zabel commits suicide (in reality, of course, no Wall Street bosses had the honour/decency to do this). With the help of Gordon Gekko, Jake discovers that Bretton James, CEO of Churchill Schwartz not only led the bear raid on Keller Zabel, but did so also on his personal account. Jake is determined to get even and starts false rumours about one of Churchill Schwartz's interests. Stop right there: if Jake is this petty and vindictive then he is not a good trader. If you allow the machinations of the marketplace to get to you personally then you should not be in it. Short selling is a risky strategy, and you would do it because you think you might make money, not because you are out to get someone. Also, if you start false rumours, that is market manipulation, which at the very least, if found out, will cost you your license. In the movie, though, instead of losing his trading license as he should, word gets to Bretton James, who respects Jake's audacity and offers him a job at Churchill Schwartz. This absolutely does not happen - the situation is not like Gekko hiring Bud Fox the original. Apart from anything else, Wall Street CEOs simply do not talk to junior traders, and in any case the Churchill Schwartz CEO is in a very different position to Gekko in the original movie - he would have appearances to maintain. Also, starting a false rumour is not exactly Einstein-like in its brilliance. Why would James take an interest in him?So as far as authenticity goes, I do not rate this highly, and certainly nothing like the original. Really, it comes down to whether you like the non-finance parts. These were good drama, I think, but certainly not the reason I went to see the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS Oliver Stone delivers one of the top Rotten Tomato movies of the year. There is so little story to tell throughout this 134 minute endless mess of a film that the viewers must resort to just ignoring the fact that we are being drowned in WallStreetSpeak and settle instead for watching the skills of such fine actors as Michael Douglas, Carey Mulligan, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon (for a brief moment), Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella (one wonders why they ever signed on to this film if they read the script). Perhaps it is the current economic climate that makes it difficult to find any humor or concern for these characters crippled by the recession: there are no redeeming outcomes form the crash that would suggest that anyone involved with Big Money learned a thing form the government bailout of Wall Street. But watching the prison release of Gordon Gekko (Douglas) and discovering that his angry, unforgiving daughter Winnie (Mulligan) has taken up with a bright lad Jake (LaBeouf) who in many ways is like the father she loathes, then in a smarmy manner climbing back into the money game only to destroy any seed of conscience that might have grown from his incarceration and in doing so drive a wedge between Winnie and Jake is hardly the stuff of which memorable movies are made. Oliver Stone drowns us in noise and despicable malicious characters and in the end beats the audience to death with his excesses in every aspect of this film. It is a waste of talent for the cast.

		<fullReview>This is a "message" movie that offers contradictory messages. On the one hand, it wants to make the anti-capitalist message that Wall Street is inhabited by slime-balls who are able to do what they do because we're all materialist pigs. It wants to say that "the system" fosters unscrupulous behavior that benefits its perpetrators. On the other hand, its desire to fulfill the requirements of a "Hollywood film" - SPOILERS COMING - happy ending, justice served, true love wins out ... torpedoes messages about capitalist corruption, because as it turns out, one guy is REALLY bad, and gets punished, as if all Wall Street crises are just the fault of a personal vendetta by a bad apple. On top of that, the dastardly deceptions of both Gekko (who steals from his own daughter) and Moore (who sneaks around with Gekko behind her back) are wall-papered over in the end with "one big happy family," a grandson, and a party of apparently filthy rich people who were among the Wall Street elite in the beginning, pushing bad investments, yet somehow are rich again. This movie is at war with itself and only interesting to watch from the standpoint of wondering "Is it really going to end the way it looks like it's going to, with a corny Hollywood feel-good resolution?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole lot of nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't go as far to say that a Wall Street sequel was "long overdue" but it was more or less necessary due to the open ending of the first film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps takes place more than twenty years after the events of the first film. Gordon Gekko is now getting out of prison after serving an eight year term for trading insider information. He meets a young Wall Street broker named Jake Moore, who is also his future son-in-law. He sees Jake's ambition and decides to aid him in his climbing of the Wall Street ladder. But, as would be expected from the sly Mr. Gekko, he has other intentions and we see almost a repeat of the first film, just set in the future coinciding with the 2008 stock market crash. It seems unoriginal but I think the only reason it works is because it is a fairly intriguing alternate reality take on an event we all witnessed.This film starts out promising enough. Seeing Michael Douglas reprising his role as the infamous Gordon Gekkos is pleasing and putting his character in these modern times is interesting, as he is now no longer a huge name on Wall Street, and there are now crooks way more greedy than he ever was. The introduction of all the new characters is also interesting. Shia LaBeouf plays his eager young Wall Street fast talker role fairly well, not as well as Charlie Sheen from the original, but it's not bad. Carey Mulligan is as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Winnie Gekko, Gordon's daughter. Frank Langella even has a brief role as an older stock broker who doesn't have anything left to live for after the crash. However, great performances can only take a film so far.What Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps suffers from the most is just being really boring. It starts out so interesting and promising, but as the plot develops it eventually stops going anywhere and flat lines. This film doesn't help out the non-stock broker types like the original did. You have to know the lingo and you have to understand how Wall Street works and you need a lot of back story on the 2008 financial crash. I myself understand these things to a certain degree, but this film just moves too fast and doesn't let you keep up with the lingo and the fast talking. And so once you get behind you're behind for the whole film. I understood enough to follow the gist of the plot, but I also think that it is just too dull of a plot to really be that enticing whether you understand it or not. For a film that is over two hours long, it really goes nowhere after a certain point.This isn't a terrible film, but it just doesn't really amount to much. There are some good things about it, like all the performances as well as Oliver Stone's direction. He pulls off some slick editing that gives the film a more technologically hip feel to it. If the film had kept with this same pace from start to finish it probably would have been a lot better. But when you boil it down there isn't much to see here and your mind moves right along as soon as the credits role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a hundred years schoolchildren and college students may watch this film as an insight into this era. Pity them. It is like one of those historical TV mini series where everyone talks indirectly about what is going on in the world at the time: "I say Mr Jones, what do you make of the new German chancellor, Mr Hitler?" Oh, dear. In Money Never Sleeps all the important parts of the financial crash are ticked off: real estate speculation and bubble, yes; CDS risk, yes; moral turpitude, yes; cameo of old buddies in movie, yes. The result is an abstract and generalized account of the period. It may work if Tolstoy wrote it but in a movie it's too complex. The original Wall St worked because of simple architecture: ambition and it's consequences. Simple, human, dramatic.Money Never Sleeps also suffers from having Gordon Gekko turned into a walking ethical aphorism generator. He is not a human, not the real Gordon, he just spews his wisdom to anyone. And worst of all, its instantly forgettable. And the Jake Moore character is not interesting and appears barely capable of understanding the business.The financial journalism around this event, and on-going problems, is much, much better than anything in a movie; and certainly what is offered in this movie.</fullReview>

There were so many dramatic moments ruined in this film by pushing in a song and turning it up LOUDER AND LOUDER, to try to make up for a dramatic moment that was lost by using a song. Dramatic underscore that's written by a real film composer is what makes the music work in a film. Stuffing songs into it is nothing more than the production company trying to make money selling a soundtrack album that has no real relationship to the film. You might notice on soundtracks they include songs that weren't even in the film! Ever since David Chase ruined The Sopranos with poorly placed songs people have come to accept this as what they should do. Get back to the basics of music scoring.The plot was truly horrible. So many disjointed ideas that didn't come together to form any sort of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough Gecko, Not Enough Wall Street.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was written by someone who has no idea how the stock market really is. The script and screenplay was amateurish. It had a made-for-TV movie aura about it that i couldn't shake off. I expected a lot more from Oliver Stone and was surprised to see so many scenes that should have been edited out because they just didn't make much sense (ex: Gecko standing up in the restaurant to shake the businessman's hand + the shots of the black passengers on the subway).The one that could have saved this movie was if we saw more of Gordon Gecko, the true reason why the original Wall Street is a classic. We saw him here and there but only a few glimpses of how we remakes his fortune during the market collapse. No twist at the end nor big drama with Gecko.So much potential with such a great cast...It was the perfect time and opportunity to showcase the wall street meltdown in a mainstream movie but many people dropped by the ball and delivered something truly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never SleepsThe reason money doesn't sleep, like the rest of us, is because it's too busy counting itself.And while the greedy investor in this financial drama slept in prison, he likely did so on his back.After doing 8 years for insider trading, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) finds himself released into a world where his former motto "Greed is Good" has proliferated into the markets' mantra ? which explains why it's teetering on collapse.Meanwhile, Jake (Shia LaBeouf), a young trader, wants Gekko's help to solve his mentor's (Frank Langella) murder. As well, he hopes to marry Gordon's estranged, indignant daughter (Carey Mulligan).While it does sound intriguing to have Douglas reprise the miserly role he made famous in 1987 and place said character in the current financial crisis, Money Never Sleeps, unfortunately, is a serious snore.Furthermore, money does sleep?when it's nestled between a woman's garter belt and inner thigh.

		<shortDescription>Wall Street 2 Is A Dull Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a crackerjack start showing Gordon Gekko checking out of prison, the title credit rolls and Wall Street 2 falls into a rut it never gets out of. As the cast moves from one glossy set to another, all very well photographed as if for the Discovery Channel, I was waiting for action.In Wall Street 2, there is no real action, just talking heads as the actors recite lines from a script with no originality and no humor. Everything is glossy, no exterior scenes at night showing piled garbage in downtown Manhattan, to be picked up later, serving as the smorgasbord for hungry rats. No scenes showing cars getting ticketed and drivers stuck in midtown Manhattan traffic. A movie set in a sanitized Manhattan, where the only minorities you see are the Chinese potential investors at a conference where Shia LaBeouf's character saves the day with his knowledge of a company out to generate fusion energy using multiple lasers to convert seawater to clean energy (Note: I am a big backer of cold fusion).In this movie about Wall Street, everyone is a Boy Scout, there is no smoking that I recall and no drug use of any kind, not even people taking prescribed anti-depressants. This movie shows Wall Street as accurately as the TV soap opera General Hospital shows the workings inside a hospital. In other words, Wall Street 2 is a complete sham populated by very good looking people who never find themselves in a dark corner, really worried, in trouble with no escape route. There is one scene in LaBeouf's company where you see a chubby office worker walking by LaBeouf, the guy carrying a cardboard box with his personal possessions. Does the guy make a comment about how rotten things are, laid off with thousands of other co-workers? Of course not. That is stuff that happens in the real world, a world the movie's scriptwriters are incapable of presenting due to incompetence or possibly excessive drug use.Try as he might, Michael Douglas cannot do much with his role as a waffling Gordon Gekko. Someone should have told director Oliver Stone that when he says "Action," there should be some interesting action. Watching the character Winnie Gekko spend most of the movie moping does not qualify as action in my playbook. To end my comments on a positive note, Wall Street 2 does have one redeeming quality: in a down economy hitting Hollywood studio movies particularly hard, this sequel provided jobs to a lot of actors and craft people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Never Sleeps but the Audience Did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous reviewer stated: "... if you liked the first Wall Street it probably won't disappoint you." Au contraire. Fans of the first film will be very disappointed basically because, unlike the original, "Wall Street--Money Never Sleeps" fails to engage the audience on any level. If you weren't a trader and didn't fully understand the story line of the first film, you at least were drawn into the drama by Sheen's and Douglas' fine portrayals of good and evil. In the updated version, it is a whole new world, both economically and technologically, so the story is more complicated but obtuse. I'm sure more than half the audience walked out of the theater not having a clue what this movie was about. But comparisons aside, the current version is flat beyond belief. The music, the editing, the script all conspire to put the audience to sleep. Shia LaBouef, while a fine actor, was grossly miscast as Jake. He couldn't carry off the ambitious, arrogant young lion, and physically he had no presence. Carey Mulligan's lackluster performance was probably the victim of a lethargic script; let's wait to see more of her before passing judgment. Susan Sarandon manages to rise above the fractured writing and turns in a fine supporting performance as Jake's wheeler-dealer real estate mother forever in need of a handout. Ditto for Frank Langella as Jake's mentor. Plot-wise, Douglas' Gekko keeps saying that prison changed him but he never really says how, nor does his return to his old ways act as testament to his alleged transformation. Furthermore, who out there believes that Winnie would choose to allow her father back in her life? He let her down her whole life and then swindled her out of what was rightfully hers. Yeah, so at the end of the day Gekko makes a donation to the cause Jake and Winnie are so passionate about, but he betrayed her in the process. How can she ever trust him again? Bottom line: if you need a good nap, then go see this film. In addition to boasting some beautiful shots of Manhattan, this movie only serves to demonstrate that everybody is getting up there in years--most notably Douglas, Langella, Eli Wallach, and the ancient Sylvia Miles. Take a real close look at her index finger when she's showing Jake where to sign. It looks like it belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West. The biggest letdown is that this is an Oliver Stone film. We used to get our money's worth when he was at the helm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dull, boring excuse for a movie. I watched it for free from BB express and it wasn't even worth the time... Oliver Stone has reduced himself to trying to take a canned script, throwing in a pop star (Shia LaBeouf) and selling it for a serious movie. This joke of a movie is the pathetic result. Even from a pure entertainment value, the movie was terrible - I've seriously had more entertainment getting my tooth filled at the dentists' office.I'm ashamed to say that once upon a time Oliver Stone was my favorite director/movie-maker. Not any more - he lost any respect with this movie - this movie has NO SOUL. I normally don't take the time to even rant, but I thought I'd save someone else from wasting their time like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies is a steaming turd. I watched this one with my family and not one of us enjoyed the movie, and we were all delighted when it was finally over. The plot is predictable and tired. The visuals of the movie are also extremely cheesy, ooh stock tickers... Edgy.... Continuous 'stock trading' montages to the endless helicopter skyline scenes seem to be the basis on which this movie was written. Their is also a 'social media' montage that made me want to cry. Their are many attempts at symbolism, sad tired played out symbols. My least favorite scene in the movie literally involves a cut of domino's being knocked over. For those involved in the making of this movie, get off your @$$ and try harder, or try at all. If i owned a production company I would fire anyone who tried to release such a poor excuse for a movie. I recommend against anyone seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of the theater on this one. I just could not take it anymore. It was nothing like the first Wall Street. The dialog was boring, just seemed to lack any spark. The acting was like watching the evening news, heads talking but hard to get excited about what they were saying. After awhile to realize you have been listening to heads talking but can't find a storyline anywhere. Kind of like watching a stock ticker, in one ear out the next. I did notice some segments that just copied the original movie but used more modern decor, phones etc. Like when they looked a the house, the meeting with the Asian businessmen. But why simply copy situations that happened in the first movie? This is supposed to be a sequel with something new not a remastering of the original movie with updated decor. This was a no go for me. Just a boring movie all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street: Money bloody wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an awful, awful film. I'm struggling to muster the energy to type about this shower of a production to be honest. From the acting to the production, the wildly misplaced music, everything was wrong with this.Douglas is probably the only half decent actor in the movie but did look like he was ready to keel over at any moment, and who made him smoke in it? Harsh much! LeBeouf spent far too long looking into middle distance, playing the strong, quiet type and the leading lady was god awful, when she cried I thought her chin was having an aneurism! The film doesn't know what it wants to be either, there's a segment which is dark, one which is slapstick, one which is action, but it masters none unfortunately. It was almost as if there were too many cooks in this movie's kitchen.And it took forever to go nowhere! The story was essentially good but could have been told in 20 mins and as they obviously couldn't think of anything to add to it they stretched it out for waaaayyy too long, que long silences looking at one another with teary eyes, so you leave the cinema, more annoyed than entertained.No-one, and I mean no-one in the entire audience upon leaving had a good thing to say about this film, every conversation I overheard was slating it, and in my opinion, rightly so. What a shame as weirdly enough I wanted to like this film.One other observation which has somehow passed by me thus far during his career is that Shia LeBeouf should medically be classed as a working midget - childsjeans.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept thinking that it had to get better, no just boring propaganda where all business guys are rich and bad and liberal reporters can save the planet. Nothing fun or happy about this gloomy tale. The positive about this film is that you want some bad guys to get it and in some way they do. If you believe in conspiracies like secret cheap energy that is suppressed by oil companies, yeah its paraded here. I doubt an engineer was talked to about the script. The love story was very weak, couldn't see any chemistry or point to their relationship. We were rooting for them to break up because they didn't mesh. Bitter movie throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable, not just because of Shia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was unbelievably awful. Never thought it possible that Oliver Stone could make a film that would be across-the-board bad. Even the music, aside from a few of the Eno/Byrne songs, was horrible; and the few "good" songs previously mentioned were used inappropriately over dialogue, etc.Whereas the first film was about morality, truth, the human soul and actual characters, this mess is quite literally about Wall Street and the financial crisis without being humanistic at all. The verbiage is as complicated as the needlessly complex plot (just read the synopsis to get an idea of how foolishly turgid the movie is). There should have been no sequel at all, but if one had to be made, there were a lot more options available with such an indelible and fascinating character as Gordon Gekko. A real shame. Oliver will hopefully come back strong with his next film.The fact that Allan Loeb wrote this and Just Go With It and The Switch and still has a number of other projects in the works confirms and exacerbates my fear about the reality of Hollywood today, the choices that creative executives are making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street - Money Never Sleeps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street Money Never Sleeps can be summed up in one word: revenge. This theme is present throughout the entire film. It starts out with Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who seeks to take revenge upon Keller Zable an investment bank, and in particular Louis Zable (Frank Langella) by refusing to help bail them out of the worst financial crisis the country has scene since the great depression. It ends with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) dishing out a dose of his own revenge to James for sending him to prison.As the film progresses we see other areas of revenge start to surface, such as the case with Gekko's daughter, Winnie, who blames her father and his behavior for the death of her brother who committed suicide. She seeks her revenge by not allowing him in her life, essentially cutting him off from anything that really matters, family. Her fiancé, Jake Moore has a little revenge of his own in mind. He spends a good deal of the film trying to get revenge against Bretton James. He blames James for the ultimate demise of his friend and mentor Louis Zable who also committed suicide.Gordon Gekko has plans of revenge as well; he knows that it was Bretton James who put him behind bars and uses Jake, who unwittingly goes along, to help get that revenge. Everything from Jake's employment at Churchill Schwartz to his relationship with his daughter, Winnie, is leverage to Gekko. His biggest use of this leverage comes as he manipulates Jake into convincing Winnie to sign over the $100 million dollars, that Gekko put in his daughters name in a Swiss bank account before going to prison, to Jake who then releases it to Gekko. Gekko has promised to get it back into the United States without implicating his daughter. The money of course never gets back to the States as Gekko keeps it to amass his fortune.Somewhere during all this revenge seeking, you end up with a little moral clarity. Jake spends time trying to raise money for some alternative energy company that he feels is the next big thing; Jake has to fix the damage he caused between he and Winnie thanks to his soon to be father-in-law; gives his supposed last dime to his mother who is a nurse playing real estate agent, to help her feed her delusions in plummeting real estate market that is spiraling out of control, and goes broke in the process. Gekko who truly has feelings for his daughter and desperately wants a relationship with her, does the best that he can while still serving his own desires.As usual with most films, in the end all is well. Just like in the end of Inglourious Basterds, where Hitler gets his due and revenge is fulfilled, Gekko is back on top bigger than ever, making over $1 billion, gives back the $100 million, Jake and Winnie kiss and make up, Jake's mom finds a job as a nurse again and most important to Gekko, he gets his revenge and sends Britton James to jail. All the while we're left wondering did I really just spend 2 hours and 13 minutes watching this. Certainly not one of Oliver Stones best films, but I guess it could be worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director was sleeping on this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Oliver Stone is immensely talented, but this movie seemed like he was asleep. The first film was executed so brilliantly. Of course, Michael Douglas is brilliant. There is no question about this. Shia is as well. But the directing literally destroys this film. You basically don't know what is going on in the first thirty minutes of the film. Frank Langella is struggling to retain some sort of a company that he has created, but you are not sure exactly which company or what his involvement is. What was great about the original was even a layman (a totally dummy about Wall Street, and who knows nothing about stocks - like myself!) could still follow the story. How easy was it to just follow Shia's story from the beginning. Stay with the damn character and then you have the audience. It is okay to introduce Frank Langella and the other characters, but they have to be through Shia's perspective. Otherwise, you're dead! Basic screen writing in my opinion. And why keep Michael Douglas off the screen and finally introduce him at minute 30-40. Hell, he is your special effect. Use him! Oh well. Good try. At least Oliver Stone had top notch actors. Try to shoot this as an independent with no names and you would be laughed out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money May Never Sleep, But The Viewer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just kidding around with that title. The viewer isn't going to sleep through this because his brain will be all twisted around.The original "Wall Street" was kind of interesting, a perspicuous piece of commercial fluff with a moral in tow. This one -- same director, one of the same big stars -- is dizzyingly confused in its plot lines. The protagonist is Shia LaBeouf, a nervous, slight, ambitious young man who loses his principled mentor -- Frank Langella in a juicy performance -- and seeks out another in the person of Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko, the rich ex con who is still filthy rich.I couldn't make sense of it. Really. The script flings all kinds of high finance shenanigans at us seriatim, unlike the original, which focused on one particular and easily grasped narrative thread: the rise and fall of Bud Fox. This one is all over the map. I didn't understand some of the high-finance stuff, which I suppose is one of the reasons I now live in an abandoned railway car in the desert and squeeze water out of barrel cacti.The direction by Oliver Stone doesn't help. At the most awkward times, he slips into his kaleidoscopic style of editing. A conversation on a subway train -- remarkably clean compared to my memory of them -- is interrupted a couple of times by instant inserts of the train rushing through its tunnel. These roaring distractions shatter the viewers concentration the way an earlier train mangled Langella's old body. The faces of people watching a computer monitor have the monitor's figures superimposed on their features. And, most wrenching of all, there are multiple split screens. And most of this takes place during scenes where we most need an explanation of what's happening.The good news: nice shots of Maria Bartiromo.I watched it for a while before realizing my investment in it was taking a deep plunge and I finally decided to put in a stop loss order at 45 minutes. I'm thinking of reinvesting that time in "Charlie Chan on Broadway." I think I'll be able to understand it, if I don't fall asleep while watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it helpful to watch Wall Street again just to refresh my memory about the character Gekko. The only thing I knew about this film was that Gekko was out of jail and the time frame was during the big melt down.The movie started out with rapid camera movements and lots of noise which bothered me. It also looked like there was going to be a detailed breakdown of the meltdown. I was not going to be interested in two hours of details on the meltdown.I was also a little bothered with the casting and the character Winnie. Winnie was coming across as wimpy and wimpy looking. The character Jake seemed to be miscast also, he did not look macho enough to play a cocky part.What I found however was characters that started to engage me. I found characters that realized that Money never replaces Values. Money never replaces Family. Money never replaces Love. Money never replaces your Word.Someone once told me that a great movie is one you have to watch a second time and you want to watch a third time. There was one scene where they are talking about one's life having a mentor and also being a mentor at some point in your life. There are several scenes including this one I want to see again. Time will tell if I want to watch a third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street (1987) was so good, I felt that it was my duty to book myself a VIP seat for the sequel. However I did go in with the fear that Shia LaBeouf was in it and to me this guy is a joke. He's OK for kid movies like Transformers but Shia in a serious Wall Street movie, that's got to be a mistake! A few minutes into the movie and you get introduced to Shia and Carey Mulligan (Gekko's daughter but you don't know that yet). It's clear that they are a couple and I was then afraid that Oliver Stone was setting the tone of the movie: It won't be like the first one -- more like jello. Seeing Gekko getting out of jail was a quite anticipated moment. I did laugh at the brick-stone mobile phone being handed over to him (even though it was already in the trailer). I have to say Michael Douglas still looks &amp; sounds as good as ever. From then onwards, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief... but that was short lived.I eagerly anticipated a captivating Gekko speech, like in the first movie, but more tied up to 2008 climate. Unfortunately the use of fades and showing Shia's and the audience face ruined this moment for me. It was such a butch job that I could hardly concentrate on what Gekko was saying. As the movie progressed, I got the feeling that I was being rushed through it (most scenes were not concluding well). To that, I can only wonder whether the movie is actually final version.Halfway through I got really bored. The movie is really about a triangle between Shia, the daughter and her dad - nothing to do with Wall Street. There was hardly any portrayal of Shia or Gekko or Bretton of having a high testosterone trader attitude. Actually the movie tried to stay clear from the jargon which made the first Wall Street so memorable. You just hear "moral hazard." Hello? Show us, this is a movie. Even the guys in Boiler Room (2000) payed a homage to Wall Street 1 by doing a little Gekko re-enactment. The sequel didn't even seem keen making another such mark in history (obviously not the same stuff but carefully researched &amp; current trader daily speak material).As for the rest of the cast, it's a major thumb down. Mostly gutless and pale, except for Josh Brolin who totally had the attitude for such a movie. Frank Langella was OK. His suicide scene was pretty shocking. You get to see Charlie Sheen (ah good old Bud Fox) but not for long.When I came back home, I played the original Wall Street and the differences were really obvious. Oliver Stone has softened up over the years. He doesn't know New York as well as he did back in 1987. You hardly see that city life in the sequel. He completely missed out on showcasing the new-era busy &amp; macho trading floor. It looked more like the Transformers NSA analyst floor. The romance and bike race were really cheap distractions. He could have worked a bit more on the financial collapse and rescue deals. Instead, he rushed through it by using graphics that were supposed to wow us. Instead, he uses a cliché gobblin old banker with white side-hair (and god knows how many earlobes) to make a strange pathetic bird sound, and we're supposed to feel a sense of impending doom. Terrible."Money never sleeps?" OK, here's one, "Everything that rise must eventually fall" and this is exactly what Oliver Stone &amp; Shia did to that movie and hopefully themselves. I haven't't gone to a cinema in 6 years and that's what I get when I do.</fullReview>

I had never heard of the lead actor, and I don't expect to again. The tags frequently mention "redemption". I bet Michael Douglas asked for it immediately after the filming. And Eli Wallach, as great as he is, reminded me of his character in Godfather III. It was good to see Charlie Sheen reprise Bud Fox, even if it was a quick cameo. I never thought I would miss Darryl Hannah. My recommendation: don't go to the box office - let your money sleep.The popcorn was good, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zuccotti Park vs. One Percenters in microcosm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't already discovered it, Oliver Stone is a preacher. His movies always boil down to the proverbial 'us vs. them'. Back in 1987, with the release of the first 'Wall Street', there was some ambiguity in Gordon Gekko's famous phrase, "Greed is Good." Although Gekko was a bad guy, there was something charming about him, so one could still feel sorry for the rapacious financier even though he's being sent away to prison. In his later days, Stone's sense of subtlety has waned. While he still holds a great attraction to the world of wealth and privilege (after all, he is a very well off in real life), it would not be politically expedient for Stone to identify himself with the 1% crowd. Thus, the heroes of Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are (in terms of today's nomenclature) the 99 per centers, who completely reject the "greed is good" mantra.'Money Never Sleeps' is set in 2008, the year of the Wall Street financial meltdown. If it were today, Stone might have had Jake, his proprietary trader protagonist, hanging out for a few hours in Zuccotti Park each day. Even though Jake professes his love for the 'green', he'll only invest in progressive companies that promote alternative energy. And his girlfriend, Winnie, who also happens to be Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter, runs a small website designed to expose one percenter shenanigans. Jake's mentor at his firm, Keller Zabel Investments, is Louis Zabel, another "word is my bond" good guy amongst the wolves, who can't take the heat when the firm loses 30% of its value at the beginning of the 2008 crisis. His solution is to jump in front of a subway train after one percenter bad guy Bretton James (Josh Brolin), CEO of Keller Zabel's rival, blocks a bailout for the troubled firm .Enter Gordon Gekko, ex-con, who wants to re-establish a bond with his daughter. He conscripts Jake by making a deal with him: if Jake can help him reconcile with Winnie then he'll provide information that can sink Brett. Jake uses information that causes Brett's' firm to lose $120 million but Brett inexplicably offers Jake a job. Jake's plan is to take revenge on the evil Brett who he holds responsible for his mentor's suicide. There is some hint that although Jake intends to undermine Brett from the beginning he's seduced by the wily CEO after Brett promises to steer a Chinese company toward investing in the fusion energy company Jake's been touting. When the economic crisis affects the firm, Brett plays it safe by promoting bunk solar panels and fossil fuels to the Chinese. Jake throws a fit when all bets are off for his fusion energy company; his 'dark moment of the soul' occurs when he blows his cover by cursing out Brett and getting himself fired.The solution is that Gekko reveals to Jake that he's had $100 million stashed away in a Swiss bank account all along and needs for his daughter to sign the money over to Jake who will in turn hand it over to Gekko who promises to invest it all in the fusion energy company Jake's trying to save. At first, Gekko appears to be returning to form when he disappears with the $100 million and the fusion company appears to be sinking like the Titanic.Jake's revenge plot against Brett turns wimpy when he merely gives Winnie some information that she publishes in her blog, leading to Brett's downfall. If you can believe that the unsubstantiated rumors in a small left-wing newspaper can destroy this powerful CEO, then perhaps I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. Whatever the case, Jake's passing of information to his girlfriend, is hardly the stuff of exciting denouements.The ultimate wimp-out of course is Gekko's decision to join the 99 percenters by returning the $100 million to the now reconciled couple and get to see his grandchild a year later. The good guy crowd wins the day by shouting the new 2008 mantra: 'Greed is bad'. Had 'Money Never Sleeps' been filmed during the time of OWS, Stone would have had Gekko along with Jake, Winnie (and a photo of the deceased Zabel) snuggle up together inside one of the newly minted pup tents in Zuccotti Park.Shia LaBeouf is really perfectly cast to play Jake. The actor who usually plays hotheads (and is a hothead in real life) shows himself to be more comfortable in a place like Zuccotti than inside an investment bank. In 'Money never sleeps', his rebellion takes the form of some wild riding on a motorcycle and well as cuddling with his 'greed is bad' significant other.. Carey Mulligan has little to do as liberal blogger Winnie but Josh Brolin is more enjoyable as a sinister over the top head honcho. Frank Langella is stuck in the role of the kindly mentor Louis Zabel and is too idealistic a character to be believable. Michael Douglas manages to pull off some real acting, particularly in the emotionally powerful scene when he first makes a real attempt to reconcile with Winnie. But the absurdity of Gekko suddenly reversing course at the film's climax, undermines all the good acting Douglas had done beforehand.'Money Never Sleeps' is Oliver Stone's attempt to be accepted by his middle-class audience. There is no chance anymore that Gordon Gekko can exist as both good and bad at the same time. Gekko can now only be good in the present. The bad guy of today, the Brett's of this world, the one percenters, must be thrown under the proverbial bus. In reality, however, none of the 'villains' of the 2008 economic crisis were called to the bar of justice. Quite the contrary, they made out like bandits! Thus, Stone's comeuppance of the one percenter crowd, rings as false as the idealized crowd of do-gooders he creates, that are depicted going to battle with them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have really made clear to viewers just how badly American taxpayers were done in by the big financial firms together with their puppets in Congress, but it falls short. Maybe that's not what Oliver Stone set out to do. If he was trying to make another point I wasn't able to figure out what it was.Movies these days are usually between 95 and 110 minutes and I figured at 133 minutes that Oliver Stone must have had a whole lot to say and simply couldn't fit it into the usual amount of time. However, there's a lot that could have been excised from this film without taking anything away from it.Wall Street gives us the expected elements of a good film, a hero or two, a bunch of villains who we are well primed to despise, and a love story. That's all we get though as the film meanders about aimlessly and never really solidifies.A few additional details: The music was awful, Eli Wallach plays an unnecessary and absolutely disgusting character, there's some quirky foolish scene closers, and Carey Mulligan is to die for.Wall Street never really gets it together. It's a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulls too many punches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987, Oliver Stone directed and co-wrote "Wall Street" with Michael Douglas as a super-confident corporate raider Gordon Gekko ("Greed is good") and Charlie Sheen as his young acolyte. The real-life financial crash of 2008 was obviously a powerful inducement to Stone to return to the crime scene and 23 years later Stone again directs and co-scripts, Douglas is back as a Gekko who has served his jail term, and even Sheen has a small cameo. The young newcomers are Carey Mulligan as Gekko's estranged daughter and Shia LaBeouf as the daughter's partner. Other talent on show includes Frank Langella and Josh Brolin and even a 95 year old Eli Wallach.This is a glitzy production that includes another hard-hitting speech by Gordon Gekko ("Money is a bitch that never sleeps!") - this time savaging the irrational exuberance that leads to speculative bubbles in over-complex and opaque financial markets. Sadly, however, the film pulls its punches by putting too much blame on one rogue trader than on the systemic crisis in modern capitalism and offering a trite conclusion to the tensions in the Gekko family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was almost like sitting through a business class. It was boring and a lot of it was just talking about finance and the stock market with revenge thrown in. Gordon Gekko, a finance genius, is released after a number of years in prison. He comes up with a scheme to use his estranged daughter, Winnie, to get rich and to put the guy that helped lock him up behind bars. Winnie's boyfriend, Jake, makes contact with Gekko. He wants to bring Winnie closer to her dad and wants advice since he works at a bank that is fixing to go under. His company is going down because of rumors that are being spread by the same guy that helped lock Gekko up. Gekko sees this as a chance for revenge plus he uses it to "steal" back the 100 million he gave his daughter. But I guess he had a little change of heart at the end.The main problem with this movie is to much business talk and to much just talk in general. Like we have to sit through Gekko's lecture about money. That scene was too long. The whole movie was just boring.FINAL VERDICT: Avoid this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This disaster doesn't work for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that Shia LeBoeuf is not Michael Douglas, and, unlike the original, there are too many stories going around. Is the Shia character into green energy or not? We get that he is ambiguous about greed, but we don't need to be beaten to death with repeated scenes showing us that, secretly, he's really more a Gecko than Gordon's daughter who he's dating. And it is not too believable that the daughter, sitting on 100 million, is completely indifferent to the money. If she's so committed to a fictional version of Wikileaks, why not use it to really make a hard hitting web site? Oliver Stone knows how to make a film, but the script is so bad that the result is a mess. And what was with the Charlie Sheen cameo? In the meantime, has he gone from idealistic whistle blower to, well, Train Wreck Charlie Sheen IRL? His story of parlaying his airline he was saving in 1987 into a brokerage he sold for millions is just not believable, as is Michael Douglas' relating to LeBeouf that it wasn't Sheen who sent him to jail in 1993. Whatever, the only believable part of this is when Michael Douglas makes an impassioned speech to his daughter to win her back. When the personal takes over from the financial, with a film entitled Wall Street, then you know you are in trouble.</fullReview>

You sure as hell don't watch it for Fox's romance with Daryl Hannah character. Oliver Stone usually hits the mark but he was never going to hit anything with this sequel's dry, incomprehensible plot. It really did feel like a three-hour film. You've got to love the product placement too - I'm talking about the Heineken in the restaurant film. I like the fact Gekko actually suggests a crappy old Heineken to LeBoeuf - the poor kid doesn't even get to read a menu, or get the choice of a decent beer! And then the brilliant shot of the bottle being plonked down! Hilarious. Sadly the rest of the film isn't so entertaining - a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most interesting thing about this is the unintentional irony...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to Wall Street is a complete and pointless bore.The plot is paper thin and makes no sense, which is a good thing because we don't care about the holes or that it is entirely predictable. The characters are cardboard caricatures which is also fortunate. Otherwise we might care that their actions are almost random and unrealistic.This mess might have been justifiable had it fulfilled its intention to preach about the dangers of greed using the 2008 meltdown as a morality tale - a worthwhile sequel theme to the original morality tale from the 80's.However, it misses its mark by being too timid. The market bubbles are possible only because of lazy thinkers and lazier followers that don't actually understand or care about the details. Ironically, there is unintentional irony in that so many of the details in the analysis and pronouncements are wrong. The mingling of the Cambrian explosion with the development of humans - the idea that evolution is somehow unproven - calling fusion - combustion. These are all the type of things that smarmy media types glossed over as unimportant in their promotion of greed. This ignorance facilitated the transfer money from the gullible to those that did understand the details..The most ironic moment was when our hero wins over the Chinese magnate with Johnny Walker Blue. JW Blue is an overpriced vatted blend with value that comes only from marketing. It would have lost the account immediately if the Chinese guy knew Scotch (an older Springbank single malt or a small artisan vat would have been the right choice) - as it would have indicated a similar superficiality in the analysis of the investment. A perfect symbol of the smug ignorance and the unquestioning lemming mentality that allowed the bubbles to happen.Almost made the snore-fest worth watching...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 2008, 7 years after Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) got out of prison, and he's hocking his book. Meanwhile Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) is trying direct investments into a new energy source. But the financial crisis is crashing his own workplace Keller Zabel Investments. His mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) commits suicide. Jake marries Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), and teams up with Gordon Gekko to bring down Bretton James (Josh Brolin) who destroyed his mentor.This feels fake. There are better and more realistic and quite frankly documentaries about the 2008 financial meltdown. Others have explained it better. Hearing Gordon Gekko talking about it is like somebody trying to make poetry out of finance. The problem is that Oliver Stone is trying to inject a fictional story into something that's all too real. It amounts to a whole lot of meaningless gobbledygook. The story is nothing but trash. All that we have left to watch for are some fairly good performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly keen on watching this as I wasn't much of a fan of the first film. However, the opportunity presented itself and I had heard that this was a good watchable flick. Well, 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' can't seem to make up it's mind. Oliver Stone is probably confused about what he wants this film to be. The characters are one cliché after another. A number of things seem to be happening but non of the plots are properly developed. They appear too contrived and rushed. Moreover, there's a melodramatic tone. The dialogue tries to be smart and witty but to very little effect. Michael Douglas appears as though he could care less about his role. Shia LaBeouf does not impress. Carey Mulligan is nothing more than the typical estranged daughter slash conflicted girlfriend. Frank Langella is brilliant in a brief role. Josh Brolin is wasted. Stone himself does a lousy cameo. It's been years since I saw the first 'Wall Street' movie and even though I didn't like that one much, the sequel doesn't even live up to that.</fullReview>

There were some special effects &amp; cuts I enjoyed weaving in and out of the plot and there were elements of humor taking shot at the rich fat cats who manipulate the market for profit. Charlie Sheen has a cameo playing Bud, who helped put Gordo away....it's a stretch role for Charlie playing a womanizing, boozing lazy rich person I know, but he somehow pulls it off.Bad points - how they got the main character (Jake played by Shia Debouf) near Gekko - by dating his daughter. Mixed messages - is Gordo still motivated by greed, or does he want reconciliation with his daughter? She loves her daddy, she loves him not. She loves her fiancée, she loves him not.Major spoiler - after Gordo steals 100 million from her daughter, she reconciles with daddy and fiancées and the all live happily ever after. Cheesy ending. I think a grittier, more truthful ending would have made this much more credible and hard hitting. Instead, Oliver Stone sold out for the easy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie and see the Gordon Gekko character once more. In this film the character is just plain boring and uninspired. It looked like Douglas did not want to play this role and needed a paycheck (yet that has been the last 10 or so roles). The script was boring and moved at a snail's pace. The script was slow and there was nothing interesting about the story. The female lead did nothing but whine the entire film about useless stuff (the spoiled child attitude) and it eventually started to weigh down an already slow moving piece. LaBeouf is the usual bland actor he is in everything that he does. LaBeouf is better suited for hemorrhoid commercials than feature films and he brings absolutely nothing to the table to make you want to endure his droning lack of talent. Not a recommended film at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good thing I am yet to watch the original 1987 Wall Street. Based on the other reviews, my opinion of Money Never Sleeps would have been adversely affected if I had. As it is, without the comparison, it is not a bad movie, not a good movie, merely average fare.Started out very well and I was looking forward to a gun-a-blazin' Wall Street ride, but 30 mins in it became apparent it wasn't going to be. It veered off into firstly plain sentimentality, then into mere un-fun shallow silliness.Poor plot aside, my main bug-bear would be the absolutely horrendously mis-casting of Shia Le Boeuf. Shia unfailingly appears like a 16 year-old stand-in while the "real" actor is away - a 16 year-old trying to play the role of a hard-driving money man - poorly, unconvincingly and plainly laughable. He is good for Transformers, but I have no idea why there is this continuous attempt to cast him as a man's man in a variety of movies, when he is but merely a boy's boy. Shia's silly presence cast a ridiculous and contrived pall over the whole proceedings.I can imagine (since I have not seen the original) Charlie Sheen to be very well suited for his Bud Fox role (i.e. if I can get his Charlie Harper character out of my mind), and carrying the movie and the dynamics with Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko into absorbing realistic territories - however, Charlie's uncredited brief and unnecessary cameo in the current movie as Bud Fox trivializes the character and should have been left at the cutting floor. What a waste... could have been that much better.... if I am now to see the original perhaps I would wish this follow-up was never made. As it is, this is a very average 'boy pretending hard to be a man' sort of well-shot but not very well-scripted, neither-here-nor-there movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sequel But Not A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a film directed by Oliver Stone, a sequel to Wall Street. Michael Douglas reprises his role as Gordon Gekko with Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, and Frank Langella also starring in the film. The screenplay was written by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff. Set in New York, the film takes place 23 years after the original and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. Its plot centers on a reformed Gekko acting as an antihero rather than a villain, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie, with the help of her fiancé, Jacob. In return, Gekko helps Jacob get revenge on the man he blames for his mentor's death.Ambitious young investment banker Jacob Moore discovers that greed is still the name of the game when he forges a fragile alliance with onetime Wall Street hotshot Gordon Gekko shortly after Gekko is released from prison. Having served eight years for securities fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, Gekko emerges from prison to find that his daughter, Winnie, prefers to remain estranged, and that his former Wall Street cohorts are still raking in the cash. Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore, who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel, of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company's stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it's being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James, of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book "Is Greed Good?" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie's back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel's downfall. Later, as Jake begins plotting to avenge his mentor, Gekko starts to reveal his true colors. It was great to see Douglas back in the role that won him an Oscar. But even when he's offscreen, he's a bigger presence than LaBeouf.Those who see him in the role of Gordon Gekko as an antihero worthy of redemption might find this kinder, gentler Wall Street worth sitting through.Though the carpe diem theme comes as something of a surprise, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps makes its political points, with 'moral hazard'?the dark side of second chances?the film's punny refrain.Despite of rating it as an excellent sequel as it's more entertaining than many sequels ever made in Hollywood, Oliver Stone,who is directing a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should have been a classic.Unfortunately,it is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I am not a fan of Shia LeBeouf, I actually despise him as an actor and a person. I do not know him as a person but he does nothing interesting in my opinion and therefore you could tell me he wants to have lunch with me and I would turn him down, unless of course it was for the website. Okay I got that out of the way. So I went to take an afternoon siesta and decided to watch a movie and it just so happened that Wall Street 2 was just starting, so I decided to give it a watch, knowing full well that I may most likely hate this movie.Having seen the original with Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and Daryl Hannah I felt obligated to see the sequel and knew what the basis of this film was so on to the plot. After 8 years in prison Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) was released from prison and selling his books. Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf), who is a Wall Street investor, was dating Gekko's estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) and thought it would be a good thing to help facilitate a mending of their relationship, and meets Gordon on the sly. Good old Gordon has not changed and manipulates Jake to wire him some money he had left behind for his daughter in Switzerland through winning Jake over.That is the main plot but the subplot has to do with revenge, Gordon's revenge and Jakes revenge, both just so happen to be against the same person, Bretton James who is played by Josh Brolin. Through a bunch of misinformation and illegal Intel Gordon gets his revenge and Jake realizes he was taken. In this process Jake loses Winnie whom is carrying their son. Why can it not just end there? Hollywood has to wrap this film up pretty so everyone goes home happy. All and all the film was not terrible but it was far from good. The writers took the whole movie to destroy things but put it back together in 10 minutes. I felt like this film was just made because of the situation in Wall Street over the past 3 years and figured they could make a buck by making a subpar film about dirty bankers.What has happened to Oliver Stone? He has not directed a solid film since 1994&#x2032;s Natural Born Killers.</fullReview>

However the film is well written and is relevant to todays economic climate. Hopefully their can be a recut and a replacement of the soundtrack. It's been done with Ridley Scotts "Legend". Gordon Gekko should have had a young protégé' say rashida jones or megan fox. Carey mulligan could have been done with kate mara. And no need for susan sarandons character. Frank Langella and Eli Wallach stood out among the cast. And more of Charlie sheen would have been great. Wish it would have been better and Gordon Gekko is still an awesome character.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Rising hot shot Wall Street whizz kid Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf) thinks he's on to something with a new investment idea, but is having trouble convincing those around him. Even worse, his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) is suffering financially after rival invester Bretton James (Josh Brolin) sets the rumour mill flowing with iffy rumours about his company. When Zabel commits suicide, Jake's world is thrown into chaos, but he's overlooking one thing, his fiancé Winnie (Carey Mulligan) is the daughter of recently released former Wall Street hot shot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), who's out to rise back to the top by whatever means.You would have to have been living on planet Mars for the last few years not to have been hearing and reading about the global recession that's seen the world plunged into financial meltdown and seen many homes and businesses re-possessed. In a situation of catastrophic irony, it is this recession that has seen an uncertain and nervous Hollywood sticking to making re-makes and sequels of successful, sometimes long forgotten 'franchise' films, that has given birth to a sequel to 1987's Wall Street (which I myself only saw for the first time recently), that has a perfect, modern day backdrop in which to set itself and feel ever so relevant and appropriate. Original director Oliver Stone has obviously been canny enough to see this, and set the whole she bang in motion, scoring another potential impressive notch on his belt. Potential being the operative word, since for all it's gloss and slick style, this unsurprisingly emerges as not a patch on the original which it so desperately mimics, a much older and more dishevelled looking Douglas pretty much reprising his role from the original film over, with LeBeouf in place of Charlie Sheen (who makes an obligatorily product placed cameo) with only a minor twinging of the plot to cover this. As relevant as it seems in the uncertain financial market of today, the film fails to hold much of a truly coherent plot together, and there are various side stories that veer off and take away from the not altogether there main one. By the end, it really feels like it's been going on for far too long, and Gekko in particular is a character who's really been robbed of his edge. It's not that Douglas doesn't play him with any less conviction than he originally did, the writing simply lets him down. LeBeouf feels like he should just be making a new Transformers movie, while rising star Brolin tries to sink his teeth into material that's just not there. For a film about financial redundancy, this is redundant in many other ways. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gordon Gekko is out of prison, and the former biggest shark in the sea suddenly finds himself swimming with the rest of the fishes in a much bigger ocean, though no less shark-infested.I heard an interview with Stone before I saw this, and so came to it expecting a searing critique of globalization, the free mobility of capital, unrestrained speculation and lax regulation and policing of financial markets. What I got was a family drama with a formulaic twist at the end. Fair enough, mixing Hollywood drama with social critique is a tough spec, but the first Wall Street just about pulled it off. This is all gloss and superficiality, to the point of a cameo by Charlie Sheen. Life and Debt this film is not.Douglas plays an aged Gordon Gekko pretty much straight down the line.Shia LaBeouf as Jake Moore is fine in terms of performance, but script-wise a Wall Street guy working to save the planet through clean energy is a hard sell. Carey Mulligan is wasted as Winnie Gekko, the daughter who hates her Dad but, implausibly, ends up loving a Wall Street financier. The fact that Gekko himself finds it incredulous doesn't make it fly for the audience.Gekko makes a speech at a college that is supposed to critique the evolved greed that has taken over the markets in his absence, but it is all jokey one-liners rather than insightful dismantling. "Not only is greed good, it seems it is now legal." It doesn't educate, and it isn't funny - why do the audience guffaw at this crap? In the end, I'm not sure what Stone was after with this effort. Maybe his claws just aren't as sharp as they used to be.As for Eli Wallach and all that nonsense about birds - what the hell is he going on about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street 2 : Money Never Sleeps Oliver Stone's continuation of his earlier work Wall Street. If you are like me, and have not seen the first film, fear not it makes no difference as there a few characters carried across into the sequel and those which are, well you're very quickly introduced to them.The main thread of this film is the sub prime stock market crash of 2009 however there are several interlinking sub plots which run through the film. Firstly, Michael Douglas is investment banker Gordon Gekko, jailed, presumably at the end of the first film, and this vehicle begins with his timely release just before the stock market crash of recent times. Secondly Shia LeBeouf is Jake Moore a young up and coming investment banker who's dating Douglas' daughter Winnie. Thirdly, Winnie And Douglas have not spoken in years and fourth, everyone in the investment banking world is ruthlessly trying to screw each other over.There's nothing new or inventive about any of this. The relationships between each of the characters are routine and could have come from any one of a thousand film scripts. None of them are particularly deep or well developed so it's hard to feel loathing for the bad guys or sympathy for those inadvertently caught up in the mess. There are several well know actors, Oliver Stone makes his customary Hitchcock-esquire cameo but no one stands out as being exceptional and the entire film feels weak in all areas.One thing Stone does get across, with the occasional intimate close up of botox injected faces and cosmetic reconstruction or panning a crowded room and glimpses of decadence, is the sheer vulgarity of the excessively wealthy. However, when it all comes crashing down little is done by the director to show the calamity of the mess so many of these people found themselves in, nor is there any attempt to show how their joyful games of pushing paper across desks and shouting figures across a trading floor affected the lives of millions.Wall Street 2 passes as a film, it's watchable but unremarkable and sadly Stone let a good opportunity to make something powerful and shout loudly with a moral voice simply slip away.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments but is pretty disappointing as a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to begin slowly, but it started to get slightly better quickly. This movie could have been really great if it was allowed to grow in the development of the story. The story focuses a lot more on Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) than on Gordon Gekko (Michale Douglas) which isn't a bad thing but Gekko should have been in it more. The film starts out with Gekko coming out of prison which is 7 years later. The character of Jake Moore was pretty good, his intentions were convincing, but Winnie (Carey Mulligan) wasn't great. Her character didn't seem to fit in well with the story and it dragged on. She became very annoying quickly because she was mostly crying/tearing out. Also the film showed too much of romance between Jake and Winnie. Also Gordon Gekko didn't seem the same compared to the original. In this one, he changes for the better and seems to have learn his lesson. The ending shows this instance. Overall, the film should have been much better than it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not engaging enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a high flying young man's fight in Wall Street financial firms, so that he can get revenge from an unscrupulous banker who caused the death of his mentor."Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" fails to carry the idea of "money never sleeps". The film is reduced to a young man's misfortunes of working for the wrong guys and trusting the wrong men. The slow pacing and a serious lack of tension hurts the film's impact. Even during the financial meltdown in the film, I do not feel shocked, scared; and I do not have a desire to see how things will turn out. This lack of engagement is very problematic for a drama.In addition, greed is not portrayed in a more visible form, which undermines the impact of the central theme of the film. The emotional subplot involving an unborn child is not emotional enough either. The film seems to achieve a lot, and end up not achieving anything. Despite the fine performances of the lead actors and actress, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" is a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the 1987 Wall Street and are looking for more, this isn't it. It comes across like a boring, meandering Liberal sermon beating you over the head. Every time nuclear fusion gets mentioned, there's the same cheesy graphic thrown up on the screen - very colorful but devoid of meaningful content. Much like the movie as a whole. Really, this is one awful movie for $50 million dollars.The main character berates his mother for throwing good money after bad on her real estate deals, but he spends most of the movie chasing a $100 million dollars of his fiancé's money so he can throw it down the nuclear fusion bottomless pit. I didn't get the feeling Oliver Stone saw the irony in this.Further irony: Apparently it's OK for the main character to commit felonies and wreck the price of an oil company just to irritate his adversary, but it's wrong for his adversary to do the same thing. Mostly a waste of time. I watched it at home and found myself wandering off to other rooms while it droned on and on. There are a few good scenes. My favorite is the fast driving cabbie midway through.I'd suggest skipping this one and renting Boiler Room instead. Much more engaging and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street 2: Money Should Sleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street was a good case of making a movie at the right time with the right actors. It was immaculately 80s and the actors were so well suited for their roles that no one noticed the shaky direction of Oliver Stone. Thirty years on, in his film "W." people finally realised what a useless director he is. The movie was bland, uninspiring and generally rubbish, despite Josh Brolin's excellent performance. In order to save his reputation and add another zero to his bank account, Stone decided to return to Wall Street. Again, the timing seemed perfect, the actors seemed perfect but this time around Stone made a terrible job of it. I thought that one of the more important lessons of the crisis is that the majority of bankers are very greedy and are always looking to take advantage of a situation, no matter how dire it is. So, I found it quite hard to sympathise with Frank Langella, who spent 30 years indulging in greed and screwing people over and then he himself gets screwed over. I found it hard to sympathise with Shia LaBoef who gets a $1.5 million bonus before the company he works for goes bust. And do not even get me started on Michael Douglas' unrealistic character. Does a man who spends time in jail after committing fraud, using illegal inside information really expect a limousine when he gets out? Admittedly, most of the actors were very good, with Josh Brolin standing out as the only character with any edge and the ridiculousness of Carey Mulligan's character, which hates her banker father but for some reason is dating someone on Wall Street. It is unclear why either of them decided to join the film, but I guess when you are a Hollywood star you really do need that second swimming pool in the back garden. The script is appalling with the age-old story of career vs. personal life and obvious life lessons at the end with Michael Douglas donating $100 million to an energy company out of his new several billion-dollar fortunes, making everything okay. And just to torment us for a little bit more the movie closes with the billionaire dad holding his new (probably future billionaire) baby whilst his billionaire step dad looks on. There is a feeling throughout the film that the stakes are really not that high and Stone has lost his sense of reality. Shia LaBoeuf is without a job but doesn't just sell his $1.5 million apartment. And Michael Douglas' final gesture of returning the $100 million he stole from his daughter (that she did not want) seems insignificant as we are told that he moved to London and made billions. There is none of the intensity of the original or the difficulty of choices. The original had a real sense of evil on the infamous street of money. In this one there is not that feeling of greed that so famously gave Douglas' character its fame. Douglas' original Gordon Gekko is one of the greatest characters of movie history and his performance culminates in one of the greatest speeches in movie history ("The point is ladies and gentlemen that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.") .At least in the original Charlie Sheen went to jail. That was a realistic ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The short review is as follows: This is a bad movie. It starts with the script. It is beyond awful. Not only is the writing stale, lifeless and unoriginal (except for that one line, the only decent one in the entire movie "If you stop telling lies about me, I;ll stop telling the truth about you."), but, frequently, the actors mumble these lines, so it is difficult to even know what the hell they are saying.One of the things I look for in all movies when I'm trying to determine whether it's any good is the quality of acting from the minor characters (e.g. college buddy of a lead actor, co-worker of a lead actor). Well, they stink.I like Carey Mulligan, but I don't like her in this movie. She plays her character throughout with so much sadness and lack of humor that, after a while, you start to cringe whenever she's coming up in a scene. Shia LaBeouf does a harmless job with his character. Michael Douglas struggles (as does the film) to find some kind of spark or energy or any reason at all to keep on watching.Do yourself a favor and pass on this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something strange when you watch Wall Street: Money never sleeps. The first thing that comes to ones mind is that it is the camera, colours, sound. Everything has a certain back-to-the-eighties- touch. You cannot find it in hairstyles or sunglasses, but it is there, woven into the movies fabric - and yet, there is more to it. Oliver Stone managed to deliver a sequel that is, at the same time, its own remake and a homage to itself, respectively its prequel. This relationship with itself does not stop in the look-and-feel-compartment of the movie, it comprises the story, too. And not only the story that gets told but the whole topic of the financial crisis that itself was repeated - with another repetition being projected within the movie that also spawns another Gekko-generation. So here we are at the decisive point: Wall Street: Money never sleeps is not so much a story about money. Not even a story about the value of time. It is a story about repetition, a story about reflection, about learning. Sadly, most of the things to learn get hammered into the audiences heads. But on the other hand, some don't, even though they get repeated over and over again. One of them being the value of experience. So go and experience the acting of an experienced actor at his best, it is worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused, contradictory mess with some good camera work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street (1987) became the iconic film it did because it said something new about the change taking place in finance, and did it through the medium of a simple, compelling morality tale. It succeeded as much by capturing an element of the Zeitgeist as by its artistic merit.A sequel could never have achieved the original's iconic status, but it could have come a lot closer than this deeply confused train wreck of a film does. Sound harsh? Well, I didn't walk out, but as I watched the ending I rather wished I had.Amidst the debris of this film, there are some individually attractive features. Douglas puts in a strong, if rather self indulgent performance. From his point of view at least, this film was undoubtedly worth making.The camera work is almost uniformly exquisite. From the soaring panoramas of Jake's office building to the gorgeously lit conversation between Gekko and Winnie, this is a technical masterpiece. Sensitive use of strong depth-of-field effects is rare, and this guy pulls them off very well.Some of the dialogue is outstanding, and the set-piece scenes in the boardroom of the NY Fed are really very compelling. The single best line in the film will I'm sure stay with me for years (Gekko 'Stop telling lies about me and I'll stop telling the truth about you.').The plot is the problem.At the micro level, it is shot through with tired stereotypes and inconsistent characterisation. Shia LaBoeuf as Jake has to carry a lot of weight, and the depth of characterisation just isn't there. His blend of massive earnestness and total implausibility reminded me of Ryan Phillipe's similarly doomed performance in 'Antitrust' (2001).Similarly, Winnie's trustafarian idealist shtick seems to come and go as the plot demands, and never seems terribly believable. In particular, the speed of emotional transition in her relationship with Gordon really could only seem plausible in the head of a rather desperate scriptwriter.However, in a film with a better central narrative, disbelief would be suspended; these small details would not matter.The macro problem for this film is the story arc, and the message behind it. Fundamentally the story is this; Gekko gets out and redeems himself for his past crimes by making even more money, using the illegally laundered proceeds of his previous frauds. Then everyone lives happily ever after. Even his idealistic daughter who hated him and everything he stood for is compelled to forgive him by his subsequent financial success.If this were intended as a deeply cryptic indictment of the seeming impunity of white collar criminals, then it would at least have a message. But it isn't. The reality is much simpler than that.The writer got completely suckered by the material wealth and glamour of the characters. The message of this film is that the difference between a penniless fraudster and a billionaire fraudster is that one admires the latter. Little could express the value system that created the financial crisis better than that.Technical Stuff: In places, this film seems to attempt to 'explain' financial concepts. It doesn't do a fantastic job. To a specialist the financial detail seems painfully naive, whilst probably still being complex enough to totally confuse a lay person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was shockingly bad for all the top talent in it. The script was about 12 rewrites short of OK. The cinematography was amateurish, using a variety of gimmicky fade-outs, split screens that were hard to watch, and way too many cityscapes. We figured all the shots of the city were put in there during editing because they didn't have a whole lot of other stuff. Susan Sarandon had a small part and it was painful listening to her attempts at a Long Island accent. Where was the director in all this? It's a real shame because the original Wall Street is a landmark iconic film. This could have been a marvelous sequel. It isn't. It was painful to watch all that talent in search of a reasonable plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street spends more time avoiding Wall Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is risky business making a sequel on movie, especially one that had major success and inspired people. There is a lot to live up to, and the extreme pressure of not ruining the name of the franchise. This movie has a strong premise and comes out ready to take on something that could actually end up being more successful than the first movie but it strays on one problem. This film weaves through repairing relationships and greed. What doesn't work though is that it is focusing on is now Gecko's weakness of wanting to repair his life instead of being so ambitious then he was before. He later grows into his ambition again I do admit, but he still is plagued by love. This film spends way to much time at first on a new subject than the last film was based on. Gecko is so far OUT of the action that it takes awhile towards the end where we get a little bit of him actually being in the action again. Along with skimming the service on Gecko, this film spends a lot of time emphasizing on Gecko's quest to make his relationship right, but it just skims the service and their really isn't any depth that makes this the least interesting. The script is very hollow and my advise would be that if they cut back on the Act I and went for more of the rest of the movie after, this film COULD have been a better, but they still would have to fix up a lot of flaws. Overall, this movie is okay, it certainly doesn't offer what the original "Wall Street", I could never really tell what this movie was trying to prove but whatever the case is, there are a lot of gaps that had some potential but are strained back and focused on staying out of the action of Wall Street.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From returning director Oliver Stone (Platoon, JFK, Natural Born Killers), I and I'm sure many other people who saw the original film thought a sequel just over two decades later might not be a wise move, but I decided to give it a go anyway. Basically the ruthless corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Golden Globe nominated Michael Douglas) is released from prison after eight years in 2001, with no one to greet him, and seven years later he is promoting his new book. His estranged daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan), who he hasn't seen for years and hates his guts, is engaged to be married to young hot-shot Wall Street trader Jacob 'Jake' Moore (Shia LaBeouf) who is rising to get deals done. When he attends a promotion meeting for Gekko's book, he gets to meet Winnie's father personally and get to know him better, he believes the former Wall Street hot-head could be a good ally to get more deals done. Of course Jake tries to reunite Gordon and Winnie so that they can settle their differences, as she blames him for the death of her brother, he committed suicide, but it doesn't really work out. Also Jake wonders how Gordon has managed to get so much money back, and he is appalled to learn that he has been stealing from his own daughter, so a deal between them is made. He wants Gordon to pay back the $1,000,00 or so back to him and Winnie, or he won't be allowed access to his daughter's baby, i.e. as grandfather, I can't remember how it ends, but he is allowed to join the baby shower. Also starring Susan Sarandon as Sylvia Moore, Frank Langella as Louis Zabel, Josh Brolin as Bretton James, Eli Wallach as Julie Steinhardt, Austin Pendleton as Dr. Masters, Oliver Stone as Investor and Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox. Returning to the role that got him an Oscar, Douglas does almost as well as he did before, LeBeouf makes a good young not as nasty version, and Mulligan is really good as the pregnant daughter to Gekko. The story may be almost as tricky to understand in moments as the original film, and the 80's Watergate element may have disappeared, but there is some element to the recent credit crunch stuff, there are some alright moments, it's not a bad drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awful. Movie was ridiculous POS with fictional plot that barely touched upon real facts with the economy. Oliver Stone could have used this as a teaching opportunity about the current manipulated economy awash with a corrupt Fed, high frequency trading, Plunge Protection Team, and Quantitative Easing that is destroying the currency while setting up the economy for hyper inflation. When Gordon Gekko started giving his lecture in front of an audience with his future son-in-law Jake in attendance telling them the inside story of Wall Street, I thought, 'Here is the teaching moment'. But, alas, that was not to happen, as the narrative became truncated with cross fading sound bites uttered by Gordon and presented as gems of wisdom to the appreciating audience. Too bad the movie audience could not experience that same exalted enlightenment.Would have normally given it a 3 out of 10 stars because of the stupidity of the plot. However because this was made by Oliver Stone who should have known better, I deduct 2 stars giving it a rating of 1 out of 10. What a lost opportunity to make something meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, a wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having waited impatiently over a year to see this film I found it disappointing. I will tell you why.Firstly, Oliver Stone and Michael Douglas always said they were amazed that Gordon Gekko was an inspiration for many a man to take up a job on Wall Street. Gekko had been intended to be a repulsive character representing greed. The fact that he was, in fact so inspirational was the reason that Wall St was such a hit. In the new film Gekko's edginess is gone. He seems almost human, and save a couple of good lines, he is an inspiration for nobody. Second, The financial crisis has provided remarkable material that could have been made into a fast moving and exciting storyline similar to the first film. Instead Oliver Stone has chosen to tell a moral tale. The trouble is the character that Stone holds up as a helpless victim deserved his fate and Gekko also makes a choice that is supposedly the moral one but he does it only because he can afford to.The message in the story? For me it's just that nobody knows what is moral any more, not even people who make films about morality.Should you watch it? Yes, it's engaging and fun but don't expect the wheeling, dealing testosterone of the first film. This is a story about people, not deal making. It's just OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Greed is not that good after all..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"?greed, for lack of a better word, is good." The classic line delivered by the wicked financial wizard Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street has become immortalised as one of the most popular movie quotes in the history of American cinema. Unfortunately, there is nothing memorable in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is out of federal prison, following eight years of incarceration for insider trading. The film begins in 2008, just before the global financial crisis, and Gekko is on a mission to warn the public of the imminent economic meltdown. After one of his speeches, Gekko is approached by Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf), who tells him that he is going to marry his estranged daughter Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan). From thereon, the film splits in two directions. The main plot involves Gekko trying to reunite with his daughter through Jake. This story is supposed to be a love/family theme within the film's financial backdrop. This is the most problematic and truly unnecessary part of the film. Instead of Oliver Stone digging deep and examining the failings of the capitalist system and truly condemning the culture of 'moral hazard' displayed by the big financial institutions, he goes for sentimentality. Stone who has directed such classics as Platoon (1986), Born on the Fourth of July (1989) and JKF (1991), is way below par with his latest project. The other more interesting and stronger side of the film is the financial stuff we see, mostly through Jake's eyes, a young Wall Street guy who is living and breathing in the toxic environment of subprime mortgages, leveraged finance and good old fashioned egomaniacal greed of Corporate America. The biggest strength of the original film was Michael Douglas (on Oscar Winning form), who tore up the screen with his presence. In this film, Douglas is underused, and it is a shame because he is the best thing in the film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps does not know what it is trying to say, and it goes soft at the end, failing to convey a message on the 2008 'Great Recession' and the culprits behind it. Ooh yeah, and the ending sucks?VERDICT: 6/10 (Mild Recommendation).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps because I did not see the 1987 version, I found this 2010 version a compelling watch. Perhaps because I was in private business and found the 2008 meltdown too predictable, I found 'just another' movie about greed a compelling watch. And, no, I did not find the main lady unfeminine as another reviewer apparently did. Carey Mulligan added a depth of vulnerability and sexuality that came across with good acting, not naked exposure. Beauty is, I suppose, in the eye of the beholder. While I have lost that admiration I once had for Michael Douglas, I found his and the other actors' performances most entertaining. I would be more compelled to give this movie a nine because its story and filming drew me in. I found none of it boring but maybe that was because I found the reality of its various characters too real in comparison to characters I met on both sides of that Canadian border in business life before this economic meltdown happened. Perhaps the movie is not so sincere because it portrays real tyrants as being made accountable in the end. That is yet to happen in the real world. But the irony is in what happened after I bought this DVD as a Blu-ray/Digital copy package as a 'collector's edition'. Yup, good old greed came to play as the Fox corporation made great promises on its packaging about how this movie could be played on all of my personal devices. And then Fox tried to shut down its use after I had downloaded only one copy with their special 'registration code'. As if I were in this movie, I had to challenge FDC about false advertising. Bankers. Business. False promises to the endless benefits we will accrue. Sad parallels remain in our world. Ironic that this is a movie about greed and what is essentially false advertising about the ethics of our big businesses. Oh, perhaps I should bump the rating up to 10 because, really, the movie expresses emotions about betrayal and dishonesty in such a pretty way that it is really a continuing statement of the hypocrisies of big business. That these people still have to be challenged to be true to their word instead of becoming just another proponent of greed? This movie should cause all of us to pause to ask: am I really just another enabling part of all of this? A beautifully filmed movie in interesting locations, if nothing else. But all else, especially the acting, came together to make this a movie that really mattered in the end to me. Fiction? Yes, I am glad that I bought the movie and after watching it twice to catch all of the hidden nuances, I do know that I will watch it again. After I cool down about Fox playing their own dirty business games.</fullReview>

Money never sleep is a actual movie because the insane financial market rhythm never stop, after a bubble always come another.

Government, corporations, consumers, everyone is so guilt from greed than no one is villain, all our system is based in consumption. Just Gordon understand it and know hows use it.Finally, the movie is about a sociology analyzes of American, and Western, society. Our life style isn't more about work, but about keep the circular money flowing. Gekko explain all it, but the main lesson, or not, is you can't change the system, just play the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Douglas Never Sleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010): Dir: Oliver Stone / Cast: Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, Josh Brolin, Frank Langella: Sequel to Wall Street, that seems to suggest ones wealth as a form of revenge or superiority. Michael Douglas returns as Gordon Gekko who is released from prison after activities in the first film. His only family is a daughter who disconnected from him but he may reconnect through her boyfriend who also works within Wall Street. Oliver Stone returns as director and is backed by a superb performance by Douglas who, as Gekko, is an anti-hero that viewers cannot help but like. He wishes to reconnect with his daughter yet he still plays the money field using her fiancé. Shia LaBeouf plays his future son-in-law seeking inside secrets but it will be at a cost. He agrees to attempt to reconnect him with his daughter. Carey Mulligan plays Gekko's daughter who struggles with her feelings towards her father. She is angry but she also questions LaBeouf whom she warns about her father's nature. The outcome of the love relationship is obvious and a weak point in the film. Josh Brolin plays the new scheming villain whom LaBeouf is connected with and whom Gekko plans to sabotage and dismantle. And the scene stealing Frank Langella plays LaBeouf's managing director. It has been over twenty years since the release of Wall Street and Oliver Stone points out that society has changed just as filmmaking itself has. That is one of the charms of this effective sequel. It demonstrates greed, corruption and the need to revive. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy and Uninsightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street' was one of those movies that become emblematic of its age; Stone might not have intended his villain, Gordon Gecko, to be seen as a hero by actual Wall Street traders, but the fact that he was is in a way a sign of how on-the-money the movie actually was in terms of reflecting the spirit of its times. The film was actually a fairly simplistic account of insider trading; but Gecko, the bold maverick who challenged the establishment, was not a completely uninteresting figure. 'Money Never Sleeps' is a sequel to the earlier film, and this time, Stone sets the story against the backdrop of the actual financial crisis of 2008. But it's a lazy movie. Shia LaBoeff plays the central character, an obnoxious, arrogant and rich young trader who manipulates the market but with whom it seems we're expected to sympathise on the grounds that he just knows that nuclear fusion will save the world, that he has a pretty girlfriend, and that he's loyal to his boss. The said boss, whose company has collapsed, is presented (without evidence) as noble and innocent; the boss of a rival company is presented as pure evil although it's hard to see the difference between the two, except that LaBoeff's character likes one and dislikes the other. Gekko, meanwhile, is this time presented as obnoxious without subtlety; but still allowed to participate in the movie's inexplicably happy ending. Plot details are also unbelievable: the ease with which LaBoeff causes share prices to fall simply by spreading rumours; or the fact that Gekko can basically set up a large financial company with money he's just stolen: Wall Street may be lenient on its practitioners, but surely even there, there's a time to lie low. Add in some silly visual effects and it's an unsatisfying film, slick but empty. Watch J.C. Chandor's 'Margin Call' for a much better portrait of Wall Street under crisis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MONEY NEVER SLEEPS has "wasted opportunity" written all over it. An examination of the recent financial crisis, if handled properly, can make for good drama (MARGIN CALL, as an example). But Stone populated his movie with leaden actors and this thing lacks any actual drama. It just lumbers on for two hours, never picking up steam (even with a motorcycle chase). Elder statesmen Frank Langella and Eli Wallach aren't given much to do, ceding most of the film to Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan and Michael Douglas. In Douglas' defense, Gekko's neutered in this movie, even in his villainous betrayal. Stone had all of the fire written out of the character. And not to gang up on LaBeouf, but his character is am insufferable jerk (Mulligan's, too, to some extent), so their drama doesn't hold water.The real problem here is that it bears the WALL STREET name. Erase the name Gordon Gekko from this movie, and there'd be no ties. The original movie was foremost an engrossing drama wit a fiery villain - the beauty of this is that it eventually became about something in a larger context (greed). It wasn't topical. But here, Stone dusts off the Gekko character to sermonize about how greed is bad. The moralizing gets old, very quickly. Stone also decides to throw Bud Fox under the bus with a throwaway two-minute cameo from Charlie Sheen, all in the service of emphasizing how bad the Josh Brolin character is.MONEY NEVER SLEEPS was awful, and it's devoid of everything that made the original great.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gordon Gekko is back....big whoop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas has another go as Wall Street crook Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street - Money Never Sleeps" from 2010, directed by Oliver Stone. It's 2001, and Gordon has just been released from prison and has written a book. His daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), who wants nothing to do with him, now runs a liberal website and is engaged to Jake Moore (Shia LeBoeuf), an ambitious broker. When Jake's boss and mentor takes his life thanks to rumors of his company failing started by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), Jake wants revenge. Gordon Gekko can possibly help him -- after all, James is an enemy of his as well. In return, Gekko wants a relationship with his daughter.Another big stock market crash, this one from 2008, serves as the background for this film, which crashes right along with the market. The acting is okay, but the story is derivative and predictable. At 133 minutes, it seems overly long, and Oliver Stone has done better work. Disappointing, as I'm sure many people were looking forward to this film after "Wall Street."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did we need another Wall Street movie? The story seemed to be closed-and-shut at the end of Oliver Stone's 1987 film as Gordon Gecko gives his big credo - "Greed is Good - Greed is Right" - and is carted off to prison for insider trading. Logically, one might think that because of the financial clusterf**k two years ago where everything went to hell until the government pulled its bail-out, its just the right time for one, to give a 21st century update with Gecko when insider trading is so... 1987. It is logical, but the question becomes 'does the movie work'? Yes and no. It's a sequel that tries to make its own story without involving too much of the previous film's material outside its iconic character (Charlie Sheen makes an almost thankless cameo as Bud Foxx, and we find out what *other* stuff Gecko did to have him get eight years in prison). But after the set-up of the story, about how Jake Moore (Shai LaBeouf), dating Gecko's daughter (Carey Mulligan) is a wall street trader who connects with the elder Gecko after Jake's mentor kills himself over the financial crisis at the firm he runs, and thus the seeds of revenge are sewn for Jake against sneaky "Pig" Bretton James (Josh Brolin), it turns into a Hollywood drama. By this I mean not really an Oliver Stone drama that one looks forward to from his days doing them well in the 80s and 90's (maybe not so much in the 00's). Without spoiling too much, the results of the drama in the story turn out to be a little too neat and tidy, and shockingly, considering how much the original Wall Street took chances and made one think about the financial mishaps downtown NYC was doing at the time, how it doesn't really take the bull by the horns and make the financial meltdown seem *that* important. More than that, it feels like Stone and his writers use the big financial meltdown as a plot point more than something to leap off of as something important. And unlike a documentary coming out this month like Inside Job, you won't really learn much about what happened with Wall Street and the financial crisis, except "hey, we're money people, we're in trouble, we can't let it "sleep", better get a bail-out." I'm not expecting too heavy a history lesson, but like with Stone's recent W., it combs over anything really revelatory to get back to the formula of the story.So why is this worthwhile? Simple: the acting here, the cast assembled, and how restrained Stone's direction is - that is when he's not going nuts with sprawling stock-numbers super-imposed over the city - makes for very compelling viewing. If it feels slightly stale and expected how it turns out in terms of the story points, right down to the Freudian daughter-father thing with Gecko, Jake and her father, the actors breathe a lot of life into the conflicts and make it believable. LaBeeouf especially is given a really meaty role here dramatically, where he has to show his chops instead of surrounded by overwhelming special effects. His Jake is smart but emotional, impressionable and determined, a kind of nouveau Bud Fox who has his passion project to fund (the one issue that is pounded away here, maybe even *more* than the economy in Wall Street 2, is alternative energy), and he plays off very well with Carey Mulligan, who gives some depth to a girl who seems straightforward: "I'm a liberal gal whose distanced myself from my father following my brother's overdose-death that is my FATHER's fault." For a character who should only be halfway sympathetic, she's filled with pathos and has a wonderful scene with her father on the steps in reconciliation.Oh, and Michael Douglas. If only he were here in every scene it would be a must-see... then again, maybe not. Maybe Stone is wise to bring Douglas in as the big scene-stealer, because he really is, one of the great ones as a character. And damn if Douglas doesn't deliver again on a character who is wicked but inviting, seductive but practical, witty but not insufferable, and has that snake-like charm that could draw in a tax collector into his grasp. Every moment with him is just about perfect, even when he's put into some of the expected beats of the last reel. Other actors like Frank Langella (for how brief he's there he makes his mark), Josh Brolin, Eli Wallach, they all contribute to making it at least watchable and fun; you want to see what the actors, more than the story, will do next with the turns it takes. And maybe the cast will be enough, and some of the dramatic situations and how they're staged without fuss will bring in audiences. I was certainly sucked in more, without the kind of distractions of Stone's most recent output by pablum (WTC), misdirection (W.) or being just overloaded (Alexander). Ironically when Stone brought in some of his wacky visual schematics for the stocks floating over the city and split-screens and the animation of the alternative-energy examples, don't work to the same wild effect that Stone used to pull off. Maybe he's getting too old for this s**t. But, thankfully, he knows how to direct actors very well, or just how to assemble them, and if one sticks to that point Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is enjoyable and, oddly enough, escapist entertainment. You'll almost forget how screwed the country still is at the end of the movie. Almost, though not quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pales in comparison to its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this follow-up to his outstanding WALL STREET, Oliver Stone does a serviceable job but ultimately, the film buckles underneath the weight of its unfocused narrative. The performances are generally good, with stellar showings all around. Shia LaBeouf shows that he has the chops to potentially carry his own movie, although most of the heavy lifting is done by Michael Douglas and Josh Brolin (the dual antagonists). Quality-wise, nothing is particularly egregious (although the flashy editing was a little distracting). It's that the film tries to do too much. There's enough material here for at least a couple films, and the romantic subplot could have been eliminated with little cost to the overall story arc. On one hand, you have the background in the 2008 financial crisis, and on the other you have Gordon Gekko's path back to the top (which would have been the most appropriate story-line to focus on). There's a lot to say, and despite all of the financial jargon which can be hard to understand, it does have good points when looking back at the 2008 financial crisis in retrospect. Too bad that all of this isn't particularly germane to the story Oliver Stone seemed to be going for, and maybe this movie wasn't the best avenue for all of that material. To its detriment, this doesn't really start to feel like a "Wall Street" sequel until about three quarters of the way through. It's a good movie, but had some more restraint been shown in editing, it could have been much better than it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(42%) Gets by with the brilliance of Michael Douglas's acting ability as well the decent supporting cast, but the story simply boils down to a seen-it- all-before family drama about a father trying to regain his child's affection. I hated the clear product placement during what should have been one of the films more interesting parts when Gekko, after many years apart, is about to have dinner with his daughter ("want a Heineken?" as the camera cuts away from the actors to show a cold one just like a TV ad) and the pointless motorcycle scene that is only there so they could put it in the trailer. Without the good cast and decent direction this would have been a right old stinker, as it is it's just plain average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rushed film to cash in on the 2008 GFC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed a little rushed to me, in a sense that as soon as the global financial crisis happened, Oliver Stone immediately sat down with his pen and began to write a movie based on the events, bringing characters from the original movie forward in time so that he may comment on the events of 2008. This is the first sequel Oliver Stone has written, and while it was not a bad movie, it did seem somewhat contrived to deal with the events of 2008.The original movie was meant to be a criticism of Wall Street, however it turned out that it was not taken as a criticism but as supporting the culture of Wall Street, particularly with sayings like 'for lack of a better word, greed is good.' However, in this film, the saying goes, 'where I originally said greed is good, now it seems to have become legal'.Gordon Gecko returns in this film, having been released from gaol penniless and with a collection of antique memorabilia from his high flying days back in the 80's. His daughter has grown up and she is now in a relationship with another young Wall Street up and comer. He works for a very old and venerable investment bank that suddenly finds itself under attack during a period of market volatility, and its share price is driven down so low that it makes it a bargain which is quickly snapped up. Jack Moore, the new hero of the story, smells a rat, especially since the owner commits suicide. However he needs the help of Gordon Gecko to get to the bottom of what is going on.Gecko appears to have changed through his time in prison, however in many cases it seems to be a façade which he uses to get himself back onto the rich list. He suggests that if he had $100 million then he could easily cash in on the crisis. However, there is also something human about him, which is what Moore uses to bring him over. There is also the idea that green energy is going to be the next bubble (it's not, rather two years on, I have noticed that it is the mining boom, at least here in Australia, that is driving the next bubble. With a number of small cap mining stocks making up to 1000% gains since July 2010 it goes to show that the green energy bubble has yet to materialise).The movie tries to explore the reasons behind the crash of 2008, trying to explore ideas such as Collateral Debt Obligations and the like, however I think a number of these areas are quite complicated, and in the end it was a rigged casino culture on Wall Street that sought to over inflate assets and false rumours to destroy one's rivals. Once again, it all comes back to bite the bad guy in the movie, though in real life that did not necessarily happen. It always comes down to a fall guy, and in the real crisis, that fall guy was Bernard Mardoff. Everybody else seemed to get away with their multi-million dollar bonuses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Michael Douglas returns to his iconic role as Gordon Gekko and proves that he still has game left in him. As a sequel, it is inferior to the first film. The first film was very good, almost a classic. But this film turned out to be somewhat of a bore even though there were many interesting moments here.This film is about how Gordon Gekko is released from prison and wants to reconcile things with his estranged daughter. He meets her fiancé, Jacob and then he comes to realize he still has tricks up his sleeve. Then there is that Bretton James....... I think the best part of this movie though is the cameo by Charlie Sheen. I wish he had more scenes.Michael Douglas was pretty good but he was much better in the first one. He just seemed more low key here. Josh Brolin was very good as the snake, Bretton James. Shia LaBeouf and Carey Mulligan are also passable in their roles.Overall, this is a somewhat interesting film. There are many boring parts here so I was a little disappointed. Maybe this film came out too soon after the market crash of 2008. Maybe that is why this film did not do great at the box office. This is a worthy film by Oliver Stone but only just. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am rating this movie 7, due to the soundtrack, actors, acting and the way it is put together. Some really nice quotes as well - especially from Gekko. I did like the positive ending. Its always nice to have some light.However if looking from storyline perspective, i mean trying to show financial crisis - it is very poor. Doesn't explain how and why those bubbles come, but throughout the movie everybody keeps talking about them. For somebody who is not interested in the financial world, it has to be explained, otherwise you are looking at a narrow group of people who actually understand whats going on in the movie. And that group of people won't be very satisfied on how everything is shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street 2: we're all Gordon Gekkos now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicked characters can be very entertaining. It was true of Gordon Gekko in 1987's Wall Street, and it is the case once again in the sequel, Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps. In his reprise as Gekko, Michael Douglas turns in a brilliant performance ? now much grizzled and world-weary, but arguably even more devilish. It left me wondering if he could win two Oscars for the same role.The film is a fairly straightforward morality play. But it unintentionally glamorised what it sought to criticise. As Stone himself has noted, many Wall Streeters have said they were inspired to work in finance by the Gekko character. In particular, they took his 'greed is good' speech in the film to heart.This time around Stone seems to be trying extra hard to make sure we do not come away with any sense that the Street is glamorous. But he is only partially successful in that. The displays of wealth are still eye- candy, and the wickedness is still engaging.The central character in the sequel is Jake (played by Shia LaBeouf), a young, striving investment banker with a shade of green politics. His firm (like Bear Stearns) is the first to be brought down, leading his mentor to commit suicide. In turn, Jake seeks revenge on other bankers he blames for his firm's downfall, mainly Bretton James (played by Josh Brolin). Jake is engaged to Gekko's daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), and he sidles up to the supposedly reformed Gekko in the hope of both receiving assistance in his revenge plot and reuniting father and daughter.The two films differ in important and revealing ways. The first Wall Street was akin to a gangster film, with raiders like Gekko the hit men, the obvious bad guys. The main victims were workers, like the unionists at Bluestar, who lost their jobs. Its message echoed the brutally ruthless mafia line: it's not personal, it's business.Stone could have taken a similar approach with the sequel ? certainly, many more people have lost jobs this time around than in the aftermath of the financial crashes of the Eighties and Nineties - but he doesn't. He remains unsubtle, but in a different way. He clearly identifies the good guys: Winnie, who runs a leftie blog, and Jake, who wants to save the world with clean energy (and make a lot of money in the process). And Stone has plenty of cardboard cut-out bankers who play the bad guys, like the one who motivates an investment to his colleagues on the grounds that it will bring 'what we want - big bonuses!'But there's more going on. The key difference is that Wall Street 2 considers the main downside of finance and the money culture is its damaging effects on personal relationships and one's own soul, rather than, as in the first film, the other financial players or the masses of workers. In the sequel, Gekko is sad and lonely, estranged from his daughter. Money threatens to tear apart the relationship between Jake and his fiancée Winnie. Personal dramas are at the forefront, and the details of the financial meltdown crash are not really examined - they are just a setting. In Wall Street 2, the mafia line has been reversed: it's not about business, it's personal.Wall Street 2's emphasis on fallen nature might appear to be a more 'human' story, but it actually denigrates people. Not only does this outlook spread the blame for the crisis to working-class folks, but it also assumes our natures are essentially wicked and easily corruptible. This explains why - somewhat surprisingly - the film ultimately does not stir up outrage. Because the fault apparently lies in immutable human nature, there is little that can be done about it. Stone ends the film with a plea from Gekko to his daughter for understanding, because 'we're all mixed bags'. He reaches a relativist conclusion that we should accept that some of us will succumb to temptation, and we should look charitably upon those who do.Wall Street 2 echoes many of today's prejudices and misunderstandings about the crisis, and this, in fact, hurts the film as drama. The first film was very timely. The Eighties saw the beginning of the financial bubble, when financiers were celebrated, but Stone came along and challenged this. His film was released in December 1987, only two months after the Black Monday stock market crash, and it became a touchstone for an emerging backlash amongst certain sections of society.In contrast, the sequel comes at a time when nearly everyone ? from academics to the proverbial man on the street ? already blames greed for the downturn. Stone's second take is not a challenge to the status quo, but simply a re-confirmation of it, two years after the market crash. On top of this, his desire to dwell on personal lives in the sequel noticeably slows down the pace of the film compared to the first. The two green goodies, Winnie and Jake, are essentially dull as ditchwater.Wall Street 2 is at its most energising when it evokes the real dread and panic that emerged when the markets started a freefall in 2008. I wouldn't expect any drama ? especially one made by Stone, whose historical films are notorious for their inaccuracies - to come close to explaining what caused that meltdown and why it struck such fear in the hearts of the establishment. But I can do without Wall Street 2's message about how we're all greedy and to blame for the crisis: I've already heard more than enough of that from politicians and intellectuals over the past two years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the perfect example of a movie that could have been great, but was wasted by a very bad written plot, lack o rhythm and casting mistakes. Some points that make this movie unworthy seeing: - Jake Moore is a very problematic and confusing character. First thing, Shia LaBeouf should never have got this role. I don't think he is a bad actor, but he just doesn't convince as bad ass stock trader making millions in bonuses. At some point, Bretton asks him if he is an environmentalist or a capitalist. That's a good question that should have been answered before writing the plot, not during the movie (and it's never answered anyway)- Jake starts the movie angering for revenge against Bretton, than he gets a job from him, leaves revenge aside and tries to obtain money for a fusion energy project. When it doesn't come, he just scolds Bretton, quits the job (wouldn't it be smarter to keep it, since he wanted avengement?) and is back to retaliation again. Those sudden changes of attitude just make the movie boring and dull, it would have been much better if the screenwriters just picked a storyline and sustained it. - Winnie Gekko is a real pain in the ass. She just moves around with that sorrowful face, weeping and complaining about everything. She doesn't' believe her father, than she forgives him, he robs her and is forgiven again in the end, just because he gives 100 million to that lousy fusion project (money that belonged to her in the first place!). Senseless and pokey, like everything else. - The only thing that could have saved this movie is Michael Douglas, a magnificent actor whose talent was wasted by poor lines and a somehow displaced character in the plot. His interaction with Winnie is tedious to the bone, and every time I saw both of them in the screen I felt like using the fast-forward button. The scene were he speeches to the audience (and no actor is better at speeches than Michael) was ruined by lousy edition. Why didn't they just wrote some good lines and let him do his trick? What a waste. The movie is also full of inconsistencies: Bretton knows Jake hates him and blames him for the suicide of his mentor. Jake spreads false rumors in the market that gives him massive losses and what does he do? Sends some thugs to beat him? Burns him so he will never get another job? Punches him in the face? No! He gives him a job, so that he can have access to his business and squelch him up faster. Gordon Gekko turns 100mil in 1 billion in a few months after the 2008 crisis! The movie is full of graphical animations showing stock market numbers and a fusion power plant project, which, IMHO, are completely displaced in a Wall Street financial drama and would be more suitable in an action/science fiction movie. To finish, the scene that got me laughing hard: Jake tries to gain the sympathy of the Chinese tycoon by giving him? Johnny Walker Blue!!! He probably tossed it in the trash. All said, Wall Street: Money never sleeps is, considered on its own, just a bad and tedious movie. If compared to the original Wall Street, it's a disaster. Bad one, Oliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity that could have surpassed the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the original, iconic film, I had high expectations for the long awaited (an overused phrase, but 23 years is too long) sequel to "Wall Street." Unfortunately, they weren't met. With the original director and the two leads from the first returning, this could've easily been one of the best films of the year....could've been.Oliver Stone is a talented director, effectively guided the first film, but never seems to connect with this script as he did with the first. It lacks the "zing" the first film glided on. Stone tries, he does try, and he does succeed here and there, but he's buried by the ill-fated script. And speaking of the screenplay...Some truly witty lines of dialogue are in there some places, but a film can't be built on good dialogue every other page. In simple terms, the actual Wall Street storyline is pretty dull and extremely uninteresting. It's boggled down by the film's pretentious "business world talk" and loses the audience. You can feel the barrier set between the film and yourself. However, Gordon Gekko side of the spectrum trumps the money/business story. The drama of the past 23 years is what the fans of the original want to see. When we get to see that the film is much better and grabs you into the story. But lets you go in the big gaps where the GG story falls behind the curtain. But then again, how much credit of the Gekko section is due to the script and not Douglas himself?Michael Douglas is back in the role he won his second, but only acting, Oscar. The role has become iconic, and Douglas still has the magic touch that won him the golden man. His supporting role from the 1987 original has been minimized (big mistake). But the scenes he does have soar thanks to nothing else but Douglas' fine acting skills. He fits comfortably back into the role that was tailor made for him. Where's his second acting nomination?Aside from Douglas, he has what looks like a good group of cast members backing him up: Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon, and Frank Lagella. Heck, Charlie Sheen even has a cameo reprising his role from the first film. The problem is, why can't this film work? Great performances, talented director, and a pick-up from a juicy storyline. On a final note, despite it's problems (and weird editing which I haven't mentioned), Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is worth seeing just to see Michael Douglas back on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS ? CATCH IT ( B ) First things first I've never seen the first Wall Street movie, so, the only expectations I had were because of Shia Labeouf joining hands with Mr. Michael Douglas and Ron Howard. Well as a business con movie it should have been very clever, sharp and intelligent but sorry to say it was none of that. There were things happening and story was progressing fast but everything was seen hundred times before " Seriously I think the movie name should have been revenge never sleeps" everyone was taking some sort of revenge from the other person". I had expected more from Ron Howard at least, everything in the movie was crystal clear and you know what's going to happen next in the movie. Another thing keep bothering me in the movie was the cheap special effects where they were showing again and again giving markets fall and rise examples, the graphics were just tacky. Michael Douglas did a fantastic job and proved that he is one of the finest actors alive. Shia Labeouf, he was good but not great like the role required. Shia is a good actor but not great and neither had the good looks or charm like Brad Pitt, Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise to run a Corporate Con movie. Carey Mulligan looks really fresh though her role was not substantial and at times she just completely disappear, still she leaves a strong impact. Josh Brolin was fine nothing special this time. Susan Sarandon was totally wasted, C'mon it doesn't make a sense. Overall a Time Pass average movie can be enjoyed because of its cast but to be honest last year's average successful movie DUPLICITY was more intriguing and thrilling than Wall Street: Money Never Sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best way to distort the first movie's impression is by watching this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "sequel" is far from being what I wanted to be. I loved the first movie from '87 and I don't really get why Oliver Stone decided to take this second shot. The analogy between Stone's decision to make another Wall Street and the point of the Wall Street movie is very interesting because it's a true analogy. I wanted to give this movie a pass, and I went in with the idea in my mind that I will actually like it. At the end it seems that besides Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko and Josh Brolin as the "hiena" Bretton James the rest is totally forgettable. This movie should have been about Wall Street, about politics, about business, about management and mathematics, about cold-hearts and ruthless rules but it ended up just containing a simple sample about all that and the rest of the movie being build upon a love-triangle. I was not satisfied with the result because if I wanted a movie that delivers drama in a "love story" than I would have watched a different kind of movie but since this one addresses mostly just a specific segment of the wide public than why would you even name it Wall Street: Money never Sleeps? The title does not reflect the actions and that is a shame. Don't get me wrong, as a drama, it might work, but this ain't just a drama... Because of this emotional exploitation I felt relieved when Gekko came back into the business... I was like: "Yes! The devil made it!"...As far as the casting, well... I have two major problems with the main characters... Speaking of characters; you are just thrown in the middle of the action. There's no actual progressive storytelling or anything like that, you have to guess at times who's who and that is a "no-no" for this type of movie, especially when you call it a sequel. The characters were poorly developed and that scene with Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) was terrible. I just felt wrong for that guy. So, back to my major problems, Shia LaBoeuf as Jake Moore, the smart Wall Street broker, did not made the movie credible to me. He was not ready for that role because he just didn't had the attitude for it... He looked random and exaggerated... On the other hand, Carey Mulligan as Gekko's daughter was, to me, the same character she plays... I want her to see acting differently because I'm pretty much tired of the same gestures and same approach in every movie... Her performance in "An Education" was wonderful but biting from that even here to me is just too much... I hope she will not pull a Keira Knightley career move and chose similar roles in each movie... I want something different, something that will move me in a way...Now the technical part is another thing I didn't actually liked... The editing was done, in main part, to provide a modernistic image of Wall Street but at the same time it failed by trying too hard. And by the way, what was with the music??... The score for the first movie was intense and menacing... this was like a pop-alternative VH1 Sunday... I didn't like it...I don't recommend this movie to anyone who loves the first original Wall Street... I don't recommend it because I don't want it to "ruin" in a way, the beautiful morbid image that classic left you with... I want that image to stay untouched, undistorted or unchanged... But if you want to watch it just for fun... then go ahead... you've got nothing to lose...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really who actually cares about such rich people moaning they just lost their $100m and then grimacing wistfully that it is back. The level of 'family wealth' here is so absurdly far from what 99.99% of any cinema audience will ever see in their own lives that the 'drama' here might as well be about well dressed aliens. All the screen gimmickery and posturing that passes for techniks and acting becomes boring and all we are left with is how pretty Carrie Mulligan is and what a pleasant marsupial is Shia laBeuf... or whatever. He looks like Dick Powell in a 1933 WB musical. My biggest moment of interest is seeing Austin Pendleton again on screen, a sure favorite since I first saw him in What's Up Doc. Sylvia Miles looked as though she needed to encounter Joe Buck again and Susan Sarandon affected a hilariously awful Jewish Mumma accent. Far too much product placement with logos front and center, and a Ratzo Rizzo performance from a skeletal Eli Wallach. A money movie about awful people with money. It all just made me yearn for Midnight Cowboy. However I do believe Josh Brolin gets better and better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oliver Stone used to write scripts from the gut. Scarface, Year of the Dragon, Platoon, even JFK were perhaps flawed, and in some ways might be considered dated today, but they were a well placed punch to the ribs in their time. Looking back I consider Stone to be kind of a chisel and hammer sculptor at movie making, both in script writing and directing. I agree to Sean Penn's comment that his basic hog nature stands in his way of achieving his true potential. And I mean this in the most flattering way possible. Sadly, I begin to think that he has lost even his hog nature in favor of a more soft day time drama sensitivity.Wall Street I believe is an OK movie, which seen in '88 could have been viewed as powerful, but most of all turned out as a great Douglas vehicle. Greed is good? Well, tell that to the billions who feed of 2 bucks a day. No, greed is not good, and Stone makes insinuations in both movies to the rotten system and its proliferation. But there was no need for a sequel to make that point. Greed is however good as a movie quote. Wall Street 2 is kind of a spin on the consequences of that quote. Was it ironically prophetic? Perhaps, but the WS 2010 version is diluted and looks weirdly dated. The score...the horror, the 80's music with no regard to circumstance..characters appearing out of nowhere to justify the development of the script, daughters, mothers out of nowhere.. Douglas is no longer Gekko, and does not try hard to be. Shia is a better actor than Sheen but his character alone is not worth a sequel, and frankly looks more like an intern talking out of place at the meeting table, as for the current financial crisis, its being oversimplified. As for Carey Mulligan, man, I'll take an airhead blonde in her place anyday, even Daryl Hannah.The last scene is however the most disturbing to me. A Happy Ending?are you kidding? Are you turning soft? If yes do a big screen adaptation of One Tree Hill and get it over with. Don't spoil the memory of one of your past successes.There was a time I would have expected a comment of the collapse of Building no 7 from Stone. Not any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS': Three Stars (Out of Five) Michael Douglas reprises one of his most famous roles, Gordon Gekko, in this sequel to the 1987 hit co-written and directed by Oliver Stone. Stone once again directs and casts Shia LaBeouf (one of my favorite young actors) in the lead (taking over for Charlie Sheen, *spoiler* who makes a small appearance in the film *end spoiler*). The film also stars Carey Mulligan, Josh Brolin, Eli Wallach, Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon. With such an impressive ensemble of talent both in front of and behind the camera you'd think they could have came up with a better movie than this. I wasn't a huge fan of the first film; I'm not interested in Wall Street in any way and characters (and people) fascinated only by self preservation and financial gain are boring and disgusting to me. With that said the original film was still somewhat interesting and well made and Douglas was great in it. Here his on screen time is kept to a minimum and although he was a supporting player in the first film he was still the most fascinating thing about it and they should have capitalized on that with the sequel. LeBeouf is good but he's been better, he's much more of a gifted quirky comedic actor than a serious dramatic one.In the film LaBeouf plays Jake Moore; a young trader in love with Winnie Gekko (Mulligan) daughter of Gordon. Winnie despises her father and wants nothing to do with him. Moore is fascinated by the man though and introduces himself to Gordon at a conference. Gordon is intrigued by Moore as well and sees a way back in to a relationship with his daughter, as well as possibly a puppet to use. The two meet secretly as Gordon councils Moore on his Wall Street plans of revenge for the death of his mentor Louis Zabel (Langella) against the man they believe is responsible Bretton James (Brolin). In exchange Jake tries to reconcile Winnie with her father.The film begins in 2008, right before economic disaster as Gordon Gekko predicts. A film dealing more with this subject would have been much more interesting. The character study, love story and family relationship are all adequate but they could have been much better. The revenge tale is a good plot devise but not effectively played out. There's a lot of different stories going on here that aren't balanced out very well and kind of take away from one another. Stone's directing is interesting at times but he's gotten soft and a little unfocused in his old age. The film should be much darker and compelling; there's no real danger or despair in this movie. The film is surprisingly family friendly as a result (the original was anything but). The movie has a lot of potential but it just doesn't deliver.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8w-4xZ94ZU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We'll most sequels that come out of really good movies are horrible, and this one does not disappoint in that regard. Shia was horribly miscast, awful, and unconvincing in his role, basically playing the equivalent to Sheens' brilliant Bud Fox performance, but failing miserably. He lacked intensity in the performance, almost as if he was too immature to play the role. I love Michael Douglas, but his performance also lacked the intensity from the original. He was 10 times better as Gekko in the first film. I like Gekko much better as a sadistic sodomizer of the stock market in the first film, and so will probably everyone else who is a big fan of the first film. He was like Mary Poppins in this film, which I feel detracts from his incredible performance as the original Gekko. Also, the Charlie Sheen cameo as Bud Fox meeting with Gekko was also pretty cheap, and unnecessary. Seeing the two together on screen just reminded of how bad this movie was compared to the genius original.</fullReview>

Then Stone insults our intelligence and destroys his movie by implementing the cookie-cutter happy ending.Let's see: the bad guy (Brolin) gets caught. Gekko turns over a new leaf and apologizes, the couple gets back together, the mother becomes a nurse again and the fusion energy scientist gets his $100 million dollars.The audience leaves the theater happy after the ending scene with the baby's birthday party, right? What a load of crap ...The inconsistency in this ending and the ridiculous implausibility of Mulligan accepting her father's apology after he *#@%ed her again (he justifies his behavior by saying "I guess we're all mixed bags) weakens or destroys any message that Stone was trying to send about greed.What a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money may never sleep, but I had a hard time staying awake. The problem is that the character at the center of the movie, Jake Moore (Shia LeBoeuf), is no Bud Fox. (And by the way, the choicest bit in this movie is Charlie Sheen's cameo where we learn what happened to Fox after he pleaded guilty.) Bud was a striver, and we saw him striving. Jake is supposed to have arrived. He's the protégé and golden boy of his firm's chairman, who cuts him a $1.5 million extraordinary bonus check when the firm is crashing. We're told he's a hotshot trader. But we never see him display any of the talent and drive that made him this money. Every financial decision he makes in the movie is a bad one, driven either by emotion or idealism. He's a schmuck, and a schmuck isn't believable in the position Stone puts him.Gordon Gekko isn't as much fun the second time around. He's still a devious rascal, with one big double cross in him, and an unabashed delight in playing the game he now affects to despise. But the big speech Stone gives him -- a lecture at Fordham -- isn't anywhere near as good as Greed Is Good from the original. That speech was coherent, and presented in one piece. It was an LBO guy's appeal to the shareholders to throw out entrenched management, and it made the case for doing it. This speech is chopped up like a bad action sequence; it's full of buzz words and laugh lines, it displays the Gekko charm, but it doesn't come close to its predecessor as either explanation or advocacy. Exposition is usually boring, but Michael Douglas could have put across much more than Stone gives him to do.Stone, of course, is never subtle; there's a scene in Central Park with kids blowing soap bubbles that just hammers you over the head. There are too many establishing shots of Manhattan, to no real purpose, and not enough day to day finance. Susan Sarandon has a nice cameo as Jake's mother, who has gone from being a nurse, to a real estate agent, to an overextended small time house flipper out on Long Island, but she's the only effort to put this into a larger context. At least the ending is appropriately pessimistic -- the individual villain gets pushed under the bus, but his firm, "Churchill Schwartz," goes on, and Jake's closing voice-over tells us that crashes kill off the weaker players but never end the game.I'm still waiting for Michael Lewis to sell out to Hollywood and write the finance movie he alone is capable of writing.</fullReview>

Lousy cinematography, in which heads are cut off in the frame, subjects get lost in street scenes, is pieced together with pan shots of Manhattan?enough already! I got the feeling that director Stone was providing an old-folks home for actors who can't give up their glory days, e.g. Sylvia Miles and Eli Wallach. There are way too many characters wandering around in this film. Only Michael Douglas lights up the screen, as does Susan Sarandon, briefly, when she comes on as a Jewish mother and realtor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original didn't need cheeseball editing effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former powerbroker Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) has been laying low. Well, he's been laying in a prison and plotting a comeback. After release he gets to promoting his latest book and comes across young trader Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf), who happens to be engaged to his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan). While Gordon wants to redeem himself in his daughter's eyes, Jake is looking for some insight to plot revenge against high roller Bretton James (Josh Brolin), the man who shut down his old firm.Has it really been a year since we last crossed paths with The Beef? I'd say he's grown, but Shia has always struck me as near 20 because I never saw his show Even Stevens. As Jake he's mature and goal driven, but I don't sense the authority that Charlie Sheen gave Bud Fox despite the nearly identical character. As before, the sea is parted for Gordon Gekko to grab focus. He has the best lines, he's the draw, and Michael Douglas owns him.The exposition may require insider trading to clear up the jargon, but there is no doubt that the editing takes too many liberties for a movie aimed at adults. This isn't Scott Pilgrim. It isn't necessary to throw animations at the screen during a simple explanation over machinery. What really cooks my bacon is a short scene with Jake and Minnie in a car. Jake's phone rings and not only does the woman he's speaking with float into view but a little instant messaging derived sound effect completes the effect. Much of the first act is scarred with these moments of narrative breaking indulgence.In recent years the trend of sequel hunting has found ways to dust off the cobwebs and in a few cases the characters don't behave the way we expect them to the second time around. In Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps an effort is made to humanize Gordon and though I found some of his actions out of character, the idea that people can change seems to be a big message behind the film. From my experience it seems that some folks change while others get worse, and I had Mr. Gekko pegged for the latter. Regardless, his actions have to fit your personal philosophy for you to deem them believable and I felt that too often he went outside the established persona.On the second pass there isn't a lot of surprise and the awe of trading stock isn't quite what it used to be. You don't even get to see the floor, and if Stone had focused on it I'm sure the audience would be less than amped thanks to the digital revolution reducing the paper streams and shouting. Otherwise there isn't enough new in the way of story and liberties taken in presenting it are overbearing. The original didn't need cheeseball editing effects to lift the audience out of slumber; pity the new generation is deemed so short in temper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is Good, but the First was Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wonderfully shot, but wildly predictable Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps shouldn't expect the same reaction when it comes to award season as its predecessor. Heck, even the first wasn't great, but it certainly had ten times a better script. And that's the saddest part of this update.It sure was great seeing Douglas reprise his Gordon "Greed" Gekko role, and I would certainly watch a Wall Street III: Rise of the Dollar Store, strictly for him, as I would jump at the chance to see Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal again in More Silence, Less Lambs. But, man?maybe it was, in fact, greed that caused him to say yes to this horrid script that contained not one, two, three, four, but about five endings. In fact, the highlight of the movie was around a half hour before it ended ? Gordon in London, and it would've been an excellent way to finish the movie. But no.And not only did the film overstay its welcome, probably due to the fact they knew there wouldn't be another opportunity to revisit these characters ? SEE: Lethal Weapon 4's four climaxes, it changed the "YES! FINALLY!" first climax into a Glee-fully uneven and uncharacteristic ending.Gekko (Douglas) is released from prison after serving years for a "victimless" crime and after a few more years, he writes a book. Why? Well, no reason that I could come up with, aside from getting himself back in the news so that his daughter, Winnie (Mulligan) and her boyfriend, Jake (LaBeouf) can see him. Immediately, we see fire and brimstone in her eyes and, yep, we know where this is going.In another predictable plot, let's refer to as PLOT B, Jake's an up'n'coming Wall Street junkie (SEE: Sheen in Wall Street) but after receiving a huge bonus from his faux-pas father (Langella) he helps the economy, badly. When (PLOT C) Jake's company starts a downward spiral, fails to get a government bailout (PLOT D) and is ruthlessly attempted to be taken over (PLOT E) by Bretton James (Brolin) said faux-pas father is pushed out. (PLOT F) Literally.PLOT F's main function, but goes almost nowhere, is to show the revenge Jake wants on Bretton and this blends in with PLOT G: Gekko. Sorry for a spoiler, but you know EXACTLY what Gekko is up to once he "strategically" places himself into Jake's life. (Side Note: that doesn't spoil the fun on watching Douglas work his charms once again, regardless.)Gekko is now a "recovered" human being and wants only to be back in his daughter's life (PLOT G meets PLOT A) and he partially uses Jake's vengeance, Bretton's ambitions and the current state of the economy and bailouts (PLOT G now collides with E, F and D) to get his daughter back in his life. PLOT H is too much of a spoiler, though easy to see coming, and that winds its way through the other PLOTs.Whoa, Douglas's The Game didn't have so many overlapping story lines. And I've actually left out another couple dozen side plots, mostly involving the timeframe this was set in: mostly 2008. But, the main plot line involves Gekko wants to redeem himself, get his daughter back and move on?or does he?Even though the movie had splendid NYC views and Douglas was great, as usual, the over-stuffed and foreseen script, the unnecessary extra half-hour and the ho-hum acting sincerely ruined the experience it could've been. And leave it to Shia LaBeouf to enter into another franchise (Transformers, Indiana Jones) and bring virtually nothing to the table. He is quickly becoming the next Keanu Reeves in regards to luck in landing roles because, frankly, he isn't the best actor out there. Mediocre is being nice.The rest of the cast were either middle of the road, laughable, over-the-top or just plain boring. Mulligan her set couldn't hit a note if she slammed on piano keys. Langella had eyes as wide as the NYC skyline you'll see half a dozen times or more. And poor, poor Sarandon, one of my personal favorites, went back to first year acting school.The only other performance, other than Douglas's, that was noteworthy would be a cameo that I won't reveal, but you know he/she's coming. Just maybe not when.Overall, the movie's good enough for video, especially when you can stop the movie when Gekko Goes to Great Britain and to see the original character(s) again. Anyone that loved the first (sorry, not me) might feel a little nostalgia, but will probably be mostly disappointed. The rest of us will probably be mostly bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the original Wall Street very much, mainly because of its energy and its strident critic against the personal and professional excesses from the North American financial leaders, but I could not understand some elements from the screenplay very well, due to the fact I am not very familiarized with economic issues.The financial jargon in the sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, is more comprehensible (at least in my case), because it revolves around the worldwide economic crisis from 2008, which keeps being felt to nowadays.Besides, I have to say I liked this fascinating sequel a bit more than the original film.I generally like the work of director Oliver Stone very much, but I have been disappointed by some of his movies.In his most "mature" (translation: bland) works, such as Nixon, Alexander and W., I did not find any traces of the maniac energy and aggressive style from his best films (which are, in my humble opinion, JFK, Natural Born Killers and The Doors).Fortunately, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps shows us to Stone in a much better shape, which is relentless but precise and perfectly modulated, at the same time he is able to hypnotize us with almost every scene, and to keep us in suspense with the help of sharp dialogs full of meaning and emotion.I think the best elements from Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are its intelligent screenplay and great performances.Michael Douglas brings an extraordinary work, because he perfectly shows us the multiple facets from his character on a credible way.Shia LaBeouf had left me impressed with his performance in the film A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and he also brings a perfect performance in here.And I also liked the performances from Josh Brolin and the great Frank Langella very much.I will refuse to mention the message from this film in here.Suffice to say is that the moralist angle is well mixed with the experiences from the characters and their intense emotions, so we never feel that we are being given ethic lessons.The only thing I can say against Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is that I found the scenes with Susan Sarandon to be a little bit unnecessary.Nevertheless, that does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending this excellent movie, because this is definitely first-class entertainment, something we are unfortunately not very used to find in modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slowly booms, ends in early recession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the first movie a few weeks prior, I was excited to see the return of Gordon Gekko (and even just Michael Douglas, having not been the lead in a film for a few years now). I enjoyed the first film, however being a person born in the nineties, I could not relate to what several people now look back on and remember as "the excess of the 80s" etc etc I found Wall Street 2 to be relevant and as authentic in its portrayal of the GFC as a mainstream commercial Hollywood movie could be. Frank Langella does a good job of portraying the struggle and vulnerability that many suffered - you really do feel for the guy. Meanwhile, Brolin does an equally good job of being the guy you love to hate, great casting. Every time he merely showed up on screen, he annoyed me. Once the impact of the crisis on Louis Zabel (Langella's character) occurs and once Jake (LaBeouf's character) starts turning to Gekko for guidance, the movie starts to heat up.Being a business student I enjoyed knowing all the terms and references (Tulipomania was nice). Even if you're not in business, it's still pretty easy to follow, although some conversations you may find quite boring and tedious.Charlie Sheen makes a cameo as Bud Fox but seems to just be his character on Two and a Half Men. Would have been nice to see more fire between Gekko and Fox. After all Gekko goes onto emphasize all the hardships that he has been through in prison throughout the movie.Susan Sarandon's character correctly emphasized the shift of people's perceptions towards the property market (they can only go up in America right?) Gekko's presentation was eerily reminiscent of my own economic lecturer's lectures so I'd have to say the writers did their research well. HOWEVER, Jake tries to speak a bit of Chinese to impress the Chinese business people and um according to my Chinese friend it didn't make sense lol.There's a scene where you think Jake will get Gekko back by blackmail or the like but instead pulls on Gekko's heartstrings (won't give a way too much). This scene is the start of the movie's downturn. Gekko ends up righting his wrong several months later (for reasons unknown) but even then would he even be forgivable? Since it's likely that by then he would have made much more than the principle he gives back. He also manages to show up at the same time that Jake bumps into Winnie...what a convenient family reunion just in time for an even more convenient cheesy and cliché ending! For its (mostly) well researched script, as accurate as you can be portrayal of the GFC in a commercial Hollywood movie and solid performances by the cast, the movie was a joy to watch. Definitely could have been better though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History repeating itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a 23-year wait Oliver Stone has made his first sequel ever to his 1987 film Wall Street. With recent events involving the banking crisis, sub-prime mortgages and toxic debt a film with Gordon Gekko is timely.Set in 2008 just before and during the financial crisis Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) is a ambitious young trader who specialised in investing alternative energy. He lives with Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), who runs a left-wing website and has a hostile relationship with her father, Gordon (Michael Douglas). When Jacob's bank collapses, his mentor and father figure Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) kills himself when he is humiliated by the head of another bank, Bretton James (Josh Brolin). Gordon Gekko starts to predict the impending banking crisis and Jacob turns to the old banker for help. Jacob promises to help Gekko get back in touch with his daughter and Gekko and give Gekko would give the young man the dirt on James. But James promises that he can help Jacob get the investment a company making fusion energy.Gordon Gekko was one of the most iconic characters of the 1980s and one of Douglas most well known roles. He was a symbol of the 80s, about the idea of making a shed lot of money from investing in other businesses. He is a figure of love or hate depending on your views on the stock market and the Reganite economic system. In Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps he is now a antihero, who works with Jacob to bring down the worst elements of the new banking system where debt was sold in a way to avoid 'risk', but really just masking a problem. Douglas really dominates the role and was the key to the film, someone who does get down and dirty but Stone and the writers do try to humanise him. But Gekko is best when he is his old self. Still Douglas is best thing about the film.Stone recruits a good cast: Mulligan, Brolin and Susan Sarandon. But it was LaBeouf who is the star of film. He is obviously trying to show he is more then the star of the Transformers film and he actually starring in a prestige picture. He gives a solid performance and he will properly will become a better actor then Megan Fox (who star is already declining). There were some really good flashes from LaBeouf like when he is upset over Lou's death, but he was wooden at other times. Mulligan gives a very good performance and her American accent was flawless. And well, Brolin has been a strong actor for a years and his performance was good.Stone had an interesting approach to directing this film: the camera work that Rodrigo Prieto used was effective, moving at the camera at just the right time to reflect an emotion or keep a scene of continuity. Some people have complained that Stone should not have put numbers flash on the screen or using split screen but I feel it adds to the sense of the work in a investment bank. Though it was weird in one scene where Jacob takes a phone call in and the person on the other ends comes up as a bubble on top of Winnie's head in a almost cartoon like way. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is also a film had to make visual, with a lot of computer graphics being use and the show of how fusion energy would work: making the film look like something from a Saturday morning sci-fi cartoon. Stone also had to add a motorbike chase just to make something more exciting. The film is too long and slow at times, whilst the ending and final third felt rushed, unrealistic and hokey in a typical Hollywood fashion.Stone does try and make banking an interest and it is a good commentary of the banking crisis. But nowadays most stockbrokers are just men and women who stare at figures on a computer screen and trading invisible stocks, not caring or knowing how it affects people. Stone could have shown more about how bankers ended up going to the government for help to allow them to survive and then rewarded themselves with a nice big bonus with public money. Mark Kermode mention that one of the big themes of Wall Street was that there was a conflict between people who made money to people who made thing: in the sequel a similar theme, involving invest in things that involve the lives of people and society to other men and women who just look for a quick buck rather then look at the long term game. It is possible for people to make more money from a long term investment. As a environmentalist I want to see oil company collapse very quickly when alternatives are viable.Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps will mostly appeal to people are interested in economics and banking, but there is enough there for other people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street: MNS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone could pull off a sequel of his own film and make it better and more in depth than the first film it would have to be Oliver Stone. His movie of course is Wall Street from 1987 and the sequel to it is Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. A more fitting subtitle could not have been chosen for this movie. The reason being is that is is always moving forward and some times at a pace that is hard to catch up with or keep pace with, but this is not a bad thing.The story of Wall Street: MNS is not really about one person as it is about the world that the characters are set in and how they interact with it. The movie starts out with Gordon Gekko with Michael Douglas reprising his role from Wall Street getting out of prison in 2001. Gekko has nothing but a gym bag, his clothing and a few possessions and no one to meet him. The movie moves forward to 2008 and we see that Gekko has written a book called "Is Greed Good?" and is promoting it on cable talking heads shows. We also meet Gordon's daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) and her boy-friend Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf) who is a trader at a top brokerage house. Winnie is part of a web based news service and both live in New York City.Jake in the process of the movie gets a huge bonus check from his boss Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) and is told to spend it. As we see Zabel's firm has bought something it should not have is is going broke. In fact it does go broke and is bought by a rival firm for $3 a share. Zabel does something rash after falling from his post as a king of wall street. Learning of Gekko giving a speech Jake goes without telling Winnie who is estranged from Gekko. The two talk and you see the start of a relationship right away. Time moves on and Jake learns that the head of the rival firm was in fact shorting Zabel's company with private money. This firm's head is Bretton James (Josh Brolin). Jake looking for revenge for Zabel makes moves in the market causing James' firm to losing 110 million. James is so impressed that fact he wants to hire Jake away from what is left of Zabel's firm to work for him. In the back ground of this there are some stories growing. One is the relationship between Jake and is mother Susan Sarandon who has gotten into buy and selling real estate on Long Island and is in trouble. Also Jake and Gekko become closer still yet to the point Jake ask Gekko to dinner with his daughter to try to get them together. If fails but Jake tries again at a charity ball where he gets Gekko in and he and Winnie meet up again. This time they start to bound.Now Jake is trying to get 100 million dollars for a fusion energy company out in California or it will go under. His company is trying to get the Chinese to invest the money in a solar panel manufacturing company. Jake sees it as a major mistake and wants the money sent to his choice. Things are looking his way when James tells him that it will go toward the solar panel company. Jake confronts James about shorting Zabel's company while buying it at the same time for dirt cheap. Of course he quits and goes to Gekko who is signing books. The two talk and Jake learns that Winnie will get 100 million dollars when she turns 25. Jake sees it as his way to get the money to his energy company. After convincing Winnie to get the money and have Gekko laundry it so it can be sent to the energy company Jake and Winnie wait for the money. It never arrives and Gekko is in the wind too. Jake and Winnie break up shortly after she gets pregnant. Jake finds Gekko who is in London running his own firm and doing well at it. Jake shows the sonogram of the baby and gives Gekko a choice. Give the 100 million dollars back and be a part of the babies life or be estranged for life. Gekko does not give up the money.In the final act of the movie we see Jake writing. He takes two stories to Winnie to put on her website. One about the fusion power plant and one about James doing illegal trading from his own accounts. Both hit the street and start to move around at a quick pace. James is brought under investigation by the feds and there is interest in the power plant to get the money it needs. At the end of the Wall Street: MNS Jake and Winnie get back together after Gekko gives 100 million to the power plant company and ask to be in their lives with the baby.First off it takes place during the almost collapse of the entire financial system. You see in this movie not only the interaction of the characters but are told how it happened and the reasons behind it. Deep down Wall Street: MNS is a look at how we got the world we live in now and how to avoid it if we choose to learn the lessons.With this in mind and the complexities of the story Oliver Stone does an almost perfect job of weaving together all the elements of this script. The camera work is perfect and the originality of how it was shot is powerful. The acting of everyone is top notch but the key to the movie is Michael Douglas who is the key to holding the movie together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gekko as prophet. Wow, what a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a searing indictment on the venality of financial interests who almost destroyed the economy of the world in their reckless and selfish quest to get rich quick - at everyone else's expense. What's worse, when the financial system started collapsing, the highest levels of the government panicked and, responding to scare tactics that were utterly transparent, caved in to demands that the government fork over hundreds of billions of dollars of public money to bail out the system that the inside traders had ruined. The movie raises this question: what would have happened if the federal government had flat out told the banks, "You're on you own." Would the atm's stopped spewing out money? Would the banks have closed? Or were these alarmist predictions of doom just part of a transparent ploy on the part of some to shake down the taxpayers? What a Gordon Gekko did in the 1980s would have attracted scant attention if done today. Then, it took inside trading, cleverly concealed, to gain unfair advantage and earn public scorn. Now, according to the movie, mere innuendo is enough to start a panic and destroy entire brokerage houses, leaving behind the wreckage for the financial vultures to pick through at leisure. To knowingly disseminate false rumors in order to affect trading is a federal offense, but one would never know it from watching this movie. Here, EVERYONE, including the good guy, is violating the law as brokers use the trading floor to settle personal scores. In one scene, the good guy spreads an untrue rumor which causes the bad guy to lose 142 million dollars. One hundred forty two million dollars of capital, money that could have been used to build a hospital, schools, day care centers, down the drain, vanished, gone forever! That is economic warfare of the lowest and nastiest variety. Yet, according to this movie, that's business as usual and government regulators are no where to be found. It is as if those regulatory agencies don't even exist. Wow, what a movie! One might say that it's just a movie, don't read too much into it. Yet the events of 2008 did happen, so the movie is more than mere hyperbole. If anything, this movie probably understates the extent of the damage done. Josh Brolin should be nominated for an Academy Award for his outstanding performance as the most detestable white-collar snob since Cal Hockley in Titanic. And Michael Douglas should be nominated for an award for best actor in a movie where the heel becomes a hero and the cynic becomes a sage.Banks and investment houses have a fiduciary responsibility to safeguard the money entrusted to them by investors. It's not their money. When this simple axiom is forgotten, then the problems start, as this movie so aptly dramatizes. After watching this movie, one may think twice before investing money in the stock market. Not that this is a new story or should come as a surprise, but this movie drives home the point in a most unambiguous way. There is a legal term called fiduciary responsibility. That means when party A invests money with party B, party B promises to manage the money in the best interest of party A, and not to gamble with the money. After all, it's not party B's money. As we all know by now, by 2008 fiduciary responsibility had gone out the window, triggering a huge financial meltdown that ultimately required unprecedented bailouts by the government to keep the system from collapsing. What Gordon Gekko did in the 1980s would be a mere sideshow compared to the tens of billions of dollars lost in risky and financially unsound investments since 2008. Gekko is no longer the bad guy, he is now a prophet, a sage. His mantra has been transferred to an even more sinister character, Bretton Wood, admirably played by Josh Brolin, who makes Gekko look like Little Lord Fauntleroy at the piggy bank. The theatrics notwithstanding, this movie conveys an unmistakable message: investor beware - the money you invest is not secure. Unfortunately, history bears this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into the theater, my first impression was that this was going to be hard to follow and just about how this bank is struggling. But it turned out to be something much more. This film felt both emotionally strong and morally strong. It had such a strong feeling to it as to how much you would hate the Josh Brolin character and how many mixed feelings for Michael Douglous. It was also fun to see that Eligh Wallac appeared in it to. This film is a true masterpiece in which Oliver Stone really made an impact as to what dose it mean to have a meaning full life, and to what will make a difference in the world. This film has a strong moral to it and I really recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Never Sleeps...And Neither Does Gordon Gekko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1987, director Oliver Stone's financial drama WALL STREET turned out to be a very prescient critique of the Reagan era's legacy of greed and excess, personified in the character of corporate raider extraordinaire Gordon Gekko, played to an Oscar-winning tee by Michael Douglas. Twenty-three years later, Stone returned to the world of high-stakes finance for his first-ever honest-to-goodness sequel, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS; and he and Douglas have resurrected Mr. Gekko. Only this time, instead of being a corporate raider, he is trying hard to be a changed man.In this case, after years in prison, Douglas is out to burn his back pages from those heady "Greed Is Good" days by writing a best-selling book that turns it into a question ("Is Greed Good?"). He then meets up with an ambitious young stockbroker (Shia LeBeouf) who, as it turns out, not only admires him but is intent on marrying his daughter (Carey Mulligan) who, at the moment, isn't about to get back to her disgraced father. But Douglas sees a way back in when he learns how LeBeouf has fallen under the spell of a corporate leech (Josh Brolin) whose actions have led to the suicide of LeBeouf's boss (Frank Langella), and who, not so ironically, was the one who put Douglas in jail. Though there's a little bit of the old Gekko in him, Douglas is more intent on getting revenge on Brolin, while at the same time attempting to save LeBeouf from going to prison, and getting back on good terms with Mulligan.Stone's commitment to character and plot, redolent in all of his best films from PLATOON through the original WALL STREET to JFK, NIXON, and WORLD TRADE CENTER, is very evident here in MONEY NEVER SLEEPS; and as he shows, the high-stakes casino that Wall Street was in the Reagan era has now grown into a high-tech monster that, in 2008, was threatening to swallow all of America whole. And while Douglas may have been softened from what Stone had shown him as in the original, there is still a lot of that craftiness left in Gekko, only this time directed at saving rather than destroying. LeBeouf and Mulligan do good turns here, as does the legendary Eli Wallach in a prominent cameo role (amusingly, LeBeouf's cell phone rings with the theme from THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, the legendary 1967 Sergio Leone spaghetti western in which Wallach played a bandido).Just like the original, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS will likely be seen as emblematic of its time--a film that saw America's hubris bite the nation and the world on its behind, but where a couple of decent people did the right thing to avoid the ultimate financial abyss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson as relevant as it is important, this sequel a fine drama through and through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty-three years ago, Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987) came out at a time when the world was reeling from the shock of an economic crisis defined by Black Monday, the day of 19 October 1987 when the global stock market suffered the largest one-day percentage decline. Stone's movie introduced audiences to a world that was largely alien to many-, a world hidden inside the Ivory Towers of our financial institutions- and more significantly, to the people behind these institutions whom his lead character Gordon Gecko represented."Greed is good!" said Gordon, a by-now iconic line that no doubt inadvertently served as inspiration for stock traders since then. And apparently, that greed has been left unchecked for the past 23 years- where Gordon himself aptly observes- it has since become legal. Like its predecessor, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" comes at a time when the world is still reeling from the shock of an economic crisis, one that has since been dubbed the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. So despite coming more than two decades after Michael Douglas career-defining (read: Academy Award) performance, there's really no question whether or not this sequel is still relevant. It is, and very much so in fact, as Stone's savvy writers Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff have skilfully adapted the real-life fates of Bear Sterns and JP Morgan into Keller Zabel Investments (KWI) and Churchill Schwartz respectively for the film. KWI is where young hotshot Jake Moore works at- one of its lion head founders Louis Zabel (Frank Langella) like a father figure to him. But the crisis takes its toll on KWI and as its stock price plunges, the bank finds itself in meetings with the Federal Reserve Board, mirroring the fate of Bear Sterns right down to the paltry single-digit share price negotiated by the government for JP Morgan. Zabel succumbs to the pressure and commits suicide, leading Jake to set his sights on Schwartz's head honcho Bretton James (Josh Brolin), the arrogant manipulator responsible for proposing the ludicrous buyout package to Zabel. Jake gains Bretton's trust by displaying his financial acumen, and a large part of the subsequent cat-and-mouse game depends on your understanding of certain inherently complex economic concepts like sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. Through graphs on the New York skyline, split-screens and TV news clips, Stone tries his best to explain these concepts to his audience- though despite his efforts, unless you're a finance major, you're unlikely to comprehend all the intricacies. Still, you're likely to grasp more than enough to gasp at the absurdities behind the financial apocalypse- the power-players behind the banks whose greed precipitated the crisis in the first place, the brokering with the Federal Reserve for more liquidity in order to keep them afloat (we're too big to fail they say) and the sheer ignorance of their own level of exposure. Stone does not disguise his own leanings on the subject (even appearing in a brief cameo) but he knows better than to preach to his audience or get in the way of what already is compelling by virtue of its authenticity. This sequel is also richer for expanding on the representations in the earlier film. Bretton is the new Gekko, the new breed of smarmy Wall Street sharks whose unbridled greed for money thrives in shades of grey and 'moral hazards'. Gekko on the other hand has become somewhat of a mentor for Jake, the Charlie Sheen-Bud Fox equivalent in this sequel. His ambition no means diminished, Gekko is the older generation whose instincts are sharper and shrewder- his observations on the current state of the financial crisis accurate and critical. And Jake is the proverbial hotshot hoping to make his name, the finance majors who go from the classrooms of the Ivy League colleges into the offices of the big names on Wall Street. Against this backdrop, Stone weaves in a strong family story. Jake's fiancé, Winnie (Carey Mulligan) estranged from her father, Gekko, blames him for the death of her brother. While Jake tries to patch relations between Winnie and Gekko, he has intentions of his own seeking advice from Gekko behind Winnie's back. Each of these characters and their motivations are nicely fleshed out, and the twists and turns of their fates are food for thought of the often polarising choices between family and money and its concomitant consequences. Stone also has a great cast assembled for the film. With a grayer head of hair, Michael Douglas returns in excellent form as Gordon Gekko, bringing a fresh sensibility to his role brought on by the years of experience. Shia LaBeouf acquits himself admirably in a dramatic role that doesn't require him to get jumpy the way he usually acts (see Transformers and Indiana Jones). Carey Mulligan is heartbreakingly good as the moral centre of the film. Brolin- fresh off Stone's last film W.- more than fills the shoes as the villain-equivalent Gordon here. Other veterans like Susan Sarandon as Jake's mother and Eli Wallach as Schwartz's patriarch steal the brief scenes they are in. But the greatest praise should be reserved for Oliver Stone, whose return to Wall Street finds him at his most assured and confident for many years. He directs with the proceedings with brio and verve, accompanied by an appropriately retro soundtrack by David Bryne and Brian Eno, as well as Rodrigo Prieto's luscious cinematography. Just as admirable was his patience at holding back this sequel until 23 years later, a wait that has proved astute in providing the film with a keen sense of relevance. Not only is it relevant, it is also important as a cautionary tale- even more so if one ponders the stronghold our financial institutions have over all our businesses and activities today, including the very financing of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to the first, it's a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as modern Hollywood films go, WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS is all right. As a sequel to one of the best films of the '80s, it's a complete disappointment, with a watered-down script and even Oliver Stone off the boil. What happened to all the energy you used to find in his films? This one is sluggish and as a director he seems almost disinterested in the material.There are some good things about this film, but they're mostly the bits that reflect the first. Inevitably, Michael Douglas is the best thing in it, but he's given way too little screen time and there's a betrayal of his character in the first movie in that he's softened up this time around; he's not the Gordon Gekko of old. Josh Brolin's corporate bad guy is all right, but the two youthful leads, Shia LaBeouf and Carey Mulligan, are absolutely horrible.LaBeouf is just out of his depth here and his acting stinks. The only film I liked him in was LAWLESS and all the rest have suffered as a result of his attempts at performance. Even worse is the single-expressioned Carey Mulligan's, whose perma-sad face is by far the most irritating thing in the whole movie. I almost had to look away every time she was on screen, she's that awful.The material starts off half-interesting, but the storyline takes ages to develop. The first hour or so retains the attention, but then there's a long, dry patch in the middle before things pick up a little at the end. Unfortunately, the final opinion I came away with is that this is a lazy cash-in, nothing more. A film that concentrated on Gekko alone without any of this kid stuff would have been much more gripping...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPSIt was as good as the original.Again, there were moments I didn't understand, but not as much as the first one. I followed this one a bit more, but this film is also more about their personal lives and not just the stock exchange.Original cast member Michael Douglas returns as Gordon Gekko. And he really didn't change much. He is still very much an unlikable character and he does not care who he crushes along the way. This time he decides the person to take him to where he wants to go is Shia LaBeouf, who is marrying his daughter and a successful Wall Street guy.Other cast members were Carey Mulligan, Frank Langella &amp; Josh Brolin.The acting was very good... and the story was slightly better than the original.It was great to see Charlie Sheen make a cameo too... I was wondering if he would show up. I am glad he did. It was also really funny at the beginning when Gordon got released from prison, he was getting his possessions back. He got a massive 80's mobile phone. :)I will give this film 6 out of 10.It was enjoyable and a bit easier to follow than the original.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline and a very talented cast.I know a lot of people were disappointed by this movie compared to the original Wall Street,but I honestly preferred,because the other one had a very dark setting to it that I didn't like,a lot of people probably did,and I also preferred Gordon Gekko as as a person in this.It felt very different,because the first one really felt like a Sheen family movie,since Charlie Sheen is the main character and Martin Sheen plays a role in it as well,its completely different in this,although I was happy they gave Charlie Sheen a cameo as Bud Fox and lets us know what happened to him after the events of Wall Street.I was also really impressed with Shia LaBeouf,its the first time I could take him seriously as an actor.I really don't see what critics problem was with this movie,I really enjoyed it and feel people who enjoyed Wall Street will like this too,it takes place exactly where the first left off,and Michael Douglas is as good as ever.After he is released from prison,Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) meets up with the man who is going to marry his daughter,and also has similar business problems that Bud Fox had,Gordon helps him out with his own business skills.Meanwhile,Gordon try's to win back his daughters love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went through that rich bunch called "simple" and "ordinary" on a comically jarring background of Talking Heads up to the point where Labeouf's character received a check of 1 500 000$. Just like that.Does he goes crazy? Well, about as much as if you received twos pays on one check. That is, in a nutshell, what sums up my experience best with this movie. How come these parasitic vultures, who live by making rich people richer at the expenses of the common man, can justify such a salary when the whole economy pays for it? Gecko's daughter claims to be a non-materialistic gal, who can be contented by something like a "modest" 150 000/year salary, but it's easy for her to say, since she is in fact, a multi millionaire. How can one who works blood, sweat and tears for a pity for their satanic majesties' requests can relate to such characters? Furthermore, the movies' psychology is simplistic enough that it not only insult my social status, but also my intelligence. The bad guys can't be more obvious - they're the ones who are pushing for oil; That is supposed to make us look at the "alternate energy sources" brokers as some philanthropic saviours, friends of humanity. I don't know if I should laugh or cry. On a technical level, the flick is excellent, with great (if uninspired) camera shots and excellent actor casting - they're almost all good, Frank Langella being the best one there is. The problem is, like at many high places in the US of A, that the elites are totally detached from reality - the few times the film attempted social salvation were the most cynically hilarious ones. It's my fault, too... Why do I keep renting these?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been better with a different cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved "Wall Street". Michael Douglas' portrayal of Gordon Gekko was legendary and his performance deserved the Academy Award.I had mixed feelings for a sequel: I was initially excited but then thought about the state of Hollywood films in the 21st century. While there are many exceptions, in my opinion, the films today are inferior compared to when the original was released: if the script stinks--just add a lot of CGI! Then I saw the cast: I knew I would wait for the film on TV when I saw Shia Labeouf cast as Gordon's to be son-in-law. I also groaned when I saw Susan Sarandon and Eli Wallach cast as well. One can see that when a director is out of it for a while or off his game--like Stone and George Lucas--their casting magic is lost. The original film had such realistic and charismatic casting (ok--except Daryl Hannah). Eli Wallach's hammy acting partially ruined "The Godfather III" and this film as well. Labeouf looked like a high school sophomore and didn't even physically look the part. It was a joke when he confronted Josh Brolin late in the film. Oooooh! I'm sure Brolin was shaking in his boots. Speaking of Brolin, he was one of the few reasons for watching. Carey Mulligan looked like Heidi trapped in New York.The reason we all saw the film was to see Douglas' Gekko adapt to life in the 21st century. He looked eerily like Bernie Madoff with his unkempt hair flaring at the ears, until the last 30 minutes when we see him with his hair slicked back as we all remember him.This is definitely inferior to its predecessor--mainly for the casting reasons--but it wasn't horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not close to the first opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the 1987 Wall Street arouse interest thanks to its freshness, a certain originality and a sense of cynicism, this long and boring sequel disappoints badly.The script is based on different subplots that fall flat for the most part, never really showing interest. The ultra verbose dialogues and the omnipresent jargon weigh down the movie, making it hermetic and excluding; perhaps the finance initiate will like that but for the average viewer, it's another business. Michael Douglas seems tired and not as incisive as in the first opus, and Shia LaBeouf delivers an anecdotal performance, far from one could expect for this kind of role. Only Carey Mulligan manages to extricate herself from this mess.Ultimately, the thing that is preventing this feature from being a total disaster is the direction, the Oliver Stone touch that he displays here again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" (2010) is a great movie in surprising ways, not obvious, but worth thinking about! First, it's different than the excellent and deservedly praised and honored "Wall Street" (1987) movie starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas."Wall Street II" is good for different reasons. Don't compare apples to oranges! Different, both good, but not for the same reasons."Wall Street II" is worth watching (again and again) for several reasons: 1. Great acting by superstar actors like Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen (not credited, but part of the movie for about 60 seconds....the best 60 seconds in the movie!).The "accidental meeting at a party" of 1987 "Wall Street" stars Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen is electric. These two guys are dynamite, and when mixed, produce incredible dramatics not seen in the rest of the movie, or in most other movies, anywhere.Two superstars, no other way to describe them.The movie is worth watching just for the quick take sequence which includes the return of "Bud Fox" (Charlie Sheen) meeting up with "Gordon Gekko" (Michael Douglas), both recently out of prison for "insider information victimless crime" offenses, and both doing great!You'll go a long way to see better, more dynamic superstar actor work than these two guys provide in this movie.It's explosive, and it's precious. Anyone who cares for incredible acting MUST see the Gekko and Fox Meetup part of the "Wall Street II."2. Michael Douglas is an incredible actor of high gifts. He deserved his Best Actor Academy Award from "Wall Street I" (1987) and this movie ("Wall Street II") shows that with good writing and the right story, he can do the same good work, again and again and again.It is a pleasure and a privilege to see the great Michael Douglas act in "Wall Street II." His Dad, Kirk Douglas (aka "Isadore Dempsky") would be proud of son Mike.His weight in the movie is bad, and director Oliver Stone wisely shoots around the newly enlarged (too big) waistline Mike has in "Wall Street II." But...what the hell? Nobody's perfect.Other "nobody's perfect" fat movie stars in the movie include Sylvia Miles (see her before she gained weight in "Midnight Cowboy" [1969], and Susan Sarandon, who plays the mother of the young man star of the movie with a the strange name "Shia LeBoeuf" or something like that.The commentary (available on the DVD versions of this movie) of Oliver Stone is wonderful.Stone went to two famous prep schools (Trinity School in Manhattan, and the Hill School) and then went to Yale U. Then to NYC Film School.He is an educated, cultured man, and his commentary is filled with references to Greek mythical figures like Tiresias and others one learns only when one goes to the best-of-the-best classical eastern USA private schools....which Oliver Stone did! The DVD commentaries part of "Wall Street II" are a pleasure to listen to, and that is also true of other commentaries Oliver Stone provides for other DVD's I've seen and heard done by him, especially including his "W" movie.He's smart, interesting, and his company is for sale in these DVD commentaries, and he's worth inviting to dinner! Make sure the dinner you provide has gourmet tasty food and a beautiful, intriguing, promising female dinner partner for your guest, Oliver Stone.Great company from a smart, interesting, intelligent, and gracious man.Get this "feel good" movie and keep it close.You won't regret it! ------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen.Email: DavidAllenUSA@Rocketmail.Com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...so bad. It started out decent enough and then steadily descended into this 'After School Special' like, being hit over the head to make some Michael Moore type point. I really felt like the plot was written by amateurs who know very little about the financial world and so picked a hot topic then hired some finance guys to fill in the 50 cent words so it sounded like the writers and director knew what they were talking about. And what was with the crazy camera wobbles and fast camera truck-ins they would do every once in a while and then totally stopped doing? It was like they decided to shoot it like an episode of 'CSI' or some cop show and then forget they did that and never did it again. There were also these awful fade-ins of an image of another person talking on top of a person while talking on the phone to someone. What? That was so amateur and terrible directing. Then fading in the image of a dead guy? Seriously? It just went no where and kept going. I liked the first Wall Street. I'm not sure who would like this movie. I'm not sure if it really appeals to any age group, type or gender. It's not intelligent, it's not interesting...probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good, But Long-Waited Sequel!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, Josh Brolin and Frank Langella star in Oliver Stone's 2010 drama sequel. This begins in 2001, with former Wall Street Tycoon, Gordon Gekko (Douglas) being released from prison after serving an 8-year sentence for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, we meet young Wall Street trader, Jake Moore (LaBeouf) and his pregnant fiancée, Winnie Gekko (Mulligan) who's Gordon's daughter. Jake's company starts losing money which forces his friend, Lou Zabel (Langella) to commit suicide. Bretton James (Brolin) is head of a rival company trying to buy his and Jake learns of his nasty rumors of Lou. Jake meets Gordon at a seminar and starts working with him in exchange to reunite with Winnie to fix their troubled relationship. As Gordon helps him get back at Bretton, Jake wonders if Gordon is up to his old tricks or not. Michael is terrific as usual and it's nice to see him reprise his role as Gekko. Shia is also good in this and Charlie Sheen makes a brief cameo. Susan Sarandon, Eli Wallach and Stone himself also appear in this good, but long-waited sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>B- A decade or so following the original, Gordon Gekko is released from prison and is on Wall Street once more. Michael Douglass is as cunning and as malicious as ever and I'm glad he returned he returned for the sequel. Playing as his daughter is Carey Mulligan, and she does a pretty nice job herself. The amount of writing behind their relationship is nicely done in my eyes. Frank Langella is pretty good and Josh Brolin plays a good role as well.I suppose the things that bother me about this movie would be the little things. For the most part Shia does a pretty okay job, except for that scene early on in the movie where he receives a million dollar bonus and has a reaction that doesn't sit well with me. He kind of just stares at it, and I didn't buy it. Secondly, I found the cinematography to be missing that edge the first film had. Silly things like a phone conversation at a certain point in the movie, and they don't use a simple split screen or back-to-back cutting, an actual bubble appears next to LaBeouf. A tad much I'd have to say. And most definitely the ending for this one is just a bummer. The climax for the first one was such a beautiful down note, an ominous feel to it as the zooming out long shot shows us we aren't anymore sure of Budd Fox's future than he is. This is one ends with a family barbecue of all things. The final verdict for me would be that its an OK sequel, but it cannot compare to the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always hard to make a sequel, even more so when the original film was of such a high calibre as Wall Street, and what I enjoyed about this most was the development of Gordon Gecko's character in the more than capable hands of Michael Douglas.And the plot is riveting, warped and twisted, even if the film is a little long at over two hours. But the script is often razor sharp warranting a repeat performance to capture all the nuances and clues that lead you along to where things are headed. Nothing about this film is straightforward and if you think it is then you are probably as gullible as I am when it comes to making money at the expense of someone else's flawed trust. And the film is full of flawed characters who must have seen it all before but still they do not always get the trust thing right. It is an exercise in studying the low regard some people have.There is some very fine acting on display too particularly from Carey Mulligan who plays Gecko's daughter. The film is well cast, the direction is almost always at the correct pace to maintain interest, and the cinematography is superb. I also enjoyed the sound track which seems to fit the action very well.A well deserved seven out of ten which is high praise for a sequel.</fullReview>

That actually was the best part of this movie was the camera work. The acting, story, characters, and ending were all lame and did not even come close to being even partially as compelling as the original. I asked my wife if this movie would have been better if we as movie-goers were not so desensitized to everything. She said no and that this was movie was just not a good film. I agreed. Michael Douglas was weak as a reformed/not so reformed Gekko that was over the top in the original. He was a fun character in the original in the same way that Alex was fun in Clockwork Orange. A villain you cannot help but like. This guy was just old and predictable. I was expecting a whole lot more. Josh Brolin was pretty good early on as the newer Gekko type but even he could not escape a weak script and story. IMO this movie should not have been made because it taints the truly classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the storyline by now, so I won't bore you with another plot summary - suffice it to say that the movie left me depressed, ready to take my $$ out of my retirement accounts and put it under my mattress! Because I don't see that anything has changed on "the Street". The ending, with Jacob and Winnie throwing a 4-5 figure 1st birthday party for their child reinforces that. I thought Stone would do a harsher depiction of WS today - maybe he too is in bed with the money guys who invested in his film! The parts showing individual investment firms and the greedy Bastards who are still running them are scary - only Frank Langella has a moral compass, and he dies early on. There are no good guys in this film, nothing has changed, yet it wrapped up neatly at the end with a love-fest among the families. I guess I expected an indictment of Wall Street and its Fat Cats from Stone but didn't get it. Is that what I'm supposed to take away from the film? That it's BAU - maybe he should have titled it "Wall Street - Some Things Never Change".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watch, the movie is better than I heard...I'm moderately interested...Yes, one must digest the Oliver Stone and Hollywood overstated too simplistic "capitalism is bad" propaganda...But it is interesting to watch the old shyster GeckoMaster play his present &amp; future family... and to watch Shia LeBouf...fight back...I saw less blatant "business is bad" clichés' in this movie that I expected. Am hearing Stone (in the commentary) invoke his name for "The Devil"! Which is mainly the Bush Bros--Reagan...Thatcher (the usual demons)...tho he gave a verbal nod to Fannie &amp; Freddie, How simple &amp; one sided his view of EVIL is!Freddie and Fannie...is the deadly economy killing cocktail made from 3 elements: mortgage loan investors--resellers...naive governmental enablers...and super dumb zealot "I'll get ya a HOME no matter WHAT your credit" activists...Will Oliver Stone &amp; others ever realize...Naiive Governmental zealots and their naive activist zealot helpers... can use an inverted greed to destroy others also. Just ask the average Illinois taxpayer (making $50,000...who probably will pay $1000 more a year to the Illinois Governmental Unfixed Money Pit).Yesterday, I viewed a huge money sting done in the dark of night...now being discussed &amp; seen worldwide. No, it wasn't a real life Gecko...or a second Madoff ... It was those NAIVE State of Illinois zealots...voting in the dead of night...to soak the average Illinois citizen big time...to pay for a corrupt, not-fixed Illinois government which still OOZES corruption like pus from a festering untreated wound. Wouldn't Gecko envy this mass sting??? REMEMBER...An Illinois resident--an average person...not a "fat cat" --only making $50,000 could possibly pay $1,000 MORE a year in taxes! No one dare propose any significant IL GOV restructuring. Anyone wanna bet how much of the Il Government's new windfall will trickle down to the poor? Some say---Watch for retiring lawmakers to suddenly get great post-legislative appointments, contracts etc. I'd love to hear Gordon Gecko's Acid but Realistic Detailed Commentary on THAT big money sting!!! So DVR this limited range movie. (Where the Investors or Bush infected Gov Officials are EVIL) ..or buy it in the $5 discount bin. (But don't pay any more...Stone's actors, sets are good...but his script is weak because Stone doesn't fully understand the range and breadth and depth of the fight between good &amp; evil!!!)But remember...Greed comes from the heart of humans (I speak having grown up near Chicago and in Illinois for most of my life---)...and DESTRUCTIVE GREED can be the inverted naive greed of the unrealistic activist political zealot!</fullReview>

I'm talking about good stuff like the fact that Shia LeBeouf stands the test as a wanting, willing and talented Wall Street trader, the homecoming of Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko who now poses a moral figure and central catalysator, the great and inspired editing effects, or the brilliant music by David Byrne and Brian Eno which is trembling and detailed, and the script that sees director Stone not rehashing the first one in a modern era, but involves true romance and family topics, and the amazing cinematography by Rodrigo Pieto who makes Manhattan look better than ever. 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' is already another underrated Oliver Stone film, and for those who expected him to purely and realistically capture the time and occasion of the financial era, he does something in movies that's maybe better; he makes it a great, overblown fanfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame so many 'top critics' are writing scathing comments like 'an inferior sequel' (James Berardinelli ); 'overly didactic' (Randy Myers); or 'the movie's ultimate agenda of rehabilitating a classic bad guy is a big disappointment' (J.R. Jones). This film should be required viewing by every MBA and undergraduate business student in an accredited U.S. university. The screenplay structure and the characters inhabiting its world are believable, complex, not-didatic, and vibrant examples of the current moral hazard inflicting our country, our generation, and our capitalist system which is imploding all around us. Josh Brolin's character exemplifies Psalm 10:3 - "the greedy man curses and spurns God." His scene in which he destroys his priceless Goya painting of Satan devouring his son is both riveting and prophetic of where American-style capitalism is heading. Carey Mulligan's scene at Shen Fui restaurant, and outside afterwards brings to life the words of Luke 12:15 - "be on guard against every form of greed; life is not in possessions." Also, very good are Susan Sarandon, Austin Pendleton, and this new guy Michael Douglas. However, Frank Langella is superb as a man of integrity who is sacrificial lamb at the start of the film. In an early scene, he observes how different the Wall Street of this millennium is from the Wall Street of his youth. It expounds on the words of II Peter 2:3 concerning false prophets, "in their greed they will exploit you with false words."</fullReview>

You have Gordon Gekko, who is supposed to be this cold-hearted business man, come back and give the $100 million to Shia's company as if to say I'm sorry. The simple fact is that it's not that difficult to give $100 million back when you used it to make $1 billion. Furthermore, if I hear the term "moral hazard" one more time I might have to slap somebody. We get it, the bailout basically told the bankers that what they did was OK and if it happens again the government will be there again to keep them from falling. Maybe it's just me but when I go to see a movie in which the premise is based on financial matters I expect to see more in regards to those financial matter.</fullReview>

His suicide sets the direction of the film.The never ending concept of corporate greed is explored here. Everyone is out to make a buck, and I haven't seen as much backs tabbing since 1950's "All About Eve!"There is no end to this idea of insider trading and how it can adversely affect the American economy, with the bail outs, bonuses and utter ruination of the American middle class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Shakespeare, this movie is insightful and significant on several different levels. Brilliant and surprisingly politically fair script. Fantastically creative, interesting and artistic cinematography. Sufficient soundtrack. Difficult to specifically follow the exact financial trading story, yet we understand the general premise. Well acted by a talented cast, and who doesn't adore iconic Michael Douglas as the magnetic, charismatic, larger than life, good intended yet evil Gordon Gekko? Scotch in a Bacarrat High Ball glass anyone? Fully expecting thorough yet liberal director Oliver Stone to bash evil corporate America and Wall Street, especially now during our ugly economic environment, the giant green light bulb switches on when the script speaks to the inner workings underneath large scale charity.What is true charity? The main movie theme states the world's greatest form of charity comes from the innovations of the 20th and 21st Centuries funded through the vehicle of Wall Street firms underwriting the research and development, production and distribution of these inventions and innovations thus making all of our lives easier and raising the global standard of living for everyone worldwide. Wow! What a macro-conundrum for the politically progressive corporate and Wall Street basher. Yes, greed is one integral spoke within this wheel of invention just as old as the continual fight between good and evil within ourselves and our societies.One level beneath the main movie theme of charity is the love story between actors Shia LeBeouf and Carey Mulligan. History repeats itself as crying, crying and crying Carey Mulligan's character is involved with a "Type A," ambitious boyfriend on the make very much like her father, except nicer as she is in love with him but hates her Father. Hum.Another level of the movie is the financial story. The windup and unwinding of trades are complicated and hard to follow within a scheme of Derivatives, CDS's and planted rumors fueled by instantaneous technology. All the personalities involved in the financial story are Type A personalities in every aspect of their lives and relationships.Susan Sarandon shines in her portrayal of Gordon Gekko's ex-wife who suffers from her own self fueled greed fest as a former care-giving RN, now an out of control, gambling real estate agent. I guess she did not originally marry Gordon Gekko for nothing.Eli Wallach is cantankerous as the old guard Wall Street tycoon. Josh Brolin brilliant as Wall Street's modern day Belizubub.Overall, this "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps" movie sequel is enjoyable and one does not have to have seen the original "Wall Street" movie in order to enjoy this installment.</fullReview>

Without giving anything away, this Gordon Gekko, lets just say, has 20 something more years of experience on people, criminal and economical purposes, and is just every bit the manipulative character has before, for better our for worse.Never been a big fan of Shia LaBeouf, little action hero put upon the spot in recent years, but truth be told, he gives a solid performance here, maybe the surroundings pushed him to be a little stronger than usual, It is not every we get to act with Josh Brolin, Michael Douglas, Susan Sarandon and Frank Langella.We have a very well written plot surrounding Jake (Shia's character), an ambitious kid looking for his big way out on wall street, Langella plays Louis Zabel his mentor and boss, and well the rest i'm not giving away, let's just say they play with people has much has they play with money.Where i think the movie fails a little is in is time, a little too long and convoluted, could've been more simple on some aspects, but in the big picture i was very well surprised.7 Thumbs Up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the time I was halfway through this film I couldn't help but ask "what's the story line"? For all the great pre-release information I had seen I would have thought this to be a real winner. It's just the opposite.It would have been better to leave Gorden Gecko out and if he were to play a part in this movie, perhaps it could have shown him having a few bad days in prison. The he could be in a decent movie at a later date. A film about Gorden Gecko being a real villain, not a sniveling, reformed prisoner. A Gecko film might start with his release from prison and shortly after taking a little vengeance out on his cell mates.The movie story line lacked any focus. The mish-mash of the awful role of Gorden Gecko, a love story of his daughter and boyfriend and his distraught mentor, an undeveloped character who is the villain in this movie. What a mess! Where was the financial engineering (preamble of the story line)of the weapons of mass destruction (subprime loans,credit default swaps, CDO's).Who were the bankers and players in the market that created the financial crisis. They were in the movie but didn't seem to make much a a contribution to the mess this movie was trying to portray or maybe it was a love story? Where were the intelligible warnings a financial crises was coming? I guess the guy playing the mentor was trying to sound a warning but it just wasn't what the viewer needed.Where were big wigs like Sandy Weil at Citibank who insisted on dancing until the music stopped because they were to big to fail. Again, you had a villain in the movie but the financial crisis wan't about just one guy.Don't watch this movie an maybe in the future you'll be able to see a movie worthy of the Gorden Gecko character.</fullReview>

Shia Labeouf has about as much screen presence and believability of being a high flying dealer as a dead fly. Why does he keep getting such roles? The only small saving grace of this film are the scenes with Michael Douglas, but there's probably an element of nostalgia which contributes to that.A poor excuse for a film if I ever saw one... save yourself the agony.

		<fullReview>Although I really enjoyed this sequel and in my opinion this is a good movie on its own, I felt that this movie was a little bit compressed and not as intense as the first Wall Street movie. Oliver Stone did an excellent job with the camera work and the story line with the credit default swaps and how the financial/banking mess went down during 2008, vaguely re-telling the story of how Bear Stearns went down in early 2008 and how the treasury secretary(Henry Paulson Jr.) conducted his meeting with the different bank officials regarding the bailouts so the feds can save the entire banking industry. This movie is about 2 hours and 7 minutes long but should have been at least 30 minutes to an hour longer with more scenes how Gordon was able to be a success again after regaining the capital to start over, similar to the last movie when Bud Fox &amp; Larry Wildman was scheming on their trading activity to get even with GG, maybe this is a reason why some fans were complaining why they did not see more of GG in the movie and why I feel this movie is less intense than the original. Also the sequel only gave a vague explanation as to what happen with Mrs. Gekko(played by Sean Young in WS1). I hope when they release the DVD version, they will release some sort of a director's cut with additional scenes related to my comments so fans of WS1 will be happy.I also feel that another sequel is a possibility with the way the movie was made because of some different open angles of this movie. Been watching WS1 with and without the director's commentary on DVD over the years and was generally satisfied with this sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>None of the High Drama of the First Wall Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made the first Wall Street great was not simply the greed of Gordon Gekko, but the mesmerizing way he drew in Bud Fox. It was like watching a moth to flame, Gekko's seduction of Bud Fox, and to watch his morals go swishing down the toilet was like watching a train wreck.This version of Wall Street lacked the taunt drama of the first. Gordon Gekko's charm was not nearly as effective on Shia LeBouf's character. For him to be so brilliant, after Gordon bounced out to London with a 100 million dollars all I wanted to say was, "sucker." You didn't see that coming? Everyone in the audience knew that Gordon Gekko wasn't going to go all mushy and exchange 100 million dollars for a relationship with his daughter. How could you be so gullible? This was suppose to be the climax, the shocking revelation that made us all gasp. It made me yawn and look at my watch.Not only that, but the movie at various points was just too preachy. I realize the country's economic system is at the brink, but I don't really want to see a movie about it---reality is horrible as it is. So as far as entertainment value, Gordon's sermonizing about the perils of greed and speculations felt like I was being scolded for being a dumb sheep, blindly allowing the greed to happen. Another reviewer said that some might find it boring if we didn't understand financial terms. I have to disagree. I understand financial terminology and still found it boring.Wall Street, was from the very beginning, a story about good and evil. How absolute power corrupts absolutely. How greed can never be satisfied and it will devour the naive and corrupt their moral values. Wall Street 2 never developed into a movie that I cared about. I didn't care about the mentor committing suicide, I didn't care about the central characters and I didn't care about who put Gordon Gekko behind bars. Thus the movie failed to tell a compelling story. The actors were not bad, but not great. The cinematography was beautiful. But the story failed on so many levels that the movie should have went straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of reviews talked about how it mimicked the falls of Bear Stearnes, Lehman Bros. I think the message was that - no one gives a thought if it's just 1 failure - but if the entire collective fails, then the govt is forced to a bail out.When you think about the fusion project - Moore only promised Dr Masters verbally. After the fall of KZI he could have walked away from his commitment - but he still stuck to it after going to Bretton's firm. And even after he learnt that Winnie has 100M, he's still committed to the cause. Bottomline - Jake sticks to his promises. How many person do you know, would give up 100M to a hopeful R&amp;D that benefits the world? He helps out his mom again and again - but advises her that she must be self-sustainable - ie US should stop these foreign aid in straight monetary subsidies and start thinking about how to teach them to "fish".In all I really enjoyed the film for the messages that it delivered; the actors didn't "over-act" - less is more and the characters were believable and very human. Gekko getting away with the 100M was - though not 100% unpredictable - was understandable - Winnie had reneged on the agreement and as a father who gave that money, had a right to collect it.</fullReview>

However, as we know these self proclaimed gurus are only spouting off their over analyzing, assumption filled, inaccurate opinions. Therefore, the film came in much greater than expectations just like earnings from a stock does pushing it way to the upside. The casting is perfect with amazing film work and editing, another master piece by Oliver Stone to put in the vault. If you want to watch a satisfying sequel, this movie certainly fits the bill.From the filming to the story line, Money Never Sleeps is a highly entertaining and thought provoking movie that I will definitely be adding to my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The legacy of Gekko should have been left alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cult movie. A piece of art. It captures the essence of Wall Street during and before the credit crunch. It was.. is phenomena. Truly, this movie is in a league of its own. Well, this is how I would have wanted to describe Money Never Sleeps, but I just can't lie to myself or to reader of this review. To put it bluntly this movie isn't worth your time nor your money. I'm a huge fan of the first movie. And many will agree with me on that for very good reasons. Firstly it had an captivating plot, great cast and dialogue was just supreme to say the least. Almost everybody knows the "Greed is good" speech and how Gekko tells his broker : "Rip their throats out!" etc. Secondly the storyline was well developed and above all Wall Street had an identity, it knew what it was: A movie trying to show the vices of Wall Street. Enough of the original movie, now I will tell why, in my opinion, the sequel is a flop. This film has no identity. I don't know what it was supposed to be. A love story? No, the movie had something to do with banking and a ex-convict. A story of Gekkos rehabilitation? No, he hasn't changed. Or should it portray the insanity on Wall St. ? But why then the love story and Gekko.. It is all very confusing. In comparison the dialogues were bad: "You are the NINJA generation?" sounds almost like a prophecy, but It lacks something? you don't get goose bumps all over your back like you did when Gekko said: "Greed ,for the lack of a better word, is good" The plot line is sometimes inconsistent and clunky. As an example: One of the characters uses rumors to upset a firms stock price but how he does it- that remains a mystery to the viewer. And that is a bad thing in my opinion. In the original movie the plot line lifted the veil and showed how things are/were done on Wall St. And that gave so much value to the movie. Regular people got some insight to the financial establishment. All in all I am disappointed and I would like to give this film 2/10 , but that would be unfair, because I feel very strongly about the first movie. So , to compensate for my emotional attachment for the first movie , I will give it a 5. I would suggest this movie for people who haven't seen the original, if you have you will be as disappointed as I am. Cheers, M</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better and More True to Life Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains major spoilers, so please do not read it until after you have seen the film. If you have not seen the film, put it on your must see list. Yes, Shia and Carey are dull as dishwater on screen, but Michael Douglas deserves a best supporting actor Oscar for his brilliant, warm, witty and charming performance. See it before reading the rest of this review.I enjoyed the movie while watching it, but felt a slight let down with the apparent Hollywood ending. I agreed with the reviewers who saw Michael Douglas' character as being too reformed and too soft. However, thinking about it more, I realize that Stone was delivering an even sharper critique of capitalism than he did in the first film.Think about what Gordon Gecko did. He pretended to be reformed and pretended to be poor. He showed humility and claimed to have learned from his prison experience. He fools everyone. Now realize that he has 100 million dollars that he stole in a Swiss Bank Account in the name of his daughter. She now hates him and blames him for her brother's drug death. The only way to get the money was to establish a relationship with his daughter again. He uses her boyfriend, Shia Labeouf, to re-establish his relationship with her. He uses both of them to get the money out of the Swiss account and he promptly steals it from them.He quickly makes a killing when the housing bubble bursts. While millions are losing their life savings in the greatest stock market crash since 1929. He turns the 100 million into a billion, a neat profit.He then invests in green energy, "the next bubble" as he calls it. It is not because he believes in it, but he believes it is the next money making thing. He invests in his daughter's leftist website because he sees how useful it has been in bringing down his Wall Street enemies.He is left at the end with more power, more control and more money than ever before. He is free and on top of the world. All of it due to the money he stole. The opposition from his idealist daughter and son-in-law is gone. They are now in his control and debt.This is a much more realistic and cynical movie than the original "Wall Street." In that movie, the Wall Street crooks end up broke, disgraced and in jail. In this movie, the Wall Street crooks end up rich, powerful and live happily ever after. Yes, Josh Brolin does not fare so well. But that is only because he is stupid and arrogant and "double dips" using his own personal account to make even more money. He betrays his Wall Street friends and mentors who have helped him. He turns them over to the police. Be smart and play by the rules of Wall Street and you end up on top, don't play by the rules, betray your Wall Street buddies to the cops, you can end up in jail.There is one image that Stone keeps going back to - bubbles rising into the sky. It is a precise and brilliant metaphor. We know that one day the bubble will burst, even if we do not see it happening on screen.Has Oliver Stone gone soft? No he has grown more cynical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining and interesting since we are drawn into a story that immerses itself into fairly contemporary times that still impact us in the present moment. The timing of this movie is perfect since the meltdown just happened and we still feel it and it is so much a part of our current events.There are documentaries out there about the dramatic spiral downward of our economic system. This is not one of those documentaries and it will not accurately and intellectually explain how the financial crisis occurred or what happened behind the scenes. Instead, this is a fictionalized fable of love, loss, and vengeance that is nicely interwoven within the contemporary financial meltdown.The movie actually has little connection to the first Wall Street, besides the character Gekko and thus should not be seen as a sequel but rather as a story onto itself concerning the recent financial crisis's affect on the elite financiers. We are taken into their world in an exaggerated, overblown yet entertaining way. The financial stuff may still seem foreign to most of us but we get the idea.Gekko was one of the most interesting characters ever created in recent film history and the mythical wall street characters including Gekko are back. Amusing to see these caricaturized Wall Street elites gathering in the federal reserve late at night like evil demagogues with self interested dark souls deciding on the fate of the economic system and in actuality deciding on the fate of the world. Its not even about money at this level, it is about the game between people and simply winning. When asked "everyone has a number, what number will you stop and call it quits", the response is "More".The director created a visually encompassing film with artistically directed shots of NYC giving the city a certain aura of grandiosity and extravagance. At the same time we are exposed to a variety of places and cultural tidbits that give the movie an absolute felt setting. Contained are little details, from a conversation in a cab while the driver drives too fast, to walks in Central Park with a dog, that take us to NYC. Also, one of the most entertaining cameos ever done in film further adds to the entertainment. It is an understatement to say that the ending in the first Wall Street was powerful and poignant. That ending in the first was unforgettable; this Wall Street unfortunately did not come close to packing the same punch in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment! Not sure where to start, but Oliver should have started by watching the original and realizing that it was a hit because it was about making money and interesting characters. This one centers around the relationship between Geckos' daughter and someone you could care less about.Of all of the trillions made on Wall Street, they decide to center on the credit swap nightmare of 2008 and the thinly veiled references to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. First of all the top is way to complex for the average viewer, and the mortgage industry is a very slow moving market (except when it collapses). I can think of 20 other scenarios that are more exciting starting with Pump and Dump schemes. Michael Douglas is not on the screen enough to save this one..There are a ton of holes as well. This biggest is this one. He has a $100 million hidden trust in Sweden set up for his daughter. According to the film - Gordan set it up for her when she was 14. So why was there not one set up for the dead son? Skip this one - major bore and disappointment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as incisive and critical as Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps nevertheless is a decent enough film to warrant a casual viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than twenty years after Wall Street (1987), director Oliver Stone brings Gordon Gekko back to the big screen. Michael Douglas reprises his screen-stealing role as Gekko, and is one of many talented actors who make up the strong cast, which include Carey Mulligan (An Education, 2009), Frank Langella (Frost/Nixon, 2008), Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men, 2007), and Shia LeBeouf (Transformers, 2007). Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a lead character in Wall Street, also makes a cameo appearance.Money Never Sleeps is, in my view, a more entertaining picture than its prequel, which is occasionally quite dull although it remains to be an important film. In the sequel, Stone focuses more on the stories of the characters and less on jargonized depiction of the inner workings of the financial industry. In a way, Money Never Sleeps could be described as a conventional love story set in the backdrop of the recent global financial meltdown that left many fuming over the unethical behavior of (mostly Western) big-shots who handle and trade greenbacks for a living.In Wall Street, Gekko was the epitomized figure of greed, played with charismatic vigor by Douglas. Here, he takes on the role of a "wise sage", someone who has experienced the terrible consequences of greed, but despite that, shows that he is still not infallible. What is greed, really? An emotional response to the temptation caused by the "this is not enough" syndrome? Or is it a rapacious mental desire for excesses? Why does greed manifest more prominently in some people, especially (and ironically) in those who have it all? Using gimmicky but still relevant editing techniques like the "split-screen" effect to emphasize on the continuous and hurried interaction among stock traders and brokers, Stone succeeds to a certain extent in depicting the frenzied drama of chronic phone-calling, and "time is money" mentality that characterize these people. This is contrasted with scenes of important men in smart suits deliberating (non-productively, I wish to add) over the courses of action to save the nation's floundering economy.Much of Stone's film is paced leisurely, and may bore viewers who show disinterest in anything dealing with "sub-primes and what not", and are only attracted to the film because of the cast. The fine performances, especially that of Mulligan and Douglas, help pull the film through a few of the more tepid parts. Not as incisive and critical as Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps nevertheless is a decent enough film to warrant a casual viewing.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eminently watchable cast and captivating subject matter .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The claim that this sequel is purely a cash-grabbing endeavour couldn't be more off target. Oliver Stone has knocked back script after script for possible follow ups to his 80's classic and it's clear throughout Money that he has put his heart and soul into a story that he has felt worthy of sharing the Wall Street moniker. Stone, as always, is over indulgent at times, but there's no denying his passion in making a Wall Street for the new generation. "Greed is good" may have been the ostensible motto of the first film (in fact the connotation was the exact opposite, but many easily-strayed, quixotic viewers took it at face value) however there's no chance of missing the point this time around, the message is loud and clear: greed, for lack of a better word, is not good.It's a shame then, that the Platoon director is too caught up in decorating the absorbing content with unnecessary visual flair. Whether it's to appease the MTV generation or simply because the 64 y.o. filmmaker is becoming more compromising in his methods, the TV-style scene separators that Stone employs ? a whirring 24 hours in 30 secs landscape shot, digital financial figures weaving through the city ? are completely unwelcome. Then there is the motorbike race at the end of the second act. How this dreadfully misplaced sequence didn't get excised in the editing suite is mind-boggling. These little hiccups tot up over the runtime and get increasingly frustrating, becoming a major detriment to this otherwise decent movie.The return of Michael Douglas to the role that garnered him an Oscar over two decades ago was always going to gain the majority of anticipation and he doesn't disappoint. He portrays the supposedly penitent Gekko as a man who is just as self-aggrandizing as he was 23 years ago, but with the newfound characteristic of subtlety, if not humility. Having said that, it's Shia LeBeouf who makes the greatest impact. The Transformers star has already demonstrated he's a genuine acting talent in the lesser seen A Guide to Recognising Your Saints and The Greatest Game Ever Played, although this is his first shot at a mainstream drama. LeBeouf's natural charisma is challenged by a vulnerable side we've not seen in any of his previous roles and it's a leap he handles with ease. He may yet be one of those rare actors who can effectively segue between huge movie star and terrific thespian.The eminently watchable cast and captivating subject matter guarantees cinematic satisfaction, even if its dampened by Stone's persistently needless visual flourishes.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total treat. Perhaps even better than the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it at the 38th Norwegian International Film Festival, city of Haugesund, late August 2010. It was screened twice there, both times in the largest auditorium - one which had been upgraded to state-of-the-art quality mere weeks before the festival (the Edda 1 auditorium).The experience of seeing this film, even with all the expectations I had, was an utter thrill. I only give it 9 out of 10 to adjust for myself being transported to a state of exhilaration, and therefore perhaps losing some critical faculties in the process.I love the first film and it's among the three or four movies I've seen the most times. I've dabbled a bit in the financial industry myself (top Norwegian fund management firm) and politics, and I paid quite a bit of attention to the global financial crisis that unspooled in October 2008 and onwards. Bail outs and credit swaps etc are handled extensively in Money Never Sleeps. Ironically, the city of Haugesund was one of only 8 municipalities in Norway (there are 430 municipalities in this country) to be hit by failed municipal investments in Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) - and it was the one that was the hardest hit of them all! So a bit ironic then that Money Never Sleeps was screened there first, for audiences in Norway (although with around 14.000 professional guests, including several international stars, the audience was perhaps not predominantly Norwegian).The soundtrack to this film is excellent, the visual style is pure perfection and very stylish, and the throwbacks to the first film are an utter thrill (if you've seen the first film recently, or several times earlier, like myself, you will notice them all, and love them).Of course, having been in politics and the financial industry, it's hard for me to tell how this movie experience will be for someone who knows little about either. But for them there's also the interpersonal drama, and a love story. At the top of that, what they learn from this film will be valuable, and a much better and valid introduction than just about anything else you'll come across.I will recommend this film to everyone. And it is so strong and so relevant, that I believe that political strategists from both sides for the US midterm elections coming up this autumn, will have to find ways of dealing with it, and pitching it to work for their side, some way or the other. Mark my words: This is one movie that *will* be referenced to during the upcoming election season - and not only in America, even.It is that relevant. As one fellow festival attendee remarked at the closing dinner of the festival though, the love story could perhaps been a bit stronger and more authentic. Judge for yourselves. Either way, it will be money well spent, and I doubt you'll regret your investment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gordon Gekko' (Michael Douglas) has just gotten released from prison. Cool! I suppose he's going to go out and shark his way back up to the top of the financial pyramid, right? Far out! Maybe he'll even step on a few toes along the way. Oh man, this is gonna be good! *PLOP!*..... sorry, but that was the sound of all hope for the previous wishful thinking falling flat on its proverbial face. Can you handle a bit of reality on this film? OK, here goes: - Gekko is mellowed and content with making appearances at book signings, - The cutthroat world of Wall Street is replaced by some Jupiter-born subplot about ecological awareness, - Gekko's daughter(!) repeatedly practices her spoiled little brat routine as she stomps away from Daddy every ten minutes because she's mad at him, - 'Bud Fox' (Charlie Sheen) shows up out of nowhere halfway through the film to brag to Gordon about how he made a ton of money by selling Bluestar Airlines (of which the refusal to do so was the only thing that exemplified Bud's integrity in the first movie), and.....- director Oliver Stone didn't forget to do his almighty cameo.I guess this 'sequel' was just another of those director's prerogatives to make a quick buck off the name of one of their past glories.</fullReview>

Producer has well emphasised on the importance of financial sectors, but there were so many technical terms that most people cannot understand its implicit meanings. With a perfect mix between father-daughter relationship difficulties and financial crisis, the producer has shown an amazing link between these two, and I must say that it really did get to my heart. I feel like this movie was made for me only because it reflected lots of my own history. It also provided lots of information to myself about finance 101.However, it is still far from 10 because it failed to keep my attention through out the movie, so that is the reason why I decided to knock-down 2 points from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, entertaining, imperfect, but ultimately worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers*Oliver Stone's long-awaited sequel to "Wall Street" is an ambitious film indeed, encompassing themes such as love, loyalty, betrayal, revenge, power, and of course, greed. The best thing about the film is the return of Michael Douglas in his most celebrated role, the former corporate raider Gordon Gekko. Gekko has most of the film's best lines and speeches, and Douglas re-inhabits Gekko with charismatic ease. It seems unlikely that the film would have been made without him.What some others have taken issue with is that while the financial crisis serves as a backdrop for much of what happens in the film, this is essentially a character-driven story, flawed characters though they may be. The film's imperfections seem to stem largely from jumping back and forth between the events in the stock market and the relationships of the main characters. The ambitious plot is as complicated as its subject demands, but not always as coherent as it should be. Still, Stone keeps things moving with an effervescent energy that keeps you on your toes and wondering how it will all tie together. The concluding scene does seems a bit too pat for a film this complex, but eventually even characters like Gordon Gekko need to complete their arcs and show their humanity in some way.Once you sort through some of the excess fat, there is a message here - Gekko's character correctly point out what the greatest evils on Wall Street are, and the bit about "moral hazard" is a nice touch. The script itself has many sharp moments, just could have used a bit of tightening up in general. Still, compared with previous Stone films with ambitious plots ("Any Given Sunday", "Alexander"), "Money Never Sleeps" is more entertaining and holds together better than those efforts. Plus, the cast includes some sharp performances by Josh Brolin, Eli Wallach, and an all-too-short turn by an excellent Frank Langella. All-in-all, although it's a bit of a "mixed bag", "Money Never Sleeps" is an entertaining ride, and ultimately, a worthy sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big departure from the original, for better or for worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You tell them for me, babe, Gordon Gekko is back."It's more than a decade since the events of the first movie, and notorious Wall Street kingpin Gordon Gekko is out of jail, broke, and apparently reformed. He even seems to be the voice of reason and sanity, amidst a sea of greed that dwarfs even his own. He comes back into the lives of his estranged daughter and her young, idealistic investor boyfriend, but does a man like him deserve a second chance?I actually preferred Money Never Sleeps to the original Wall Street. There was less financial jargon and dense investor speak being thrown around, the main characters were easier to identify with, and the plot that was at least partially focused on human drama that I could relate too, instead of only numbers, stock quotes, and indices. Both movies are clearly products of their times, as well, and Money Never Sleeps deals with things and events that I'm familiar with in a way that the original (which came out when I was only two years old) does not.Not to say the sequel is perfect, though. Or anywhere close to it. It tends to be overly sentimental, at times (especially the ending). We're talking soap opera levels of cheesiness. And Stone uses it as a vehicle to push his point of view across with all the subtlety of a hammer to the kneecap. This is Stone, though, so that's basically expected. My biggest criticism is how little depth there are to the characters. None of them are really anything more than a collection of one or two broad qualities (naive, earnest, amoral, caring, deceitful, vengeful, greedy, etc.), which is a real shame when you have truly talented actors involved like Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, and Frank Langella. They do a good job with what they're given, but it's not a lot.It wouldn't surprise me at all if a lot of people favored the first movie over this one, as they are quite different in tone. But, if Wall Street left you a bit cold, as it did me, then maybe the sequel will be more to your liking. If you loved the first...well, your impression may not be as favorable as mine was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last great Douglas role?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solitary man might have been close to his personal life, but this might just be the last great performance we will see from Michael Douglas. I hope not of course, but no one could blame him if he took time off and looked after himself.But back to this movie. It's been awhile since I had seen the first Wall Street and unfortunately I did not see fit to re-watch it before I got into this one ... A grave mistake, even if it would just have reminded me of the tone of the movie. The fact that there were things referenced from the first movie, made it worse (with a great scene involving Mr. Douglas and another actor at a Dinner Party).I might have expected more of this movie (though I got warned, that it might not be that good). But the first part of the movie was great. Especially the chemistry between Frank Langella and Shia was really good. I loved Frank and would have loved to see him go one on one with Michael (Gordon Gekko) Douglas. Unfortunately that did not happen. Still Douglas was on a role and he played Gekko as if the role was a suit he could just put on. It came off naturally. The rest of the movie lacks a bit of that suave though. Still, if you are an Oliver Stone fan, you will relish this movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gordon Gekko (Douglas) is released from jail and intends to get his life back and to make amends with estranged daughter Winnie (Mulligan) who is going with Jake (LaBeouf), who is a Wall Street genius.The key to this sequel is the line Gekko uses to Jake: "A fisherman always see another fisherman." Once you understand that, you will enjoy the movie more because you will know what to expect. Aside from the Wall Street mumbo jumbo, we see how Wall Street rumors can destroy people and companies. But, though the story kept up to date through the bad economy in 2008 when the banks were talking bailouts, the story here still centered on the father, daughter mix and we were all hoping for closure and a happy ending. But, the economy and the betrayals take their toll on Winnie and Jake, but not on Gekko who is flying high in London. And, it appears that Gordon Gekko is back doing what he was born to do.All performed well, but I am not sure LaBeouf was strong enough to be in the company of Douglas, Langella, and Brolin. He did okay, but his character appeared subdued in their presence. And, this is a Wall Street genius who is supposed to have many plans beyond Plan B when things go south? Put a Gordon Gekko in Jake's place and you will see a knowing twinkle in Gordon's eye and he will have a plan to fly north. We didn't see much tension or even suspense in here. We realized the story was really about Gordon, and his daughter and Jake, and how the Wall Street activity and the betrayals affected them. We were just watching it all play out like a regular TV soap opera. No surprises. We weren't sure if this would have a happy ending. Charlie Sheen's character from the original Wall Street makes a cameo appearance. We really cannot expect this movie to top the original Wall Street.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb by LaBeouf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge shoes to fill, although Stone makes a half decent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Stone took a huge chance here when he decided to make a sequel to one of the best movies of all time. So many directors have tried to bring a sequel to the screen of their original hit pieces and epically failed. Now this being said I'm not saying this is a brilliant work of art as you can see by my rating however..It does it's best with a stellar cast to hit a home run. 87's Wall Street was an original in itself, a corporate tale of greed over humanity, 2010's version is more of a revenge tale instead of Stone titling this film Money Never Sleeps it should've been titled Wall Street 2 : Gekko strikes back!. This installment takes place 23 years after the events of Bud Fox(Charlie Sheen) going up against the great Wall Street tycoon himself Gordon Gekko(Michael Douglas). We see Gekko finally released from his 12 year prison stay, a lonely man watching other cons being picked up by their friends and family and he is picked up by no one. 7 more years advance in the film and we are now introduced to young Wall Street investment banker Jake Moore (Shia Labeouf) who working under his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). The firm the pair work for is about to go under, unfortunately due too some bad decision errors made by Zabel. Moore is dating young Winnie (Carey Mulligan)Gekko, recognize her last name? Yes, Winnie is the daughter of former tycoon Gordon Gekko. When Jake learns of his mentor's suicide, he decides to get revenge on the firm and it's leader Brenton James (Josh Brolin) finding out along the ride that it wasn't Fox who was solely responsible for Gekko's incarceration, as Bud only had a small role to play, it was Brenton James who was responsible for Gekko's long prison term. Trying also to patch up his fiancé's relationship with her father and bringing down another Wall Street giant is a huge game to play for a young investment banker. Like Gekko claims in this film "It was never about the money, it was playing the game) A worthy sequel to the 87 hit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last 40 Minutes kill this sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a sequel, and it does not let down the original in many ways. But, and it is a big but, somehow American sensibilities of redemption, the Family and repentance, have to be thrust centre stage for the final section of the film, and it stinks. By golly the last forty minutes or so are dreadful - in order to achieve a happy ending. Stone actually finishes the 'Wall Street' element of the movie with a Looney Tunes fade, eg the screen closing in an ever decreasing circle, well before the end. So is he responsible for the ending of the film or is someone else? But the earlier parts are good in places. The story tells of the global meltdown and credit crunch on Wall Street, although the quickness of the speech and script give you little time to take it all in, and how it affects several characters in its devilish maw. In the original the personal and the public stories meshed and melded brilliantly, but in this film the two elements do not work so well. The character of Shia La Beef(as an ambitious trader with a heart) is fragmentary and too poorly written, Josh Brolin (as ace villain) a papier mache construction, and Carey Mulligan (as Douglas's left wing daughter desperately trying to act American-style only with her face) pouts and pleads like a wet towel. Only Michael Douglas keeps the ship afloat throughout as he plots his comeback from jailtime and being bottom of the heap. But his timely exposure of the reasons for the meltdown do not match with his later re-ascendancy in the markets - it simply does not work. And the plot line that sees Carey Mulligan re-finance her father is ludicrous and unbelievable. But there are good things - Frank Langella as an old time Wall Streeter and the early visuals, especially as Shia is lured to his betrayal down on the NY subway by the Satan-like Gekko. Some of it works, but not half as well as it ought to have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heydays of Our Me-Decade Plutocrats and Their Twin Towers are Over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like The Social Network, Oliver Stone's 21-year follow-up is about organizations and brutes at their helm, and the complexities of honestly deconstructing capitalism from within our virtual oligarchy. He gasps and gusts with images for the trade and industry void, even if his drama comparatively lacks the throb of recent documentaries on deregulated financial markets' puppetry of our state of affairs. As in W., there's the sense of a softening cinematic rabble-rouser. Notwithstanding, it's both endearing and horrifying to watch this continuation, to see the crucial '80s model of beaming gangster self-indulgence, Me-Decade artifact Gordon Gekko, downgraded to an item of old-world diversion, for both the characters on screen and for we the audience. Is this the guy---this out-of-the-frame member of the old school who looks in the glow of the Great Recession like a petty operator---who stimulated such pervasive concern, such pop-culture stir back in the day? How amazingly immature we were---in the Reaganomics heyday of all times---about how much destruction the usurers could do to us.Gekko's back in Stone's regeneration of 1987's original, but only just. It's 2008, and he's already been out of prison for seven years, living rather moderately on his book, Is Greed Good? He lectures university students on how "the mother of all evil is speculation," that credit default swaps are the true weapons of mass destruction, that their (my) age group is screwed. Gordon today is, alarmingly, a voice of reason. And Douglas slips so effortlessly back into the role that even we who know him for a crook cannot help but be enamored while we've also got our eye on him.Gekko just cannot expect to weigh against the treachery of the economic offenders manning 2008 Wall Street, the ones he's now viewing objectively. If JFK was Stone's tribute to conspiracy theory, then his 18th dramatic film is his sketch of conspiracy reality, but dressed to the nines as fiction, about the billionaires who see $120 million as a modest share and scheme to preserve the monetary muscle-flexing that sustains them. It seems like some fearful vision when the Wall Street patriarchs sit around a Federal Reserve Bank conference table and plot ways they can stop their own wrongdoing from taking them down with the ship they so mercilessly shot at before, and get even wealthier in the process by inducing the government to pay their dues. Initially, I thought Brolin's disturbingly unflappable manner as one calculating brokerage head might be the eeriest element, but what's worse is that there's no heroic figure this time to drive home that wrong was committed and someone must pay. Deregulation, derivatives, middle-class devastation, all open to the elements. Few of us seemed to care much, until afterward, when we could pay righteously indignant lip service to the problem.This is, in some ways, much more pessimistic than its predecessor. The two Me-Decade plutocrats and the Twin Towers that conquered the skyline are all four pointedly missing here. '80s hostility has annihilated an emblematic backcloth and transmuted into a custom that's hardly noticeable anymore. Even the few smudges of optimism in this sprawling drama seem peculiarly muffled and conflicted. Our supposed protagonist, savvy broker Jake Moore, has an idea he's been shopping to anyone with ears, but unlike his 1987 foil, the eponymous half-man on ABC, who sustained a deteriorating airline and prevented blue-collar layoffs, Jake's a bona fide romantic in a world with no use for romantics. It's like the film is implying, by the absurdity of Jake's optimism, that impracticality is an even tougher outlook to hold today than when it already seemed quite aloof and tricky.If the film's final moments wind up conflicting somewhat dissonantly with what leads up to it, then, well, it's a dismissible flaw, as all that precedes was so vigorously told by a visual storytelling master. The opening sequence stages present-tense New York as a place as vivacious and active as ever sans employing any of the customary formula. Stone's sharp eye makes incisive points wherever he turns it, as when he concentrates on the jewelry glittering a Wall Street soirée. This is a very entertaining film, and a pretty upsetting one, too. For if Gekko was a word of warning back in '87, should we take his re-emergence as yet another prophecy of further economic ruin to come?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly good movie. This is a different movie to it's predecessor which is refreshing. It questions the importance of materialism and the loneliness that can creep into a persons life without the support of family and friends.Micheal Douglas portrays Gorden Gecko as a somewhat matured man, scarred by his years in prison and family dislocation. Shea Labeouf was also solid and believable in his role as Jake Moore, an extremely ambitious stock broker. There was an interesting contrast between his character and his girlfriend, who was politically left wing.Probably not as dynamic as Wall Street, but, particularly towards the end, an emotionally rewarding movie that the viewer should enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps picks up in 2008 (the film really opens in 2000, but I don't want to spoil things for those who haven't seen the first film yet) where we meet Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf), a young Wall Street trader looking to make his mark in the industry. He is reeling from the loss of a colleague and mentor. His main goal for now is to find the man responsible and have him pay dearly.At home, he has the lovely Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan) waiting for him. She wants nothing to do with Wall Street because of her father Gordon (Michael Douglas) and what the business did to her home life. When Gordon resurfaces, Jake sees this as a major opportunity to reunite Winnie with her father, and also to pick the brain of one of the smartest minds ever to work on Wall Street.With his help Jake finds himself working for Bretton James (Josh Brolin), a man Gordon knows well and who is also the man Jake has been looking to bring down. Like a modern day Gangs of New York, Jake works his way into his close-knit group of workers. Gordon all the while looks on like a hawk, waiting to swoop in to remake himself as a king of Wall Street.For those who have not seen the first film, you will have no problem understanding the film because, due to the large time gap, most of the characters have changed and the main characters are operating on different motors. There are a lot of references to the first film, something you may find cliché or clever depending on where you stand, but I think it's necessary to get the full concept of the film if you have seen the predecessor.The film really follows through with some beautiful visuals, including some complicated crane shots around the skyscrapers and some beautifully saturated footage at a gala event. The world has changed drastically since the 80s, and the business world is no exception. Offices are less sterile and the technology is sexier. That said, the business of Wall Street is as cutthroat as ever, something Jake finds out first hand.The star of the film is of course Douglas. His character has barely lost any bite in over 20 years, and thank goodness. Gordon Gekko is one of the greatest villains of all time, because it's so fun to hate him. He's charismatic, brilliant, ruthless, and cold hearted. Though he might have aged a few years, those eyes still stare through your soul and into you wallet. His supporting cast of LaBeauf, Mulligan, and Brolin work fluidly around him. Though the film is really about LeBeauf's character, it is Douglas that brings out the best in him.I guess the only thing I really didn't like was the story. It's too relevant to be turning it into fiction. Yes the market was in trouble in 2008, but we all knew the players. It's not the right time to be making up new parties. The worst part of the story lies in it's ending. I won't give it away, but let's just say that certain characters shouldn't act a certain way, especially for such a lame reason.It's not a bad movie by any means. It's certainly not even close to being on par as the original, but it's a nice compliment and could be a great gateway for new viewers to go back and watch the original. Stone has taken a lot of risks in the past few decades (World Trade Center, W., Alexander), none of which really panned out, though I wasn't totally against W. I hope he looks for something more original next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To greed, all nature is insufficient." ? Seneca The Stoic "Wall Street 2" opens with financier Gordon Gekko's (Michael Douglas) release from prison, where he has served eight years for insider trading. The film then watches as Gekko tries to re-establish himself within two worlds: that of high finance and that of his estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan).Fittingly, Gekko spends most of the movie off screen. He's a puppet master, pulling strings from the shadows, moving money and people to conform to his own warped little games. While he does this, the film charts Winnie's relationship with Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf), a Wall Street trader who walks a tightrope between all consuming capitalism and a deep interest in green energy. In short, Jake is painted as the acceptable face of capitalism. He's a nice guy who sticks up for sacked employees, loves the environment and vengefully vows to get even when the company of his surrogate father is destroyed by a corporate raider played by Josh Brolin.If the film is far too easy on Jake's lifestyle, it is even more confused about Winnie's. She despises her father's values (to the extent of becoming a journalist for a leftist website), and yet here she is shacked up with a guy like Jake. "You're so Wall Street you make me sick," she yells.Watching the film a second time, I looked for signs that director Oliver Stone was being ironic, or satirical, with these characters. That he believes them to represent some amorphous, slippery new future where green energy, leftist writers, environmentalism and capitalist greed hook up to form a new, amorphous, mutant strain of capitalism ("Buy now and save the planet!"); a wholly hypocritical "kinder" capitalism. After all, Stone's previous film was "South of the Border", in which he warily examined what Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez calls "21st century socialism". But no, Stone seems to be sincere about these characters. Playing the game is fine, he says, as long as you plant a tree afterwards. The reason the audience's stance toward Winnie and Jake is important is because it casts a light on the film's ending. The film ends with Gekko "stealing" millions from his daughter and abandoning his family in favour for jump-starting his financial empire. Jake then brings Gekko an image of his unborn grandchild and gives Gekko a choice: money or family. What does Gekko do? He chooses family, donates millions to a green energy fund and lives happily ever after with his daughter, an ending which many read as being hokey and silly.Indeed, it is a silly ending, but ONLY if we accept it at face value. Look closer and Gekko is watching that grainy picture of his grandchild with nothing but twisted desire. The kid's a brand-new, untainted acquisition, and the family unit at the end of the film is nothing but the warped face of 21st century capital, greed, green, charity, exploitation, left, right, environmentalism and strip mining happily existing in the same space. It's the World Bank and the IMF raping the Third World, and then rationalising it all by giving a little aid and funding a little "noble" research.So the quality of the film rests on whether Gekko has become a "good guy" or a super parasite. On whether he is reformed, or is now the embodiment of a new strain of capitalism, now able to both infect everything, and feign being a father (benevolent, caring, empathic etc). Which view is correct? Does Stone intend for his characters to be taken at anything but face value? I don't know - Stone's an inept satirist - but it makes the difference between this film being terrible, and excellent.Regardless, the film does several other things well. Stone points out that the only things "Made In USA" nowadays are weapons and mass entertainment and elsewhere bathes his film in neat baroque touches. For example, Brolin is cast because he once played George Bush (one of the culprits behind 2008's economic collapse), Eli Wallach is cast because he was in "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", a film famous for being about gold and greed (and the song ecstasy of gold, which is Jake's mobile ring tone), and Brolin owns a painting by Goya which depicts Saturn eating his children. What also works well are Stone's allusions to cancer, infections, evolution and adaptation. The film paints greed and predation as a virus that infects and taints one generation after the next, always morphing so that it can get a little closer to its host targets.On the downside, the film is filled with Stone's usual blunt metaphors (greedy characters are called Moore) and obnoxious symbolism, with floating bubbles (economic bubbles rise and pop), and fetish like shots of computer panels and skyscrapers. We forgave this in the original "Wall Street" because we were seduced by Gekko's financial phallus, but the sequel's new Gekko (a low key, more disarming guy ? a far closer representation of today's genteel yet predatory money movers), doesn't gel well with Stone's macho aesthetic. Gekko has aged, but Stone is still clinging to youthful bluster, his style hard, energetic and masculine, when it should be the more fluid, gentle, amorphous thing that is 21st century capital. Gekko's still creepy, but in a quieter way. Stone's aesthetic fails to make a similar shift.This is because Stone is happiest tagging along after charisma champs and alpha men. But capitalism thrives on flow, networks and facelessness. It's about shared psychoses and systems, rather than individuals, and doesn't operate according to the rules of classic drama. 8/10 ? Incidentally, there are actually three "Wall Street" films ("Wall Street" (1929), "Wall Street" (1987), "Wall Street 2" (2010)), each coinciding with a massive market crash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say I think that the reviews criticising the storyline are unfair. I think the story, and Douglas, are the best things about the film. For me, the storyline works perfectly. However, LaBeouf does not convince in every scene, and Mulligans performance is very poor. Brolin does a reasonable job, not his best performance, but quite effective. Of course, Douglas steals every scene he is in. I can understand that Stone wanted to concentrate more on LaBeouf and Mulligan to develop the story, but had Douglas been in more scenes, this could have been so much better. Don't be surprised if he gets at least an Oscar nomination. The jargon about the financial markets didn't detract from the story. I left cinema feeling entertained, but that it had just fallen short. Finally, Eli Wallach, what a performance, 95 years old!! The bird noises were genuinely hilarious AND surreal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel merely skims over surface of greed and barely shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most Western economies, Oliver Stone's sequel to "Wall Street" goes through cycles of boom and bust.In a world where bad debt can be sliced, diced and swapped, and a transaction is either in the money, at the money or out of it, the only sure winner is greed. In "Money Never Sleeps," greed has moved up a notch, according to convicted insider trader and fraudster Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). Twenty-three years ago, he declared that "greed is good," but now he says "it seems to be legal because everyone is drinking the same Kool Aid." Freed after eight years in prison, Gekko gets back to the business of survival and picks up the pieces of his once-opulent life while dreaming to get hold of a staggering amount of dirty money he had laundered in Switzerland. His personal redemption is in the hands of his only daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan), an embittered woman who has not spoken to him in ages.He finds a perfect bridge in her fiancé, the brilliant investment bank analyst Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). The two men are a good fit because their thirst for vengeance runs through parallel veins, and they share an instinct for stealth and cunning. Jake wants to mow down the new Gekko on the block, the sleek Bretton James (Josh Brolin), who had driven his benefactor and mentor to suicide. Gekko, whose downfall James helped orchestrate, is more than willing to help.Much like Gekko, director Oliver Stone returns to the scene of his original hit to find it a somewhat different place. The clunky cell-phone of 1987 has become a featherweight multimedia gizmo, clean energy futures are blue-chip hot and new economic superpowers are moving up in the world. Though personal matters are more pressing now than market gyrations, they are necessarily intertwined and Stone finds himself juggling, not without success, the elements of his story ?- revenge, family reconciliation and the "moral hazards" of the Street.As Gekko tells an old lady during a signing of his book "Is Greed Good?," moral hazard is when somebody dupes somebody and gets away with it, loot and all. The original "Wall Street" rode bravely on the back of the theme of moral hazard and sparkled. This sequel simply skims over the surface of greed and barely shines.Next to the federal government and the family, Wall Street is the most important of U.S. institutions. Amid the financial scandals, market meltdowns and depression of recent years, Americans on Main Street are asking questions about why and how they happened. But it may be too much to ask of a movie to provide the answers. It's a safe bet that Stone was not intimidated by the challenge, content to simply pose the questions. Jake's sweet revenge on his new patron and mentor James nearly doesn't happen, but when it does, it's not because of a well contrived trap or Gekko's machinations. Both are rendered superfluous by the exposes of Jack and the liberal Internet blog site run by Winnie and the intervention of federal authorities. It's perhaps a less exciting course but one that is true-to- life and avoids piling up more money-speak that this movie already has in heaps. What's left is the tale of a broken family and Stone explores this angle spiritedly, mixing high drama with mush. The result leaves much to be desired; the conclusion is unearned and the decisions made by the characters are arbitrary and unconvincing.This film is a sumptuous banquet for the cast. Frank Langella as Jake's father figure Lou Zabel fires up the movie to a dazzling start. He's so wrapped up in his role that one can imagine him playing Gekko with the same verve and ruthless efficiency of Michael Douglas. There is nothing more to say about Douglas's performance except that he adds slimy charisma and more venom to his reptile, plus a skin layer of vulnerability that he can slough off and put on as needed.Despite a face that's more teen computer whiz than Wall Street wheeler-dealer, a committed LaBeouf acts more maturely than Jake's supposed age, fine-tuning his emotions and bonding most closely to every one in the drama. Mulligan's Carrie is more technique than Method but it's still early in her career and she has the choice of becoming a Helen Hayes, a Stockard Channing or a Meryl Streep someday. Square-jawed Brolin as James is a competent but rather self-effacing robber baron.One can listen for hours to this movie's lines: the razor-sharp rebuke; the witty riposte; the allusions to evolution and pop culture; the droll maxims and aphorisms spiced with a New York twang; plus Mae West's celebrated quote about two evils. When they fit the character, they're good. And when they don't, they're good.Images loaded with symbolism are part of Stone's flashy mannerisms. Here he employs fluorescent 3D charts of stock quotations; tulips, as in the mother of all investment bubbles, the tulip mania of 1637; and the inevitable soap bubbles. (Cotton candy would have been subtler.) New York City's skyline looks particularly stately, as if to proclaim the obvious, its prime position in the world. These symbols reach an eye-popping level at a charity dinner shot in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the camera parades the women's Cartier baubles, Bvlgari earrings and Harry Winston beads from Tiffany's or some other haute jewelers. But nothing beats Stone's accidental metaphor for Wall Street. He was right on the money when he cast 95-year-old Eli Wallach as a shriveled banker whose bird-call during board meetings is the modern-day equivalent of a Roman emperor's thumb-down for gladiators. With his wizened face, snake eyes and the smile of the Grim Reaper, he fits the bill for the prophet of doom in a financial world that ignores the lessons of history to slump time and again into the arms of greed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gekko's back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone could have something interesting to say about the 2008 financial crisis and its consequences, it would be Oliver Stone, American cinema's prime troublemaker, whose first foray into the world of Wall Street, with the eponymous 1987 film, was a sharp critique of the yuppie approach to money-making, though some failed to get that message and viewed the film's main character, capitalism icon Gordon Gekko (an Oscar-winning Michael Douglas), as a role model. 23 years later, the filmmaker returns to that world with the unexpected sequel Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and Gekko remains his weapon of choice to tell us what went wrong.The only difference is, years in prison have changed Gekko: short on cash and estranged from his daughter Winnie (Carey Mulligan) after his son died of an overdose, he nevertheless manages to get back in the spotlight with his new opinions on the financial system, recounted in a book that, in a shocking reversal of the original film's most famous scene, bears the title Is Greed Good? Needless to say, when the market collapses, those words become very vivid, particularly after Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella), one of the top names in the business, commits suicide. Rumors suggest he was driven to it by the actions of the ruthless and arrogant Bretton James (Josh Brolin), and Zabel's former protegé Jacob Moore (Shia LaBoeuf), seeking revenge, turns to the reformed Gekko for help. As it turns out, Gordon has very good reasons for getting involved: not only is Jacob dating Winnie, it also appears Bretton had something to do with his incarceration. And you know what they say about payback...Much like the original, Money Never Sleeps (a line from the first film that receives a different treatment this time around) presents itself as a very classic story - this time, it's all about revenge and redemption - mixed with a potent look at the present economic reality. However, despite numerous smart references to the 1987 prototype (same font for the opening credits, same closing song and, of course, a cracking cameo by Charlie Sheen, who seems to have just walked off the set of Two and a Half Men), the sequel is a much more conventional affair: whereas the first Wall Street drew a lot of its power from a refusal to label single people as good or bad guys, this time Stone goes to great lengths to emphasize who we should root for and who we should despise. Maybe the fact that he didn't write the screenplay has something to do with it, as does his less angry approach of recent years: it's hard to imagine the '80s Stone pandering to audience tastes like he does with this film's ill-conceived feel-good coda (reportedly added after negative feedback at the movie's Cannes screening) and a largely pointless mother-son subplot (Susan Sarandon, playing Jacob's mom, doesn't really fit in).Lucky for us, then, that Douglas hasn't lost any of his edge: his screen time may have been reduced to showcase the younger talent (and it must be said LaBoeuf is less disastrous than some had anticipated, though he bears no comparison to Sheen), but from the very moment Gekko gets his huge cellphone back as he is released from jail, it's clear that the "greed is good" man will deliver the goods, which he does with relish and a kind of energy that's been missing from his work in the past few years. Langella is also predictably excellent, and Brolin is a charismatic bad guy, but the standout is Eli Wallach, whose recollection of the 1929 crisis - which the actor really experienced - is one of the few topical high points.If the first Wall Street was a necessary product of its time, the second one is an entertaining but slightly hollow attempt to do the same thing in a very different climate. Then again, how do you get past the paradox of a subject like the recession being discussed in a movie that cost 70 million dollars to make?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Performances By No Real Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010) ** 1/2 (out of 4) I think the moral lesson of WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS is that Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) isn't the biggest thief in the world. This film picks up as Gekko is released from prison and we flash forward seven years when a young trader (Shia LaBeouf) shows up at a speech he's giving and informs him that he's about to marry his daughter (Carey Mulligan). Gekko, who hasn't seen his daughter in years, is interested in using the young guy to start up a relationship with his daughter but to also take down a Wall Street big wig (Josh Brolin). I think a lot of people were shocked when it was announced that Douglas and Stone were teaming up for a sequel to WALL STREET nearly twenty-five years after that said film and performance became iconic. It took a lot of guts for them to try and update this story but I think in the end you can't help but call this a disappointment considering all the talent involved. I think one of the biggest problems is the screenplay, which just doesn't seem mean or tough enough. I never really got what it was trying to do. Were we suppose to be looking at these traders as evil men? Were we suppose to be happy that these people are out there? Were we suppose to look up to someone like Gekko who served more time in prison than a murderer would? I'm really not sure what the screenplay was trying to get done here but it did come as a minor shock to see Stone didn't have a hand in the writing and this might explain why the film seems a little watered down and in the end it doesn't pack much of a bite. Douglas slips right back into the role of Gekko but it's more than just a good performance. The performance is one I'd call more smart than good because you can really look at the character and see certain traits that we saw in 1987 but at the same time you can tell how much wiser and older the guy is. Douglas has no problems getting into the part but he does more than just trying to recapture the spirit of the previous film. Mulligan continues to impress with an extremely strong performance and her scenes with her father are quite touching. The love/hate between the father and daughter take up a large portion of the running time and this is actually the best stuff in the film. Frank Langella doesn't appear that often in the film but when he's on he's extremely good. Brolin makes for a great villain and Eli Wallach has some real fun and we even get a few nods to THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. We even have Susan Sarandon in a pretty good bit as well as a pretty fun cameo. Then, there's LaBeouf. I know the Indiana Jones posse already have a hit out on the guy so I don't want to pile on too much but he's just not strong enough to carry the film. Not once did I believe him as this hot shot but what's worse is that each time he's on screen with the other actors (which is a lot) he just seems so out of place. It's somewhat like looking at a pool of Olympic swimmers and then there's someone in the background struggling to stay above water. He's not horrible but he's certainly out of his league. Stone's direction isn't quite as flashy as the first film but he holds everything together fairly well. He certainly has the father/daughter relationship going right just like the first film did its father-son between the Sheen's. The problem is the Wall Street stuff and the dealings with the banks. It just never played out in the end and when you see that they spent $70 million on this thing you can't help but think it caused the rather embarrassing and out of place ending.</fullReview>

For the average movie goer who is not stock market savvy, you will probably be bored early on .

We all know by now the stock market has always been manipulated by the guys at the top . As a viewer I found I was being manipulated by director Oliver Stone again, especially with a hokey, cornball ending that even I saw coming a mile away ! I expected Michael Douglas ( Gordon Gekko, not the GEICO Gekko ) to have a somewhat larger and more significant role in this under performing sequel . I would rename this bore-fest " Wall Street 2 : You just wasted 12 bucks " Definitely Not Hot , ... P.W.H.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers the goods, but should have been much more interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel does deliver the goods, and you get your money's worth, but Gordon Gekko should have been the star here. When he's not on screen, the movie is a bit flimsy. I did enjoy the subplot where Winnie Gekko struggles to come to terms with the fact that her father was in prison for so long. I just thought this was resolved way too soon. And the relationship between her and Jake is hardly credible, and Susan Sarandon is just phoning it in here. I also enjoyed the story involving Louis Zabel, who apparently decides life (at least on Wall Street) is too much to bear, especially after putting up with Bretton James, a character who wasn't especially evil. To me, he didn't seem so much evil as misguided. Is he supposed to be a villain or an antihero? As for Charlie Sheen's cameo, it wasn't anything special. After what happened to him at the end of the 1987 movie, I expected something completely different. He seemed more like a guy who just dropped in, instead of somebody who used to be part of Wall Street. Overall, "Money Never Sleeps" plays more like a separate movie than a sequel.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Market behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a complex movie, even worst if you know nothing about market behavior, but is an excellent movie about a systemic decease in how the market operates and how humans behave about greed and fall in speculation. Is very well acting, directing and the music is great. So many are disappointed because they spec something else about Gecko, but in fact the movie is about States economical crisis in the problem behind. Speculation is about future oranges, oranges that you don't have yet. At first is not bad to speculate about oranges and how much juice you will get this year; but if you speculate about oranges of trees that you don't have planted yet, or even worse, the seed has not born yet, you are getting in serious problem. In many ways is how the market operates when people try to get today profit without considered tomorrow profit, danger and equity. Special in this movie is the concept of moral advice when people think to invest. A movie to help teaching many concepts about market behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is there so many angry comments here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was actually pretty good. Yes, you could say that Stone does get a little too sentimental here and that this isn't so much about the real Wall Street as the original.It's because this movie is so different from the original that I think people get so angry here. This isn't really a movie about Wall Street but about time. Someone once said that time is money. You trade your time for a fee. That's what I thought this movie was about.Gordon Gekko feels cheated of time. He feels he has been screwed royally by all, the Josh Brolin character, his daughter and of course the government who put him in prison. What does he do about it? He tries to get a little back. Since he can't have the time back, he settles for the money. As he later explains, it's not about the money. It's about the juice he gets from wheeling and dealing.But as we see later in the film, when he gets what he think he wants, he suddenly realises it's the wrong thing he's been after. Unlike many critics here, I think it is a believable turn of character. It's magnificently displayed in a wordless scene, where Gekko is looking at his trust's net worth and then the sonogram of his unborn grandchild.That's what the theme of this movie is. Granted, you don't get an epiphany like that so fast in real life, but it's a movie for c....sakes. People's priorities do change over a lifetime and I totally believe this ending.As for the other theme of the economic crisis today, I think it is as developed as it can be. The scene at Fordham explains it all. People are being suckered into consuming much more than they can ever pay back and banks are the predators today, not the businesses.So, kudos to Oliver Stone and the screenwriters to find a subject that actually touched a nerve. The original Wall Street was the story of the 80s. This is a story about the time we live in now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the best movies of the year. its got a great cast, a great story, and put some things that surprised you. i liked this movie better than the first movie because you saw a kinder and better side to gekko than you did in the first one. what Gordon wants in this film to reconnect with his daughter after getting out of jail. Jake is gekkos daughters fiancé. Jake's shia labeouf. anyway there is another story going on also. there is this new guy named Breton James ( played by josh brolin). and he is like the Gordon gekko from the first wall street.he puts the company Jake works for out of business and Jake's friend Louis zabel who also happens to own the company commits suicide because of it. thats how Gordon and Jake met. he wanted Gordon's help and in return Gordon wanted Jake to help him reconnect with his daughter. i thought this movie was much much better than the first. i thought it was very good to bring back Charlie sheen's character bud fox back in it to see whats happened to him even though he was only in it for a few minutes. this was a pure classic and Michael Douglas should get an Oscar for his role in this. either him or Colin Farrel. me personally would go with Michael Douglas if he even gets nominated. i hope does. anyway watch this movie. in fact get it on DVD you wont regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps" as much or more than I liked the first "Wall Street." I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, and now that I've seen Carey Mulligan I'll be looking for her films. These two were most of the movie. The older actors took a back seat or else the young couple stole the show. It was a sweet love story with Wall Street business for excitement. I felt good after I had seen this movie.Some of the things I especially liked were the title song from "Carousel" when they had a grand ballroom waltz . . . I want that on my MP3. And, the cinematography of the architecture of the New York night lights on those sky scrapers was something I would rewind to see again at home. Beautiful! I wish it were in IMAX.

		<shortDescription>Gekko is back. He has a number of surprises. Which one comes first?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mention the words "stock market" or "Wall Street" and most likely negative shivers trickle down the average Joe's spine envisioning crooked wheeling-and-dealing jokers trying to make a quick buck. No surprise white collar criminals have had their share of spotlight inferring pure robbery as a legitimate profession. The first Wall Street movie explained brilliantly why people behave in such manner ("Greed Is Good") yet curious souls wonder where else to explore on this topic. If you are a mastermind at taking advantage of people's weaknesses then what else is there to drain? Perhaps Wall Street part two will lead the way for upcoming generations of fools. Or will it? Movie begins with Gordon Gekko leaving prison and no one waiting for him. Not sure what this implied but eventually it catches the eye of the viewer. Next up is Jake Moore (Shia LeBeouf) learning of Gekko's release but his mistress vehemently opposes him watching the footage on CNBC. New York City lifestyle is heavily embraced from the dialect to the beautiful Manhattan skyline and what's most astonishing is how Jake Moore alongside his nightclub guys are conversing in financial slang whereas the norm would have these individuals speaking in city tongue. Go to any fancy bar or nightclub in New York City and start your conversation with, "What's the P/E ratio on DELL's stock?" Prepare for a deer in the headlights look followed by a whack in the face.Market declines, the Bear Stearns collapse, and Lehman Brothers selling out to JP Morgan Chase for $2/share are all non-fictional events that are masterfully portrayed by Oliver Stone and opposite of the first Wall Street movie. A fantastic move to throw in similarities to a dark reality but that's about all that saves this movie from pointlessness.Wall Street part two moves very quickly in numerous directions falling victim to too much going on to understand. Jake Moore wants to be the bridge to repair Gekko's relationship with his daughter (Winnie played by Carey Mulligan whom Moore is dating), billionaire Bretton James (played by Josh Brolin who funny enough looks like a mix between Julio Iglesias and Pierce Brosnan) puts together a plan for Moore to work at his firm, meanwhile Gekko and Moore come up with a cheesy plan to "get" him for a past dirty deed. And, suddenly, Winnie becomes pregnant. These components contribute to the plot but not very well. The main focus is Gekko.$100 million is magically instilled into the storyline which leads to Gekko using his tactful worthiness to scam the money from his daughter. He then moves over to London, England and starts his own investment firm. Voila! Within a snap of two fingers he's worth $1.2 billion. Give me a break! Despite the turbulent changes, Stone throws a few cameos to help invigorate fans of the first Wall Street movie. Charlie Sheen makes an appearance at a charity dinner. And so does the ugly real estate lady who sells Bud Fox the Manhattan apartment. A mafia looking Fed Chairman can only bring laughter since he would never end up in that seat in reality.Movies that have a sequel created solely based on the glamor of a particular character almost never turn out stellar in terms of comparing to the original. Examples include Another 48 Hrs, Beverly Hills Cop II, Rambo II, etc... This movie is light years ahead of any of the aforementioned titles and may impress newbies fascinated with big money/big city culture. However Wall Street Two says money never sleeps. Try telling that to the guy snoring in the front aisle.</fullReview>

So what if Michael Douglas is so strong you can't believe he is anyone other then Michael Douglas, or maybe Kirk Douglas.The end credits are excellent and very welcome as the movie is too long and just doesn't work. There is plenty of walking and talking, sitting around the table and talking, and talking.The movie flips from the business story to the relationship story. Oliver Stone deserves a ticket for making these turns without using his blinker. Seeing him on screen was also a distraction. When was the last time an "Iris In" was used in the middle of a film? There are some good moments, enough for a trailer. Frank Langella seemed like the kinda guy to be driven in a limo but the writer needed more drama. The final scene felt tacked on, maybe a result of preview screening audiences wanting a Hollywood ending. The soap bubbles were a nice touch. Hate to burst your bubble this sequel is a sleeping dog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't exactly need to see the sequel to "Wall Street" to comprehend how completely the market has changed in the past twenty years?Watching the original film today makes that more than apparent. It's still a fascinating time capsule from 1987, almost a work of science fiction now. Cue Rod Serling?"Imagine, if you will, a world in which the greatest economic hazard is making too much, too quickly."But greed is not the antagonist in "Money Never Sleeps." Debt is. Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after an eight-year stretch for insider trading only to discover that his money now torments him in its very absence. Picking up in 2008, the entire cast of affluent characters in the film is haunted by the global economic crisis and even more intimate money matters.Shia LaBeouf plays Jake Moore, a trader who invests his million-dollar bonus the night before the market collapses, just after buying an extravagant wedding ring to propose to his girlfriend, Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan). After Moore gets the opportunity to speak with his new father-in-law, the two begin a series of unorthodox transactions; Gordon wants an opportunity to get closer to his estranged daughter, which Jake orchestrates in exchange for the opportunity to further his career.In that way, "Money Never Sleeps" follows a similar template to the original, with Gekko acting as protégé to a young, cutthroat trader. The sequel, however, has a more ambitious, branching story and what feels like a much larger cast. It suffers somewhat for its sprawling narrative, but the film is grounded by a strong emotional center. "Wall Street" is still the more rousing film, but "Money Never Sleeps," is appropriately more dour, downbeat and moody; the films are alike only in their committed reflection of their respective economic climates.Both "Wall Street" films seem to find Oliver Stone at his most experimental. His multimedia gimmickry doesn't always work, but he never seems to be at a loss for a new way to present information. "Money Never Sleeps" paints the stock market index across the New York skyline, fractures into split-screens, and cedes itself entirely to illustrated figures that would seem more at home in a documentary. Stone can sometimes be a frustratingly predictable director, and small flourishes like these are what make the "Wall Streets" stand out in his filmography.But viewer beware, for all its stylishness, "Money Never Sleeps" will bore many. It is an uncompromisingly slow film, especially in its drooping middle?devotees of the fast-paced original will be particularly let down. But while the clock-check quotient is relatively high in places, I believe it ultimately reaches a satisfying payoff.After all, what makes these films tick is their characters, and this sequel is no slouch. They make not be as vibrant or distinct as the people who populated the 1987 film, but again, they have to support a modern disillusionment with the market that didn't exist back then. The characters in Stone's original are eccentric, quirky, domineering, and vivacious. The characters in "Money Never Sleeps" are sullen, worn, and scared.And then there's Gekko. It's interesting that Douglas' portrayal of him is the most enduring part of the original film; but then it's obvious when you see him as that character. He is capitalism, a physical manifestation of it. Douglas owns the performance, and though Gekko has been beaten into a shell of his former self in "Money Never Sleeps," he's still plain fun to watch. The charisma is there, and Douglas supplements a terrific irony to the character in playing him broke. "Bet you don't have one of these," he boasts to Moore during their first encounter, flashing his NYC MetroCard."Money Never Sleeps," for better or for worse, is the "Wall Street" our generation gets. It's a time capsule from 2010, an imperfect but equally relevant window into our languishing economy. In twenty years, we can only hope it all looks like science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Will Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen the original Wall Street, and being that I was nine years old when the movie was released and kids just don't like watching movies that deal with money, this movie did intrigue me enough to see it at theater. It wasn't the greatest movie I've seen, but it had a good story to tell and some really good performances.Going into this movie, I really didn't know what the plot was. In fact, I'm a terrible reviewer because I can't remember many of the character's names in this movie. I guess Shia Labitch's character's name is Jacob, and his girlfriend's name is Winnie Gekko. Michael Douglas's character's name is Gordon Gekko and Josh Brolin (who I am glad is still working after all these years since being Brand on The Goonies) is named Breton. Maybe that's all I needed to know.So I thought the plot was that Shia's character finds Gordon and wants him to show him the ways of making money and getting to the top, like a mentor. I was sorta right, however, and the film started out that way. Shia has this boss who the movie establishes very early on that he's a father figure and gives him this huge sum of cash and tells him to spend in on the economy. Shia gives him a kiss on the head and right there, I should have thought, "Frank Langella is going to die." By the way, Frank offered a wonderful performance in this movie.In the scene where he is gathered around the round table while his peers tears him down for being bankrupt was the film's turning point. Our villain, played by Josh Brolin, offers to buy his shares for two dollars a piece. Frank responds with that he would never sell to the likes of him. So just as they are leaving, Frank counter offers with six. Josh raises the stakes to three. After some negotiating, Frank ends with four, and says something like, "I don't want to look anymore pathetic that it already is." And as the true villain, Josh sticks with, "Three. And not a penny more." I was half expecting him to spit in his face when he left, as it would be just as kosher.So then Frank commits suicide and Shia wants revenge against Brand from The Goonies. Meanwhile, he seeks advice from Gordon Gekko in exchange for reuniting him with his daughter who Shia just happens to be dating. The true scene stealer in this movie is Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko. He has the best lines, by far, like, "You stop telling lies about me, and I'll stop telling the truth about you." However, I felt his character was underused, and the focus is more on Shia's character rather than Gordon's. Which is a shame, because honestly the movie is a lot more enjoyable with Gordon than with Shia.After the movie was over, it felt underwhelming. It was a good film, with several scene encounters between characters that make you wonder what exactly is going to be exchanged between the two and the twists in the story keeps it interesting. However, the ending just didn't feel right to me. I don't want to say much but it just seemed like the overall product was initially longer than what it was supposed to be and that the ending was probably more chosen by the studio than Oliver Stone himself. I could be wrong but it felt that way.Does it make me want to see the first Wall Street? Absolutely. With more Gordon Gekko and less with Shia is always a plus to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Offering from Stone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hesitant about seeing this film because my last Oliver Stone experience, "W," was underwhelming to say the least. However, the famed director redeemed himself with "Wall Street 2." The cast is superb. Shia is not only eye candy, he has the goods, he'll be an actor to watch for the foreseeable future. Mulligan with her unique look took some adjusting to as the female lead, but once you get used to her, her character works. You begin to accept and even root for them as a couple. Their chemistry is really appealing and even welcoming.Other highlights are the cameos, from Charlie Sheen to what seemed like the whole cast of CNBC anchors to even Stone himself who appeared more than once on film.The plot and storyline are solid, even if predictable in some areas (like Gecko cleaning out his house and shipping out after being wired the money from overseas.) The movie is great but not flawless. It felt a little slow, long, and drawn out in some areas. As aforementioned, some of the characters took a little getting used to. Frank Langella looked out of place when first being introduced on screen, on the stock exchange floor, his age a major contrast to the surrounding more youthful stock traders. Mulligan's character was a little irritating with all her hatred towards her dad, especially so if you didn't know the storyline from the previous movie. In fairness, they did attempt to explain a little afterwards so it wasn't a huge problem. It also took some getting used to seeing Susan Sarandon play a slacker. And even Lebouf's character seems a little old for the young looking actor at first, but he pulls it off as the film unfolds. I could nitpick other small things here and there, but none of it really takes away from the overall quality of the film.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Having spent nine years in the can, federal penitentiary, the once all powerful Wall Street market mover Gordon Gekko, Michael Douglas, is released from prison with no one, and I mean no one, there the greet him or give him a ride back home to his halfway house.What really ticked Gekko off is that his daughter Winnie, Carey Mulligan, didn't even bother to go see him at a time when he, with everyone he knew on the "street" turning their backs on him, needed her most! Winnie has nothing but contempt for her dad in holding him responsible for her moms mental breakdown and her older brother Rudy having OD'ed on hard drugs! It's in fact Gekko's daughter's live in boyfriend hot shot stock broker Jake Moore, Shia Labeouf, who makes any contact with him in trying to get Gekko together with Winne. Jake also has ulterior motives to get in good with Gekko in that he's determined to get back at big shot Wall Street Hedge Fund manager Bretton James, Josh Brolin, for driving his good friend boss and mentor Louis Zabel, Frank Langella, to kill himself by jumping in front of a New York subway train. That after James in a planned hostile takeover of his business spread rumors about Louis' brokerage firm Keller &amp; Zable about to go under! This caused Keller &amp; Zable stock prices to plummet from 79 to 2 dollars a share in less then two weeks! Gekko plays it close to the vest in giving Jake all the information he needs to get in with James in becoming a member of his Hedge Fund operation having his own reasons to take James out and put him behind bars. Not only did James destroy Louis Zabel but also Gekko himself in being the person far more then Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), who wiretapped him for the FBI, who ratting him out to the Feds that had Gekko convicted and sent to prison for nine years on his insider trading and stock fraud rap back in 1988! Now by using Jake together with his unsuspecting daughter Winnie, who has the means for him to do it, Gekko is planning to get back at Bretton James Big Time! Like a leopard Gordon Gekko didn't change his spots he only camouflaged them. Coming across at first as a reformed stock and Wall Street swindler and wanting to have nothing to do with making money in the stock market Gekko in fact planned to use the some 100 million dollars that he secretly held in trust,in a Swiss bank account, for his daughter Winne as ammunition against the hated Betton James in destroying his financial empire that he build up over the broken bodies of men like Louis Zable. As things turned out James himself did all the work for Gekko in his greed and stupidity by getting in over his head by playing it fast an loose in the very dangerous and speculative derivative and real estate markets! This all came to a devastating conclusion on the morning of of "Black Monday" September 15, 2008 when the stock market tanked because of the trillions of dollars of toxic assets that James and his fellow Hedge Fund manipulators accumulated over the last five or so years!***SPOILER*** Sitting back and enjoying the fun in the stock market meltdown that he saw coming Gekko, by leaking it, had his daughter's financial website release information on James' unscrupulous actions, through his secret off shore Hedge Fund, that just about destroyed the financial markets not only in the USA but the entire world as well! James now broken and penniless is to face the music and feel what Gordon Gekko went through some 20 years ago that he was responsible for. Back on top of the financial world Gekko in his London office is confronted by his future son in law Jake Moore in what a low down manipulating creep he was by pulling off the financial scam of the century and at the same time making himself filthy rich off it. Besides all that Gekko also ended up swindling his own daughter out of her trust fund as well! But the news from Jake in him soon to become a grandfather, with Winnie about to give birth to his grandson, and leaving both daughter and grandson out in the cold by pulling the rug, Winnie's 100 million dollar trust fund, from right under them finally brought Gekko's good side, if he ever had one, out in the open!Moving and very touching ending with Gordon Gekko doing the right thing for the first time in his rotten and miserable life and thus for once making a "Mench", Man in Yiddish, of himself. It wasn't an easy task for Gekko to do, give back the money he stole, but it did helped him sleep at night as well as be able look at himself in the mirror!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't happen often, but for once the follow-up here, is much better than the original. Of course it's because of Oliver Stone. Is there any film-maker today with his total control of what he's doing? Maybe not. This is so well done.Has Gordon Gekko gone human? No, that would be to ask too much. His sentimentality in some scenes is like that of the crocodile, being sorry for his dinner. There is also critic of capitalism here, but it doesn't go beyond that even economy journalists have been capable of after the latest crisis.Purely entertaining and really great handicraft by Stone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just loved this movie, so interesting to watch, excellent performances by Carey Mulligan, Shia Labeouf, frank Langella and josh Brolin. Michael Douglas was good too but not as much as he was in the first movie of course. Susan sarandon and sheen in cameo, wow. Stone handles the financial stuff quite well. This movie is by turns brilliant and dumb, naive and wise, nowhere near good enough and something close to great. "Money Never Sleeps" is never boring, even as its plot descends into cheap melodrama and the script runs out of banter about the "the NINJA generation - no income, no job, no assets." If you haven't seen the original Wall Street, you better. Its a masterpiece, in Oliver Stone's hey day, the iconic movie of the 1980's yuppie lifestyles of the rich and shameless. This sequel can be entertaining, but it's flat, the whole concept I think was too complicated for the masses, I would understand if it was too hard to follow for many. It wasn't spectacular in any way, but I didn't like its bluntness and how relationships were explored, and it was not until the latter part of the movie when the whole plan is revealed would you get to appreciate the whole "con". Oliver Stone's direction is certainly apparent throughout this film. From a technical standpoint, Stone, along with Scorsese among others, is very much known for the way he edits his films. He is also known for the ways in which he utilizes multiple types of cameras and filming techniques. Here the film feels quite slick in the way Stone uses his rapid fire cityscape shots as a way to draw out stock market graphs on top of skyscrapers, as well as how he portrays the Wall Street of today with all the fancier technology that is in use. Well-crafted with intelligent direction by Oliver Stone, and extraordinary cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. A eminently watchable and captivating film, that guarantee's cinematic satisfaction. Highly Recommended. loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From 1993 to 2001, Gordon Gekko (Oscar-Winner:Michael Douglas) went to Prison for securities fraud. Gekko has to start back all the way from the beginning by writing an successful book about his past and getting back his daughter's respect Winnie (Carey Mulligan). Although she wants nothing to do with him, since Winnie blames her father for her brother's overdose.Seven years has passed... Jacob "Jake" Moore (Shia LaBoeuf) works in Wall Street and he is dating Gekko's daughter. Jacob is trying to convinced the company, he works for... to invest on a viable source for alternative energy. Jacob is loyal to his mentor, Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella). Which Lewis is been disillusioned with the industry and he feels the stock market will be going down. When the stock market crashes, Lewis tries to save his company but he is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), an ruthless powerful CEO of Churchill Schwartz.When Lewis unexpectedly committed suicide in front of hundreds of people. Jacob wants revenge... which Bretton pushed Lewis over the edge. When Jacob goes to an lecture of Gordon Gekko. Jacob finally talks to Gekko about his investment plans and also planning to marry his daughter. Jacob decides to trade information with Gekko. But Jacob is seduced by Gekko's charms, Jacob doesn't know that Gekko has plans for him. But for Gekko, it is his only chance to get back to the powerful, ruthless, double-crossing business man, he once was...Directed by Oliver Stone (The Hand, Salvador, U-Turn) made an entertaining if light-hearted sequel to the dark, absorbing, original "Wall Street". Douglas is a joy to watch, reprising his critically acclaimed Oscar-winning role. LaBoeuf is surprisingly good as a young Wall Street investor, who shares some of Gekko's greed. Brolin and especially Mulligan are also good in their strong supporting roles. The movie has some surprises but the film goes on too long at times and the ending is extremely predictable... But it doesn't ruined your enjoyment of the picture. An few familiar faces from the original appears in Cameos, especially an amusing juicy cameo by Charlie Sheen, who gives one of the movie's funnier moments. Some may be disappointment by being not as dark or vicious as the original. Since it is twenty-three years... "Wall Street:Money Never Sleeps" shows that times has changed for better or worse. Screenplay by Allan Loeb (The Switch, 21, Things We Lost in the Fire) and Stephen Schiff (The Deep End of the Ocean, Lolita "1997", True Crime). From a story by Bryan Burrough. Super 35.

		<shortDescription>Prison has softened Gordon Gekko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨So, does Blue Horseshoe still love Anacott Steel? ¨This quote was from Charlie Sheen's cameo in Oliver Stone's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, which only served as a reminder of how good the original film was and how distant the sequel is from it. The film began with a lot of promise and I thought there was little anyone could do to mess it up considering Michael Douglas was back with one of his best roles as Gordon Gekko. The problem is that with time and life in prison Gekko has changed and he isn't that powerful person he once was. The major problem I had with this movie was the ending which I thought was way too soft and it seemed as if Stone sold out to the typical Hollywood ending, which was nothing like the finale in the first part. However this isn't a bad movie, it just isn't as good as Wall Street because Gekko isn't as bad a villain as he was in 1987. If you've seen this and haven't seen the first film then make sure you do because I guarantee you will enjoy Douglas's Oscar winning role as Gordon in that movie more than in this one. Oliver Stone is known for always bringing the best out of his cast and this movie is no exception. I really enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Frank Langella, Josh Broslin, and Eli Wallach who were really great in every scene they were in. Shia LaBeouf is no Charlie Sheen, but he wasn't bad in this film either, and one can say Carey Mulligan is a much better actress than what Daryl Hannah was in Wall Street. I know they are different characters, but they are similar players in similar roles. The screenplay was written by Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff, but it wasn't as powerful as Weiser's original screenplay.The movie begins in 2001 with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) being released from a long jail sentence. No one is there to pick him up and it is obvious that things have changed for him over the years. The movie then jumps forward to 2008 and introduces us to Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a young man who works at a banking institution named Keller Zabel Investments and who is trying to raise money for a fusion research project. His boss is Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella) and he is like a father figure for him because he has taught him everything he knows about being a broker. Zabel gives Jacob a bonus for his work, but at the same time he seems depressed because the company has been losing money due to the financial crisis that has hit everyone. Jacob decides to buy a nice ring with the money given to him and propose to his beautiful girlfriend Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who actually happens to be Gordon's daughter who has broken all ties with her father after his arrest that led to her brother's death from drug overdose. Gekko wrote a book during his time in jail and now he finds himself promoting it throughout different colleges. Jacob goes to one of these lectures and tells Gordon that he is planning on marrying his daughter. They begin to hang out secretly and Gekko explains to Jacob what may have caused Zabel to have recently committed suicide. He says that Bretton James (Josh Broslin), a successful broker, began rumors to hurt Zabel's company and benefit from its demise. Jacob swears he will get his revenge, but the question is whether his relationship with Gordon will affect his relationship with Winnie, and whether or not he can actually trust him.Gordon Gekko was a true villain in the 80's although many people actually bought into his philosophy once the movie was released. Now a couple of decades later he is more of in a gray area. The true villain is Bretton James, and I thought that was one of the things that hurt the film, because Gekko made a terrific villain and there was no need to soften him in this film. One of the best scenes in this movie is the lecture that he gives at Jacob's alma matter about the foreseeable financial crises. It was reminiscent of the speech he gave in the first film about money and greed. That was the highlight of the film, while on the downside you have the washed down Hollywood ending. The film had the potential to be a lot better than it actually was if it focused more on the economic aspect and less on the melodrama and relationships between Gordon and his daughter and Jacob with Winnie. This isn't a bad movie, but I still recommend the first one over this any day. One thing is certain, Michael Douglas won't win another Oscar for this version of Gekko.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible direction, terrible edition, terrible plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with fairly good hopes to see the great "Wall Street" sequel. The first one, which was set on the 80's starring Charlie Sheen, nailed it. This one... Missed it!To begin with, the direction is just terrible, I have no idea what was Oliver Stone thinking when he did something like this. The movie looks like it was made 25 years ago. If the idea was the give a similar visual aspect as the first one, well, he achieved that. But we're on 2010, and I was hoping for some visual candy, some good cinematography, good edition and OST. But instead, we have terrible circle transitions, awful scene merges and a terrible OST.The acting is OK. Although I don't think Shia LaBeouf was definitely suited for this part, he didn't do too bad, but still... Carey Mulligan did a good job, but has the most annoying character ever in the history of cinema. I couldn't stand her anymore, she stays 90% of the movie crying and wining.The Plot, to simply put it, is bad. A Wall Street movie set in 2008 promises way more than it delivers. This movie focuses on the relationship between Shia and Carey's characters instead of the devastating crisis we're going through. This could of been one of the greatest movies of this year. Instead, it's one of the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If money never sleeps, and it doesn't, then I was seriously in danger to falling asleep in this flick. Let me tell you I'm among the #1 fans of the first Wall Street movie 23 years ago, ... and I made millions just from the "lessons" learned in the first one. But this sequel, although it has a few scenes that are funny and interesting and there are a few lines here and there that give you a chuckle, the film is a flop. I don't know what Oliver Stone thought about making this film the way it's made, ... it had so much potential and then it's such a disappointment and even unrealistic. For instance who in the world in our day and age has brokers on the phone screaming to get money from retail investors? ... in the age of E-mail, texting and online chat, internet, etc.?Acting: Well, LaBeouf is okay, but just doesn't come across like a Wall Street trader, analyst or whatever, but at least he's likable ... and here he goes promising a company a hundred million bucks, and he's even promoted to be (only for a short time) under today's hot Wall Street shark (Josh Brolin). Brolin is actually doing a fine job, ... reminds me a lot of Pierce Brosnan all the way around, ... just waiting for the Aston Martin Bond mobile. Of course the one everybody wants to see is Michael Douglas and he's back, ... often with the same lingo and lines like 23 years ago. There's a surprise ending concerning Gekko, and it's cool. And Michael Douglas enjoyed himself in the role once again and he gives the movie the necessary fabric, ... at least to some extent. Gekko's daughter (Mulligan) character is a wacko crybaby (that's why she's probably called Winnie) and the character never takes off and the drama is there like in a soap opera ... at times it seems like it's a Broadway play adapted for the sliver screen.Anyway, the style is missing, like there are no yachts, no cool cars and not really any cool digs, etc. like in the first Wall Street movie. There's so much potential to flesh out this movie and to give it substance. And the rehashing of the financial "crisis" is also so fake and wannabe that it's laughable at times. And then the philosophy behind it in the lines ... gosh, give me a break. The world will always exist of booms and busts and people just have to learn to live with it.The soundtrack is also not very good, ... it's not as coordinated like in the first Wall Street movie. Let's put it this way, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps doesn't have an edge and Oliver Stone is trying so hard to constantly remind us that there was an original a quarter century ago. And Stone does it with bringing back in cameo appearances Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox and the cranky elderly Realtor in NYC, and some of the other characters from back then with a shot here and there, ... just for a few seconds. It seems like this new film has been slapped together of footage here and there just to release a sequel, ... there's not much craftsmanship in this one.As you can see, I'm disappointed as the expectations were so high. Will it stop me on my way to becoming a billionaire? No, but it sure won't inspire me much to get it done. But then, perhaps I should have sent Oliver Stone a check for helping me make my first million in the stock market due to the release of the first Wall Street flick.After all, and bottom line, Gordon Gekko is supposed to be the bad guy, but in reality he never did anything wrong and he's the most likable character of both Wall Street flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The glitz and glamor of finance is gone. In its place we have corruption and joblessness. 23 years after the first "Wall Street" made waves and crowned Michael Douglas as a genuine actor, we get its sequel, "Money Never Sleeps", and it is a damn fine film.Now to start off, I have little knowledge of finance and economics, yet I can't help but find myself enthralled by this film. This film is very relevant to today's times, as it examines the financial crisis and the behind-the-scenes as the fictional story fashions itself around this real-life event. Granted, even though one won't get most, if not all of the financial talk that is being spoken on screen, one will still be gripped and will keep on watching until the end to see what actually has happened. It's a small lesson, this film. This film delivers a few pieces about the financial crisis, and those with a career/have an interest in finance should check this movie out to learn a few tricks or two.Now, coming to the story, this is more of a character-driven story than the financial-driven first film. In this part every actor deliver superb performances. Michael Douglas returns as an aged and seemingly wised-up Gekko, and he still gives a fine performance that still soars above the other actors. Here is the same man who now looks as if he's guilty and remorseful about the actions he did; the same man who slithers his way to the top in the first film. He shows that he is a flawed man, just like anyone else can be. Shia LaBeouf also proves that he can act with his character Jacob, and not just another new face in Hollywood. In this one he lets his emotions and face do the talking, and it pays off. The father-son bond between Gordon and Jacob is made strong with the great chemistry between Douglas and LaBeouf. Take note that Jacob is NOT like Bud Fox. Other actors are staggeringly fine in their roles, including Josh Brolin as an intelligent, slimy villain and Frank Langella as Jacob's fatherly mentor. Carey Mulligan also gives a great and sympathetic counter-balance performance as Gekko's daughter and Jacob's fiancée Winnie, as she represents the normal person lost in the corrupt dog-eat-dog world of corporate business. Eli Wallach and Susan Sarandon also steal the limelight in their brief roles, and an OK cameo by Charlie Sheen will make fans feel nostalgic.Technical-wise, the film is absolutely outstanding. Director Oliver Stone is at the top of his game, finally making a film that is worth watching again. His direction is taut. The screenplay is packed with terrific dialogue and financial lingo that is spoken by the characters with life. The editing and cinematography are top notch as the split- screen technique and fantastic sweeping shots of New York City are juxtaposed with each other to give the film an extremely slick and stylish look that is not unlike the first film, only this time it is made more frequent and more fancy thanks to the power of CGI-enhanced visual effects. The soundtrack is also very good in my opinion and it suits the tones of the movie perfectly. The production design is top- notch as it gives the film an updated set/location and makes it look modern and up-to-date while making it classy and elegant at the same time, like the film should be.In short, Oliver Stone and Michael Douglas has returned, and has given us one of the best and most important movies of the year. Fans of the original "Wall Street" and those who are interested in a financial career should give this one a shot. Go in with an open mind, but be prepared to have a conversation about economics and finance once the end credits roll.Overall value: 86/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm annoyed with Oliver Stone. He has such an energetic eye, such an instinct for rhythm that he almost can't fail to make a movie you think you are engaged in. Some of the handling here of the energy is his best, really his best. And that's even discounting the two vapid images he keeps coming back to.One is the recurrence of bubbles. This is remarkably blunt as those rats that Scorsese put at the end of his "Departed." The other is the really annoying and repeated way he combines buildings and quantitative displays. These two notions just smack you in the face with the man's stupidity in the world. He is famously dull and obnoxious and you can see it in the way he handles this simple sort of metaphoric visualization. I surely have no desire to meet him. And if I did I might think as badly of him as Jake thinks of Bretton, for how selfishly and blindly he treats the notion of space, as if buildings were there for his billboard cosmos.And the story itself is so patently formulaic you want to scream. Will the young couple have their happy life and baby? Will the rouge father come to his senses? Will the bad guy get his just deserves? Will, will we even know that the genius scientist is funded so that we can get free, unlimited power from seawater?But shucks, even all these sins we forgive, because the man can make lovely eye music. If Woody Allen is Chopin, the Stone is Wagner.I hate to give this a three, but the things that are good ? and I mean Talking Heads level good ? are good enough.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

I am not going into details about the movie itself, due to you can probably guess it without actually seeing the movie. What I will say is that the high points of the movie, is that it is very suspenseful, powerful, and has a touch of passion. This movie could have been really great if it was allowed to grow in the development of the story. I thought it would but it is actually very short for an oliver stone film, probably one of his shortest in run-time. I also will say that this is one of the better films of the year, possibly the best film of the year so far, in what has definitely been a ho-hum season for movies. I would recommend for people to go see the movie, however it isn't something that you will hate yourself for not seeing, but you will miss some of the greater performances this year.</fullReview>

Jake is stricken with grief, when his boss and mentor Louis(Frank Langella) commits suicide. And blames evil business tycoon Brettan(Josh Brolin) for it. Jake attempts revenge, and asks Gordon(Michael Douglas) for help, Gordon agrees on one condition, if he can help him reconcile with his daughter. But will this be a rise or fall for them both? Perfectly directed by Oliver Stone, and well acted by Michael Douglas, and Shia LaBeouf who really holds his own with Douglas. Carey Mulligan is also good, so was Josh Brolin who looks like he just walked off W. Lets not forget Frank Langella.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The much anticipated sequel to the 1987 original has Oliver Stone back in the director's seat and one of the most iconic characters in movie history, Gordon Gekko, being released from prison. Michael Douglas is back as GG and the film opens with his release from prison ... with no one there to pick him up. He is truly on his own.Skip ahead a few years and we see Shia LeBeouf as Jake, a Wall Street hotshot working for Frank Langella, a Wall Street legend. It is very obvious that this legend, and Jake's mentor, is in deep trouble and the entire market is pretty wobbly. Sound familiar? Yep, it's 2008. Ahh yes, the juicy part ... Jake is getting engaged to the lovely Winnie (Carey Mulligan) who just happens to be Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter. Now we're rolling! Turns out, the dirty tricks and back room deals didn't stop while Gekko was incarcerated. Josh Brolin plays a high roller for a thinly disguised firm that most will recognize as Goldman Sachs. Brolin thinks he was wronged a few years back by Langella and can't wait to get even when the opportunity presents itself in a meeting with the Treasury Secretary. Sound deliciously nasty? Well not so fast.The movie steers away from much of the back-stabbing and dirty deal making that was so prevalent in the original. It even avoids much commentary on the scuzzy financial services industry leaders who managed to profit while all of our retirement plans and home values were plummeting. Instead, we get much melodramatic, sappy conversation about feelings and family and time. Apparently Gekko found a semblance of a soul while in prison. He's certainly not perfect, but this is not the wheeler-dealer that was so much fun to hiss in part one.Oliver Stone tosses in some touches that help: Charlie Sheen reprises his Bud Fox role for a brief encounter with Gekko, there are some terrific shots of NYC and we get Sylvia Miles back as the Realtor - this time helping Jake dump his loft in a soft market. We even get 95 year old Eli Wallach whistling his way through a power role, complete with Jake's ringer playing the theme song to "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly". All fun aspects, but they don't offset the inordinate number of times we get people choking up and crying. Had to check the credits to see if Nora Ephron was co-director.Bottom line, if you enjoyed the original, you probably owe it to yourself to see how Gekko has come full circle. The ride is fine, just not at the same level as we were treated 23 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone has lost his touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when I heard the sequel was coming out I was very excited, then I saw the trailer and couldn't wait to see the film. Once I saw the film I was very disappointed. Oliver Stone does some ridiculous editing in this movie, especially during the phone call scenes, and it's not good writing. If you liked the first one, don't see this one, you'll be disappointed. But the more I thought about it, what was the last good Oliver Stone film. The last good picture he made was back in 1995 with his Richard Nixon biopic but since it has been all done hill for him. If you like Gordon Gekko don't see this film. As I said before Oliver Stone has lost his touch and I can definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though not flawless, "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps" is a great film that has almost everything needed for a drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I enjoyed about the first "Wall Street" is that it not only explored the atmosphere of the stock market in the 1980s, but it also illuminated the darkness of its corruption through the eyes of a young idealist. "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps" takes a similar approach as its predecessor, but now it takes place at the turn of the 21st century. The market is on a downward spiral. After serving 8 years in prison for insider trading as well as multiple other crimes, Gordon Gekko, is released and is on his own. He has been out of the game for years and the movie makes you wonder, will Gekko get back into the game of greed and master manipulation. Or has he really changed? Having not been in the role for over 20 years, Michael Douglas, one of the greatest actors alive, easily molds into Gordon Gekko perfectly. The man's a genius?the way he speaks, walks, and even the use of facial expressions are all utterly brilliant. However, instead of being the devilish antagonist that he was in the first film, he's more of an anti-hero?drawn by another idealist (played by Shia LaBeouf) who's going to marry his daughter (played Carey Mulligan) and getting even with an old acquaintance (played by Josh Brolin). Needless to say, there's a lot more going on in this" Wall Street" than in the previous one. I enjoy that the plot focuses more on Gordon's life (and the other characters) and not just the "game". With the addition of Michael Douglas, the cast is almost perfect. Shia LaBeouf is a decent actor, and once again, he proves that he can take on any role. His character goes through a lot of ambivalent situations?juggling his job on Wall Street, having a pregnant fiancée all the while trying to befriend Gordon and get him back with his daughter. He delivers this all well, particularly when his character hits his breaking point. Other noteworthy performances are Frank Langella, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon, and Eli Wallach, whose 95 years old and he still has it in him. Amazing! The technical aspects of the film are also worth noting. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning. Not only is each shot within the film crafted beautifully in color, lighting, and composition, but he also pulls off some great in camera effects. For you videographers out there, you'll know what I am talking about. The choice of songs and Craig Armstrong's score not only suits the film, but it adds a new sense of emotion to the film. I even like the use of graphics and the old film editing techniques that were thrown in, such as screen swipes, split screen effects, and the iris effect. But the one big flaw is Carey Mulligan. I have never seen her in a movie before. Hearing that she's an Oscar nominee at just over 25, I had high expectations in her performance. She's not bad looking, but she didn't seem to show a lot of emotion in her character. I mean, she's supposed to hate her father, but all she does is stare at him with a blank expression. She doesn't build in tension, which I think would be common, given the plot's circumstances. The other problem I had with this film is the constant use of smoking. I had heard that the MPAA was going to add smoking as a reason for rating a movie PG or PG-13. In the movie's rating, smoking isn't listed?Avatar was rated PG-13 for smoking and there were only two scenes of Sigourney Weaver lighting up. This movie has almost has every other scene with someone smoking cigar or a cigarette?okay, maybe not that bad, but you can understand my point. This movie also ran into an issue that most Oliver Stone films run into?a slow pace. Though I enjoy this movie, the last act of the film seemed to go on longer than it needed to. I have not seen too many great films this year. Though not flawless, "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps" is a great film that has almost everything needed for a drama?near impeccable acting, an interesting plot, beautiful direction and filmmaking talents, and even some light humor. It's very possible that this movie might win some awards. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.My rating: 3.5/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gekko Wrecko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas returns as "Gordon Gekko", the villainous love-to-hate stock market pirate from Oliver Stone's first outing, a lightweight classic starring Charlie Sheen as a climber who learns from Gekko how to cut corners and make a ton of money.In that film, Gekko convinces us that greed is good. Now, eight years after being released from prison for insider-trading, he's not so sure... of anything. He has a book to sell, but heaven knows what it's about since Gekko doesn't preach good or evil. He's an ambiguously vacant bore, just like Shai LaBeouf, looking like a college freshman playing broker, engaged to Gekko's estranged, mopey daughter.An extremely bland Douglas provides a side-character role, advising Shia on overthrowing evil Josh Brolin, whose one-dimensional baddie is a weak replacement for the young Gekko... but there's no seduction into power: just a dully conceived, revenge-driven motive without any purpose. And the stock market crash of 2008, shown during the third act, adds nothing to the overall nothingness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gekko Gospel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In cinema history the characters of Fast Eddie Felson and Gordon Gekko have had a similar path. Both Paul Newman and Michael Douglas got to reprise their characters in a real time period on the screen, roughly the same quarter century for both. Gekko had the additional good fortune of having his character helmed on the screen the second time by the man that created him, Oliver Stone.Gordon Gekko certainly had a more public existence than the small time pool hustler who reached for the big time only to get flattened by powers that be. Michael Douglas won his Oscar for Gekko in the original Wall Street and he's improved and refined his character here.The Wall Street Pirate of the Reagan Era has gone to prison for his crimes and is now a best selling author, but also someone not quite sure of his next move. Douglas is a sadder and wiser man it seems, he's lost a wife and son and his daughter is estranged from him. Daughter Carey Mulligan is serious with a young stockbroker, Shia LaBoeuf oddly enough though.LaBoeuf has a mission kind of thrust upon him. In an obvious reference to Lehman Brothers, the long standing brokerage firm headed by family patriarch Frank Langella has collapsed. Langella was his mentor and LaBoeuf is thinking that this was a set up and he wants payback. Who better to help than Michael Douglas who knows the Street like no other. But as it turns out Douglas has his own history with the man who engineered the downfall Josh Brolin and Douglas has his own agenda.Douglas is right back at the top of his game in his career role and LaBoeuf and Mulligan make an attractive pair of young lovers. However I would not be surprised if Susan Sarondon does get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress as Shia's mother. She was once a hospital nurse, but she gets into the real estate game with the inflated housing market and gets in way over her head. She too has taken up the Gekko Gospel of Greed Is Good and takes a tumble for her efforts.Oliver Stone has done what some consider impossible and made a successful sequel to a classic film with Money Never Sleeps. And in real time as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just terrible. Not even worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stone gave us a lot to smile about in the new movie. But we did not smile because of the movie we are looking at, it's the memories of Wall Street from 1987 we smile about.Wean Gordon Gekko checks out of prison in 2001. We sit and jumps of expectation in theater seats while the legend is back silk handkerchief, ring, watch, money clip in gold without money and cell phone from 1987 which is the size of a small expanded clay block. One time this phone was the epitome of high-tech luxury. Outside the prison, the heart sinks in the chest of Gordon where he is standing alone outside the prison gate, referred to the bottom step of the ladder. The action jumps fast forward to 2008. Gordon has now published the book "Is greed good?". Here Gekko talks about speculation as the root of all evil. The new Gekko stands resigned and gives a very politically correct message that fits the general opinion. Only Michael Douglas' excellent performances remind us of the film from 1987.In the chaos on the trading floor, we find the young and idealistic broker Jacob Moore. He takes on the task of reuniting father and daughter. Here begins the part of the movie that simply should have been deleted from the script. Just a lot of love, some tears, family drama, etc. that lasts for about 1hr and 30min.Towards the end of the movie, when Gordon has just been so bad that we are about to rejoice again, Gordon talks in the new mobile phone and says some lines to the fans from 1987. But the lines fall on stony ground, and Oliver Stone's salute to us is nothing but a scene that just does not work.Stone has succeeded in rendering a good Wall Street environment. Some of the characters in the film is amazing. But that's it. 85% of the movie was just some family drama, cry movie horrible combination of I do not know what.Stone is going to have to go home and write another script. Gordon has never been and never will be a nice family man.Wall Street - Money Never sleeps was just the largest and most horrible let down in the history of movie if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst sequels ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wall Street, the original, was a cautionary tale of a smart guy, raised by a moral father who fell in with those who want nothing more than to make money and destroy things. Wall Street II is no wear as good as the original. You know I enjoy movies that teach something about modern times but the story writer and the direct have to let the story tell the tale, that is they can't fall victim to preaching. The characters have to play the roles and thus you learn from watching them. Stone does none of that in this sad, boring sequel. Gekko is Gekko, until the end of course. The other bad guys are rich jerks with absolutely no moral compass with again makes for a boring time. And Shia's character starts could have been interesting if he hadn't been so dumb. Winnie Gekko is the only character that lives and breathes and unfortunately she is one note during the entire film. Too bad, so sad, I'm mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film that deals primarily with excesses of money and greed, it is interesting that the budget for this movie was in the region of an obscene $70,000,000.00. I'm not sure how much of the budget was devoted to script and substance but the end result was a banal and poorly developed screenplay with puerile, soppy sub plots of romance and the strained relationship between father and daughter.Ultimately the story is grossly simplistic, cashing in on the global financial crisis, without any attempt to provide real detail as to how the end results are achieved. You are supposed to just accept that everything that occurs in the film is plausible without any meaningful attempt at a reasonable explanation. Leaving aside the flaws in the plot there was an opportunity to develop some suspense but Olvier Stone missed his chance and concentrated on expensive sets and effects that did absolutely nothing to provide anything substantial. The cast all do their best but they are hamstrung by an unimaginative script and poor direction.At the screening I attended, the person in front of me was playing games on his mobile phone and many people left before the end credits were shown. That, I'm afraid, says it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is good; money is a bitch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Oliver Stone reprises his 1987 original; but the impact is just not there. Greed is good and money is a bitch that doesn't care with whom she sleeps. The much beloved "greenback" will always be the root of all evil. After eight years in prison for inside trading, financial icon Gordon Gekko(Michael Douglas)is back with a book sharing his secrets. But it won't take long till Gekko proves that prison did not really make him a changed man. An upcoming trader Jake Moore(Shia LaBeouf)happens to be engaged to Gekko's daughter Winnie(Cary Mulligan), who despises her father and his money. This does not change Jake from wanting to help mend their relationship; not knowing that Winnie has her own fortune in a Swiss bank. Moore trying to avenge the death of his mentor (Frank Langella), cozies up to the newest Wall Street megalomaniac, Bretton James(Josh Brolin). Capitalism thrives. Also in the cast: Austin Pendleton, Venessa Ferlito and Eli Wallach. Stone is seen in a minor role and Charlie Sheen has a walk-on as Bud Fox, from the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, or does it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love these type of movies for two reasons. One, it is the type of work my mother is involved in, except for the greed and crimes involved. I also love these films because it exposes how much Wall Street tries to screw over a bunch of innocent people and/or their own co- workers.On to the movie review. If you saw Wall Street one you know that Gordon Gekko is the main focus and an evil son of a bitch, Josh Brolin this year is 2 times as evil as Gekko. Brolin successfully captured his role perfectly, but Brolin wasn't the only stand-out in the film. Shia LaBouf, actor from the (Eagle Eye, Holes, and Transformers) tops the ball in his role as Jake Morre. I believe that Shia has a chance at his first Oscar nomination for his role. I also think Shia has revived his career, because Transformers 2 really hurt his chances at being taken seriously by movie critics including myself.Just like the first film I hating the ending of the movie. Besides the ending, I believe Michael Douglas wasn't on top, he has seamed to lost his touch as Gordon Gekko, I don't think it's his fault I think it is because of the fact that he has not played Gekko for 23 years, that he forgot how to show the characteristics of Gekko.The film was at it's best, I believe "The Town" has a better shot at winning best picture this year than Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. I give it a 8 star out of 10 star review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All About the Money!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ask me, what do they think end up by resurrecting 23-year-old movie for a sequel? Well, let me tell you, it's all about money! Just like every successful film that has sequel to follow later, a well-experienced "Platoon" (1986) Director, Oliver Stone eventually settles his first sequel. Michael Douglas repeats one of his lifetime famous performances as Gordon Gekko, like what he did in 1987. It tells the notorious corporate raider Gekko finally gets out of jail where he redeemed his sin on illegal insider trading. The film also focuses on Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) the young ambitious trader who is the fiancé of Gekko's daughter Winnie (Carrey Mulligan). There are several Cameo appearances, include main character from the first one, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Douglas himself seems to be lack of space to repeat his charisma as seen on its predecessor, the script could not provide enough space to describe his "Zero to Hero" situation smoothly, Douglas is just fine. Carey Mulligan once again shows her capability as one of the most promising Actresses in thiz generation. Two corporate tycoons which are played by Josh Brolin and Frank Langella stirs the conflict among Jake character, recently they had something in common, both of them portrayed President's character in 2008, Langella convincingly played as Richard Nixon in "Frost/Nixon" and Brolin acted the other side of George W. Bush in short titled movie "W." (also directed by Stone). Oliver Stone is a Director who always improvises with different methods. In thiz movie, he uses a lot of attractive graphics and split screen techniques ,just like we have ever seen in his previous works "Natural Born Killer" (1994) and "U Turn" (1997) which I love so much. But something disturbs me, the promising storyline during almost the entire film crashes down in the end. The plots rush into solution too fast. I know any single deathly rumor can kill any market stock instantly in thiz wide open market. But hey, at least you give something detail to make it seems real. It's an awful ending. Even while the ending tries to consolidate everything with centerpiece of human relationship. At the end, if someone tells you, "It's not about money, it's about anything else", no matter how you debate on thiz topic, trust me it's not true! Even Gekko once said, "money is a b!tch that never sleeps".Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Enough Not to Walk Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really wanted to see this picture, but must admit that I was disappointed. It did its job in the sense that it really connected me with what is wrong in this country. However as it pertained to the original picture, Shia LaBoeuf gave a very good performance, but was a boy amongst men. His presence just wasn't convincing enough that anyone would give him the time of day. The heir apparent to Bud Fox he is not. No one tops Michael Douglas. Gordon Gecko is quite possibly one of the greatest characters ever developed; which made me wishing this picture had more of him. His character spends too much time lying in wait and was to a great extent a sub-plot. There was a misplaced Cameo mid-way through the picture that did nothing more than distract. It reminded me how great the first Wall Street was and that this was no where near as good as the first. The music by David Byrne was a fantastic nostalgic touch and I totally intend to purchase a few of the tracks.All-in-all, I would recommend this picture, but I wish that Oliver wrote this one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Douglas is the highlight of this sequel to Oliver Stone's 1987 classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I did enjoy Oliver Stone's 1987 film Wall Street, which tells the story of Gordon Gekko and how he manipulated people and events in order to make money. This cost him his liberty in the end, but as they say, that's another story. This film picks up some time after that one left off with Gordon's release from prison. It's an interesting tale with quite a complicated plot, so no nipping out to make tea part way through now? Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Having witnessed Gordon's release from prison we are introduced to his daughter, Winnie and her boyfriend, Jake Moore. Jake works for a Wall Street investment bank, KZI, where he deals with investments into green energy. In particular he has one project that is looking into fusion to produce cheap energy and he's trying find investors when things start to go wrong at KZI. Due to rumours the company crashes on the stock market and the head of the company, and Jacob's friend, Louis Zabel commits suicide. After this Jacob reaches out to Gekko and, because he wants to re-connect with his daughter, Gekko agrees to help Jacob find who was behind the rumours. The finger points at another investment bank, Churchill Schwartz, and the head of that company, Bretton James. There is much more to this, it's so much more than a straight forward tale of revenge. There are many more twists and turns in the road to come and questions to be answered, like; "Has Gekko really reformed?"? All this and more is revealed, but, of course, I can't tell you that here or the Spoiler Police will have me for insider trading? (or some other trumped up charge).I must first say that this film is beautifully shot, Stone certainly has an eye for the visuals and he uses it to great effect here. The use of graphics and split screen is all done very well and, for the most part, fits the story perfectly. And so we move on to performances; well I can't fault Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko, it's a part he made his own in the first film. Shia LaBeouf as Jacob Moore on the other hand, well I'm still waiting to be convinced by the young man, I don't want to be disrespectful so I'll leave it at that. I thought Carey Mulligan did a good job as Winnie Gekko but I felt her character had more depth than she was allowed to show. Frank Langella did a great job as Louis Zabel, as did Josh Brolin as Bretton James. It was nice to see small parts from; Eli Wallach as Julie Steinhardt, Susan Sarandon as Sylvia Moore, Jacob's mother, and a very brief came from Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox (uncredited).Although I did enjoy this film to some extent, Oliver Stone does make very long films and this sometimes means they take the story a little too far. I was quite enjoying this one for about an hour and forty minutes and then it started to drag. I don't quite know if it was down to events happening on the screen or what, but I kind of lost interest. On the plus side, there are some good songs by David Byrne and Brian Eno which pop up every now and again. I found this quite a tough one to judge because we're supposed to engage with people who control finances and those people, in my book, have been grossly discredited of late. It's hard to feel sympathy for someone living in a very nice New York apartment bleating on about being poor! OK, rant over? I guess this one is worth seeing if you're a fan of the original; Michael Douglas is very good value.My Score: 6.4/10.IMDb Score: 6.3/10 (based on 31,178 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 54/100 (based on 211 reviews counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off slow but picks up more and more from beginning to end. This isn't your high speed action packed thrill seeking movie. It is a movie with a story line, what movies these days lacks. There is well written characters and great realism to the story. They use real time lines of real events in stock markets and financials to make the movie work, flow and to add realism to it. There is twist and turns and I found this movie to be very unpredictable. Won't say completely unpredictable because some of it is, but for the most part you don't know what is going to happen next. Again not like most movies these days. Give this movie a chance you may like it you may hate it, but I think on the most part you will be amazingly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and Well-Written Sequel Which Tells a Very Different Story Than the Original; Put Your Money on Michael Douglas, Frank Langella and Josh Brolin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying it would be difficult to top the 1987 offering. The original film began with an up-and-coming Wall Street trader Bud Fox who's trying to break into the big time of financial trading, in other words trying to become a "player". He calls Donald Trump-like trader and deal-maker Gordon Gekko everyday for a long period of time who's day's pay is around $800,000 in 1987, more money than some people make in ten years. In "Wall Street Money Never Sleeps", the story begins from an entirely different angle. Gordon Gekko, once the biggest name in finance and deal-making, is getting out of jail. The limos are gone, his large office is gone, his private residence and private secretaries are gone, and his wife is gone. When he is led out of the prison gates, there is no one to greet him. Not even his children, who were young tykes in the previous film, don't seem to be around. We wonder what exactly happened to him. This is 2001, and we fast-forward seven years to the beginning of the events of this story in 2008.The film cuts to a young finance guy, Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) who, not unlike Bud Fox, works as a trader for a finance brokerage firm, Keller-Zabel. Although, unlike Fox, he is not trading stocks and bonds but rather brokering financial deals, a la Bear-Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The story begins with rumors of Keller-Zabel's financial collapse because of investments in the so-called toxic prime mortgages and insurance default swaps which turn out to have been horrible investments. Louis Zabel, played by the incomparable Frank Langella, seems an honorable man but who made the bad investments which has, as a result, jeopardized the future of this firm. But at the same time, someone on Wall Street appears to have leaked rumors of Keller-Zabel's bad debts. The once powerful financial firm is on its way to the pearly gates of finance where it will meet the likes of Lehman Brothers and Bear-Sterns.After the financial firm has been flushed into the financial sewers, Jake Moore lands a job with the current Donald Trump/Gordon Gekko finance wizard, Bretton James, played with incredible believability by Josh Brolin who is fast-becoming one of the best actors in the entertainment biz. (He had previously turned in a stellar performance in "W" as one of our former presidents, although I keep forgetting his name.) Their firm is an investment broker, much like Gekko's firm of the first movie. We also learn that James once worked for Gekko in the late 1980's and early 1990's.But the relationship between James and Moore is not like that of Gekko and Fox. It is more of as an employer and an up-and-coming business associate rather than a mentor-pupil relationship. Moore recommends new investments, and he is pushing for a green energy company thats developing fusion, a much cleaner way to manufacture energy. James balks at the opportunity and decides to go with a much more traditional fossil-fuel company. One thing that was slightly unbelievable was the idea that a 24-year-old could so quickly be in the inner circle of a seasoned financial executive in his late 40's to early 50's.Moore also just happens to be dating Gordon Gekko's daughter, Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan) who is disenfranchised from her father. He is peddling his new book "Is Greed Good?" Unbeknowst to Winnie, Moore begins having secret meetings with Gekko who claims he wants to repair his broken relationship with his daughter. Gekko also mentions that Winnie has 100 million dollars in a Swiss bank account which would be perfect for investing in the fusion-energy company. However, Winnie seems reluctant to re-establish a relationship with her father too quickly.The shortcomings are the young leads who are interesting, although they are incredibly young to be doing what they're doing. LaBeouf seems like a recent college graduate whose confidence and knowledge seems more akin to that of a 35-year-old rather than someone only 24. At one point he confronts Brolin in a scene that was hard to swallow particularly because of the difference in age and experience. Is a 24-year-old really going to tell off a 48-year-old finance magnate he hardly knows and who could possibly ruin his financial career? Mulligan who appears about the same age is already running a very popular political website. Actually, I could buy into her job more than his, if only because website creation is the prerogative of the young, not financial firms. Charlie Sheen in the first movie was extremely convincing, and he seemed right where he should be for his age at the film's beginning. Sheen's eventual entry into Gekko's inner circle is a gradual process whereas LaBeouf seems too immature to be in the position he's offered, and too green to be able to confront Brolin as an equal. Despite these reservations, a compelling story that works because it is not a re-telling of the previous movie. I think if the two young leads had been in their mid 30's rather than early 20's, I could have believed them more. Although the original "Wall Street" can probably never be topped, at least this movie works on its own terms, with several very compelling twists. Charlie Sheen has a wasted cameo as Bud Fox which seems at odds with how he ended up in the first movie. (I was hoping Bud Fox would be an important character but we see him only briefly.) Still, great performances by the two supporting cast members, Frank Langella and Josh Brolin, and of course high marks for Michael Douglas reprising his role as Gordon Gekko. Douglas very easily slips into Gekko's skin, always using "pal" when speaking to someone, akin to Jay Gatsby's "old sport". At first you think he's changed, but remember the letters in the word "greed" and "good" are contained in "Gordon Gekko".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone makes Michael Douglas' reprise in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps the most interesting presence here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a little more than 20 years ago, I had watched the original Wall Street in a college economics class but had missed the ending which the teacher provided before the class ended. The movie was enjoyable enough especially when Michael Douglas did the famous "Greed...is good" line. So when seeing this sequel, it's Douglas as his Oscar-winning Gordon Gekko role that gets one excited whenever he appears on screen and, for the most part, he does not disappoint. That excitement gets a boost when another player from that movie makes a cameo here. And many of the supporting players also provide some moments. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I was a little bored by much of the dialogue concerning the "insider trading information" that predominated much of the movie and the confrontations weren't always compellingly dramatic enough for me. Still, Oliver Stone can still provide some interesting transitional scenes like the way he fast forwards some city scenes or make some electronically printed words and numbers blend in with various talking heads. So on that note, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but pales in comparison to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the film on Opening Weekend, and thought that it was okay. There were some pretty big leaps you had to take which didn't add up, and it just didn't seem to have the same verve, flair and intensity of the original. Gekko's eventual redemption was EASILY foreseen; I'd have given this 5 stars (or maybe even 4), but the graphics at the end of the movie were really captivating.The female lead of this movie is really weak, almost 2 dimensional, and the relationship between Brolin and Shia le Beouf lacks credibility. Overall, not a bad movie, just thought it would be so much more dynamic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gekko is promoting his book, his estranged daughter Winnie is a political muckraker engaged to Jake Moore, a hot-shot Wall Street trader, and an old nemesis of Gekko's, Bretton James, devours the firm Jake works for. When Jake's mentor takes his life, Jake wants revenge and Gordon may be the perfect ally. Can Jake maintain Winnie's love, broker a rapprochement with her father, get his revenge, and find funds for a green-energy project he champions?...A belated sequel to a classic film is sometimes uncalled for, but in this instance, this film is very topical and one feels that it was only made due to the 2008 financial meltdown.The best thing in the film, Langella, is only in it for the opening act, but sets the whole story moving. And because Langella puts in such a great performance, the rest of the film sadly goes downhill from there, but only slightly.For once, Labeouf is watchable, and isn't as unlikable as he is in his other movies, but there isn't much chemistry between him and Mulligan, and as they are more or less the central characters, they sub-plot is quite boring and there scenes feel lethargic.Douglas on the other hand, is what you expect, a little more vulnerable in some instances, but still the man. And you can tell he knows this film wouldn't have been made if it wasn't for him, as he swaggers around in his scenes and is effortlessly cool whenever he utters a line. And kudos to him for making Gekko more human this time around.Whenever the more seasoned actors are on screen (Brolin et al), the film is electrifyimg and is as good as the original, but these scenes are few and far between and Brolin doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserves.These are a few minor gripes though, the film is slickly made and has the Stone trademark to the film, but the yuppie thing is missing, and that was a pivotal point of Wall Street.So all in all, it's a good movie, sometimes pretty pointless, but it's good to see what Gordon did next.The Sheen cameo is nostalgic, but feels very awkward and is pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My same-sex life-partner and I, who have known each other intimately, on and off, over the past several months, have alternately worshiped and adored Oliver Stone's storytelling and directorial craftsmanship ever since we were both but small drug-addled children growing up among the gunfire in Cabrini Green.Mr. Stone makes a convincing argument that greed never left - it simply found a new home in "credit default swaps" which are never described with any clarity. The overuse of the phrase "moral hazard" presents risks of its own - namely that the audience will be fatigued by the repetition. And apparently they were.With the exception of Douglas, the fake acting is nothing short of awful. Fake tears, fake arguments, fake pitches, fake jealousies. There is only one short clip where Mr. LeBoeuf's entire left (non-chain-smoking) hand is visible. Now, That's Acting! Much of the blame lies in the writing, but most should be aimed squarely at Stone. "Circle gets the Square," in the parlance of the equally defunct and socially irrelevant Tic Tac Dough. Stone could not have scored a more perfect bullseye if the target were a stationary broken toy duck on the carnival midway. Good shot, Oliver! Way to go! The one plot line that I liked, Gecko's relocating the business oversees, was too little too late. And it also would be implausible for a number of reasons, mostly legal. But it added the glimpse of hope that at least one character was actually a moving target. Not enough.Perhaps my expectations were overly high and unappreciative of the creative genius behind 1) multiple 70-story "crane" shots, 2) tacky colorful cacophonies of floating financial data superimposed onto other shots, 3) the inanity of a misplaced, unimpressive motorcycle race, 4) the overly ornate formal dinners, and 5) the less-than-believable, overly simplistically described clean energy ocean-wave project. It was all very showy to the point of being tasteless - which perhaps it is meant to be - but who wants to pay to watch a two hour turn-off? The film dumbs down so many aspects of the financial, scientific, legal and regulatory worlds that it might as well have been animated and released on four successive Saturday mornings on whichever broadcast network has the lowest ratings for that time slot.But if you choose see this movie in its current form and expect to learn anything, you are an idiot.And Mr. Stone, if you are gracious, humble and sober enough to read this, you are the reason that my life-partner (who is a full time day trader and nonstop tequila drinker) and I have temporarily gone our separate ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to the first "Wall Street" movie, we find Gekko out of prison but without funds. Making money is in his blood and he needs to find a way to reestablish himself. Michael Douglas again is Gordon Gekko.Shia LaBeouf is the new financial hotshot in town, as Jake Moore. He has a number of challenges including his mother who quits her job as a nurse to make money in real estate. Only she isn't very good at it and repeatedly asks her son for money to carry her over. Six-figure type of money.Jake is married and his young wife is Carey Mulligan as Winnie Gekko, the estranged daughter of Gordon Gekko. She just wants to make it as a journalist and hides the fact that her dad placed money in her name, in a Swiss account, before his old operation was exposed and was sent to prison.And finally Josh Brolin as Bretton James is an unscrupulous financial manager who was responsible for Gekko's downfall those years earlier and part of the subplot here is to bring James down.Pretty interesting movie, especially in light of the financial system and Wall Street issues that were responsible for the problems in late 2008 and continuing today in late 2011.SPOILERS: Gekko had left $100Million in the Swiss account to his daughter, she was to "loan" it back to him to let him get started after his prison term was over. But she failed to do so. Gekko eventually got the funds through a con he worked on Jake, and set up in London. He and the staff he hired parlayed the $100Million into $1.1Billion. After he found out he was to become a grandfather, he began making attempts to reconcile, and began with donating $100Million to a secret offshore fund in the name of a fusion enterprise that Jake and Winnie wanted to help fund.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1987 is remembered for the release of 'Wall Street', a louche tale of corruption, greed and scandal among New York's finance elite. In that film, a young whippersnapper, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) idolised Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a merciless investment banker worth millions. Gekko liked Fox enough to employ him, but when Gekko reneged on a deal including Fox's father, Fox exposed Gekko's fraudulent transactions, causing him to be imprisoned. This sequel continues after Gekko's eight-year prison sentence. The kid this time is Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf). Already a hugely successful Wall Street broker, Jake just happens to be dating Gekko's estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan). Gekko meanwhile ekes out a living ? actually lives quite well ? by giving lectures in finance and predicting the global financial crisis. It seems that prison has cured him of his ills; at least until he concocts a wily plan to return to his former glory.Veteran director Oliver Stone directed both films and what superlative achievements they are. Acute attention to the smallest details ? recalling characters and events from the first film ? creates an impressive synergy, which over a span of 23 years is all the more commendable. Although both films contain plenty of stock market jargon I may never comprehend, the multiple narratives couldn't be easier to follow. The cinematography is skilfully executed (New York has rarely looked more majestic), and strong support is provided by such big-hitters as Eli Wallach, Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon and Josh Brolin. By rights I should hate Gordon Gekko. We all should. He treats people like commodities ? either to use or to use up; he spits out pious platitudes like a cobra spits out venom; and he famously believes that 'greed is good'. He is the epitome of evil, the devil incarnate. But I defy anyone to say that they are not seduced by him in some way.His character teaches us about human nature at its most bestial. Who among us has never flouted a precept to gain an advantage? No doubt our transgressions would count as mere peccadilloes compared with financial fraud, but the motive is much the same: deceit. In one way or another, we've all been Gordon Gekko at some stage, only we're so morally superior that we won't admit it.www.scottishreview.net</fullReview>

The best part of the whole movie was the lecture Gordon gives at the beginning of the film, as seen in the previews...it goes down hill from there. Very slow moving and predictable and unrealistic at the same time.~Spoliers~ The whole daughter being so unforgiving through the whole movie and then at the end just forgiving both Gordon and Jake after a lame 10 second speech from Gordon was just too unbelievable. What all is forgiven now that Gordon is really wealthy again? And while the birthday party for the kid was sweet in a way, it was just the kind of over the top event that the whole movie is 'preaching' against. So what is the message, we should be 'better,' focus less on material things and status, but humans as whole will never be over those things, so enjoy it, if you've got it?</fullReview>

Second, I am half through my "Broker course" at my university, by no means expert for high-level economy, this is only optional subject I simply picked. "Wall Street 2010" is one of several obligatory movies we must see before final exam, which will have some questions regarding key moments in those movies. So far, this was hardest for me to understand and actually had to rewind some scenes on DVD to fully figure what is going on.This is a perfect film, acting is superb, high-budget production, and addresses some key elements regarding 2008 economic crisis. It is not for everyone, since it requires higher knowledge of the topics presented in the film to be fully appreciated and understood. I have no doubt this movie will acquire a cult status in the years and decades to follow, despite low ratings in the opening year, jugging by 6.3 average at present on IMDb.Perfect dialogues and metaphores of speculation bubbles and moral hazards, only one frame on Citibank banner was enough to complete introductory scene. Artistic perfection!Young actors did astonishing effort to make characters believable, so was performance of well established names like Michael Douglas. Absolute recommendation if you are into stock exchange movies.Acting: 10/10, Story 10/10, Factual accuracy 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Wall Street improved with age (my age) becoming more relate-able as I became an adult and had endured a few corporate layoffs and buyouts. Therefore, my expectations for the sequel had built to a perhaps unrealistic level...In the original Wall Street, Oliver Stone did a masterful job painting a clear picture from the sleazy Gekko down to the hard working victims at the bottom. Even if you couldn't relate to the details of "the street" you could relate to the people and the consequences of their decisions.Not so in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. The LeBouf character's journey was far less interesting for me than that of Bud Fox. I think the main reason is his hero (and even the so-called victims in the movie) already seem so enriched by and entrenched in the Wall Street system, it's hard to have sympathy for them.The strongest part of the movie was Michael Douglas' performance. Seeing the tantalizing preview in the theater is what made me eagerly await this movie. Gekko is not the central focus of this movie, but fans of the original will enjoy seeing him again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat disappointing, but is still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is inevitable that Hollywood will make a movie from the 2008 global financial crisis and who has greater claim to this lucrative piece of investment than Oliver Stone, and who wouldn't have a nostalgic yearning for Michael Douglas's Oscar-winning performance. And yet, this movie, split-screen and panoramic aerial shots and all, attains at best slightly above passing grade.Perhaps the audience themselves is to be blamed ? they know too much. In today's world of information overload, there isn't much you can tell them that they don't know (at least superficially, and that's all you can realistically do in a movie). The real problem with this movie, however, is that the plot is rather feeble. Despite Stone's occasion flare of directorial flare, there is nothing really to excite the audience, or move them, for that matter. Some plot elements are outright ridiculous. For a girl to reject a devoted lover simply because he, behind her back, tries to bring her and her estranged father back together is something so contrived that it verges on insulting the audiences' intelligence. "You've lied to me. Our mutual trust is broken. We're through". Pardon me! I feel sorry for Carey Mulligan to have to stoop to such stupidity.But then, this movie is probably worth watching just for the cast, despite the fact that the characters generally tend to be one-dimensional (and I'm not talking in the context of the outrageous onslaught of 3D). Starting with the cameo's and supports, Susan Sarandon is always good to see, even when in this near-cameo role she can breeze through while sleep-walking. Frank Langella has a meatier role, eve though still essentially cameo. During the lamentably short times when he appears, the screen brightens up and the movie is lifted a notch. Almost the same can be said about Eli Wallach (a really cameo appearance) whose recent appearance in "New York, I love you" is all but unforgettable. Josh Brolin did not get a chance to shine here as he did in "W" or even "Milk" but delivers as a cardboard villain. Shia LaBeouf shuns his rebellious juvenile screen persona and is almost too good to be true here. Carey Mulligan has made the best of the feeble material she has been given and is even at times mesmerizing. Another thing I see is an uncanny resemblance to my all-time number one screen lady Jean Simmons, if you think of movies like "Guys and dolls" (1955), "The big country" (1958) and "Elmer Gantry" (1960). I think it's that facial expression with that faint smile at the corner of her lips.But if there is something that is really worth the price of your admission, it's a speech delivered by Michael Douglas to a large audience of essentially college type and young professional, a sales pitch of the protagonist's new book. It occurs about half hour into the movie. So if your are habitually late, don't be THAT late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return Of Gordon Gekko!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1987, 'Wall Street' spoke the Stock-Market language, with a stellar, academy-award winning performance by Michael Douglas. Oliver Stone and Douglas bring back the language and the legendary character after 23 long-years. And The Return Of Gorden Gekko, is one comeback! 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' catches you from the word GO, Stone's direction, Douglas's stylish performance &amp; striking Cinematography keep you at the edge of seat. Without a doubt, Money Never Sleeps is a punch tribute to it's Prececessor.'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' takes place 23 years after the original, revolving around the 2008 financial crisis. The film's plot mainly centers around the reformed Gekko acting as more of an antihero rather than a villain and follows his attempts to help Wall Street before its soon-to-be stock market crash as well as trying to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie with the help of Jacob, Winnie's fiancé.'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' is a terrific cinematic experience. Stone's ever-worthy Direction and Style never lets the momentum go low, he brings back his favorite 80's characters, Gekko, and uses him to the optimum. This is one his finest works to date. Rodrigo Prieto's Cinematography should earn him Awards. His work is truly astonishing! He captures each moment, with grace. Craig Armstrong's Music is good.Acting Wise, 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' belongs to Michael 'Gordon Gekko' Douglas from start to end. Gekko is suave, conning &amp; absolutely stylish. Another Academy-Award Worthy Portrayal! Shia LaBeouf is superb. He shines even when he has to share screen space near the mighty Gekko! Josh Brolin excels as an antagonist. Carey Mulligan as Gekko's Daughter, is splendid. Frank Langella is memorable in a brief role. Susan Sarandon is decent. Charlie Sheen makes a fine appearance.On the whole, 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' is amongst the most interesting, gripping and memorable films to come out of 2010. Gekko and Stone still rule! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent. 85% of this movie is top notch. I really felt pain at times watching the financial crash on screen.The screenplay is well balanced. There is a lot of story and details like most Oliver Stone movies and it is quite long. The financial details don't bog down the story though. They didn't do a tedious documentary explaining the subprime crisis. Instead it shows how the crisis played out from the point of view of Shia's young Wall streeter. It is different from Wall Street 1 in the sense it is not so preachy with a clear cut good and evil message. It's more a chronicling of events. The fear and panic of the crisis are well played out. The thinly disguised Lehman Bros collapse is well integrated. Loved Gordon Gekko's little character flaws and his betrayal and recouping his fortune. Glad it had a feel good ending or the would have been too depressing.The only annoying thing is the clean energy company is unrealistic and distracts from the story. Carey's Winnie Gekko character can be a little too self righteous. Also how they got back at Brolin so easily seems a little too easy.The acting is really good. Michael Douglas gives another great speech and his scenes with Carey Mulligan are quite moving. Carey is good at acting sad and disappointed so she suits the role well. Susan Sarandon is convincing in her frenzied realtor role. Josh Brolin is really becoming a good actor - he is just right - not over the top. Shia is good and earnest. His distress and worry is quite well acted.This movie lives up to its hype and deserves much praise and several nominations / awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its some 22 years later. Gordon Gekko is out of jail. Shia La Bouf {what a macho sounding name} is romancing his daughter, and Mr Greed becomes La Bouf's mentor. Expensive looking but empty - and lethally boring morality tale does nothing to build on its predecessor. Its a strictly by the numbers banality designed to cash in on one of the most unlikable screen characters ever created. However, one can't really be too surprised because nearly every successful movie ever made always has the ineviatable sequel-even if it comes two decades after the original.I really don't want to get on a rant here about leftist America hating, Jew bashing, Iranian supporting and "Hitler was just misunderstood" director Stone, but he is just another Hollywood hypocrite who hates everything America represents- except for the money of course. In a year of CGI and 3D overkill, Money comes in as just another faceless product. Douglas is OK and I honestly and sincerely hope he recovers from his bout with cancer,but movie has nothing to recommend itself. They say that this year {2010} was one of the worst years for American films. "Money" does nothing but confirm it. And speaking of money, don't waste it on this rubbish. The reviewer who said he saw some kid playing a game on his computer before the movie started probably had more fun doing that than watching this. Who can really blame him? He realized that this movie was just another dud.Do you really want to make Oliver Stone even richer than he already is? I didn't think so.A despicable film from a despicable director.

		<fullReview>Im one of those people who hasn't seen a huge amount of "classics" and so when sequels come out i get the chance to watch movie arcs together, and not have to wait decades between films . Wall Street is one such film.With the first movie being made in the 880s i thought it would have dated,but surprisingly it holds up OK.The second movie although is average, it could have utilised the original cast more.Instead we get a kinda remake on the original movie as opposed to a continuation of the original characters. Douglas is underused in this movie, when he could very easily have been given a good storyline could easily have stolen the show.The other downside to this film is that i wasn't aware that Oliver Stone made them, the first film which is made in the 80s you can forgive Oliver as these days hes regarded as one of the best out there but in the 80s not as much, so i had high hopes for the second movie in regards to camera work, story telling etc, but it fails to have any "Oliver" imprint on it. Finally the main character whose name i forget is OK in the movie but every time i see him on screen i just think " its the annoying person from the even more annoying Transformers movie ! All in all the 2 movies when watched together are a good watch, but if any movie producers are reading this, if your going to make a sequel, invest some time and energy into it .. after all, the fans have invested some 20 odd years .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathy For The Gekko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste. I've been around for a long, long year, stole many a man's soul and faith.' Mick Jagger was singing about the guy with the horns and pitchfork, but the opening lines to Sympathy For The Devil (disappointingly featured in the trailer and not the actual film) can be just as easily applied to one Gordon Gekko. Among the greatest individual performances of all-time back in 1987, Michael Douglas reprises his role as the snake in silk, with the respected Oliver Stone again in the director's chair.Set some twenty years after the original Wall Street, Gordon has just completed his jail sentence and is settling down to a quieter life. Successfully predicting the Global Financial Crisis, he travels to function centres across the nation, preaching his word and plugging his book. Meanwhile, Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) is an up-and-coming trader who is about to cross paths with Gekko courtesy of his relationship with Gekko's estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan). Gordon believes he may have inside information (no pun intended) for Jacob regarding Bretton James (Josh Brolin), who's rumour spreading and poor management led to the suicide of Jacob's mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella). This is information he will divulge provided Jacob makes the effort to reacquainted Gordon with his daughter.Sound confusing? It should. And that's just the surface of a film too bloated with sub-plots for its own good. Let's get to the positives first, because this was not a poor film by any stretch. While there are only minor flaws on minor occasions in terms of acting, everyone involved pulls their weight with the exception of Michael Douglas (in a good sense). Despite delivering an above-average script, it feels as if the writers spent more time on Douglas's character than the rest of the movie put together. And he hasn't lost a step, either. Taking great pride in reviving his greatest creation, Douglas injects real energy into his performance. Although Gekko isn't quite the immoral puppet master he once was, Douglas takes this change in character development and makes it real and acceptable for anyone who has seen the original.In fact, Gekko is portrayed perfectly for about eighty percent of the film. Unfortunately, decisions made regarding the conclusion take away almost all of his integrity. Usually a straight shooter, the last half hour of Money Never Sleeps involves uncharacteristic flip- flopping from the man. This can be attributed to the multitude of plots, which Stone attempts to solve flimsily in order to provide some sappy closure for a saga not to be returned to.While others question the decision to apply a revenge theme into the movie, claiming it is not in keeping with expectations, I actually think they had the right idea. That aspect of the story is engaging, but again, it means virtually nothing by the time the film finishes, having been swallowed up by other mini-movies, including the collapse of American investments, the Gekko trust fund, Winnie's pregnancy and Gordon's personal agenda. As I said, this is not a poor film. Josh Brolin makes an excellent villain, with veterans Langella and Wallach showing class in smaller but still significant roles. But I would have had no problem with seeing the film end twenty minutes earlier than it did, giving the audience some food for thought rather than vainly trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. I see now why Stone was so reluctant to direct a sequel; it was clearly an unnecessary project. Nonetheless I will go against the norm and admit I thoroughly enjoyed the cameo.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You wont fall asleep with "Money Never Sleeps" due to Douglas' always winning Gekko!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Greed God himself Gordon Gekko is back! And no, he is not related to that talking lizard in those commercials of that insurance company that sounds like Gekko. However, both of them do have big tongues that are used to suck up your money. "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" is the sequel to the 80's predecessor hit film which featured W.S. tycoon Gekko going head to head with that guy with the Adonis DNA. At the end of the 80's "Wall Street" movie, that guy's Adonis DNA was FBI wiretapped in a confrontation with Gekko which caused Gordon to spill all the beans on his corrupted money laundering schemes; which led to an eventual trip to the big house. By the way, just in case you are not in the loop with this one, it was the character of Bud Fox portrayed by the wirehead Adonis DNA king Charlie Sheen that caused Gordon's "go to jail" trip due to Gekko's attempted monopoly on Wall Street. I am punning, duh! The "Two and a Half Men" star even makes a two and a half minute cameo in the sequel. "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" starts with Gekko in 2001 upon his prison release of his 8-year jail term. However, there is no one there to pick him up once he is freed. Then the movie quickly zips ahead to 7 years later in 2008. Gekko is not the leading character in this sequel. It is the character of Jake Moore, a young savvy stockbroker who seeks revenge on a merciless financial executive who Moore thinks caused the suicide of his stockbroker mentor Louis Zabel. But that's not all, here is more on Moore; he happens to be engaged to Gekko's estranged daughter Winnie. Jake does end up having an association with Gordon Gekko and they even start trading. Gordon provides Jake inside information on his former nemesis Bretton James who happens to be the executive that Jake wants to crash I mean crush. In return, Jake has to find a way for Winnie to reconcile with her daddy G.G. With the economic crisis of 2008 in the background, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" encompasses many financial debacles and shady deals within the the narrative. If you are not into financial verbiage (as yours truly), you have to be paying close attention and never sleep to this one or else you will be lost as a puppy. So call me financial-verbose challenged, but Screenwriters Allan Loeb and Stephen Schiff's complex "write me the money" screenplay will leave many moviegoers puzzled and confused. Personally, the first "Wall Street" was easier to understand and I saw it when I was 19; or maybe this means that my money market intellect is crashing as I am getting older. Director Oliver Stone returns to helm the sequel with the same finesse as he did in the first one. Shia LaBeouf's rapidly rising acting stock came to a halt with his overacted performance as Jake Moore. Josh Brolin played just another one of those what has become his stereotypical villain roles with his formulaic performance as Bretton James. Carey Mulligan's work as Winnie was a bit too bratty-like for my taste, and did not cause me to root for a win-win situation for the whining Winnie. However, the acting of "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" was bailed out by the legendary Michael Douglas with his charismatic performance as Gekko. Douglas won the Best Actor Oscar back in the late 80's for his star turn as Gekko in the first "Wall Street". And though his work in the sequel borders between a supporting and lead performance, it still shows that Douglas, for lack of a better word, is good; very good! I think you should invest some time in "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" but the dealio is that dow will probably not love it. *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what you ca expect "Michael Douglas". A perfect performance by Douglas combines with a talented young girl named "Carry Mulligan" and consequences in a great achievement for "Oliver Stone". Using a number of famous actors reminded me of Iranian films in which you can't distinct who is the first role. Here in "wall street" everybody knows what to do. Michael Douglas, Shia Labeouf, Josh Brolin &amp; Carry Mulligan are all people who can guarantee a film's ranking.Main scenes are taken in roofed areas; salons, offices or at home. These kinds of scenes need an interior design which should absorb the watchers ASAP. Another point about cinematography is focusing on building and city's architecture. No doubt in these part personnel has done a well job.Concentrating on a book written by Gordon Gekko named "Is Greed Good?" indicates whole film's strategy. Everybody out there tries to be the one who has all the money and power. There is not any white or black (no one is very good or very bad).Keller Zabel's suicide because of "going under" and selling his share just for 3 boxes, influences many people's life. Jacob, who thinks that he has a responsibility about Zabel, tries to revenge the person who caused this named "Breton James". Gordon Gekko helps Jacob and gives the experience to him only if Jacob helps Gordon to get back to his daughter?The most eye-catching scenes are felt only when "Carry Mulligan" comes in. the new cinema star successfully shines near Douglas. However there are some goofs about the scenario and seems that they have tried to avoid film's time extension. Winnie looks so weak about her beliefs and always looses her power when every thing is about feelings and emotions. Although there are many problems about the stuff, but generally the film is one of the 2010 best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Only now seeing that there was actually a previous installment (if I may call it that), having seen that movie would have added a bit more background to the opening scene and the quick encounter of Gordon and Bud at the fund raiser. Also understanding where Gordon came from.I loved the emotion of Shia and that little kiss on his mentor's head showed something much deeper than mere money making.There was nice suspense to the demanding and cut throat world of trading showed and ultimately the longing of humans for family and to be loved prevailed. Beautiful.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the absolute WHITEST movie I have ever saw. I mean just over the top WHITE... I saw a couple of Asian people, one Black guy with a messed up haircut and that's about it. The music was terribly white and the young characters acted unbelievably corny. They had no personality, no charisma, just unbelievably white. I mean starbucks drinking, expensive sandwich eating, toyota prius driving, spoiled bratish, computer geeks with entitlement attitudes. It seemed more like an ode to White America than to Wall Street. The love story could of been cut out the motorcycle race was boring and someone could of gotten smacked. Bretten was a good character but his fall was uneventful. They could of gave him more exposure, Gordon Gekko was cool but a lot of what drew people to him was missing. I did enjoy Gekko shopping at the end but overall this was missing the darkness and hunger from the first movie. The whatever it takes attitude, the wit, the cut throat nature, the creativity, the GAME... At the end of the day they were making large money but could of used a lot more swagger and charisma. I guess this movie was made to convince minorities not to enter Wall Street. Only white people and people with really thick skin can hang around people like Winnie and her boyfriend, I can't even remember his name... Anyhow anywhere there's talk of turning a $100 million dollars into $1.2 billion, I'll be tuned in... I'll watch it again but it will definitely be on bootleg DVD. Oh yeah, how can I forget the old guy jumping in front of the subway as a catalyst of the movie... That was a dumb idea...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the reviews here are a little too critical. Remember, it is a sequel to a great movie (Wall St - 1987). It was never going to live up to expectations of the original. We all loved the original movie, but it wasn't enough, we needed to see a sequel showing the legend Gordon Gekko walking out of jail and climbing his way back to the top, and that is what we got. Although it could have been so much better, but I'll gladly take this sequel over no sequel at all.I agree with most comments that there was too much of Gekko's little girl crying. The scene at the start where she grabs the TV remote from her boyfriend's hand and throws it at the TV was too much. Is she an adult or a 14 year old? I think Shia LaBeouf did a good job in his role, despite most disagreeing. Despite his young age and earning so much money, I found him very believable. Of course, Michael Douglas is once again brilliant in reprising his Oscar winning role. Showing his cunning as Gordon Gekko, but also acknowledging that time behind bars had made him rethink a lot of things, and showing a little emotion for his daughter and grandson was good to see. Josh Brolin is again very good in his role, he does have an on screen presence.The cameo of Charlie Sheen is much talked about. Yes, it was completely unexpected and his appearance as Bud Fox did not reflect the character in the first movie. He was surrounded by two hot girls and his persona reflected his real self and his character in Two and a Half Men. It was all wrong for this movie. He ended the first movie with his tail between his legs, having learnt some hard life lessons. What happened to that man? Here is my thought, I believe Charlie Sheen told director Oliver Stone he would only appear in this movie if it could be in this way. So Oliver Stone had no choice but to let Charlie appear like his real self. But I preferred this than no Charlie at all. Those few seconds of Gekko and Fox face to face again was worth it. Even if they had of said nothing and just stared at each other. Seeing them together again was magic! I'm grateful for this sequel to a great movie, could have been so much better, but still better than no sequel at all. I'll take what I can get. To leave the original movie as it was would have been disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Money Never Sleeps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Never Sleeps succinctly wrapped up the recession of our recent times, with the collapse of a trusted, mammoth investment banks (hint), the dog-eat-dog world of the inner financial circle, and how the entire sub-prime nonsense which preyed on everyone's insatiable greed, prove to be everyone's downfall in a buyer's beware market, if only things were that clear especially when rumours are used as tools and weapons to mislead and force a predictable outcome through which to hedge funds on. There were many instances with the release of Gordon from his jail sentence, where his second career as a writer/sought after speaker (only in America folks) brought about opportunities for the character to serve as a mouthpiece of caution in today's world.There's a new protagonist in the film in Jake Moore, played by Shia LaBeouf, who's very much into alternative energy markets and has a hand in the investment and development of one such nuclear fusion farm. Unfortunately the investment bank he works in goes belly up causing the demise of his much respected mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), Jake swears revenge against Josh Brolin's Bretton James, another head honcho banker in a rival firm, and if you've not been listening attentively, or are not remotely familiar with the financial terms being mouthed around, you're more than likely to find it hard pressed how this link was made to position Jake and Bretton as rivals.Gordon Gekko enters the picture because of Jake's fiancé Winnie (Carey Mulligan), Gekko's daughter, and through a potential in-law relation, both men who see so much similarities in each other, especially the older in the younger's fire in the belly, forge a trade of sorts where Gekko provides much needed inside research and knowledge to Jake in exchange for opportunities set up to reconcile with his estranged daughter. And of course, a leopard never changes its spots, and despite warnings from Winnie, we're left to expect how Gordon will actually screw them all over, if he does decide to put aside family bonds.In many instances of relationships here involving Jake and his peers on the Street such as Louis, Gordon and Bretton, there's this hark back to the Dark Side in Star Wars where each master keeps only one protégé to induct into the evil side of things, and each of these relationships are very pronounced in showing that. Of course one has to demonstrate enough rottenness and ruthlessness in order to be spotted for further grooming, and I found it mildly amusing it had to boil down to that. More interesting would be the fact that they're maneuvering in grounds that are set up for such unethical behaviour that it'll either surprise you that such moves are possible, or make you resign to the fact that it's life.Shia LaBeouf probably benefited from not being overexposed, especially with bad films, and Oliver Stone probably elicited one of his best performances here, which is subdued rather than the smart-alecky young adult he usually plays. Here he's more a deer caught in the headlights as a greenhorn yet to but eager to earn his stripes as he goes headlong against seasoned players. Unfortunately for Carey Mulligan, her Winnie role isn't all that fleshed out, being just the romantic lead opposite Shia (which became real for all you tabloid followers out there) and her reconciliatory difficulties with her dad. Perhaps the only bright spark in her character is that she epitomizes free press/speech in the form of a non-profit, independent website out to provide stinging exposes, which has a purpose of course in the last act, like a torchbearer for Stone to champion freedom of speech to bring down the corrupt.Josh Brolin had starred in Stone's previous film W as the ex US president, and here he becomes chief antagonist with great ambition and is behind every shady deal, that you can't help on one hand to hate this guy, while on the other admire his brilliance to exploit with confidence every loophole in the legal and financial system. Villains have seldom looked that suave in a tuxedo hiding behind arrogant smirks. Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko seemed to have mellowed, though yet having enough scenes to spout soundbites and through the narrative, makes you wonder if he's really reformed and out to make peace, or still has that shrewd streak within him, waiting like a coiled snake ready to strike another blow in the markets. Rounding up the star studded billing is Susan Sarandon as Jake's mother, a real estate agent caught up with multiple housing mortgages and serving as the precursor to inevitable trouble.Rumoured to have had its ending edited after reactions in Cannes, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps hit plenty of right spots in delivering a relevant followup film on the financial markets of today. For a fictional film it's rather insightful in its ability to bring forth real issues and ideas to the mass market, and I enjoyed its subplot suggesting how the rich can bury innovation should those breakthroughs threaten the well being of their cash cow commodities, where short term billion dollar gains to these folks far outweigh the benefits and greater good for mankind in general. Think about how alternative fuels have always stagnated, or why the electric car had failed to take off. Highly recommended for an all round great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things Have Changed For Good and Bad, But Still a Good Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about Hollywood making a sequel to the great "Wall Street" I had a mixed feeling, a part of me wanted to see more of that rushed and heartless world but the other part felt that it wasn't that necessary to be made and no matter how much money someone put in a film wouldn't result a better film than the 1987 version. I'm still mixed with the final result and what I saw was a inferior film than the original but with a little of something useful to say to this generation.I'll start this review by asking the major question of all: What happened? I mean, you have the actors, you have the money but you really don't have a story or something to make you moved, thrilled, glad to see. It works in a great level in the beginning, gets weird in the second act and then it makes a positive and cheesy third act. Where did all that bite and tense went? Where did all the excitement and freshness of the first film go to? Sorry, it's very difficult not to analyze both films and it must be done because you might not want to watch it.Michael Douglas plays Gordon Gekko in great shape again, but this time, after some years in jail, he's mentoring Jacob a young, idealistic and too perfect stockbroker (Shia LaBeouf) who wants to get revenge of a powerful CEO (Josh Brolin) responsible for damaging the company of his former mentor Zabel (Frank Langella) to the point of this last guy committing suicide. And this all happens in 2008 in the emerge of the catastrophically financial crisis. Instead of the agitated market with high deals we have bubbles and crisis; instead of the yuppie generation having fun with prostitutes and oral sex in big limousines we have motorcycle races and paintings collection for the purpose of being collected. And instead of playing with emotions and simply wanting more money we have a young man trying to marry Gekko's daughter (Carey Mulligan), a firm relationship that is about to collapse when Gekko wants to make amends with her all this time he was in jail, and her brother died. The only thing that remains the same is the run for more and more money.What makes of "Wall Street - Money Never Sleeps" a gripping and important film is the way he deals with the subject of the financial crisis and how Gordon changed his perception of the economic world, transforming his famous speech "Greed is Good" to "Greed is Legal". The energy between the two films is very different and I think that this sequel should be more faster, more dangerous and less complicated in the use of economy terms, which was way more easier and interesting in the first film. The most disappointing aspects of this film is the bad and annoying editing, the soundtrack and some of the characters and situations. I love David Byrne's songs but most of the songs played in the film were repetitive and pointless, played all the time (but "Naive Melody" saved the closing credit just fine). The third act of the film went by with a strange rhythm, it wasn't dramatic, it was corny and unbelievable; Gordon's double cross was sad and unexpected but it made the film more interesting; and the whole story about Jacob and his girlfriend was distractive at times, slowed down the tone of the film.But "Wall Street 2" is not that bad as many will say. It's good, it has good performances, Michael Douglas was great to see again in the awarded winning role of Gekko although he's a supporting character this time ; Charlie Sheen returned played Bud Fox in a laughable cameo where he didn't looked and sounded like Bud but it was playing Uncle Charlie (his character in "2 and a Half Men") walking along with two women by his side. Along with Douglas for the title of best performance is Josh Brolin who played a vain and mean villain, every time he's on scene he's brilliant, remind of us of the soulless figures of the business world evoked in other films like "Wall Street". LaBeouf's very good, forget about all the criticism thrown on him, but the character he played should have more flaws, more egoistic and less the type of guy who keeps trying to help everyone. Langella, Mulligan, Susan Sarandon, Eli Wallach are good here, nothing so impressive considering their body of works.Oliver Stone makes a good and relevant film that pales in comparison with his first "Wall Street". He needs to get back writing again, (he didn't wrote this film), use more creativity and imagination allied with the current reality. This time we can say that the money in Hollywood felt asleep, otherwise we would have a better film with a better screenplay. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street : The Hollywood Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are all familiar of the events that have happened in the past few years at Wall Street. This movie directly put faces and stories on top almost each of the events. There is the house flipping realtor, the Bear Sterns character, the evil banker that's holding the economy hostage for bailout money and then there's Gordon Gecko. Gecko provides two things to the movie; a soap opera family drama and a strong enough personality to do the Wall Street talk opposite Jake, a young and hungry Wall Street guy.As a movie, it's a ride into the Wall Street world. None of it really makes any sense, actually. Like the hydrogen water researcher who needs 100 million to finish his research but can only get funding from one source. But, it's the atmosphere that perhaps counts and the atmosphere is great but it even sacrifices the plot to keep the atmosphere going.This is a movie made out of the events of the current economic crisis but without a real story inside it. It feels stylish and seems to say something but we're not even quite sure what it is. Overall, it feels a little vapid and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slightly over-complicated drama driven by powerful performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So first things first, I haven't seen the original Wall Street film from 1987 and know little to nothing about the market itself. Oliver Stone, who is certainly a very talented director, hasn't really made a film that I've loved. Considering all these factors, I was wondering how Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps would measure up. While a good portion of the film seemed to take solace in the massive amount of stock market jargon spewed throughout its entire duration, hiding underneath that layer of the film was where Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps truly shined.The first forty five minutes or so of the film come off as slightly convoluted. It almost feels intentionally overly complicated in its execution, but once the film starts to present itself as more of a revenge tale for Jacob Moore and focuses on the relationship between Gordon and Winnie Gekko things begin to get a bit more interesting.Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is full of nothing but solid performances from the entire cast. The only weak link of the bunch was Carey Mulligan who seemed to just cry every time she was on screen. Michael Douglas steals the spotlight every time he's given screen time. This is the type of role he was meant to play. While Shia LaBeouf has shown in the past that he has some untapped potential as an actor, he really steps it up here and this could be the best performance of his career so far. The on screen chemistry between these actors is unbelievably strong. Any scene involving Josh Brolin and Shia LaBeouf conversing with one another is one of the best in the film. There's also the scene where Douglas is pleading with Mulligan to give him another chance as a father that is incredibly memorable. Watching the relationship between LaBeouf and Mulligan fall apart is really powerful, as well. This stellar cast is near perfect for this film.While Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps starts off as a purposely baffling drama that revolves around the stock market and is somehow more talkative and dialogue driven than a Tarantino film, the film evolves into a rather intricate tale of revenge that is driven by nothing but strong performances all around. The film is worth seeing for Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf alone, but Frank Langella and Josh Brolin certainly have their moments as well. Even if you have no interest in this film, it's still worth giving a chance. It might surprise you.</fullReview>
