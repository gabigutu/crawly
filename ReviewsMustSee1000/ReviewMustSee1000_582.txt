		<shortDescription>How To Make A Timeless, Original, Hysterical, Satirical Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every summer Chevy Chase takes his family on a little trip. This year he went too far.  Chevy Chase stars as Clark Griswold, the typical American businessman. Well, almost a basic businessman. He works in food preservatives. Beverly D'Angelo plays his wife, Anthony Michael Hall plays Rusty, his teenage son, and Dana Barron plays his daughter Audrey . This summer, Clark has decided to go all out and take a vacation with his family to "Walley World," a theme park spoof on Disney World, owned by "Roy Walley".Basically, this film starts out strong and ends strong. There are many gut grabbing scenes, and the film never resorts to gross out humor. The biggest gross out is when Clark bites into a sandwich a dog leaked on, but that's a different story.Along the way to Walley World, everything and everything that can go wrong does, and Clark ends up with Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca), who adds more fun to this wallop of a comedy.The laughter just escalates more and more as we see Clark's dreams flush down the toilet farther and farther, and I can't tell you how much I laughed at some of the scenes."Vacation" isn't typical National Lampoon fare.Chevy Chase gives by far his best performance (akthough he acts just as well in "Christmas Vacation") as Clark, a real optimist, go get'm kind of guy, who completely snaps toward the end of the film. The rest of the cast does well, and Beverly D'Angelo does surprisingly well as a house wife. The two children, Audrey and Rusy, squawk at each other, but not to the point of obnoxious, which is another good thing about this film.Is it no surprise that John Hughes, the king writer/director of the 80's comedy films wrote this, or that Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Striped, Analyze This) directed the film? With cameos by the likes of John Candy, Eugene Levy, Brian Doyle Murray (who played Clark's boss in "Christmas Vacation"), and more, "Vacation" is a comedic triumph of the eighties that is now an icon of how to make a good comedy.4.5/5 stars --John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you not like this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that i loved when i was younger so i really didn't know what to think as i watched it again. But to my surprise it is still charming, funny and sweet. Enter Chevy Chase as the last family guy, just wanting to spend time with his loving family. A hilarious journey from Chicago to California to get to an amusement park. You may think, that shouldn't be a problem, but it is. This is one vacation you will never forget. I have always liked Chevy Chase and if you watch this movie you will know why. The sweet caring family man losing more and more of his mind is nothing less than funny as hell. Maybe you will think twice about taking your family on vacation after watching this movie. I rate this movie 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one word: Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times on TV (the German dubbed version, of course) and I loved it every time...allthough the more often its shown, the more it gets cut on TV.Now, for the first time (thanks to DVD), I have been able to watch it in its original language. And it was just awesome! The dialogues were even better and the characters were so much better outlined.I swear that I will never see such a great movie in a dubbed version again!To any Germans in here: go get it on DVD (even though it is just in Mono) - and delete the video tape if you have recorded it from TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vacation", what a hysterical laugh out loud till you hurt movie! I was watching the wonderful "I love the 80's" on VH1, and they showed this movie. I remember watching it when I was younger, but I didn't get much of it obviously. So, I watched it again, because it looked more appealing than it did when I was a kid.God, I never laughed so hard in my life. Chevy Chase, Clark Griswald decides that he is not spending enough time with the kids, so he has planned a cross road trip with the family to see their favorite cartoon character theme park "Marty Moose!" and "Wally World!". Back on the old holiday road, it's not going to be easy. Visiting their hick cousin, Eddie and his scary hillbilly family and putting their grumpy old aunt on the trip with the Griswalds. Clark has a mysterious but extremely sexy girl, Christie Brinkly, following him around in a red hot Ferrari. Their car is constantly getting into accidents and dents on the way to California. Finally, after to the point of madness, Clark will kill every person if he has to to get to Wally World. If you loved "Vacation", I highly recommend "Christmas Vacation" as well. I think the reason why we all love this movie is because we can relate in some way. How many of us go on vacation and nothing goes perfect? I loved the ending of this movie so much! I won't give it away, but trust me that it is that good. If you've seen it, I'm sure you will agree that this is a must see comedy.10/10-highly deserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clark Griswold ignores his family's pleas to go to Hawaii for their summer vacation and opts for the Walley World resort in California instead. His long-suffering wife Ellen wants to fly, but Clark would rather drive and spend time with the kids he hardly ever sees.Sounds like a simple journey from A to B right? Wrong! The Griswolds are a gene pool of absolute disaster and nothing...NOTHING goes right...ever. The fun begins with Clark being forced to accept a disgusting metallic pea-green family truckster instead of a cool-blue sports model with CB and optional fun pack. It's literally the most hideous car in the history of automobiles (and that includes the car that Homer Simpson made for his brother Herb).As the lengthy days on the road pass, Clark is ripped-off by street hustlers, guilt-tripped out of $500 from his hick cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid in what is, begrudgingly, his most popular role), ripped-off by a hick sheriff/mechanic, and tempted by gorgeous blonde in a Ferrari. Though Ellen doesn't take kindly to anyone with an eye on her Sparky (actually D'Angelo's pet name for Chevy Chase and not something that was scripted).Based on John Hughes' ill-fated trip to Disneyworld when he was five-years-old, Vacation brought us Chevy Chase's most famous character (sorry Fletch) and most successful series. He has absolutely perfect chemistry with Beverly D'Angelo, who, with her large eyeballs and perfect timing, is an under-rated comic actress in her own right.While I absolutely love the first and third movies in the Vacation series, and both definitely score 10/10, I have to say the original is the best as it has a really dark edge that none of the others have. There's virtually nothing in Vacation that isn't funny. Harold Ramis, fresh off the absolute anarchy of Caddyshack, keeps a tight, sadistic reign on the disastrous road trip. If you have a dark sense of humor and enjoy evil comedy then you'll love Vacation. It was one of the first movies I ever saw and it helped turn me into the misanthropic, dysfunctional, ghoulish misfit that I am today.Thank you, Vacation! Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of my favorite comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's the part when they visit the white trash relatives (Randy Quaid and his family) and they acquire Aunt Edna for the family trip. Maybe it's the part when Aunt Edna dies and they put her on the top of the old station wagon,, maybe it's the fighting and bickering all kids do when the family goes somewhere,, or maybe it's the part where the Griswolds drive through a cruddy neighborhood and the station wagon gets vandalised and all of the hib caps taken..I cannot think of a "favorite" part of this movie because it is hilarious from start to finish. Clark Griswold's good intentions gone bad makes this a decent, highly watchable movie with non-stop laughs. It's not ridiculous nor highly exaggarated either- just a typical American family trying to get to Wally World in one piece and everything goes wrong. I think we can all relate to something in this movie when it comes to going on vacation. I still watch this movie every time it's on television and I still laugh every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Vacation Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"National Lampoon's Vacation" is a funny movie that follows the Griswold family, Clark (Chevy Chase) and his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) along with their children Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron), as they cross country on their station wagon westward from their home in Chicago to Walley World, the Disneyland-like amusement park in California. It took them two weeks to get their and have fun. The film co-stars John Candy (too bad he died), Randy Quaid, Imogene Coca, Eddie Bracken, Eugene Levy, Christie Brinkley (who plays the girl in the Ferrari here), and the other cast and crew. If you have not seen "National Lampoon's Vacation", I suggest you go rent it at your local video store near you and laugh or see it on television and laugh also. If you'll liked it, buy the video or DVD or tape it from any channels on television on blank tape. I think you will not be disappointed. Hilarious!I give it a perfect 10/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Illinois, Chicago, the suburban Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) decides to travel on vacation with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and their daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) driving his new station wagon to the Walley World theme park in California. Ellen and the children suggest that they fly to the destination, but the stubborn Clark wants to spend more time with his family and say no to the proposed airplane travel.The Griswold family has many problems along their journey and they visit Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her useless husband Eddie (Randy Quaid) and their children. When they leave the place, they are forced to give a ride to the inconvenient Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and her hateful dog. Soon Clark learns that his planned journey has become a trip from hell."Vacation" is a hilarious road movie that makes anyone laughs. The clumsy Clark Griswold provokes very funny situations with his attitudes, supported by his beautiful wife. Unfortunately this type of naive comedy is forgotten by the studios on the present days. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Férias Frustradas" ("Frustrated Vacation")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favorite movies I own. One of Chevy Chase's finest movie besides The 3 Amigos. It seems that Chevy Chase lost his humor after 3 Amigos. But this movie here had everything you could ask for a comedy, and I've seen a number of them. I'd also like to see Dana Barron (Audrey Griswald) in more movies, cause what a hottie she is. And the rest of the cast did a superb job in making this early '80s movie a box office hit; and I would highly recommend anybody to watch this movie, even if it is for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chevy is, a very funny lad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>National Lampoons Vacation is an absolute classic Chevy Chase film. Chevy (as Clark) is, a very funny lad. Americans are capable of comedy, although are yet to master the British and their achievements in this genre. Each time I watch this film the delivery in Chevy's lines becomes funnier. The absolute classic for the movie is when Clarke talks about the Mississippi River and then the St Louis Arch.The cross country adventures are taken to extremes with great characters such as cousin Eddy at times stealing big Chevy's thunder. Don't be fooled, I'm not suggesting anyone deserved an Oscar. However, when you watch a comedy and it is comical then they have to be doing something right. If your a fan of Chevy then you will have seen this film so i suggest you go and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Family movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so I guess you can't really call it a family movie because it's rated R. But that family movie presence is still there.Anyway, what can I say about National Lampoons Vacation. It's probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you don't even laugh at ONE of the jokes, you're not human. I'll admit, there is some crude humor but most of it should, at the very least, make you chuckle. Chevy Chase is outstanding and is probably the funniest character in the movie.It may be a bit old but it's a classic and I enjoy watching it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clark Wilhelm Grizwald; the epitome of Murphy's Law.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grizwold Family Vacation just isn't going to be the same this year.If you know Clark, you know he never under-does anything. Clark is a spineless worm of a man who deary loves his family. He is a gullible idiot who lacks the backbone to stand up for himself, until he absolutely cracks. He takes and takes until he little mind just can't take it anymore and then he goes completely nuts.This, the first in a small series of "Vacation" movies, is the most successful endeavor. While the sequels are each enjoyable, they lack the care that went into the making of this first installment.There are quite a few moments which have you rolling your eyes and cringing inwardly, but the campy humor never ceases to entertain.Driving across the country with two children in the back seat is an arduous enough task without having Clark W. Grizwold at the helm. He is almost flagitious in his determination to have fun. On their way to "Wally World," to see "Marty Moose," anything that can go wrong, does.Stopping for obvious tourist attractions such as the "House of Mud," surely does nothing to help this trip. And neither does the little blonde in the red sports car, who distracts Clark so badly that he can barely keep himself contained.Equal to the bad choices and horrible distractions, is their visit with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid). From country losers who are obviously the white trash of the family, we get quotes like, "I'm going steady and I french kiss." "So? Everybody does that." "Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best at it." and "Dad taught me something really neat last year. Ever bop your bologna?" and "I don't know why they call this 'Hamburger Helper,' it does just fine all by itself." Don't eat sandwiches during the scene just after they leave Cousin Eddie's house. You'll regret it. Just a heads-up. Although I must admit that Clark's solution to Aunt Edna's horrid little mutt was rather creative.I won't detail every scene in this movie, but you get the general idea. And it goes downhill for the Family from there.Delightfully portrayed with comedic dialog and wonderful direction.If you can laugh at another's mishaps, then this is definitely the movie for you.It gets a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm On A Pilgrimage To See A Moose"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Getting there is half the fun", says bland family man Clark, head of the bland suburban family, the Griswolds. He's rationalizing why the family will drive from Illinois, instead of fly, to Wally World, a moose-centered family amusement park in California. What makes this film enjoyable is that the Griswolds are so typical of banal American suburban family values.Clark (Chevy Chase) is a good-natured sap, gullibly idealistic, and conforming. His meek wife (well played by Beverly D'Angelo) looks up to Clark. Their two teenage kids are dull blockheads, patterned after their dull parents. The boy wears ugly dental braces.Their mode of travel is a prehistoric, humorously ugly, putrid green station wagon with cheesy brown panels. The Griswolds blast off with unlimited optimism and good-natured anticipation of the fun they will have at Wally World. But the optimism gradually fades and is replaced by grim determination after a series of on-the-road disasters that make a mockery of idealism.The film's humor lies in its absurd plot situations, and in the dialogue. At a cookout, a down-on-his-luck Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) treats the Griswolds to backyard burgers, then remarks to Clark: "I don't know why they call this stuff hamburger helper. It does just fine by itself".Casting is appropriate. Overall acting trends humorously exaggerated, consistent with the satire. Performances by Imogene Coca and John Candy add to the comedy. The bouncy song "Holiday Road" opens the film with a series of vintage American postcards in tandem with the opening credits.My only reservation is that some of the plot contrivances are a bit over-the-top. The writers seem to be trying a little too hard."Vacation" is a satire on the banality of the traditional American summer ritual, and therefore thematically rich. Production values are fine. Though not perfect, this film is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For such an obvious premise, the film gets a hell of a lot of laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film approximately 30 to 40 times in my life, and I never get tired of it. Boneheaded, but well meaning father, Clark Griswold, driving his wife and two kids on a cross country family vacation, from Chicago to a California theme park, to spend time with all of them, before the kids are too old for such things. Needless to say, absolutely nothing goes according to plans: they got lost before even leaving Chicago. Their new car isn't what they had planned. They're saddled with driving an obnoxious aunt to Phoenix. They get lost in the Arizona desert, after visiting obnoxious, trailer trash in-laws, and then robbed by local hicks. All of these absurd, yet wholly possible, circumstances and occurrences pile up, yet Clark Griswold (Chase, in one of his funniest roles as the hapless, clueless father) is determined to have a good holiday with the family, even if it kills them. And a junkyard dog. And Aunt Edna. Beverly D'Angelo is equally good as the (sexy, but not overly) housewife who has enough disaster and wants to turn around and go home. Great score by Lindsay Buckingham also. The film is only let down a bit by the climax, when they actually get to the theme park, the laughs fizzle away. But, perhaps that was the filmmakers' intent? The journey is more memorable than the destination, as is sometimes the case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation is the ultimate vacation movie. It's filled with jokes, crazy moments, and everything that could possible go wrong, does. It's got crazy jokes, crazy characters, crazy scenarios and overall it's just a complete joy to watch. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is the average American family man who takes his family on vacation to Walley World. But right from the word go something goes wrong. And for Clark and the Griswold family that's the pattern of the rest of the movie. Something goes wrong, followed by something else going wrong. But Clark just wants his family to have a good time. Honestly there isn't much more I can say about this movie so I'll sign off by saying see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Road Trip From Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Harold Ramis' R-rated road-trip "National Lampoon's Vacation" is a classic comedy of errors, it doesn't surpass "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." Indeed, "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (1989) amounts to the best "Vacation" outing in the four film franchise. For the record, the 2003 sequel "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2" was a made-for-television movie, so it doesn't properly belong to the cinematic canon. Ramis' rampantly funny, occasionally ribald farce about a dysfunctional middle-class family's cross-country journey from their suburban home in Chicago, Illinois, to the California-based theme-park Walley World benefits from a charismatic cast, fine performances, and gags galore. Some of the gags were rather racy for their day. The demise of Aunt Edna's dog Dinky and Aunt Edna's own death were probably interpreted as borderline tasteless. Released in 1983, "National Lampoon's Vacation" appears dated now in some respects. Meanwhile, the 2015 reboot with Ed Helms and Christina Applegate makes it look comparably tame. The video games that Clark Griswold's children play with look primitive, too. Nevertheless, any comedy toplining Chevy Chase cannot be a total loss, and this origins saga about the misadventures of the Griswold family will keep you in stitches.Irony and incongruity figure prominently in this comedy. Everything that can go wrong for the Griswold family does indeed go wrong. The destination that they set out for is Walley World. Of course, nobody at Disney would countenance anything that National Lampoon conjured up. Not only did THE John Hughes of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" fame pen the screenplay, but also the same Hughes wrote the short story that National Lampoon magazine published in its the September 1979 issue. For the record, "Vacation" was Ramis' sophomore effort after "Caddyshack." This also served as Christie Brinkley's cinematic debut; she is cast as an enigmatic blonde who seems to be stalking Clark. Happily, Ramis doesn't shove the comedy down your throat and Beverly De Angelo and Chase maintain straight faces throughout the hilarity. Some genuinely understated moments of mirth occur that you might overlook unless you have scrutinized the film. For example, in an early scene, watch the way Clark 'Sparky' Griswold (Chevy Chase) dries the dishes at home for his wife without washing them. The Griswolds go through Hell literally to get to Walley World. Naturally, when they show up at the world renowned theme park, they discover that it is closed for two weeks, so Clark brandishes a gun and forces the security guard (John Candy) to take them on a roller-coaster ride from Hell. "National Lampoon's Vacation" consists primarily of a series of incidents strung together as the family travels by station wagon across country. At one point, they pick up a cantankerous relative, Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca of "Under the Yum Yum Tree"), and she dies midway through the journey. The Griswolds are as elated to rid themselves of her (they leave her under an umbrella in a relative's backyard during a downpour) as they are saddened to lose Aunt Edna's pugnacious dog. Indeed, Clark gets pulled over by a grim cop (James Keach of "The Long Riders"), who asks him about the canine leash attached to his rear bumper. Everybody who has seen this vintage comedy should remember Christie Brinkley in the convertible red Ferrari that catches Clark's attention. After several glimpses of each other on the highway, they hook up in a motel swimming pool, but the ecstasy of the moment is ephemeral. Naturally, Clarks' long-suffering wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo of "Every Which Way But Loose") forgives him for his flirtatious swimming pool dalliance. Later, she plunges into the pool naked (unlike the more discrete Brinkley), and Clark joins her. Ramis and Hughes set the tone for this tongue-in-cheek comedy from the start when Clark pulls into the car dealership to pick up his new vehicle. The shady car salesman (Eugene Levy) doesn't have the car that Clark ordered. Clark wanted an Antarctic Blue Super Sports Wagon with a CB and an optional rally fun pack. Instead, he winds up stuck with a Metallic Pea-Green Wagon-Queen Family Truckster that resembles an armored car with the gas cap on the hood. By the time they convince the car dealer that they want their original station wagon back, the dealer has smashed it up. Most of the comedy is standard stuff, and Clark is an eccentric fool. Eddie Bracken, Bryan-Doyle Murray, John Candy, and Eugene Levy make memorable cameos. Nevertheless, the Griswolds are a sympathetic but half-witted family. "National Lampoon's Vacation" is a good comedy, but it isn't strictly a memorable, Hall of Fame epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cornball family man Clark Griswold (Chase) takes his family on a road-trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, and they run into plenty of bumps and detours along the way. Sets expectations for being a standard goofy comedy typical of its type, and then suddenly amps the crudeness at all the right spots. Cousin Eddie (Quaid) is underused, but we thankfully see much more of him in Christmas VACATION; however, here, we still get other fun supporting characters like Aunt Edna (Coca) who add just the right amount of zest to make this an outstanding full of great lines, fun locations and non-stop laughs. The Lindsey Buckingham soundtrack is both nostalgic and timeless. Followed by European VACATION.***? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chevy Chase gives a real performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost a perfect comedy and I have watched this maybe 20 times. It's not only a very funny movie, but it is the most relatable film ever made. We have all been on these family trips where you are supposed to have fun but instead, everything goes to hell.What is so amazing about this film is Chevy Chase. He actually gives a performance whereas in many of his other movies he just seems bored. I loved Fletch when I was a kid, but you can tell that Chevy tries very little and he is not in his element in this type of action-comedy. Here, he is outstanding.There are so many great scenes in this show: 1) The dead aunt on the roof - 2) The visit to Ellen's cousins, especially the discussion about french kissing (what a horrible image it gives you). Of course, it went way over my head as a kid - 3) The scene in the desert, where Clark nearly croaks from dehydration and many, many more. There are a few rough spots as when the family drives into a black neighborhood. I understood what the filmmakers are trying to do, but it just falls flat. And the main sore point about the dead dog. I laughed at the time, but must admit that I felt a little guilty about it. The scene is played very well by both James Keach and Chevy.So, It is almost perfect but not quite. The ending actually made my stomach turn a little, because I am not a huge fan of rollercoasters. But John Candy is terrific and it is like no other movie performance he has made since then. It was a little far-fetched that Roy Walley does in the end, but what the hell, it's a movie, not real life. If you haven't seen the movie you won't know what I'm talking about, but I doubt there are many that haven't seen this amazing flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the funniest comedy movie of all time. Definitely a classic, Chevy Chase is fantastic in this one. This movie is one of my favorites and really embodies middle-class America in the 1980's, in a satirical yet relatable way. The whole cast was incredible, Randy Quaid was hilarious as Uncle Eddie, and who could forget Eugene Levy as the used car salesman ! John Hughes was at his very finest when he wrote this masterpiece of American comedy. European Vacation, Christmas Vacation are both very funny as well, and Vegas Vacation was a distant fourth in my opinion. The Griswold's are simply a barrel of laughs no matter what generation you are part of, this brand of humor continues to make people laugh even after more than thirty years have past. Definitely a 10 out of 10 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation was the 1983 comedy classic that spawned three sequels, several inferior imitations and rip-offs and made a movie superstar out of Chevy Chase.Chase plays one Clark Griswold, an everyman who becomes obsessed with taking his family on a cross-country car trip to a vacation spot called Wally World and the crazy adventures that occur en route and after reaching their destination.The film is rolling-in-the-aisle funny as we watch Clark, his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), his son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) deal with a side trip through a Chicago ghetto, a couple of car accidents, a reunion with long lost relatives, hilariously played by Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn, the sad story of Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and a brief encounter with a blonde in a convertible (Kristie Brinkley). Harold Ramis' fast-paced direction and Chase's dead-pan approach to the material are big assets here and mention should also be made of John Candy's cameo as a Wally World employee. A film that provides major laughs, no matter how many times you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extremely memorable comedy classic. One of the funniest films ever made. This is a film so many of us can identify with - a family vacation by car. This is a stereo typical family in an atypical comedy. Nothing unusual about a mom and a dad with their kids going on a vacation and stopping off to visit relatives along the way to their planned destination. But if your parents are Clark (Chase) and Ellen (D'Angelo) Griswold then you are in for a comical vacation. The rest of the Griswold family is just as weird and funny too.If you liked the movie Vacation then you might like these comedies: "Fletch", "Spies Like Us", or "Caddyshack".9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy with a great adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedy which boasts a fun family vacation with just crude laughter and some of the most random things ever. All jumbled together the film is fun to watch and with some great jokes physical and verbally, this is one comedy that I see never getting old. Done well by the late Harold Ramis, I felt the film was actually a firmly very good one, and here below is why I felt that way about it.The story is hectic but one of pure humour and a kind of comedy that is hard to really see done well in the present day, but the Griswold family make the film there own and bring laugh out loud jokes along with them. It goes at a nice pace and they seem to never over stay there welcome when they come across a new place, this allows for the diversity of the film to show and has a lot of different and new fast things all the time.Chevy Chase is just brilliant in the main role as the dad of the family, he just brings out everything a comedy actor in this type of role needs to be, if you ever think about making a family comedy, look no further than Chase for inspiration. Beverly D'Angelo and the two kids provide good support to kind of push Chase over the edge, the comedy is flowing out when they are in the car together. There are so many new people seen that they also have different effects on Chase and the family, it is just great to see his reactions.Directed by Harold Ramis, it is done well by him and his touch can be seen in every scene with just a little new direction here and a little there. The screenplay is also one of comedies greats, it has so many great lines in it and John Hughes is of course the man to provide such a thing. It is never done lazily by either also, and it seems that a lot of thought was put into even the most stupid of jokes, just good good fun.The only criticisms I would have of Vacation, it can be kind of crude and maybe at times over does it, not as a whole movie but certain parts anyway. I think it all depends on what type of humour you enjoy the most, the film does lack what it had at the beginning toward the end but still manages to get some massive laughs out of you first. One more thing, the acting is never great from anyone but what do you expect, it is a comedy and Chevy Chase is by far the main character but also the best actor here in the film.I think if you like 80's screwball comedies and the kind of funny film that moves along the USA with a fast pace of jokes, this is for you all over. If you also like a bit of rude or crude humour dabbled in, but not always, then this is also one to watch. I think some may not like it mostly from the fact the jokes can be silly, they are funny though and I guess the film would have to come down to personal preferences.Overall it is truly a Firmly Very Good movie, it has comedy elements we need to see more of these days but also the typical trademarks so many great 80's comedies provided. Sit back and relax, they say this is for the people who saw it in the 80's but I disagree, it is for everyone and even modern audiences alike would enjoy this, thoroughly funny, great jokes all around and just some stupid-ness from all the cast in between, go watch it now if you want to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, this movie shows me the reasons why the 80's were so recognized in American industry as a whole. "Vacation" is a politically incorrect movie that deals with dedicated subjects, like father and mother trying to have sex while their children are asleep, young son learning to watch porn-- and consequently masturbate--, young daughter learning what is weed-- and probably how to smoke--, among others. I admit I felt a little shocked with such scenes, since they would NEVER be in a movie these days. You know, several people would feel offended by that and the movie would be too controversial to be popular, so nowadays' filmmakers prefer not to show people as they are. There are some creative scenes, like the pool one and the dying dog for accident, which proves this film HAS a black humor-- which is the funniest for some. For those who enjoy odontology, it's interesting to notice how Chevy Chase had some good teeth, despite the low quality technology they had in the 80's; also, it's fun to see how braces were different, comparing how they are nowadays. Good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic 80s comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Griswold family (Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron) from Chicago is driving cross-country to the Walley World theme park.It starts off with a great happy vibe with the song Holiday Road by Lindsey Buckingham. Director Harold Ramis and writer John Hughes have created one of the iconic comedies from the 80s. This was when Chevy Chase still has his likability and not overstayed his welcome. This is undeniably Chevy's best movie. The three creates a goofy silly comedy deserving of the National Lampoon moniker. The comedy is broad. There are black stereotypes. Beverly flashes her boobs. It's college humor of the times.I do have to say that I didn't realize that Jane Krakowski was the first Cousin Vicki. It's been awhile since I saw this back in the day and she was a nobody. I still laugh at the french kissing joke. Cousin Eddie and his inappropriate family is where this movie starts to get interesting. The ridiculous problems keep mounting, and the jokes keep coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Griswalds go on vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie for one particular reason ? it captures some truth about life . Anyone who's been on a similar journey as Griswalds know that the journey itself is more adventurous than the vacation itself. And that some family members are best to see only once in a year.This movie is considered a classic and the most recognizable movie of Chevy Chase . I like it, but I have to say that this isn't my favourite Chevy Chase movie . I can agree that this is his best performance . His Clark Griswald is a mild mannered man who wants everything to be perfect . Unfortunately , he's an unlucky person and he often has to fights against the odds to achieve his dream . What Chase plays here might be too subtle for some people . I admire how he was able to show a man keeping a straight face even during the most crazy times. He's humble and not too charismatic , yet he does everything not to show it. He wants to be a perfect husband and father , despite that he lacks confidence and everything seems to be against him . He's a very likable person .Beverly D'Angelo gives a good support as the patient and loving wife . I also like Randy Quaid as the disgusting cousin Eddie. Both are kinda underrated comedy actors and that's a shame. Watch out for John Candy ("Planes , trains and automobiles") as the amusement park guard.The jokes here are mostly simple , but they work. Some are lame and there is one rather disgusting and unfunny joke with the dog and leash . Thankfully , there are some subtle jokes here that you might miss during the first watch ( like Clark speaking nicely to the bartender after the shotgun accident).There are some nice songs here ? the most famous title theme song Lindsey Buckhingham "Holiday road" , Pointer sisters "I'm so excited" and June Pointer "Little boy sweet".I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really funny and really touching as well! There is nothing that I hated about this movie at all. This movie is a must see for anyone willing to take a deserved vacation, or just to be seeing it, and you must.Clark Griswold, played by Chevy Chase, is the stubborn but loving husband and dad who takes his family on a cross country drive from Chicago to Los Angeles, running into almost every problem imaginable! Also part of the wonderful cast is Beverly D'Angelo as Ellen, Clark's beautiful wife, Imogene Coca as Aunt Edna (the semi-antagonist), Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty, Dana Barron as Audrey, and many other people who helped make this movie such a success. The Griswolds first stop in St. Louis to see the Gateway Arch, but they end up in a scary, crime-ridden neighborhood. They have their car's hubcaps stolen and their car spray painted to say 'Honky Lips", all while Clark asks for directions! In one of the funniest scenes, Clark dozes off behind the wheel and drives throughout the city asleep, but when it's over, everyone inside is fine. They then travel to pick up Aunt Edna, who hates Clark for no reason. They all get hilariously sidetracked when on the road! I loved this movie, and whoever reads this review must watch it later. This movie is touching, dramatic, and of course funny.</fullReview>

He decides to take his family on a cross country trip to amusement park, Walley World and gets into mishaps along the way. Quaid plays Ellen's cousin, Eddie, the late great, Candy plays a security guard and Christie Brinkley also makes an unforgettable appearance. This is definitely one of Chevy's best, he and Beverly are great together and I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the king of road comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie that Hollywood should not dare attempt a remake of. The film is absolutely hilarious and unforgettable from start to finish, Chevy Chase gives the funniest performance of his lifetime as Clark Griswold, a now classic character whose mishaps and hilarious choices trademark the Vacation series.It starts out with Chevy getting the families car for the road trip all the way to Los Angeles for the theme park Walley World, based off of Disney World. After that, everything that could possibly go wrong on a family road trip does. From the classic character of Cousin Eddie, one of the best slob performances i have ever seen to the complaining Aunt Edna to Chevy's complete mental breakdown at the finale, this film is great fun from start to finish. Only Chevy Chase could have pulled off Clark Griswold, just as John Belushi is the only man able to play Bluto in "Animal House" and Chris Farley was the only man for his performance in "Tommy Boy". A classic comedy, the first of the "road comedy" genre and the best of them by far. If you haven't seen this film yet and are a fan of Chase or just the comedy genre in general, go out right now, don't rent, buy this movie. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I know Hollywood has completely run out of original ideas and are remaking anything that made a name for itself before, but please, i beg you, do not remake the Vacation series, they are perfect the way they are.</fullReview>

Chase is at his funniest in his movie where his classic Clark has his heart set on making it to the famous Wally World theme park, even if it means walking across the desert, leaving his dead aunt on the front porch and taking the security guards hostage. Harold Ramis (later scoring further comedy successes with Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day) handles the whole thing with finely tuned comic-skill, whilst Chase and Beverley D'Angelo make the most of their frequent laughs. Randy Quaid and the late John Candy also make fine contributions to this side-splitting comedy, which spawned three sequels; one poor (European Vacation), another good (Christmas Vacation) and the last worn-thin (Vegas Vacation)</fullReview>

There is a great cast Randy Quaid, Anthony Michael Hall, Beverly D'Angelo etc, and this has a more adult-type feel to it, including bare flesh and even the odd ' f 'word it has everything an 80's road tripping disaster movie should have. I think the European Vacation was great aswell, But Why did they keep changing the kids ? ? ? The series went a bit downhill from here as they got a more bit childish, but still very watchable. I liked the Vegas Vacation scene where the sexy girl in the car(Christie Brinkley)is re-created that was class!Chevy Chase may have been in a few stinkers, but think Vacation, Caddyshack and Fletch the mans a hero!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever someone takes a vacation, they plan and are sure to see to it that nothing goes wrong, unless you're Clark Griswold. Then everything MUST go wrong! [MIGHT POSSIBLY CONTAIN SPOILERS] Clark and son Rusty pick-up their new car: Wagon Queen Family Truckster! Wasn't the car they ordered but: "If you think ya hate it now, wait 'til ya drive it." The Griswolds are heading to Walley World, the ultimate theme park in Los Angeles. So next day they pack up the Truckster and leave their safe Chicago suburb and onto the open road. They run into gang members because Clark got off at the wrong exit.Their motel room has a vibrating bed that won't shut off, and when they visit Dodge City, Clark insults the bartender. Since they're in Kansas, they drop by Cousin Eddie's place. The Griswolds are even conned into taking feeble Aunt Edna to Phoenix. Edna has a mean dog, Dinky, who watches "Family Feud." While on the road, Clark cannot keep his eyes off a gorgeous blonde in a Ferrari doing 80 MPH! They stop at a place called Kamp Komfort in Kolorado (Colorado). It's got a pool, full of garbage and swans, and everything. Next day, Clark attaches Dinky's leash to the rear bumper of the Truckster while loading the luggage. As they drove down the road, Clark couldn't help but wonder if he forgot something. A highway patrolman stops him and shows him the empty leash on the bumper. Poor Dinky. They arrive in Arizona and everything goes along okay--for 10minutes. They hurtle off a cliff and land in a desert in the middle ofnowhere. So Clark trots across the desert looking for a gas station.They're eventually rescued and Clark learns that the man who fixed his car is also the sheriff! And he sets the prices. So now they're strapped for cash. Not only that, but Aunt Edna's cashed in her chips. They must get her to Cousin Normy's, as promised, so they strap her to the roof,not knowing it was gonna rain. Normy went to Flagstaff so they tiedEdna's corpse to a lawn chair in the backyard, recited a eulogy and left. Ellen, Audrey and Rusty want to go home, so Clark slams on the brakes, turns around and tells everyone, in his own vulgar and commodemouth, why they must press on. They finally make it to California! They arrive at Walley World to find that--you guessed it--it was closed so it could be cleaned and repaired. Clark snapped, so he bought a BB gun, took a security guard hostage, and they rode steep and scary roller coasters until the feds, the SWAT team, and Mr. Roy Walley showed up. Clark and Mr. Walley talked it out and everything was forgiven and forgotten. It was a happy ending. This film is quite entertaining! It probably airs on TV more times than "It's A Wonderful Life" at Christmas time. It's followed by three sequels. They're all good, except for "European Vacation". So in conclusion, check this movie out, I think you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"National Lampoon's Vacation" and forms of comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"National Lampoon's Vacation" is a stupid comedy that has opportunities to be a smart one but opts out. The humor in it is, as humor is wont to be, highly dependent upon taste. People who like stupid comedies might guffaw at it, because to them, humor is best when it's big and bawdy and obvious and makes a lot of noise. In this philosophy of comedy, wackiness is directly proportional to hilarity. The equation is simple, and factors like believability, motivation, and meaning simply don't enter into it. People who like smart comedies might well take a different view of this movie and its trajectory. For them, it's still possible to chuckle, because watching dumb people do spectacularly dumb things has an id-level appeal: it is a common denominator, albeit a very basic one. But there is an irrepressible feeling that the movie ought to do a little more than the bare minimum. It is a movie, after all, not a collection of YouTube videos, and that means it has things like plot and characters. Stupid comedies don't rely on these things beyond their utilitarian functions as links between scenes. Smart comedies, on the other hand, use characters and plot to make something more complex than just a string of goofy vignettes on a theme. If humor is relative then one kind of comedy isn't objectively funnier than the other, but since the latter seems harder to achieve it tends to be more pleasing to the hard-to-please."Vacation" seems torn between an intermittent impulse to use its characters to create one of the many forms of smart comedy, namely satire, and a stronger impulse to confine its characters to the cartoon logic of stupid vignettes. I smiled at the sight of a station wagon full of people going airborne and crashing in the middle of the desert. I'd have smiled at that regardless of whether the family inside was perfect or dysfunctional or made up entirely of animorphic cats. But what I really laughed at came next, when Clark Griswold (dysfunctional human) sits down with his boy (dysfunctional human in training) and tries to give him a coming-of-age, man-to-man talk while his glasses fall apart on his face and he comes up blank on the name of his daughter. This scene is funnier, to me, than the car crash for three reasons. First, it requires characters like Clark who are well- defined enough to earn adjectives like "myopic." Second, it moves the human plot of Clark's descent into madness forward. Third and most impressively, it is a scene whose humor has a recognizable purpose: to satirize (dare I say lampoon?) a real-life target and make it appear foolish. The target is that old-fashioned father-knows-best mentality that was almost beyond question in the 1950s when director Harold Ramis and writer John Hughes were in the kid's position, but that was wide open to attack in the 1980s when they were Clark's age and knew how little they really knew. It is, for my money, the sharpest and funniest moment in the movie.But in "Vacation" such moments of satirical brilliance are the exception. Far more time is devoted to broad hijinks, at best, and to validation of Clark's alpha-male, mid-life-crisis fantasies at worst. The latter is a problem because it undermines the movie's satire and turns the dumb man-child trope into an enviable thing of pride, much the way Homer Simpson shades at times into unironic hero. What are we to make of the Christie Brinkley character, an 80s-type supermodel in a sports car who flirts with Clark despite the fact that he's a thoroughly square middle-aged man with a terrible car and a screaming family? Her motivations are unexamined, but Clark's consequence-free flirtation is depicted in great detail. It's now a movie for people who want to be him, not for people who want to see him taken down a peg. But Clark is not and need not be the movie's only figure of mockery. A gaggle of redneck cousins (including a young Jane Krakowski with one of the movie's most memorable lines) gets it pretty good, too?though this violates the principle that satire ought to punch up to real and self-styled authorities rather than down to the impoverished and unprotected."Vacation" is capable of more thoughtful applications of its comedy, and proves it on occasion, but it generally prefers to be broad, easy, and stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really the classic it's made out to be, but far from a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever people see the words 'National Lampoon' on the cover a new DVD these days, do you think they say, "Awesome! A new comedy classic from these geniuses!"? I think only if they're being sarcastic. It's no secret that their films have been less than spectacular over the last decade and a half and it's a shame. It's a shame because in the 1970s and 80s they gave us some real gems. One of the most popular is this 1983 hit that has since spawned three sequels (I refuse to include the abomination that is 'Christmas Vacation 2') and is still shown on TV every year. At the time it was a hilarious good time, but not all great films stand the test of time. Fortunately, for the most part anyway, this one has held up. It's not as funny or entertaining as I remember, but it's still good fun and a must watch for anyone looking for a few good laughs.Pros: Great concept with a lot of potential. An awesome cast that's in top form here. Some hilarious lines and situations. Great shots of the scenery from the various states and landmarks. Decent pacing. Good score and soundtrack. An excellent directing job by Harold Ramis.Cons: Humor is hit or miss. Pace is uneven at times.Final thoughts: It's a shame when films you loved in your youth aren't as great as you remember when seeing them as an adult, but it happens. For me 'Vacation' is one of those films, but it's in no way a bad one. It's miles ahead of some of the stuff we see now and without it we wouldn't have the sequels to enjoy.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic that never seems to get tiresome. The Griswald family, Clark(Chevy Chase), Ellen(Beverly D'Angelo), Rusty(Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey(Dana Barron), are on the 'Holiday Road' cross-country from Chicago to "Wally World". Histerically funny sequences make the vacation one to remember. My favorites are: the sandwiches being drenched in dog "pee"; Clark falling asleep at the wheel; the vibrating bed; and Aunt Edna(Imogene Cocoa)strapped to the top of the station wagon. Then there is the stop to visit dead beat Cousin Eddie(Randy Quaid). Harlod Ramis directs and co-writes. Other faces you'll remember in the cast: Eugene Levy, John Candy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Jane Krakowski, James Keach and Christie Brinkley. Chase is in top form and just maybe his most memorable role.</fullReview>

The encounters along the way are now classic, some to look for: Chase delirious in the desert, the station wagon launched into the air, the visit to Cousin Eddie's (a perfectly slobby Quaid) and the chick in the red ferrari. Maybe writer John Hughes driest script, with dead dogs and dead aunts tied various places, picnic baskets wet with the grossest of liquids, and a great foul mouthed response from Chase to his whiny family. 3 (so far) sequels have followed, which was good for Chase, seeing how this was his only real memorable character ('cept maybe for Fletch). And a testament to the films popularity: Wally Joyner, a baseball player for the California Angels who was enjoying a great rookie year in 1986, had the stadium he played in decked out in "Wally World" (the familys destination) signs by fans. So a big hit all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly benign comedy occasionally spiked with toilet humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chevy Chase excels as bland suburban family man Clark Griswold, high on taking his family on a cross-country vacation by car. Their ultimate destination: Walley World. A touchstone movie for many viewers growing up in the '80s, "Vacation" is probably more funny and outrageous in retrospect than the actual film itself. Episodes with gross cousin Eddie and cantankerous Aunt Edna don't really build much comic momentum at the time, but the wobbly jokes have a sneaky way of catching up to you after the movie's over. Hurt overall by a tame final reel (apparently the result of some hasty re-shooting), the tone of the picture is sweetly banal, and if not for some R-rated gags it would be the perfect family comedy. Followed by a bushel of sequels, none of which equaled the nimble comedic touches of this first installment. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vaction is about the Griswold family traveling across the USA to visit wally world only to encounter unfortunate hilarious events at every turn. Based on the magazine lampoon by John Huges it starred snl alumni Chevy Chase as the lead man and was a box office success.For good reason as the scenes are very thought out from the psycho reference when Helen takes a shower to Clark wandering the desert to find a mechanic and finds his family had been picked up and worried about him.There's a lot of heart in the script from good natured Clark who only wants his family to enjoy themselves and has little moments to share with each member recalling stories from his youth. Angela D'Angelo (Helen) plays the head strong supportive wife who stands by her man and builds up his confidence. Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron (Audrey and Rusty) are surprisingly talented for young stars not once over reacting or obnoxious. Each character felt fleshed out and served a purpose without being filler.The music always got the scene, sometimes adding to the humor, and was catchy.Wallyworld a play on Disneyland was a fantastic ending full of magic, rides and even an appearance from Toy Disney as Roy Wally, lol.Vacation is a treat for the while family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting Away From It All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The noble all American pursuit of taking your family on vacation (or holiday as we call it in the UK); that is the ultimate aim of Clark Griswold. Chevy Chase is Clark Griswold, in one of those roles which is so identified with one actor. He's such a family man in an extreme yet subtly comic way, with is repressed frustration making him a ticking time bomb. He's a proponent of the American dream if there ever was one, an unashamedly white Anglo Saxon protestant who takes family ideals a little too far at times.Vacation is my favourite John Hughes movie, and a very American movie at that. You can't do this in the UK; here you can hop in your car and you will be at the other end of the country in a day. It seems like the idea of a road trip was designed for the vast open country of the United States in which you drive for days on end. However the theme of vacation (or holiday) frustration is relatable to anyone who has been on vacation. As Clark puts it, "When I was a boy just about every summer we would take a vacation, and you know in 18 years, we never had fun". Even the most out there jokes such as the car still moving while Clark has fallen asleep at the wheel or the death of the aunt still manage to feel relatable to some degree and remain grounded in reality.Road movies give some of the best opportunity to create great mounts of character development, and I feel there are few other writers in cinema history who had the ability to generate so much character development within such a short space of time than John Hughes; and like The Blues Mobile of The Blues Brothers, the car in Vacation is a character itself. As seen in many of Hughes' film, the kids and/or young people are fully sexually aware (In Vacation Rusty's cousin teaches him about masturbation for the first time), which I find liberating to watch as Hughes is a writer who treats young people like adults with themes which were explored further in films like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Sigh, why wasn't I a child of the 80's?Vacation is one of the most summery movies; watch it during the cold months of the year to escape the winter blues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely funny - and influential - American comedy of the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION is the first and undoubtedly the best of the NATIONAL LAMPOON series, a genuinely funny road movie with strong performances and first-rate direction from GHOSTBUSTERS star Harold Ramis. The plot adopts a simple journey narrative and one which would be repeated for the sequel European VACATION; the long-suffering Griswold family go from place to place, wreaking havoc all the while.There's a strong mixture of different types of humour here, from end-of-their-tether character laughs to slapstick gags and plenty of wisecracks and innuendo. Much of the humour is witty and it also has a fairly dark edge that makes it stand out from the usual John Hughes-scripted family fare, particularly the bits with Randy Quaid, the dog, and the aunt. The movie belongs to Chevy Chase, who is very entertaining in the lead role, but there are a handful of supporting performers who don't disappoint either. Beverly D'Angelo, in a MUCH racier role than she played in the sequels, sparks off Chase very well, and there's a late-stage cameo from John Candy which continues to delight. In fact, there's very little to dislike overall about this popular '80s comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedies! I have to admit that I was surprised by how watchable the remake was, but it can't top the original. It's weird, because I'm not a Chevy Chase fan, but he's so good in this movie. I always laugh watching him do stupid things. There are so many classic moments in this movie that I don't know where to begin. I'll just start by how good the cast is. As I said, Chevy Chase is fantastic. Beverly D'Angelo is cute as a button here. I thought she was really good. Anthony Michael Hall &amp; Dana Barron are both great as the kids, especially Michael Hall. Randy Quaid is a show stealer. I can't forget Imogene Coca's performance as Aunt Edna. I felt bad for her. You can't be a true fan of comedies if you haven't seen this movie. If you're looking for a lot of belly laughs, you'll get plenty of them by watching this movie. It's a classic!P.SI'll never forget Christine Brinkley in the Ferrari. She's one of the most gorgeous women you'll ever see!8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remains fun stuff, still, and I deem it the best installment of the 'Vacation' series. It's pretty straightforward American comedy stuff, but here and there, there are some sharp observations about American life (and life in general, I suppose) and some bits are pretty nasty or dark; let's put aunt Edna (dead) on the roof of the car or leave her hanging dead in a chair with a relative, forget to unhook the dog from the car and drive for a while, aunt Edna who doesn't mind eating a sandwich which was micturated (Imdb's 'auto-correct' seems to think this word does not exist...) upon by the dog, etc., etc..Chevy Chase is perhaps a love-or-hate actor, but I think he's excellent for this type of job. Beverly D'Angelo is also perfect for her role, and, out of the various duos that have played son Rusty and daughter what's-her-name Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are probably the best (although Juliette Lewis was pretty damn good, too). And, of course, good old Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie - irreplaceable. And there's plenty more little fun parts.A big 9 out of 10 for this ever funny classic. And I don't mind at all that 'Holiday road' pops into my head on whatever occasion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.This movie is silly and some elitists deplore it. But it consists of one great scene after another, with lots of good gags, good pacing, and good performances, especially by Michael Anthony Hall. Supporting players Imogene Coca and John Candy also turn in good performances, and Chevy Chase is better than usual. Some reviewers take issue with a scene here or an off-color joke there, but fail to judge the movie as a whole. Don't fall into that trap. If you liked Caddy Shack or Airplane or even Married With Children, you will like Vacation. If you've never seen it, then look for it (it's often on TV), and enjoy. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind Of An 80's Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this (road)movie still do elicit some laughter, from time to time. It sometimes feel aged, and the slapstick humor is typical 80's. Greatest earnings is from the well enthusiastic players, well aware of the easy-going comedy stuff America bought then.Chevy Chase will always be Chevy Chase in the history log of movies. My personal relation to his way of act and play is splitting my mind in half: Funny when intended not to, silly when trying to improvise with some mambo jumbo, taken out of context, outside script. OK, that was/is part of the man's talent, I know. I know. The Griswald character couldn't have been performed by any other, that's for sure....Money well spent all the way? I've read that John Candy was hired for the final scenes - and minutes - he appears on screen, for a million bucks. True or false, that's Hollywood in a nutshell...but by the sponsoring of some fancy clothing companies you can afford it. (Lots of screen time for -at the time- jeans fashion giant Jordache, and sports polo shirt classics from Lacoste.)The famous station wagon is a chapter of it's own; only in America you could afford the fuel account of such trip, getting the whole gallon for the same price as Europeans paid for a quarter of it in this era. (Bet that big locomotive only moved ten miles per gallon...)As I said in the beginning, this raw model 80's comedy still does it when you are in the right mood, but feels a little aged. (My personal favorite scene is at the gas station, Chevy not able to find the hatch to fill up the car, watching a nearby car flipping up the rear license plate. Then violently tears of his plate, very soon to find out that such business is taken care of in front...)Randy Quaid does the sleazy kin guy very well; one can imagine having such relatives. A good part of the movie. The enforced aunt - or whatever she was - brought out some laughs too.I fell in love with the beautiful Beverly D'Angelo the first time I saw her, then appearing in the first "Clyde"-movie, famous anti-Clint Eastwood comedy "Every Which Way But Loose", starring Clint Eastwood... Pretty as a picture and a darn good actress; completes Chevy Chase with honor.Though I (sometimes) hate the fabricated sequel in Europe, it always reminds me of the solid quality this movie partly contains.The two final(?) Griswald movies are to me just flicks of bricks in an unfinished wall waiting to get the worthily ending.Watching some old Chevy Chase movies in present time, you will explore that the art of improvisation of that kind is quite dead in comedies nowadays.To me, he will always stand out as the man who joined late Andy Kaufman's way of comedy, and became the worthy inheritor of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generation and Subgenre-Spanning Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant comedic melting pot, mixing screenwriter John Hughes's heartfelt, vivid knowledge of life in the middle class with director Harold Ramis's biting sarcasm and National Lampoon's off-color brand of dirty humor. Chevy Chase is perfect as the everyman dad, easily his most identifiable role, who's out to show his family a good time come hell or high water on the mother of all bad road trips. The ensemble cast, speckled with cameos from several SCTV alums, elevates an already-rich premise into something even greater than the sum of its parts. Some of the puns are a dated product of the early 80s, but others are nothing short of timeless, and they all hit harder than an eighteen-wheeler. Legendary comedy from some of the best, I was wiping tears away during some of the best bits despite already knowing them by heart. Could've done with a less abrupt, bizarre finale but I can overlook that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wickedly Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vacation" was Harold Ramis' second movie as a director and John Hughes third as a writer, and it was a huge step forward for both of them (Ramis' debut "Caddyshack" achieved cult status thanks to memorable performances and standout scenes, but the movie as a whole was a complete mess). Vacation is a terrific comedy, one of the best to come out of the National Lampoon brand; Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo deliver perfect comedic performances, making all the visual gags as well as the sharp script work very well, despite various jokes which have become clichés since and quite a few that were clichés to begin with. The timing and pacing are good enough to make even those work.My only real complaint about Vacation - and it greatly hindered my enjoyment - is about jarring moral dissonance in the main character. It became very clear to me in the dog scene that Clark isn't someone I can sympathize with. That scene may be the most revolting and least funny in the movie, as it's played horrifically straight; and Clark gets off extremely easily. In fact, throughout the movie, the more horrible he is, the more it seems Ramis and Hughes are trying to make him look sympathetic. It's especially evident when Clark's wife catches him - not flirting - but skinny dipping with a strange girl, and forgives him completely several minutes later; and in the tacked on ending, when he gets off completely scot-free from actions that should land him in jail and traumatize his children. Clark's family seemingly forgives everything, and it's apparent that we as viewers are meant to do the same. To be clear - the problem is not with an unsympathetic protagonist or black comedy by themselves, but with lack of decision from the writer and director, who zig-zag between violent black humor and wholesome family comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic Chevy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could choose one movie that best represents what Chevy Chase and his brand of humor is all about, I'd probably go with "National Lampoon's Vacation". Chevy's own career often seemed to reflect the fortunes of his hapless alter-ego here, Clark Griswald, as many of his subsequent films were flops. So as much as I have always liked Chevy, I have never felt that he really had a lot of control or interest in the quality of his own work post-Saturday NIght Live. Its as though his on screen persona - aloof, disinterested, wise-assed, etc was also his real life persona. Also, Chevy was born into a lot of wealth and probably really didn't need the money. So all this I think spelled trouble for much of his film career. "Vacation" is possibly the best of the lot, and even here, there are times when he goes beyond comedy and lapses into behavior that just seems absurd for the sake of being absurd. But overall, "Vacation" is a funny film and it should touch anyone who has found themselves in similar circumstances while "on the road".OK, Chevy is Clark Griswald, a nerdy husband to Beverly D'Angelo and a father of two. The family lives in Chicago but want to drive to "Wally World" in Southern California for a few weeks of fun and rides. To get there, he buys an absurdly built "family truckster" (station wagon), packs the bags and off they go on their family vacation.Once outside of Chicago, problems surface immediately. Everything is terra incognito to Clark as he bumbles his way across farmland and prairie. The standard schtick is that he claims to be in control of everything thats going on, but he really doesn't have a clue. He makes things up and lies if he has to. Beverly D'angelo knows this. His kids know it. So ultimately, the joke is always on him despite how hard he tries to act casual and remain "in command". Sometimes, the result is great comedy. Other times, its a little absurd. But mostly you will enjoy and possibly relate to what they are going through as they wind their way to California. But once they depart Kansas and head to Colorado and Arizona, the movie starts to fall apart for me. Clark's bumbling and antics start to go over the top, and that peaks when they stay at a hotel in Arizona where Clark meets a mysterious blonde (Christie Brinkley) who seems to be following the family across the country. Also, there is a subplot involving an older relative (Imogene Cocoa) that borders on bad taste. So what started out as kind of a cute and funny film begins to escalate into absurdity and anger as Clark begins to get on EVERYONE"S nerves, including my own. In fact, you almost want to strangle him at some points. Its not the jokes with bad taste so much as the fact that his growing incompetence makes those jokes less funny. There is a balancing act going on here, and at some point, he crosses the line. For example, Beverly's "as long as you don't tie me to a bumper" line in reference to an incident earlier where Clark accidentally kills his cousin's dog, takes the shine off of the comedy and starts to turn it into something darker and less enjoyable.Anyway, but before they reach California, though, there is one more funny scene where they get lost and crash the car near Monument Valley, Arizona. Clark's "father to son" talk here is a classic, and he follows that with a dash through the desert looking for a gas station. When they recover the car later and Clark is lashed by an attendant for his stupidity in thinking he could find a gas station in the desert, he replies "well, I'm from out of town", another classic Chevyism. So that to me was a funny scene, and oh well, then we hit California...beyond that I probably should shut up or else I could be writing a spoiler here. Suffice it to say, things don't go well at Wally World either...and once again Clark's antics go over the top for me.But "vacation" is still a funny film worth checking out if you are a comedy fan. If you know and like Chevy, you will like the movie. And then I will close with one lingering question that always resurfaces for me every time I see this movie. The question is:"Would you dump Beverly D'Angelo for Christie Brinkley???"I dunno.......I really don't know...</fullReview>

We had several Griswaldean experiences on the road, Clarke reminds me of how my father used to act on the road. Thank god for GPS. Christy Brinkley was all over my wall as a kid, she still looks great. John Hughes was in tuned with American family life in the 80's, most of his movies are on target and are still very watchable.

		<shortDescription>National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) - The Griswolds are Heading for Wally World!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"National Lampoon's Vacation" has been wildly considered as one of the most classic comedies of the 1980s. Harold Ramis directs this hilarious tale starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold, who plan a 2-week cross-country road trip to California with their kids. From then on, tons of unexpected situations and shenanigans occur. This is one of my favorite comedy movies for many reasons. This movie kept me laughing my buttocks off, from start to finish. This movie just brings out laugh after laugh, and I can't stop laughing. Chevy Chase delivers the most hilarious performance of his career playing the father who is determined to give his family the best vacation ever. He has is best moments and always makes me laugh, so if Chevy Chase is not in this 80s classic, then you don't have Chevy Chase in this 80s classic. This all-star cast includes Anthony Michael Hall, Randy Quaid, Dana Barron, Imogene Coca, John Candy, and Christie Brinkley. They all made performances that really made this low-budget comedy. This movie has the funniest lines, funniest characters, funniest plot, and funniest situations. There are also some familiar moments from the crappy car, the girl in the Ferrari, the car crash in the Grand Canyon, and the annoying Aunt Edna. I can watch this movie over and over again, and I still laugh every time. To keep this review short, if you don't laugh at this classic movie, then you are a total failure at life. "National Lampoon's Vacation", in my review, "a fun and entertaining comedy, a true classic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The feel good movie of the eighties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one movie that is one of the all-time feel good movies it's definitely National Lampoon's Vacation. It's a work of comedy gold as the lead character, the iconic Clark Griswold (Chase), tries simply to give his family a successful and fun vacation. It turns into a problematic joy ride that rarely lets up.Everyone has a Clark Griswold. He's a charming guy, great smile, calm tone, and a wish to make everyone happy. Clark is married to his wonderful wife Ellen (D'Angelo), and has two kids Rusty (Michael Hall) and Audrey (Barron) who would later become America's family in the three sequels. Clark and his family want to go to Wally World to see Marty Moose and spend some quality family time. But so much goes wrong it sends them into a downward spiral into insanity.What happens, I won't spoil. Many have seen it, but it's not fun reading about their antics. Watching them on a Television is so much funnier and the right way to do it. The fact that the characters are so desperate for one simple thing, but can't get to it is hilarious. The characters aren't laughing at what happens which is good. They shouldn't feel like they're putting on a show for us. They are concerned about their well being, not if the audience is laughing.The family is fun and well developed. I appreciate every actor who played both Rusty and Audrey and found them to be fit and capable of pulling the job off. As for Clark and Ellen, by the second movie they proved to us they were irreplaceable. Chevy Chase can't be replaced, neither can Beverly D'Angelo. It's just not possible.I've always had a place in my heart for the Wally World Scene. It is arguably John Candy's funniest and most memorable role in movie history next to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Not to mention, Clark's unexpected yet hilarious outbursts are always something to look forward to in the series.Followed up by two decent sequels, and a hilarious and underrated closure that is Vegas Vacation, the Vacation franchise is forever etched into my heart as a work of comedy genius. It's not only a brilliantly crafted, but it is the poster child for how to make a successful comedy. Don't act like you're putting on a show for somebody, act natural and act how you would if it were real.Starring: Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall, Dana Barron, Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy, and John Candy.

		<shortDescription>Back when "National Lampoon" meant something...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1983, so many of the crises we deal with today like they're just common events didn't really hit the first so called "yuppies" in nearly the same fun killing manner. Enter the Griswold clan. Father Clark, played by Chevy Chase, the first celebrity spewed out from "SNL", mom played by the wonderful Beverly D'Angelo, children (Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall in this original excursion) and temptress in a hot red sports car, the one and only Christie Brinkley.Chevy has a well earned reputation for being nasty to his co-stars (especially when returning to host "SNL"), but here he's on good behaviour, in the film (for the most part) and the definitely worth listening to commentary track. D'Angelo isn't one of the voices guiding us on that recording, but her beautiful singing voice in the film itself almost makes up for that absence. Too bad there weren't karaoke clubs back then, so her character could belt out a number every ten minutes or so. She really is that good!"National Lampoon" used to invoke terror of the comic kind in parents who didn't get the humour their children were experiencing from the likes of Doug Kenney, Michael O'Donoghue, Peter Beard and others. Now, "NL" has all the brand intimidation of cat litter, as it's banner has gone from "Animal House" and this gem to the most insipid and run of the mill "raunch", with non talents like Paris Hilton taking up space that should be reserved for actual actors.The 80s get an unfairly bad rap when it comes to film. But any decade has it's great and not so great, as a full ten years is a long time! "Vacation" is the kind of flick I like to check out again when it pops up late at night or I feel like watching a piece of smart "dumb" entertainment. The sequels don't really do it for me (the second in this series in particular). But the original keeps it's kooky charm over the passage of time, making us wish we could go to "Wallyworld" when there aren't any lines to wait in for the rides!</fullReview>

He is such a doofus and screws up the trip in some way in every film. But you know what, he's hilarious. That's probably why she hasn't left him yet. In the first, and the last, he ends up hitting on women. Actually, I think that it happens in at least 3/4 of the films. It's kind of irritating, but I can deal with it.

The journey involves doing idiotic things and meeting more idiotic family members. None of them funny or even remotely close to being funny. How this spawned a bunch of sequels and what is basically a remake is beyond me. I won't give this film an excuse of it might have been good back then because airplane and blazing saddles are older and funnier, watch them instead.

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to movies like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My grandfather showed my brother, sister and I the National Lampoon Christmas movie and ever since then we've been really into the series. Vacation is the latest one I've seen, featuring a parody of Disney World (Walley World) and a jerky but well-meaning man trying his best to drive his family across the country. Unfortunately they automatically fall into misfortune; their poor reliable old car is traded in to a sleazy dealership for a newer model and squashed flat, and the dealership sells them an inferior pea-green station wagon (not at all what they ordered). They make a pit stop at their redneck cousins' place, where a misfit family of hillbillies and farmers introduce Audrey Griswold to some rather disturbing lifestyles... Audrey is given a purse of weed and rolled joints from her cousin and learns about the family's inbreeding, and the Griswold family gets the surprise (and unwanted task) of driving their crabby old aunt Edna and her nasty dog with them in the backseat to be dropped off in Phoenix. As things usually go for the Griswold family, their bad luck can only get worse, providing a load of entertainment through the whole movie.My question is, what happened to movies like this? Vacation is a genuinely funny and entertaining movie. Most movies like this today are full of gross sex jokes and fart jokes (R.V. from 2006 for example). The families in movies today are silly, lazy and clones of everything trendy right now, leaving them hard to relate to, and the soundtrack for them is terrible. Vacation has very few sex jokes (the ones it does have are very subtle), no fart jokes, some swearing, but nothing that would take away from enjoying the movie the way movies today have become. The soundtrack to Vacation is so catchy and nostalgic (I wish music was as good today as t was back then), the family is just your average middle-class family, easy to relate to, and the acting was excellent (they even got John Candy to play a small role as the overweight security guard). Unlike most movies today, which rely on fart jokes to get laughs from their audiences, Vacation improvises with various antics that could happen to any family. If a time machine was invented right now, I'd gladly pack my bags and go straight to 1983 to avoid the stupidity of society today.Sometimes you just want a simple, hilarious, entertaining little movie to watch at any time of the year and Vacation definitely fits the profile. Watching it is like living through your old family home videos and Super-8 recordings (or camcorder videos if you grew up in a later time, although I was born in the Nineties my family always used older home video equipment). It's hard not to love the misfit Griswold family and there have been some other movies of their adventures out there but Vacation is the best way to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chevy Chase &amp; Beverly D'Angelo play Clark &amp; Ellen Griswold, a happily married couple with two teenage kids, who take a long-planned vacation to Wally World, a famous amusement park, but their efforts to get there do not go as planned, and almost end in disaster...Probably Chevy Chase's most likable performance, he is mostly appealing here, helped by the beautiful Beverly D'Angelo, also good. A more successful variation of "The-Out-Of-Towners" school of escalating chaos, film is reasonably funny and engaging, though does become crude and silly at times. Twist at the end when they meet John Candy is quite funny, and help end the film on the right note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sequels Were Better, But You Have To Appreciate That This Is Where The Griswolds Began</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have some time to waste, any of the movies in the National Lampoon "Vacation" series is worth killing some time with. Chevy Chase knew the part of Clark Griswold and always managed to capture the character bang-on. Beverley D'Angelo as his long-suffering wife Ellen also hit the ground running in her first stab at the character. (I was a bit surprised to see her do two topless scenes in this - one fairly close-up in the shower, the other from a distance at the hotel pool.) As far as I know, Chase and D'Angelo are the only actors to have been in all 4 movies. This initial chapter in the series spawned three sequels (European Vacation, Christmas Vacation and Vegas Vacation.) Of the four in the series I have to say that my favourite (for various reasons) was Christmas Vacation. Interestingly, given that sequels tend to go on a downward spiral in terms of quality, I thought this initial chapter was perhaps the weakest of the four movies - still good for a laugh, but not as funny as the others (certainly I'd rank "Christmas" and "Vegas" ahead of it.)Here, Clark decides to take his family (somewhat against their will) on a drive from Chicago to California to go to "Walley World" - a National Lampoon spoof on the Disney World theme parks. They have the assorted adventures along the way that you expect, including the requisite time spent with Cousin Eddy (Randy Quaid) and his family - cousin Eddy is always one of my favourite characters in the series. It's good fun. What weakened it (in my opinion at least) was that Clark seemed less lovable (if you will) in this movie. Maybe it was just the way that the character evolved, but in his initial outing he seems harder, he spews a lot of foul language (even in front of his kids) and there are a number of scenes where he just doesn't seem like the Clark Griswold who appears in the later movies. There were also too many unnecessary characters (or, at least, characters whose place went on far too long.) I didn't care for Aunt Edna. I thought Christie Brinkley's unnamed character was humorous for one scene, but she kept appearing everywhere the Griswold's went - she started to seem as creepy as a stalker after a while. And John Candy's security guard at Walley World was too over the top. He wasn't a believable character at all - and watching the Griswold's ride the roller coasters with him got really old really fast.So, this is my least favourite of the "Vacation" series. I can't be too hard on it though. It spawned three very funny sequels, and for whatever shortcomings it may have it still packs a few laughs of its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh, darkly funny film, when a family vacation goes completely wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase) always wanted to have an great vacation with his wife (Beverly D'Angelo) and their two kids (Anthony Michael Hall &amp; Dana Barron). Since Clark thinks that he doesn't have any time with his family, he decides to take them in a vacation from Chicago to California. Clark and his family are going to Wally World!, a Disney-like theme park. Once they start on a road trip cross-country from their home turns into a complete disaster. Every state they cross, it's turns bad to worse. Especially when Clark is forced to drive his mean-spirited aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) to Pheonix, after visiting their odd-ball Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and their family. Only thing that lifts Clark's spirits is a mysterious young woman (Christie Brinkley) that Clark's occasionally sees on the road, while she driving an red Ferrari.Directed by Harold Ramis (Bedazzled "2000", Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) made an enjoyable silly comedy with a dark edge. Chase appears in one of his best roles as a naive family man, who does his best with his family to have a fun time in the film. This was one of the most popular comedies of the 1980's and it went on to have three sequels. Which "Christmas Vacation" is the best of the four films. This has some great comedic lines, especially the scene where Chase has an nervous breakdown in the car after the death of a key character in the movie. This has an memorable use of Lindsey Buckingham's song "Holiday Road" in some scenes in the movie.The 20th anniversary DVD edition is good. DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby 1.0 Mono Sound. The highlight of the DVD is the enjoyable audio commentary track by the director, producer Matty Simmons, actors:Chase, Quaid, Barron and Hall. It is interesting to hear them talk about the film, especially when they mention the original darker ending. Which sadly, it is not in the 20th anniversary edition. But it will probably see the light of day on a future Blu-ray release. DVD also has mini-featurettes, original theatrical trailer and introduction by Simmons, Chase &amp; Quaid. This is one of Chase's best comedies and also one of Ramis' best movies as well. Quaid is a hoot in a small memorable role and as well for Brinkley as the girl of Griswold's dreams. Many familiar faces appears in cameos and bit-parts like the late John Candy, the late Eddie Bracken, Brain-Doyle Murray, Mirian Flynn, James Keach, Eugene Levy, Jane Krakowski and more. This is a terrible vacation not to be missed. Written by John Hughes (The Breakfest Club, Home Alone, Uncle Buck). Which Hughes adapted from his short story "Vacation'58" from the "National Lampoon" magazine. Followed by three sequels. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Step right up with the Griswold family, &amp; go on a trip to Wally World to see Roy Wally &amp; his cast at a fantastic theme park in California. Yes, this is a thinly disguised family trip to Disneyland. It's a lot funnier though when you put Director Harol Ramis (Ghostbusters, Ground Hog Day) together with Clark (Chevy Chase) Griswold &amp; his assorted family &amp; characters.Clark sets up a vacation in which everything goes wrong on the way. The material is so funny that it's theme &amp; jokes are borrowed in 2006 film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and won an Academy Award for best original script. Does this mean that this film would win the award for that if it came out last year? The trip in this film &amp; the borrowing of it reminds me most of when the Griswolds have an accident that disables the car &amp; the guys at the small town garage charge Clark (my favorite Clark Griswold quote) "$450 dollars for 4 bald tires &amp; a tow." The film also addresses every middle aged married mans fantasy of being hit on by a drop dead gorgeous 20+ year old blonde that is built like a dream while also having a foxy little blonde wife too.I wouldn't mind doing stupid things myself to wind up in Clarks shoes. Of course he might be smart enough to take advantage of the situation or maybe not. The happenings at Wally World are a hoot &amp; a good time, so this film never really lets you down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's a "Cult" Movie ? It's a movie that supports a lot of viewing &amp; with each one, you'll discover something new or you notice something that you don't have in mind when you think about the best moments of the movie.So I took this "Holiday Road" a lot of times, and the last time, was still a great pleasure: With the time passing, the American 80's is felt everywhere: the cute family, the cars, the gangsta rap, the wild west, video games &amp; pop music! In one movie, you got all the funny face of America! I rediscovered also some "forgotten" best moments (ah, the night driving!!!!).The really strengths of the movie are its writing (it isn't a simple addition of scenes, but there is really a deep flow for disaster) &amp; its exceptional casting: Chevy Chase is wonderful as a man who always want to save his face. Beverly d'Angelo plays a wife who isn't naive but supportive as well, and the kids are divided between their maturity &amp; their childish attitudes.In conclusion, a true Cult movie! Maybe we wouldn't live such vacations, but as an audience, we would see movies like this every time !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes! If you only take one "Vacation" in your life, this is the best one ever! Chevy Chase never misses a beat as the "square" dad, trying to treat his family to a little fun going to Wally World, while they encounter every conceivable mishap along the way! I love this movie so much because I always resented family vacations!Most of us can remember having to put up with the noisy kids, the smelly stuffy car rides, visiting the hated relatives, and stopping at all the stupid sites along the way! Not to mention that I used to have a neighbor that looked exactly like Chevy Chase in this movie and he made a big ritual out of taking the kids every other week to all these little "Mickey Mouse" attractions, and he always got more excited than his kids ever did! LOL! So it really hit home for me and my own family.This is a movie that is pure fun because it relates to potentially realistic family situations and those family vacations that became disasters that we would love to forget. My favorite scenes are: Clark asking for directions and the hoodlums stealing the tires off the "Family Truckster." Clark's eulogy for Aunt Edna. (One of the funniest scenes ever!) All the scenes with Cousin Eddie! Especially the "Red-Neck" etiquette in offering someone a beer, and the family eating "Helper" outside!Note that Vacation must really be seen on the Premium Cable channels or rented on tape/DVD to seriously be appreciated. It's R-rated, but could probably pass for a PG-13 if released today. Too many classic scenes are cut on standard cable and the old network broadcast airings. Yes, Clark drops several F-bombs at once when he loses it, shortly after Edna's "eulogy." But other than that, I think it would be OK for teens to see. There is nothing really bad, language-wise that kids haven't heard at school. Furthermore, so much of the humor is lost in the censored versions.Take some time off and do yourself a favor. Go on this VACATION!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation (more properly known as National Lampoon's Vacation) is a great film that started a successful film series (including the great Christmas Vacation). Chevy Chase in the lead role of Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. is spot-on hilarious with Beverly D'Angelo equally funny as Ellen Griswold. But really, it is Randy Quaid as Uncle Eddie and especially Imogene Coca as Aunt Edna who steal the show. Watch out for these funny supporting characters who pop up throughout the film as the Griswolds do a cross-country drive to try to get to the WallyWorld Theme Park (for some reason, every time I hear Walley World, I think Wonder World from Beverly Hills Cop III!). This is truly a funny film, a solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies of all-time (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dig 80s comedies. The vast majority of them are foul-mouthed, filthy-minded and completely gratuitous. They're definitely nearer the knuckle than the recent spate of 'gross out' comedies, because although recent comedies (American Pie for instance) may be more scatological, they have a tendency to end in mawkish sentimentality ? they're more conservative than they like to think. 80s comedies, on the other hand, by and large, are far more cynical, which is the way I like it.One of the best of these 80s comedies is National Lampoon's Vacation. On the surface is seems quite conventional ? all-American family take a trip across country. But while it could have been banal in the extreme (being trapped in a car with your family for a fortnight is an ordeal; how insightful!) it has a magnificent streak of cruel humour that makes it rather subversive. For instance, you have a dog being dragged to its death, a cruel old woman copping it and a father who goes insane and punches a moose. It's far funnier than anything Hollywood has produced recently.And it's the meltdown of Clark Griswold that makes me laugh the most. I especially like his reaction to the inconsiderate way that Aunt Edna dies. He just ties her to the luggage rack. And why not? Dotty old relatives are never (as films would have you believe) delightfully quirky or fountains of wisdom. They're much more like they are here: human tumours. So I'm with Clark when he strings Aunt Edna to the luggage rack ? he didn't ask for her to come, so he gets to choose how she leaves. And I love his insincere prayer and his reaction to Aunt Edna's son not being at home when he comes to drop the corpse off. "Normie's always been flighty." "He's always been a jag-off." And I love the scene where he says that he's on a quest for fun. When you've come that far, you don't just expect fun, you demand it.Which, of course, makes the fun park scenes even more amusing. Fun is going to be had by whatever means necessary. Although, I'm not sure if Chevy Chase enjoyed going on all those roller coasters. In one scene he actually turns green. But the punching out of the moose and Clark shooting John Candy in the arse with a BB gun are moments of comedy genius.Next in terms of amusement would probably be the scenes with the girl in the Ferrari. It just amuses me how unrelentingly horny Clark is ? even nerds were oversexed in 80s films. And it cracks me up the way that Clark's car struggles to keep up with the girl ? the car literally bounces. And the way that Clark fantasises about being in the Ferrari too is genius. Plus you can't beat flirting with a soiled sandwich. And, I have to admit, that Christine Brinkley brings back fond memories of raging adolescent hormones. Although it was to my eternal frustration that the end promise of her poolside striptease went unfulfilled? (But by way of compensation the film has a rather lacklustre Psycho parody that is only there to show the audience some skin. It's completely gratuitous. Of course, I heartily endorse its inclusion.) Not far behind in the pecking order of favourite scenes are those with Cousin Eddie. It's further evidence that hicks are a valuable source of comedy relief. I mean, a girl born without a tongue, a man with a steel plate in his head, a kid with a bountiful supply of bongo mags ("And I use them a lot." "How d'you use a magazine?" Oh, how naive you are Ruben. Er, I mean, Rusty.) and a girl who French kisses her father. What's not to like? And I also fell over laughing when I noticed that Eddie has a string belt ? after five hundred viewings, I've only just noticed it. And you also have the white shoes, the Kool Aid, Eddie's barbecuing, Aunt Edna ("You were the ones that sent me the fruitcake for Christmas. It made me so sick.") and Dinky. No moment is wasted.Indeed, it speaks for how funny the film is when even the little moments crack me up. There's a bit when Clark is on the pirate ship, holding a gun to John Candy, and you see him looking suspiciously back and forth ? it's absolutely nothing but it made me laugh. And there's Clark's strut when he dives into the pool with the Ferrari girl (I also like the way that he jumps into the pool with his socks on), Clark's fake tears when he's telling Roy Walley about Aunt Edna, Eugene Levy's face at the start when Clark pulls into his dealership, Davenport's deadpan reactions (I'd like to see 'Davenport: The Movie'), the dog barking at the end of 'Holiday Road', the black pimp he tries to get directions from, the dog getting yanked back when the asleep Clark almost runs it over, the way that the camping site is called 'Kamp Komfort' and lines like: "The bed was very soft." The film's just hilarious. Not only is it one of the best comedies of the 80s, it's one of the best comedies full stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tasteless but very funny Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Griswold, the world's worst family guy, takes his family on a cross country trip where everything goes wrong.This is one of those comedies that gets better with repeated viewings. The outrageous, and often completely tasteless, humour goes down better once it's digested properly. Chase's sickening obsession with everyone having to enjoy themselves is a wonder to behold, he will go to any lengths to complete this mess of a journey.The film goes completely overboard and that actually works in the film's favour. The ultimate fate of Aunt Edna is hilarious, but also one of the more shameless jokes I can remember. Randy Quaid, as cousin Eddie, is completely revolting (and judging by a comment made by his daughter, a beyond loathsome) character but he's very funny none the less, Quaid milking the character for all it's worth.The script is very witty at times, throwing in countless below the belt humour (animal cruelty anyone) but unfortunately some gags here miss completely and go on way too long. The ending is also a bit too silly for my taste.Still, the film has more things going for it than against it. Chase is a comic genius here and his Clark Griswold is one of the funniest characters ever in comedies. In my opinion the Vacation series hit their peak with Christmas Vacation, but this film should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chevy Chase truly became one of the true comedy actors of the 80ties, as Jim Carrey did to the 90ties and Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson/Jack Black is doing to the 2000ties. Here he starts in one of his most succeeding movies, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION is truly a comedy classic with all the mixtures that makes the belly laugh ring.The Griswold family sets out on a car vacation heading across the US to get to Walley World where they can enjoy themselves, that's all. And on the trip things really doesn't go their way; the family dad Clark falls in love with a highway-beauty in a Ferrari, they team up with the irritating grandmother and so on. The movie is enjoyable, it truly is. Whether it is on it's most entertaining or most classic, it's for-filling the comedy genre with happenings and dialogs worth memorable.Lindsey Buckingham fills out the soundtrack with two tracks, making the movie hunt like a wolf and attacking very vital with it's great comedy aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "National Lampoon's Vacation", Chevy Chase did what may have been his funniest role ever. As all-American dad Clark Griswold, he, his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their two children have a miserable time while driving from Chicago to theme park Walley World. Probably the funniest scenes are the mishap in Arizona, Clark's peccadillo in the motel, and the grand finale. Some great supporting moments come from Imogene Coca as crotchety Aunt Edna, Randy Quaid as obnoxious Cousin Eddie, Christie Brinkley as a woman who catches Clark's eye (and then some) and John Candy as a security guard. There quite literally isn't a dull moment anywhere in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1980s B-grade comedy at its most... average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Vacation series has taken on a kind of inverse version of the Star Trek series rule, in that the odd-numbered Vacations are the best. The original Vacation is the best, although Christmas Vacation gave it a good run for its money. Both films are incredibly dated, but it is the savage lack of restraint or political correctness in the original that makes it worth repeat viewings. 1983 was a great year for comedies that were unafraid of being labelled as being in bad taste, and director Harold Ramis had already proved his mettle on Caddyshack, one of the finest films ever made about golf. Paired with such fine actors as Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid, there was precious little that could go wrong here. When it does go wrong, the audience is too busy laughing at the other ninety nine instances where the cast and crew get it right to care. Unlike many other comedies where jokes are deleted because they didn't test well, Vacation simply leaves the failures behind and moves on to the next.The plot concerns itself with one Clark Griswold, a designer of food additives who wishes people would take him more seriously. He takes his family on a road trip across the USA, with the final destination being a theme park known as Wallyworld. Wallyworld being a cheap knock-off of Disneyland, naturally. None of the film is really rooted in reality, as the moment when the old Griswold family car is ceremoniously towed off to be crushed at the car dealership. Maybe it is meant to demonstrate how spineless a man Clark is, but even the most timid man would file complaints or sue if the vehicle he ordered turned out to not be there on the delivery date, and his old car was written off. Clark's spinelessness is a two-edged sword. It drives the comedy very effectively in some scenes, but it grates in others. As I have more or less indicated, it only works when there is no good reason for him to be more aggressive.The plot thread with Clark lusting after a babe in a Ferarri (that is more or less how she is billed) is incredibly dated nowadays. Christie Brinkley puts in a great performance as the piece of tail that this spineless wimp keeps chasing in spite of the fact that he should know this woman is so out of his league. Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall are great as the long-suffering Griswold children, who alternate between being amused at the misadventures on the road and reflecting on what a big wuss their father is. Observant viewers will noticed that Anthony Michael Hall grows a foot or two between the introductory sequences and the arrival at the Griswolds' destination. John Candy gets a great cameo as a security guard who seems as spineless as Clark. But it is Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Jane Krakowski, John Navin, and Imogene Coca as Ellen's relatives who make the film as funny as people remember. One almost wishes there could be a film entirely devoted to these idiots.For sure, Vacation is incredibly dated, and some of the humour in it has been lost to time. It has also spawned more sequels than any franchise this ordinary deserves. Then again, you could not have Christmas Vacation without European Vacation, so I guess we should take the good with the bad. Anthony Michael Hall has defied expectations and had a decent career since, while Dana Barron and most of the rest of the cast have seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth. Chevy Chase has basically been reduced to the B-list, making the kind of films that rarely get released on video outside of America, if at all. Fortunately, director Harold Ramis has gone onto much bigger and better things, as an actor, director, and a writer. Unfortunately, this kind of B-level comedy that used to fill the rental shelves has been phased out in favour of politically correct drivel. I guess some you win, some you lose.I gave Vacation a six out of ten. Unlike some other comedies that have "this is a product of the 1980s" stamped all over them, it has not aged well. It is, in fact, quite a step down from Caddyshack, Chevy Chase's previous collaboration with Harold Ramis. Still, if you are bored and could do with some nostalgia, Vacation might be worth a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, but Engaging Cult Comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis' second directorial effort, NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION, penned by 80s 'teen film master' John Hughes, lacks the 'over-the-top' madness of his first feature, CADDYSHACK, but offers Chevy Chase in what has become his signature role, and enough sight gags and one-liners to make it an enduring favorite, and start a franchise of VACATION films.As Clark Griswold, Chase is the embodiment of an 'average American dad', none too bright, but anxious to take his family on a bonding cross-country 'dream vacation' to 'Disneyland' caricature, Wally World. From the opening moments, when he is conned by a smooth-talking salesman (a wickedly deadpan Eugene Levy) into buying a truly hideous station wagon for the trek, you know that this family outing is in for serious trouble! Nevertheless, his devoted wife, Ellen (the sweet and sexy Beverly D'Angelo), and less-than-devoted kids, Rusty and Audrey (the terrific Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron) are sucked into Clark's dream, and soon the family is bouncing across the U.S.A., to the tune of Lindsey Buckingham's 'Holiday Road'.The journey is a series of slapstick vignettes, ranging from hilarious (Chase's spectacular arrival at a motel, after falling asleep behind the wheel), to silly (the running appearances of supermodel Christie Brinkley, and Chase's attempts to look like a 'swinger' to impress her), to questionable (asking for directions in a Black ghetto of St. Louis, offering a variety of racial stereotypes that director Ramis himself says was in poor taste). A comic highpoint comes when the family visits unemployed cousin Eddie (the irrepressible Randy Quaid) and his 'trailer trash' family. While Eddie offers Clark 'used' beer and tries to hit him up for a 'small' loan to help put him 'back on his feet' ($52,000!), his wife serves up Hamburger Helper without hamburger, his son turns Rusty on to his pornographic magazine collection, and his oldest daughter shares with Audrey her expertise in 'French kissing' ("Daddy says I'm the best...") and stash of marijuana. As a final insult, acerbic Aunt Edna (the legendary Imogene Coca) and her psycho dog are dumped on the Griswalds...with ultimately calamitous results!Finally, the family reaches Wally World...only to find it closed for annual cleaning and maintenance! In the original climax of the film, Chase then tracked down the home address of Walt Disney-based 'Roy Wally' (screen legend Eddie Bracken), and got revenge by trashing his mansion. This ending played disastrously with preview audiences, however, and the cast was reassembled (Hall had grown several inches...check it out!) and a hasty rewrite was shot, with Clark buying a BB gun, and forcing his way into the closed park, forcing a security guard (the wonderful John Candy, in a cameo) to turn on the rides, and show them the '(bleep)in good time' he'd promised his family. An army of police and S.W.A.T. converge on the park, and Roy Wally arrives to decide their fate. The new ending got very positive feedback from audiences, and is the version seen in the final cut of the film.VACATION was a major commercial hit when released, spawning three sequels (the second, CHRISTMAS VACATION, has become a holiday favorite, and is the best of the series). While the first film is certainly not a classic, it is a better film than some critics have implied, and has a loyal following.Next time you plan a family vacation, check it out...and remember, don't tie your dog's leash on the rear bumper of the car!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahh the typical 80's comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back before political correctness had a stronghold in American culture, writer/director John Hughes seemed to have a fixed sneer on any characters in his films that were not white, upper middle-class suburbanites, usually his targets of ridicule were poor rural whites, blacks, and orientals. Nevertheless, this was one of my favorite 80's comedies, yes, some of the jokes are pretty flat, but Chevy Chase is always great as the all American suburban/loser dad trying to do his best for his family with disastrous results. Randy Quaid is great as his wife's cousin Eddie, an unemployed factory worker with 5 kids and a still-growing family who can still manage to whip up a decent family meal (how do you like your bun?). Christie Brinkley appears in the movie not as someone to get to know, but as mere eye candy. And then finally at the end, Magic Mountain is in disguise as Wally World with John Candy as a bumbling security guard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies are a fickle business because they rely on appealing to the humor of the audience. Since forming rapid-fire jokes is harder than making drama and action, comedies are typically shorter than the standard film. I have yet to see a two-hour comedy other than The Blues Brothers.Vacation is obviously more a John Hughes movie than Harold Ramis' due to the blatant stereotypes. Blacks are treated in a state of contempt while the hillbilly's are just that: pot-smoking, pig-racing, semi-incestuous eyerollers. I wonder if Strom Thurman had a finger in the script.Let's face it, we (the audience) both envy the excitement of the Griswolds in our family adventures, yet we loathe the tribulations that befall them. Chevy Chase shows he could do comedy at one time, I will avoid any references to Memoirs of an Invisible Man for his performance here. Anthony Michael Hall proves to be the second-most interesting member of his family. It is interesting how John Hughes would both create and wreck his career.Overall, this is certainly an interesting movie that speaks for anyone who tried taking a cross-country trip. If you haven't, or can't, try this instead. You will either like it or despise it, but, like many of Hughes' films, it speaks on a different level. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest trips you'll ever take.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't laugh hard at some of the scenes in this movie, then you just don't have any sense of humor. Yes..this maybe corny silly humor, but it's laugh-out-loud funny. Mind you, I have literally seen this movie about 15 times (no joke) and I STILL laugh at the same funny scenes. There are just some classic lines in this film and Chevy Chase was at his best here. European Vacation and Vegas Vacation didn't live up to this classic. Only Christmas Vacation was close to this film it terms of script and funny scenes.Now we all know the story of this film by now. Clark Griswold wants to take his family from Chicago to California to visit the theme park Wally-World for vacation. The fun begins with Clark trying to get a new car and the laughs continue all the way to their destination.*****SPOILERS****** I don't want to give to much away, but some of the funniest lines are the following. 1) Eddie cooking burgers on the grill with no meat. He says, "I don't know why they call this Hamburger Helpers, it stands great all by itself. 2) Clark about to use what he thinks is ketchup for his burger. He says, "Oooooohhhhwww...real tomato ketchup Eddie?" Eddie says, "Only the best cousin." All it is a bunch of crushed tomatoes. 3) Cousin Vicky stirring the kool-ade with her hands. Clark says, "Can I help with that Vicky?" 4) Some of the cruder lines include a talk between Cousin Vicky and Audrey. Vicky says, "I know how to French Kiss" Audrey says, "Yeah so, every is doing that." Vicky says, "Yeah, but my Daddy says I do it the best." Now the word "Daddy" was replaced with science teacher, girlfriend, dentist and other things for T.V. viewing, which didn't make it any better. 5) Ellen saying, "The dog p***ed on the picnic basket and watching the reaction of Clark and Aunt Edna.This stuff is classic humor. If you don't laugh at one of these scenes, then this movie isn't for you. *******************END SPOILERS***************Vacation is one of Chevy Chase's best movies. I can't think of anyone I know who hasn't seen this movie at least once. If you haven't then rent it, TODAY. Also pick up a copy of "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" w/Steve Martin and John Candy. These are the two funniest movies from the Saturday Night gang. Get them today and be ready to laugh .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A career highlight for everyone involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great eighties comedy for all the right reasons. First of all, Chevy Chase is an outstanding comic actor, playing a devoted father with the anti-midas touch, desperate to treat his family to a little fun but fluffing every opportunity. The rest of the family shine from beneath him, especially Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), a freeloading redneck making no money from the live bait business.But it's the script that keeps things moving, keeping the kind of pace a road movie should as the rapidly deteriorating "family truckster" carries the Griswolds from suburban Chicago to Walley World, California. Jokes flow as the misfortunes mount, and Hughes's one-liners are genuinely funny.Vacation is a fantastic movie, not just because it's very funny, but because it's funny every time you watch it. They've done everything right. Definitely one to buy on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilersWithout doubt one of the funniest movies of the 1980s, National Lampoon's Vacation sees Chevy Chase at his finest. The premise is simple: food additive genius Clark W. Griswold (Chase) plans a family holiday, a 2500 mile trip across country from his Chicago suburb to Walley World, California. Acting on his mantra that `getting there is half the fun!' Clark decides against flying so that he can spend more time with his kids. The movie opens with him trading in his old car for the luxurious Wagon Queen Family Truckster. To the chagrin of his son Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall), it's not the car they ordered but Clark is somehow convinced by the salesman (Eugene Levy in an amusing cameo) to take it. And so begins the unravelling of Clark's meticulous plans.First off, the Truckster is vandalised when a wrong turn sees the Griswolds lost in an unsavoury St. Louis neighbourhood. We meet the trailer trash cousins of his wife Ellen (the sexy Beverly d'Angelo) in Kansas, with the hilarious simpleton Eddie (Randy Quaid) providing some of the film's most memorable moments. At Eddie's shack, Clark is informed that he must take the deviously decrepit Aunt Edna to Phoenix, a task he does not relish. After Clark kills her accidentally kills her dog, Edna dies en route, leaving Griswold Sr. with no option but to tie the corpse to the Truckster's roof-rack. Visits to Dodge City, the Grand Canyon and a hellish breakdown in the desert leave Clark, minus credit cards, cash and contraception, slipping deeper into comical insanity as the trip becomes one long nightmare.His only escape is his obsession with the girl in the red Ferrari (Christie Brinkley) who seems to be everywhere he turns. Clark's attempts to win the girl over almost wreck his marriage as he tries to convince her that he's travelling across country with his brother's family incognito on an annual nationwide inspection of his motel chain. It's classic Chase - which to some is an oxymoron - with his quick, deadpan delivery offset by hilarious bumbling slapstick. Fixated with schedules and dull tourist spots, Clark rambles throughout the movie as the know-all father who likes the sound of his own voice. To top it all off, when the exhausted but still excited Griswolds reach California days behind schedule and thousands over budget, they discover that Walley World is closed for repairs. Clark's reaction is semi-controlled hysteria and provides a fitting end to a hilarious film.With Chase, writer John Hughes and director Harold Ramis all on song, National Lampoon's Vacation is a riot. Chase went on to become Fletch, which some believe is his best role. I would disagree. While he is brilliant as the wisecracking Fletch, Chase was born to play Clark Griswold, a buffoon with the best intentions but the worst luck. His kids Rusty and Audrey (Dana Barron) are brattish and quarrelsome, while Ellen tries to maintain a semblance of calm amid the chaos. Cameos from Brian Doyle-Murray, Eddie Bracken and John Candy add to the fun. Vacation has spawned three sequels, with only 1989's Christmas effort coming anywhere near the hilarity of the first film. As with most films and their sequels, the original is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad it's Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The family vacation is something uniquely American. Taking the family and heading out across the country, packed in a station wagon, is just brimming with comedy and anecdotes. Just basing it on real life adventures (catastrophes) would be enough to fill a movie and bring back the memories (nightmares). Yet this film takes this loaded idea and fall completely flat with it. Everything is over blown and over the top. The gags are simple and cheap. Nothing is relatable. There is also a cruel dog killing scene, which is supposed to be 'hilarious', and even a few racist bits. To say the humor is forced is a understatement. It's like trying to jam a 10 inch brick into a 5 inch round hole. A twisted eulogy to Aunt Edna in the rain on somebody's back porch is this films only inspired moment. The rest is so absolutely basic it is almost insulting. Some of the jokes are so bad they deserve a sort of 'dud hall of fame' mention. There's a very tired PSYCHO shower scene parody, a uninspired 'lost in the desert' sequence, redneck humor, and even a thread involving supermodel Christine Brinkly that makes absolutely no sense. The characters are just too general even for simple comedy. It's like nothing ever got passed the storyboard phase. Yes it's fun to see comedy legends Eddie Bracken and Imogene Coca in 'surprise guest roles'. Yet neither of them are given anything to work with. Coca is especially wasted. She plays a very cliched driven crabby old lady. Her lines and nuances are so standard that her presence becomes boring, even transparent. This comedy is really sad. If it had been done with some astuteness it might have really worked. Instead we are left with Chase whose deadpan humor, believe it or not, is the one thing that really holds this together. Followed by NATIONAL LAMPOON'S EUROPEAN VACATION, which is even worse.</fullReview>

The movie is followed by four sequels: EUROPEAN VACATION, CHRISTMAS VACATION, VEGAS VACATION, and AMERICAN ADVENTURE.

		<fullReview>This movie is so great! I can't say enough wonderful things about it. Although I did like the third and fourth better than this, it's difficult to not like it just as much as the others. The writing is hysterical, and the acting extremely well done, and the casting perfect for this film. All the characters are funny and right on cue. I can't say that there is even one boring or bad scene in the whole 98 minutes.If you've seen this film you have to appreciate the comical genius behind it. Chevy Chase is one of the most talented comedians, and should deserve so much more credit for his skills and ability than he does. I think this is probably the best role he ever received, and Beverly D'angelo is great as his wife, she was perfect for the character she portrayed.If I had to pick a favorite scene it would probably have to be when he finally meets the blond in the corvette, and tells her he used to work for the C.I.A. But, then again there are so many other funny parts, it's hard to pick just one!A definite 10 out of 10.And that's my review.</fullReview>

There is no story building or creating some highlight point ... nothing.It was supposed to be a comedy movie but it failed to do so. I do not mean it has no comedy scenes because it has, but not as much as a regular comedy film should have. And the comedy scenes are not of great laugh or hilarious they are rather stale. I do not know how come this movie get above seven rating in IMDb.All and all I will not recommend it to a person who has a decent level of sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really "good" so much as "classic "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie again after not having seen it for some twenty-odd years and I was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't as good as I had remembered it being. It wasn't bad, just not that great. Like many people, I first saw it back in the 80's when it first came out. I was in my early teens then and thought it was decent. Now in my forties, I have a much better appreciation for it when I watch it because I have two children of my own and I see much (perhaps a little too much) of myself in the Clark W. Griswold character. I laughed out loud several times at Chevy Chase's portrayal of Clark being "such a dad." I don't know whether or not he had children of his own prior to making this movie, but he really nailed the "typical dad" character. Also, Beverly D'Angelo is the perfect combination of sexy and motherly in her role, and Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are also terrific in their roles. Randy Quaid, back in his more stable days, gives a rather sane performance as the inimitable Cousin Eddie. There are many outstanding supporting performances in this movie. Having written that, however, I must state that the movie plays out as episodic, like one childhood memory after another strung together. Also, the movie is often silly; it contains elements that would have better left as ideas. For instance, it doesn't really make sense that Clark's old car would be driven straight from him trading it in to being compacted within minutes. It makes for a fairly funny sight gag, but doesn't come across as something that would actually happen. When it comes to ratings, the movie really deserves no more than six out of ten; however, there are so many funny moments and Chevy Chase is so good as Clark, I bump up my rating to seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny But No Too Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Light hearted film of the 80 vintage. It does a great service to exploring the America of the late 20th century. Despite the movie it being a farce as described on the DVD there are revealing aspects of American lifestyle hidden within the movie. The scene whereby they travel down St Louis is one that is of contemporary interest.The movie is about a dysfunctional family traveling to LA from Chicago and the maladies and fatalities that befall them. The journey is a nightmare for the family and primarily a satire. The film is entraining without being a masterpiece. I found in some parts of the movie it was uncomfortable to watch than humorous. Such scenes involving the hicks were completely stereotypical that the presence of them on the show was in my opinion cheap humour and distasteful. In any case the movie did have some funny moments and the tone of the film was just right. The aurora of silliness was around this movie and made it a good quick fun movie to have on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never laughed so hard in my life. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Chevy Chase as Clark Griswald decides that he is not spending enough time with the kids, so he plans a road trip with the family to see their favorite cartoon character theme park. Their car is always getting into accidents on the way to California. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. Oh, and the acting is very effective, save for a couple of scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Christmas Vacation but was disappointed in European Vacation. The original Vacation though for me will always be the best one, being the funniest and most original of them in my opinion. The film looks great, the cinematography and scenery are striking and the fashions and the film as a whole hold up well. The soundtrack has a great energy about it, the script is very funny and quotable, the gags don't fall into the trap of being tired and stale and the story is well-paced, energetic and heart-warming. Chevvy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo give great performances, as do Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy and John Candy. All in all, a great film and a comedy classic. I personally wouldn't go as far to say it is one of the best movies ever, but I would class it as a personal favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) has long surpassed a movie's humble status?it's a comedy anthem; I'm dependent, addicted to comedy, and the mythical John Hughes is acknowledgeable as the uncrowned king of the kitsch, of the wildest and most kitschy fun. How comes we lost Hughes as a director, but Scorsese is unstoppable? Hughes was on to something; call it kitsch or otherwise, it did kick. In the '80s generation, Chase was my second favorite comedy actor?after Willis. Anthony Michael Hall was to become a Hughes stock actor. Have you seen the handsome Hall in Into the Sun (1992) ? Now that was his peak; when you hear someone trashing Ed Wood, remind him of Fritz Kiersch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather good vacation for you the viewer, not so much for the Griswalds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the classic road trip movie and one of the best as far as comedy road trip movies. This is the first of four vacation type movies and is easily the best, granted I never saw the one in Vegas. This one just seems the most realistic, granted I am doubting all the things that happened here could happen on one trip, but still I am sure these things have happened before on family trips. So the story in this one? Simple, the Griswalds are going on a cross country trip to Wally World and plan on taking in the sights of America along the way. What could be more fun? They even stop at some relatives house and get to take on another traveler in the form of a delightful aunt. Yes, this movie is very funny and you just have to cringe at all the stuff that goes wrong on Clark's (Chevy Chase) perfectly planned trip as things go wrong right from the get go as the vehicle they planned on driving gets replaced by a rather crappy station wagon. The cast is great as Chevy is in prime form and Beverly DeAngelo is perfectly cast as his wife. The kids in this one are the best of the movies I have seen in the vacation series and Randy Quaid is excellent as cousin Eddie. We all have that relative hiding in the wings don't we? The trip seems to go from one disaster to the next, and while it is terrible what they have to go through it is still worth a lot of laughs. Many people I am sure have driven into the bad part of town on accident, driven through that detour sign, and had run ins with the local law enforcement. Granted, I am also sure not many have found themselves in the middle of a desert, flirting with a beautiful modelesque lady, and had to use a BB gun to get into a park. So for a very funny and memorable trip check out this vacation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chevy Chase Steals The Vacation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vacation (1983, Dir. Harold Ramis) The Griswold family are on a quest. A quest to a Walley World theme park for a family vacation, but things aren't going to go exactly as planned, especially when Clark Griswold (Chase) is losing all thought towards a mysterious blonde (Brinkley) in a red Ferrari.These days, National Lampoon is not known for its comedies, but back in the early '80s, the world was introduced to 'Vacation' which began the start of a series of funny and well known comedies. 'Vacation' can not really get a simpler story. A family travel to a particular place with unprepared comedic occurrences. The are some nice cameos featured, such as Eugene Levy and John Candy, an the film is a mixture of both physical and verbal comedy, with it nicely separated amongst the well played characters, with one of the best and remembered characters being Aunt Edna. But, the one character who gets the best portion of the jokes is Chevy Chase. He delivers all the lines so perfectly that creates one of the best characters of the film, and a character who is still being referenced to this day.I turned off the water, the stove, the heat and the air, locked the door, notified the police, stopped the papers. I called to get the grass cut. Did I put the timers on the living-room lights? - Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies you always remember as being better than it actually is."Vacation" tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) leading his family across country on one of those most dreaded of dreaded events -- the Family Vacation! It's episodic in nature, moving briskly from one disaster to another, some of them very funny (the death of a miserable aunt played by Imogen Coca is a highlight) to the downright disturbing (a brief stay with some incestuous hillbilly relatives). Some scenes deliver bigger laughs than others, but none of them sticks around for very long, so even the dead parts move by fairly quickly.Having been on a cross-country drive myself with my family when I was a kid (from Illinios to California) to go to Disneyland, let's just say I could easily relate to this film.Beverly D'Angelo is smokin' hot as Chase's wife, and a young Anthony Michael Hall is hilarious as his adolescent son.Grade: B</fullReview>

Getting to Walley World isn't easy and there are many bumps along the way such as feisty Aunt Edna and getting lost in St. Louis. When they finally do make it, there are more nightmares than they ever thought possible.I thought that this was pretty funny. I especially liked when Clark was looking for the gas cap and pulled off the license plate.

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies that Comedy Central's justified in playing ad infinitum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that because I've watched enough of the cable channel over the course of almost a decade(actually longer than that,since there was a gap of time between 1995 and 1998 where I didn't have Comedy Central)and I've known this much about the channel:one,they will NEVER touch "South Park"(and I'm NOT complaining) and two,once they broadcast a movie,they will rerun it for as long as they feel like they can get away with. Some films--Kissing a Fool,She's All That and Rat Race come to mind--really aren't very good at all. Then there's this one,which seems to be in the minority,and it is VERY worthy of being rerun over and over again.The Grisowlds,a WASPy middle America family from Chicago,are going on their yearly summer vacation. DAd Clark(Chevy Chase,in one of his best roles)decides to take the family via automobile,and he loads the famile into a Pea-green station wagon. Mom Ellen(Beverly D'Angelo)just wants peace in the family,and is supportive to the teeth. Kids Audrey and Rusty(Dana Kimmel and Anthony Michael Hall)are naturally turned off by their parents,but they go along because they want to get to WalleyWorld in Anaheim(remind you of anyplace?) bad enough.The ensuing trek westward is,of course,hardly smooth. Between overbearing family members(Randy Quaid as a loudly obnoxious Kansas cousin and Imogen Coco as a cranky and borderline-insane great aunt are particularly good),pesky animals, ignored roadblocks, car vandalizing and unplanned fatalities pepper the family's voyage toward the promised land. The naturalness of Chase(who is a much better physical comedian than verbal one) and the rest of the cast as family make the pratfalls and verbal gaffes all the more fitfully fun.This is the definitive Vacation movie:the European Vacation would be a passable but unspectacular offering,Christmas Vacation would be inspired but could almost be its own separate film. I have yet to sit through Vegas Vacation but what I saw of the film struck me as a shallow attempt to capitalize on the franchise at best. THis is a definite renter of a movie(I saw this on the big screen in August 1983!),and since it gets played on cable pretty routinely,you may not have to look very far to find it. If you do,sit back and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "vacation" is headed for a lengthy hospital (or jail) stay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first and very best of Chevy Chase's "hellish" Family Vacations. He takes his wife and 2 teenage kids on a road trip from Chicago to LA, with everyone's dream-theme-park "Walley's World" as the final destination. Unforeseen (and eventually predictable) problems lurk around every corner. From being cheated by a car salesman to being "taken" by various locals, to "visiting" with bumpkin relatives, this trip includes every imaginable disaster. There are many subtle jokes that seem to elude the cast members delivering them. When the wife clears the left-overs from the dinner dishes, the husband wipes them off (without washing them) and puts them in the cupboard. Neither of them seem to notice this, busy talking about their imminent trip. When Chevy Chase has a "father to son talk" with a young Anthony Michael Hall, he puts on his eyeglasses (presumably for dramatic effect), but almost immediately one half of the frame falls off, the other half following quickly. Both father &amp; son ignore the incident and just continue talking. Imogine Coca basically plays "herself" as the obnoxious Aunt Edna,who meets with an untimely death while "hitching a lift" to yet another relative. Her funniest moment is when she (upon giving it some thought) eventually decides to have a big bite of a sandwich suspected to have been drenched in dog urine.The "f" word flies freely, which would appear gratuitous today, but by 1983 standards was considered "standard". The "R" rating seems a bit harsh, though. Even with brief "glimpses" at female breasts and several sexual innuendos, today a PG-13 rating would have been the most. Hints at marijuana use are so subtle that anyone unfamiliar with the practice would "miss it". Fears of corrupting minors are unfounded.This is a very entertaining trip through the USA with a roller-coaster ride at Walley's World as a reward. This vacation inspired 3 sequels! Recommended to audiences age 12 and up.</fullReview>

Although Christmas Vacation is more TV friendly, it isn't quite as well done as the original.From the very beginning, we see Clark(Chevy Chase) as a father with a solid heart but shallow head. Car dealer Eugene Levy swindles him into buying cinema's ugliest vehicle to drive cross country in. His wife Ellen(Hollywood's most underrated actress Beverly D'Angelo) wants to fly to California and his children Russ(Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey(Dana Barron) would rather spend their vacation in Hawaii. But dimbulb Clark persuades them to travel to Wally World by beatup car.There are numerous funny moments, like their visit with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid at his best) to Aunt Edna willingly eating a urine soaked sandwich.A well written comedy that most Americans can relate with, with relatives you'd rather not see and the hazards of traveling for longer than a day.Also is notable for cinema's second most famous shower scene(second to Psycho only), as Clark attacks an unsuspecting Ellen with a banana while she cleans off. Clark:"Can I do your back, honey?" Ellen: "I've already done my back." Clark: "Can I do your front?" Ellen: "Go do your own front."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today's directors might still learn something from this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though 'National Lampoon's Vacation' is a movie that has been made in 1983, it is still very funny to watch. I guess you could call this a timeless comedy, because the jokes in it still work today and will probably still work in 20 years time as well.In this movie we follow the Griswold family, Clark and Ellen and their two children Rusty and Audrey, as they prepare themselves to go on a trip cross-country from Chicago to the West Coast, where they will visit Walley World, a Disneyland-like theme park. Clark has prepared and planned down the trip to the last minute. But even before leaving they already encounter some problems and more will follow later during their trip, making this the vacation they will never forget...It's hard to say which part of the movie I liked most. I liked it all, the part where they get the new car, where they meet Ellen's relatives, when Clark flirts with a pretty young lady... It's just too hard to pick one. It's too bad they don't seem to make this kind of comedies anymore. Today's movie makers sure can learn something from this movie. I give it a 7/10 at least, perhaps even a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate family vacation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Griswold is determined to visit Wally World with his family. The problem: it's more than 2000 miles from home. But the Griswolds embark on a cross-country trip that gets funnier by the mile. Just by looking at the family's new car, you know it's not going to be pretty. From Chicago all the way down to California, it's trouble after trouble. And there's Aunt Edna watching the scenery from the roof of the car! Great fun. Good performances by Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast. One of the best comedy from those years.Seen at home, in Toronto, on January 23rd, 2005.79/100 (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hilarious and fun to watch. It's just impossible to Hate it! I'd recommend it to anyone! It's the best vacation of all of them and also the best National Lampoons move! 4 out of 4 stars all the way! It delivers a barrel of laughs into the hardest-to-please! Just watch it! Chevy Chase is brilliant. The kids are brilliant and the script was obviously well thought out. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) decides to take his wife Helen (Beverly D'Angelo), his son Rusty (Anthony Micheal Hall), and his Daughter Audrey (Dana Barron) out on a family vacation at Wally World. Helen wanted to go on a plain, but Clark insisted that they go by car, which he later finds out was a big mistake! Because on the way they get into a lot of problems which seem like misery to them, but to the audience, Its hilarious to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vacation" isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it sure does have it's moments. At first glance you may think that this is a family film, but this film most certainly is not. The film is aimed toward the adult audience (or those over 18) and is rated R for a reason. You must also keep in mind while watching this film that it was made in the early 1980's and therefore will have a great deal of differences in humor than today's comedies, so it must be treated as one.There are some aspects of the film that are just all-around hilarious, then there are others that are rather morbid and dark, and even some moments that are very un- Politically Correct by today's standards. But, all in all, it makes for an excellent film.The cast members are all quite good and all pull off fantastic performances. Chevy Chase leads the film and does so quite well, in one of his funniest roles to date. He's reason enough to watch the film, Chevy is great. Beverly D'Angelo, looks better than ever and pulls off a very nice performance, she fit the role perfectly. Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron play the two children in the film, both of which do very nicely (it's too bad neither of them returned for any of the sequels). Christine Brinkley, Randy Quaid, Eugene Levy and John Candy all pull off excellent performances, despite having such little screen time. Also, it's rather interesting to see a very young Jane Krakowski (of TV's "Ally McBeal") in the film, as Cousin Vicki. I also feel inclined to mention cast members Frank McRae and John Diehl, neither actor is terribly well known, but I like them.Like I mentioned above, "Vacation" is a classic! And should definitely be seen by anyone who appreciates a good comedy. Some of the comedy is a bit dated or has been done countless times since, but nonetheless, it's good to know where it all started. I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that likes comedy films, or just likes Chevey Chase, director Harold Ramis, or any of the other cast-members. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic. Clark Griswold wants to take the trip across country to Walley World. The only thing is Clark knows what to do to mess it up whether it be drivinginto the inner city or forgetting he tied the dog to the rear bumper of the car. In other words, this is the nightmare vacation. The type that even your family would give up on. But not our Clark as it turns intoan obsession ("I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose!!!"). The acting is great all around. Chevy Chase is in the finest form of his career as neer-do-well Clark. We suffer along with him as he deals with in-laws, flirts with 'the girl in the Ferrari', and getting ripped off by corrupt mechanics. The film barely punctures the R-rating only for the fact it is full of strong language. It could've been probably made as a 'PG' film since much of it is directed toward the family and is mostly harmless. My main problem is many local TV and cable stations still use the stale 1986 CBS edit that adds in different dialogue (I'm sure everyone knows the 'Christopher Columbo' line by heart), and cuts out scenes that would be considered harmless today. If you going to watch it on TV, catch on TNT as they have their own edit that includes many scenes that were cut out the first time. With that in mind, get ready to pack up the family truckster and prepare for one vacation you will never forget!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a classic. "Vacation" is one of those movies that gets better every time you see it. Largely because any of us who have been on a cross-country road trip with our family can relate all too well with the mishaps and bizarre stops along the way. Chevy Chase makes the movie. He's the perfect numskull with a heart of gold. **Potential Spoiler Ahead** My favorite scene is the very last: the "Screemy Meemy" roller-coaster coming down the hill with the Griswold's, Roy Walley, security guards, and even the S.W.A.T. team on board sharing the moment. Simply beautiful, and the perfect conclusion to their disastrous journey. The T.V. version is actually not butchered too bad, however you should rent the video or DVD if you want to hear the verbal exchanges that really took place in St. Louis, and inside "The Family Truckster" in Phoenix. HA HA HA!</fullReview>

The funniest part in the movie is when Clark accidently pulls out the license plate from his station wagon, while getting some gas. Another funny part is when he beats the crap out of the moose's nose. I have this movie on VHS and I highly recommend it.10/10 A+</fullReview>

I have had enough bad experiences to appreciate some of the moments from this movie. After this vacation, you may need to take another vacation to recuperate.

		<fullReview>Greatest travel film of all time, and seems undated today almost twenty years after its release. I think everyone can, to a small degree, sympathize with what the Griswold family goes through on a disastrous trip to Wally World, as everyone has had a bad vacation in their life, but the Griswold's experiences top the list as the worst trip in history. Chevy Chase is probably in his best role here, as the bumbling food additive specialist who has good intentions in driving cross country but not enough common sense to prevent disaster. Beverly D'Angelo plays his hapless wife stuck in the middle of the mess, who tries to add some sanity to the trip but doesn't succeed. The bickering kids, awful Aunt Edna, and the vicious dog add lots of comic touches. This is a movie you could watch dozens of times and never be tired of seeing it. Great music in the soundtrack, and all in all a fun trip across early 1980s America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you mix Chevy Chase, Harold Ramis, John Hughes, Randy Quaid, Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Hall, Imogene Coca, Eugene Levy, John Candy, and many more? You get National Lampoon's Vacation, a comic treat from Ramis and Hughes.Chase plays bumbling father Clark Griswold, who works with food additives. He decides to take his family on a road trip from their home town of Chicago to Wally World amusement park in California. Wally World is from a popular T.V. show about a talking animal. Three guesses on who that's a parody of, and the first two don't count. Clark's wife Ellen (D'Angelo) wants to fly out, and so do his kids, Rusty and Audrey (Hall and Dana Barron). Who does want to be in a car for 5600 miles (round trip)? Just so you know-they don't get there safe and sound.Chase is in top form as Clark. You can imagine no one else in that role. His comedy is funny, and a certain cockiness (as being the father figure) he brings to Clark is great, too. He's not the best actor in the world, but he still brings out laughs. Hughes's script is right on target; it's not mean-spirited or cruel. And the way the cast pulls it off is hilarious.D'Angelo is good as the typical wife. She brings common sense to Clark's wacky behavior. Hall and Barron are great as the kids who bicker with each other, and I really like Quaid as Clark's cousin Eddie.As I've said before, Hughes's script isn't fat jokes and gross-out body functions, it's the introduction of the American Family to out-of-the-ordinary situations. Sure, some of the plot is outlandish, even unbelievable. But when you watch the other three movies in this series, it looks like a walk in the park.I loved Coca as complaining Aunt Edna who comes along for the ride. Her sarcastic humor brings a new style of the movie. We have plain, kind jokes. We have jokes about swearing. And now we have jokes with sarcasm. She is really great.I love Ramis and the movies he directed (in exception to Caddyshack). I feel that some of his movies are underrated (Bedazzled, for instance). Vacation isn't underrated much, but I'm surprised it hasn't got a bigger following or higher reviews. But, you can tell it's him, and it's a great movie (which could only be done with Ramis and Hughes together) that needs to be watched again and again.My rating: 9/10Rated R for some language, nudity, and drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best comedies are humorous because they have traces of truth within the laughs. That's what makes this satire so risable as we relate to the sojorn of the Griswald clan from several perspectives: the kids enduring the interminable highway in the backseat, the wife trying to keep the family in tact in the midst of her husband's egregious fixes, and of course the father--a veritable everyman trying to produce a first class vacation for his middle class family.There are many silly moments of course, but they are easy to put up with as there are many truly funny (though gross) moments. The best of which are (SPOILERS) The teenage girls French kissing disscussion ("My dad says I'm the best at it"), the violent dog ("Rusty quit playing with the dog and come and eat") and the cop's scolding of Clark about animal cruelty ("Do you know what the penalty for animal cruelty is is this state?" Well i bet it's pretty stiff"). Great irreverant comedy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The famous Vacation, Chevy Chase and company at their best. Harold Ramis second effort in the director's chair is almost as good as his first (Caddyshack).On the first viewing of this you may never stop laughing. Second viewing will be the same because you'll be laughing at all the jokes missed the first time. But comedies has the least repeatability and this movie doesn't change that.It makes no point and it's not about that, this movie is a about stupid fun and it achieves the goal. I have a problem with the useless nudity, and the Christie Brinkley car bit, just became old before it even started.Some of Chase's ramblings while going through the desert are fairly dumb. The pool scene is stupid and the movie gives Clark two different personas. At one point he is a true to heart family and then sometimes he's seen as a guy who can't even remember his daughter's name.It's funny, mind you, but I just thought that was odd.Highlights are John Candy's appearance as a nerd security guard at Wally World and Randy Quaid is priceless as cousin Eddy.On the overall it's a good movie but only has a two or three repeat chance. So, a must see if you've never seen it before. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The other family members do good jobs as well, and so does Randy Quaid (hilarious!) as Chase´s brother-in-law. John Candy also turns up towards the end, as a fumbling security guard.Most jokes are funny, some are just silly. But this lightweight comedy feels like a winner, and something that you can watch several times. It was followed by three sequels, the third "Christmas Vacation" is probably the best, in competition with this one. The other two were just awful.3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview> This is a funny movie in every aspect. First of all, Chevy Chase is an innate comedian. In this and all of the following "Vacations" we see Clark W. Griswold, a dedicated family man who cracks down to the pressure of having his family vacation brought to the ground. Both Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid are great as secondary actors, playing Chevy Chase's wife and cousin by marriage respectively. But one of the great performances of this film goes to the late Imogene Coca. In this movie, she plays the obnoxious Aunt Edna who, with her nagging remarks, drives everyone in the family crazy. Don't miss this movie for nothing. And specially, don't miss the hilarious elegy that Clark Griswold gives while leaving Aunt Edna's corpse in the backyard.</fullReview>

Chevy Chase is as funny as can be as Clark Griswold a man who travels his family cross-country from home in Chicago, Illinois to vacation in California to visit Wally World theme park. Along the way just about anything you could imagine happens most are misfortune and mishap, but never worry Clark and the Griswold family finally make it the funny mishaps are the best parts of the movie! Some sex appeal can be found with Christie Brinkley and even Beverly D' Angelo has her moments as Mrs. Griswold. Good supporting performances from Anthony Michael Hall and John Candy also make this movie even more enjoyable. Vacation airs many times on basic cable it is still a popular movie after many years.

		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I decided to buy all 4 of the Griswald vacation movies. I remember bits and pieces (of the early ones) from throughout my youth, but have never sat down to really watch all four movies. First up was the original family Vacation to Wally World. I was blown away by how funny this movie really is. Chevy Chase is at his comedic best. Chase perfectly portrays the average smuck, who tries so hard to be the best dad in the world, but his complete failure in every attempt makes his character, nevertheless, all the more lovable. The two kids (Dana Barron, Anthony Hall) portray the Griswald children the best of all the sets of children. Rusty is hysterical as the beer-guzzling advisor of his mis-guided father.The kind of movie where you know everything is going to go wrong, but you laugh anyway when it does. Full of hilarious characters (e.g. Cousin Eddie, Aunt Edna), genuinely funny situations, and wild kinetic energy, this movie is full of fun and great laughs. The timing, the directing, the performances are all excellent. FINAL RATING: 9/10 A movie you can watch over and over again. A comedic masterpiece. Enthusiastically recommended to any fan of movies!Noob Aalox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet The "Griswolds!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one that introduced the Griswold Family to the world, `National Lampoon's Vacation,' directed by Harold Ramis, is a side-splitting comedy starring Chevy Chase as Clark W. Griswold, Jr., who is arguably the best, and most memorable, character he's ever created for the silver screen. It's summer vacation time, and Clark has ordered a new sports model station wagon to drive the family from Chicago to Los Angeles; their destination: The one and only `Walleyworld' amusement park in beautiful Southern Cal. But things begin on a somewhat dubious note when the car Clark ordered hasn't arrived, and he has to settle for the `Family Truckster,' which the salesman (Eugene Levy) tells him is superior to the one he ordered and, moreover, is just the vehicle for driving the `whole tribe' across the country. And it's only the beginning of a vacation the Griswolds (as well as the audience) will never forget. Working from a screenplay by John Hughes that is clever and filled with subtle humor, Ramis also uses the natural abilities of Chase and the rest of his cast to full advantage, punctuating the wittiness of the script with some broad strokes of physical comedy that blend well within the framework of the story. The project was in good hands with Ramis, who knows the territory and keeps it all flowing with a good pace and excellent timing. He was especially successful with Chase, who in other films has had a tendency at times to wander a bit from the humorous aspects of his characters; but not here. His `Clark' is right on the money. Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) does a good job as well, in a role that is basically one of playing `straight man' for Chase and his shenanigans. And they have an on-screen rapport that helps make even their screwiest antics believable. In the four `Vacation' movies, the only parts that had different actors each time were those of the `Griswold Kids,' the best of which were the original, with Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty and Dana Barron as Audrey (the second best were Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis in `Christmas Vacation'). They round out what is, somewhat surprisingly (for all of their comical situations and circumstances) a fully `functional' family anchored by Clark, who always starts out, at least, with only the best intentions. Also outstanding, in the role he reprises in the third and fourth installments of the series as well, is Randy Quaid as the inimitable `Cousin Eddie,' a relative the likes of which can be found in just about any family anywhere; the cousin nobody wants to claim, whose heart is bigger than his brain. It's a characterization rooted deeply in Americana, and one you won't forget. The supporting cast includes Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), Eddie Bracken (Roy Walley), Imogene Coca (Aunt Edna), Brian Doyle-Murray (Kamp Komfort Clerk), James Keach (Motorcycle Cop), Frank McRae (Grover) and John Candy (doing a hilarious turn as Lasky, a Guard at Walleyworld). A movie for anyone who's ever taken a vacation with the whole family (or even for those who haven't), `National Lampoon's Vacation' is a laugh-filled, upbeat and highly entertaining movie that, between the laughter, will make you think about a few things (like verifying the schedules of an amusement park) the next time you start planning the family vacation. This may not be the `perfect' comedy, but it comes awfully close; and if the number of laughs it gets are any indication, it at least puts it somewhere near the top. If you haven't seen this one yet, don't waste any more time; this is one that's going to brighten your day. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"National Lampoon's Vacation" is a wildly funny film about a family on their way from Chicago to California. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo star as the clueless parents who must get to Wally World at all costs. Cameos abound add great laughs and a special part for a very young Christie Brinkley also keeps the audience intrigued, to say the least. The direction is focused and the screenplay is smart enough to work. Overall a good comedy that delivers for the most part. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent 80's comedy. Chevy Chase's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"National Lampoon's Vacation" chronicles a disaster ridden trek across country for the Griswold family. The origin is a suburb of Chicago, the destination is Wally World, an obvious spoof of DisneyLand, complete with it's own mascot and sing-song theme... "M-A-R-T-Y... M-O-O-S-E.... What's that spell? Marty Moose!" Every thing that can go wrong during the trip does. From the early botched effort to plan the trip on the home computer, to the unfortunate detour through St.Louis's seedy side... "WHO DO I LOOK LIKE???? CHRISTOPHER COLUMBO????", to the pit stop at a redneck cousin's house (the excellent Randy Quaid, lamenting the fact that he can't get too close to the microwave because of the metal plate in his head), to the ramping of the family truckster off a closed road into the middle of the desert. And once they finally arrive at Wally World... LOOK OUT!!!I've seen Vacation probably at least 20 times. And each time I laugh and laugh (although the demise of Aunt Edna's dog still seems unsettlingly harsh). The subplot of Christie Brinkley's sports car driving vixen, taunting Chase with occasional chance encounters, and an eventual skinny dip in a hotel's pool has become the stuff of comedy legend. Even so far as to be revisited briefly in the most recent Vacation sequel, Vegas Vacation.Everybody in this cast plays off each other quite well. Imogene Coca as the irritable Aunt Edna, and John Candy as the Wally World security guard were perfectly cast. The gentleman that plays Roy Wally is quite funny as well, spoofing Walt Disney to a "T". Make this a must see on your next family movie night! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Chevy and Anti-Road Trip Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily one of Chevy Chase's funniest films, Vacation skewers the great family road trip and generates quite a few moments of hilarity from the entire cast.When Chevy and his family decide to take a trip to Wally World (a hybrid of Six Flags and Disneyland), Chevy opts to take a good old-fashioned family road-trip in a station wagon (what else). Predictably, things go bad from the beginning as they encounter the relatives (played hilariously by Randy Quaid) and their battle-axe Aunt (the equally funny Imogene Coca).While being predictable, it's a very fun flick to watch. Chevy Chase is in top-form here as Clark Griswold, turning in a seethingly funny performance. It's a joy to see Chevy hide his contempt and disgust when Quaid gives him a great gift ("I saw how you liked mine"). And their arrival at Wally World will no doubt have you in hysterics as well.Lightweight and fun, Vacation will leave a smile on your face and no desire to take a road trip any time soon.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vacation introduces audiences to the Griswold family, an average middle class American family with perhaps a not so average knack of getting into all sorts of predicaments.We find that the family is to spend their holidays at a theme park called Wally World. It so happens that the theme park is in another state. Instead of flying there, Clarke decides it would be better to drive cross-country, was he mistaken........All it takes is a few hours until trouble kicks in........The Griswolds seem to be the unluckiest bunch on the road, headed by the king of bad luck himself, dad.Chevy Chase is at his funniest, securing him a place amongst some of the greatest comediens of our time. Its the way he tries so hard that makes you laugh. You're never gonna travel on the open road without a smile again.Vacation is well worth your time, give it a go, and I guarantee, you'll be singing the theme song "Holiday Road" for the few days after you've seen the movie..........</fullReview>

Must be something to it. I treasure this movie mostly for one of the great lines of all time, Cousin Vicki's remark about french kissing(see 'Memorable Quotes'), delivered in true Elaine Vassal style by a 15-year old Jane Krakowski, playing, essentially, "Ally McBeal's" Elaine as a teeny-bopper.

		<fullReview>"Vacation" (aka "National Lampoon's Vacation") is a very funny look at the horrors of taking a cross-country trip by car and having lots of things go wrong. Chevy Chase started his own franchise here as Clark Griswold, a businessman who wants to take his wife and kids on a two week vacation by driving out to Wally World Amusement Park in California. They encounter a bunch of mishaps on the way. And you'll be laughing at what the Griswold's go through during the course of the trip. Beverly D'Angelo plays Clark's wife Ellen, Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are Clark's kids Rusty and Audrey, Imogene Coca is the cranky Aunt Edna, Randy Quaid is nutty Cousin Eddie, and the late John Candy is featured here in a bit part as a Wally World security guard. "Vacation" has very big laughs throughout with only one negative aspect in the film: the fate of Aunt Edna's mean dog. I didn't like the way this was treated. I love dogs and I don't like seeing dogs mistreated in movies. The good thing about this is that they don't show you what happens to the dog. They tell you through dialogue. But they couldn't show this in a comedy. Otherwise it would put a damper on the rest of the movie. This is only a minor complaint. Aside from that, "Vacation" is still a very funny movie.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

On theway though, the family encounters many hardships and freaks.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase, family man extrodinaire) keepssleeping on the wheel and meeting a hot blonde chick, much tothe dismay of Mrs. Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo), while theGriswold kids pick on each other. Along for the ride is Clark'scrusty, complaining aunt Edna. Among all the troubles likerunning into bikers and slamming their car into various things,the family manages to reach Wally World, where they see ashocking revelation."Vacation" is a nice comedy. However, it's not particularly afamily-orientated film because of the nudity and the profanity.Even so, this is an enjoyable piece of work. The Griswoldsshould have tried</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few comedies ever made that surpass Vacation. Chevy Chase may not be the funniest comedian of all time, but you'd never know it watching him in this movie. His performance as an exasperated dad taking the fam on a cross country trip to Wally World is hilarious. And once they finally get there, the best part of the movie is still to come. John Candy playing the Wally World security guard is classic, especially when he starts rambling on to the owner of the park about how he loves his ride and didn't even get sick on any of the rides this time. Anthony Michael Hall is great as Chase's son, and there are really no poorly played roles in the entire film. Although each of the sequels had their funny moments, with Christmas Vacation nearly living up to the original, none could quite match the constant humor of Vacation. There are very few people who did not like this movie, and for good reason. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laugh if you want, but I firmly believe this is the greatest film ever made.The always underrated Chevy Chase is perfect as the hapless father determined to give his family the best vacation possible-his determination catapulting the family headlong into a series of adventures few films can rival. Every performance in this film is well judged and perfectly pitched- top supporting honours go to Eugene Levy, Randy Quaid, and great, forgotten comedy actor and Preston Sturges favourite Eddie Bracken. The film belongs to Chase though, and the scene in the car in Flagstaff where he reaches, ooh, let's say, the end of his tether, confirms his ability. Each scene in the film plays like a separate vignette, the standouts being Cousin Eddie's ("I'm going steady, and I french kiss""Everybody does that""Yeah, but daddy says I'm the best at it") and the final scene at Wally World (Oh they don't close the state of Florida), as fitting a climax as any film ever had.

		<fullReview>"Vacation" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), his wife Ellen (Beverly DeAngelo) and kids Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) take a cross country trip to the famous Wally World, a Disney world-like amusement park. Clark refuses to fly because he says "getting there is half the fun!" If he knew what was ahead of him he would definitely change his mind! They travel in this awfully ugly pea colored car with 8 headlights (The Wagon Queen Family Truckster!) and get lost in a St. Louis ghetto, Clark falls asleep at the wheel, they visit country cousin hick Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his family and take cranky old Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) to Phoenix, but she dies before getting there, and there is a mystery woman (Christy Brinkley) in a red ferrari following Clark all over the place, which definitely catches his eye! The funniest part of this movie is when Clark loses his cool in the car after dropping off dead Aunt Edna in Phoenix. John Candy makes a cameo appearance as a security guard at Wally World. Everyone does such a good job as the constant bickering and fighting and mishaps affect them in each scene, you have to feel sorry for them but you laugh at them cause the mishaps get so ridiculous. Followed by three sequels not nearly as good as this one, but all funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear NetGoer,By coming to THIS EXACT PAGE, you have embarked on "a quest. It's a quest for fun!" as Clark puts it in this hilarious comedy from acclaimed comedy expert John Hughes. Hitch a ride with the Griswolds to the legendary Walley World, where a kid's dreams could come true. Along the way are a thousand nightmares, though... As an added bonus, Clark's brother Eddie adds to the insanity with his crazy family. The cranky Aunt Edna tags along to Phoenix, which may drive Clark over the edge! With a beautiful stranger in a red Ferrari showing up throughout the film, Clark's brains temporarily turn to Jell-O. It's no longer a quest for fun...it's a quest for sanity!

There are some very funny scenes to this movie, but it doesn't live up to "Animal House". This is a great movie that spawned forth numerous sequels, that weren't near as good as this one, besides Christmas Vacation, which is a tad worse.

		<fullReview>VACATION is funny. It's more than that. It's HILARIOUS. The entire cast works well together, and Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron are quite possibly the best "kids" used in a "National Lampoon's Vacation" picture yet. This was an early script by John Hughes, the staple of American comedy writing in the 90's. Look for Imogene Coca, Randy Quaid, John Candy (as Lasky, a guard at Walley World), and, of course, Christie Brinkley as the Girl in the Red Ferrari. Songs include "Holiday Road" sung by Leslie Buckingham. Opening credit montage of postcards is even funny, as is the whole picture, even up in to the ending credits, with photos from the memorable vacation. Rated-R for language and some nudity. The print in circulation on television is edited and includes some different dialogue, shot as an alternate just for television audiences. This includes: -In the St. Louis alley, the pimp responds to Chase's request for directions with "Who do I look like-Christopher Columo?" rather than his R-rated response. -When the family visits Couisin Eddie, the two girls are talking to oneanother. Eddie's daughter tells Audrey that she French kisses. Audrey's response is blase, "So, we all do that!" However, Eddie's daughter tells her that her "daddy says that she's the best at it." This is the original. However, in the television print, she credits her science teacher as saying that she's the best at it. Also, some cuts take place on television. -On the FOX (family) network, the exchange between the two daughters is cut entirely, as is Cousin Dale's response to Rusty as to what he does for entetainment, to which he responds "No, I don't have video games, but I gotta stack of nudie books about this high!" Also, there is the moment where Cousin Dale shows Rusty how to...uh...well, this is cut out as well, OBVIOUSLY! -Also, some of the language is dubbed out, chiefly in the scene where they have just dropped Edna's corpse off at the cousin's house, and Chase tells his family that they ARE going to have a FUN time...they are on a quest for fun, and so on. The offensive language (and there is a lot of it) is softened out of existence off the soundtrack. This type of dubbing takes place elsewhere. -On the Comedy Central network, the film is more heavily edited, but in the interest of time rather than in content. It retains the exchange between the two girls (albeit the alternate version), but is missing "filler" shots of the car travelling down the road, as well as the pimp's response to Chase in the alley. This scene is included in the FOX version, albeit in the alternate take. Well, anyhow, these are some things to look for. The supporting cast is made up of comedians like Brian Doyle-Murray and Eddie Bracken. Enjoy!</fullReview>

At the relatives' house, Chase ends up giving most of their money to Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid). Things add up until they finally arrive at Walley world, where... Well, just rent this movie as soon as possible. Video versions are probably best, since versions circulating on TV are heavily cut here and there for various reasons. It's really funny.

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this film in the theaters as a teenager and finding it a mildly diverting, if not hilarious, road movie comedy. Despite being a box office hit on its release, the reviews were largely mediocre and, reading them in retrospect, fairly on target. With the Ed Helms reboot coming out, I decided to catch it again as an adult, and I must say that the rose-colored glasses of nostalgic sentiment coupled with the gaggle of increasingly dreadful sequels, give the original Vacation a reputation of hilarity that it simply does not live up to. In fact, it has aged badly.The simple story centers on the Griswold family (dad Chevy Chase, mom Beverly D'Angelo and siblings Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron) and their disaster plagued cross country road trip to Wally World. Pretty much everyone can relate to family trips, especially from childhood, that went horribly awry, which should give Vacation fertile ground to mine. Unfortunately, it too often misses the mark and ultimately wears out its welcome long before we reach the final destination.On the plus side, the film has a fun postcards opening credits sequence paired with Lindsay Buckingham's rousing Holiday Road. Then it starts to deteriorate. A huge problem rests with the central character of Clark Griswold and the performance by Chase. Anyone is sympathetic with well-intentioned travel plans that blow up due to circumstances beyond one's control (i.e., bad accommodations, car trouble, nasty relatives, unplanned side trips, weather, etc.) and can laugh about them after the fact. Much of this should be the focus of the comedy, but very little of these are exploited in this film. Instead, the film takes the low road and too many of the "comical" moments stem from Clark being a complete imbecile. He makes choices and has reactions that few, if any, sane human beings would. To make matters worse, he is also a rather mean-spirited jerk. We can laugh and be sympathetic with a likable well-meaning guy of average intelligence running into vacation road blocks beyond his control, but it becomes less funny when the guy is actually a fairly unlikable jerk whose foolishness is often the starting point of the problems.Also, a number of the jokes are simply not that funny and the side trips and subplots often seem little more than padding. The film also has its fair share of mean-spiritedness, which sours any good humor. Christie Brinkley makes several appearances as a hottie in a sportscar who keeps ostentatiously flirting with Chase on the road. Overlooking the fact that one cannot fathom why someone who looks like Brinkley would be wasting her time relentlessly trying to seduce a shlub like Clark with his wife sitting in full view in the passenger seat, what kind of jerk would unabashedly leer back with his rather lovely significant other present. This all culminates in a hotel swimming pool sequence that goes no where, other than to allow son Hall to give Chase a reverse father doesn't know best pep talk that rings hollow.A side trip to visit redneck relatives, led by a criminally unfunny Randy Quaid, is fairly laughless and seems present only to pad time and saddle the Griswolds with a hated aunt (Imogene Coca) and her dog. This could have been funny, but the film is so mean-spirited that instead of some great verbal banter between comedy legend Coca and Chase (and company), we instead end up with Chase murdering her dog by tying it to the bumper and dragging it to death and then precipitating Coca's fatal heart attack and then leaving her cadaver on her son's front stoop with a note. Oh the hilarity! This might be understandable if the aunt were a character of great villainy, but other than being mildly unpleasant, she does nothing to generate this level of malevolence towards her. If there is anyone in the audience that can relate to vacation memories like this, then I suggest you move quickly away from them and make for the exits.Chase's performance clumsily lurches between abject stupidity and meanness. D'Angelo, stuck in the stereotypical long-suffering wife straight man role (are there any other kinds in these comedies), acquits herself well despite having so few notes to play. Hall keeps trying to find something to do with his role long after the writers have given up. He has it made compared to Barron, who only gets a few reaction shots and nothing funny. Apparently, women need to play it straight and only guys can be funny. Coca seems game, but she is only on hand for a nasty gag at her expense.By the time the Griswolds do get to Wally World, the viewer is exhausted and not from laughing. The film has long since run out of gas. It has seemed like an endless trip and shortly after departure has ceased to resemble anything like a funny disastrous road trip that friends or family would regale you with. Truly, at least 20 minutes or so could be cut from the film to its benefit. This mediocre film was followed by the even worse European Vacation and Vegas Vacation, and a barely tolerable step up from those with Christmas Vacation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry folks, parks closed.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Griswold family, Clark, Ellen, daughter Audrey and son Rusty, set out to spend their vacation driving cross-country from Chicago to glorious Walley World on the West Coast. The trip, which Clark planned down to the minute, slowly loses its smoothness from the moment they get a new vehicle. A stop off cousin Eddie results in the Griswold family giving cantankerous aunt Edna a lift to Phoenix. The Griswolds receive one strike of bad luck after another, and when they finally arrive at Walley World, they have to find out that the park is closed for maintenance. But Clark promised his beloved family the best vacation ever...With Clark Griswold, and Fletch, Chase had two of the funniest characters in the early eighties, and this movie has to be the best movie Chase has ever made. No matter which version you have seen, edited, the one with the Pointer Sisters in the blondes car, or the one with profanity, it never fails to raise a laugh.Standalone, the plot is simple and generic, the family are going on holiday, plain and simple. But what happens in between is the filling, and the filling is goo-oood (as Eddie would say), and they play like different sketches.Chase is deadpan throughout, and always manages to keep Clark utterly serious, even when he loses the plot at the end, and the support is fantastic.Other comedies have tried to emulate the comedy road movie, but they end up having gross out gags, because they don't have the genius writers behind this movie.A classic eighties movie, still funny today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation is the first of a series of Vacation movies starring Chevy Chase, as Clark W. Griswold, and Beverly D'Angelo, as Clark's wife Ellen. It is also the best of the series.Clark decides to take his family on a cross-country drive to Wally World in California for their vacation. Although Ellen doesn't think much of the idea, she would rather fly, she dutifully goes along with it. It seems Clark is the only one who wants to do the trip. His children Rusty, played Anthony Michael Hall, and Audrey, played by Dana Barron, would rather go to Hawaii.The family sets out on their adventure in the what has to be the ugliest station wagon in history, the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. Mayhem ensues.This film is one of my all time favorites and has been since I saw it in 1983. The reason I like it is the humor of course. Not only from the physical comedy - like Clark walking through the desert - but also the lines in the movies that one is thinking but don't expect to hear. Sure some of the humor scrapes the gutter but overall the screenwriter and director squeezed every bit of comedy out of this movie.I also like the film because many of the episodes have some truth for those of us who have made the obligatory cross-country car trip with the family. The stories fit in with my experiences and those of my mother when she went on trips with her family back in the 1950's.We have all visited relatives who live in the sticks. We have all had car trouble and paid through the nose simply because we are from out of town and we have all stayed at less than clean camp grounds where the items in the brochure didn't match up with what was actually available. We have all taken a wrong turn and ended up on the bad side of a large city.That is what makes this film a classic. People can identify with many of the troubles and adventures the Griswold's experience and we can laugh at them. Even if a not so great thing happens, years later we sit around and laugh about it.The only other film in the series to capture the same magic as this one was "Christmas Vacation".This film also started the John Hughes era. He wrote the script and went on to direct, write, and produce some other classic films like "The Breakfast Club", "16 Candles", and "Home Alone".10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a trend in recent years to over-value a succession of 80s comedies and National Lampoon's Vacation is a prime example. Released in 1983, the film performed strongly at the box office despite crummy to mediocre critical response and spawned a slew of increasingly more desperate and inane sequels, which somehow made the original seem better than it truly was. Chevy Chase is the imbecile head of the Griswold family who embark on a disaster-prone cross-country trip to Wally World theme park. There should be a lot of comedy to mine from the scenario, but the film only hits on a handful of true guffaws before running out of steam altogether well before its climax. Chase alternates between looking bored and manic. His Clark Griswold is not only an idiot, but more than a bit of a nasty jerk which fails to elicit much in the way of audience sympathy. Beverly D'Angelo, Anthony Michael Halls and Dana Barrons round out the wife and kids. Most people probably will not remember Barrons in the film at all, while D'Angelo and Hall keep trying to act long after the writers have stopped giving them anything to do. Imogene Coca shows up for a brief highlight as a demonized aunt and manages to showcase one of the movie's great weaknesses. The legendary Coca was arguably one of the funniest old school comediennes at the time and the film hands her nothing to work with until unceremoniously bumping her off and turning her cadaver into a sight gag. Even worse and utterly laughless is a criminally unfunny joke about Chase dragging a family pet to death after tying it to the bumper of the car. Randy Quaid and John Candy are both odiously underused, while supermodel Christie Brinkley is excess baggage through no fault of her own as a hottie who keeps running into the Griswolds on their trip and provides Chase with temptation to stray. Her role culminates in a staidly filmed skinnydip at a hotel pool, which will fail to sate the hormones of the fanboys who have responded to the film's hit-or-miss lowbrow humor. Harold Ramis' direction can complimentarily be described as wildly uneven. A great Lindsay Buckingham opening song is the film's strongest asset. An army of increasingly inferior sequels manage to make this one look stellar by comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood has just churned out a remake of Vacation, one of the most beloved comedies of the 1980s. The new version will no doubt be raunchier and dumber, but even if it were in competent hands, this film would be a hard one to top, even if it isn't perfect.Chevy Chase does a fantastic job depicting a family man, a loving husband and dad, who slowly loses his mind during a vacation. The humor is generally good, though there are a few bits which fall flat. The ending is priceless. John Candy may have limited screen time, but he is pure gold. Funny to think in a few years he would be playing the father driven mad during a vacation gone wrong in The Great Outdoors.Not really a classic, but still a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, But Not a Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong Vacation is an enjoyable and funny movie, but it isn't exactly the classic comedy that some have made it out to be.The concept of the ultimate family vacation is executed well and anyone who's ever been on a less than stellar vacation will be able to relate to it. Chevy Chase is the best thing about the film and he has a real gift for delivery and comedic timing. It's hard to picture the film working quite as well with another actor in the lead role. The humor is very much in the vein of comedies of the 80's being silly and completely over-the-top. While the majority of the humor works, there are a few gross-out gags and repetition of jokes that don't work well that keep the movie from being great. Vacation is a lot fun and has more than a few laughs to over, but it's simplicity makes it a bit forgettable. Maybe it's lost some of it's charm since it was released it the 80's, but it's still a very enjoyable comedy that's worth watching. I'd still say that Christmas Vacation sit the best of the series though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION (Harold Ramis, 1983) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third "National Lampoon" entry I have watched after ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) and Christmas VACATION (1989), the latter being the second sequel to the film under review itself. I recall being lukewarm on both of them, but this VACATION proved altogether more satisfactory; incidentally, the fact that the late John Hughes scripted it came as no surprise since the same basic premise ? a trip fraught by unforeseen calamities ? would be re-used for his own effort PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES (1987), which I actually watched this Thanksgiving and for which John Candy (given a minor role here) was elevated to co-star status. Chevy Chase is the cheerful everyman taking his family on a cross-country holiday from Chicago to the fictitious Disney-like amusement park "Walley World" in L.A. His troubles begin straight away as he is handed the wrong brand of vehicle for the occasion; when they go to see the wife's backwoods relatives on the way, the latter dump their cantankerous old aunt on them whom they are to take home to Arizona. This section is certainly the more amusing, especially the woman and her pet dog's own separate fates; another recurring presence on the road is that of a girl driving a red sports-car who flirts with Chase, culminating with them taking a nude midnight dip in a motel pool. Somewhat predictably, when the family finally does make it to "Walley World", it is temporarily closed down for repairs: Chase really loses his cool here (following a couple of brief foul-mouthed outbursts en route) and he holds watchman Candy at gunpoint while the hero and his brood take all the fun rides ? a desperate step which necessitates the intervention of not just the Police but the park's President in person (a welcome appearance by Eddie Bracken, na?ve and bumbling lead of a couple of Preston Sturges comedy classics back in the 1940s)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My All-Time Favourites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this movie for a while before I bought the 20th anniversary DVD about three months ago. This movie came out in 1983, which was the year that I started Kindergarten. I was about 10 or 11 the first time I saw the movie (it's rated 'R').The Wagon Queen Family Truckster looked goofy in the 80's, and looks even more goofy today. Driving such a Medusa car across the country is just one of many things that made this movie hilarious.This movie reminds me of vacations I took with my family when I was a kid. Fortunately, none of them turned out to be as disastrous as the Griswold's vacations. We never had old, cranky relatives in the back seat who died on the way to their destinations, our car being vandalized in the ghetto, jumping our car off the road in the middle of nowhere (that was a cool stunt by Dick Ziker), blonde girls driving Ferraris, and our destination being closed when we got there.My Dad got a speeding ticket on the way home from the cottage one time. That was the closest he came to dragging a dog to its death. (That part was a bit sad, actually).This movie brings back great memories for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Through!Vacation, to me, is a good comedy that is a definite must view ONCE but it isn't a definite must see over and over. Although, I did enjoy it when it came out so very long ago, I don't think of this as the best comedy ever or love it to the extent many others do.Some of the jokes were very, very funny and the actual premise was GREAT!! A father takes his family on a road trip and along the way experiences-well-the good, the bad, the ugly-just about everything! Great premise for a fun movie and vacation WAS fun but it definitely had parts that were more crass then funny and I could see the multiple viewing thing grating on you after awhile.I agree with the IMDb user who mentioned te scene where the dog is dragged by the car was not necessary. But it wasn't just THAT one scene-many times the movie seemed to be trying for laughs through shock value. It wasn't necessary, the truly funny parts were the more subdued. The "in your face" vulgarity that frequently surfaced wasn't necessary to make this pic good and actually detracted from it, I thought. This was a movie that was sometimes HILARIOUS, sometimes merely funny, but other times somewhat crude. I still think it was a pretty funny comedy, if I met someone who hadn't seen it(don't know many) I 'd recommend they give it a viewing. But I don't think the movie's perfect by any means and have seen better comedies. One thing I'll mention is the ending which I LOVED!! That was a plus and in spite of all the things that go wrong, the family members are grounded in love and the ending makes that clear. Great ending and great cameo By Christie Brinkley(I actually found the whole Brinkley subplot to be one of the funnier things in the movie). And despite all the twists and turns of this family's incredible road trip it puts you in the mood for your own vacation! Definitely had both positives and negatives but a must see once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether or not this movie was deemed to be a "comedy classic," but I'd never rank it that high. Altogether, I did enjoy it, partially thanks to the fact that I was able to put myself in the Griswolds' shoes and feel their relenting turmoil when they'd get into one disaster after another. The comedy, however, could've been a lot sharper. Most of the jokes are predictable. Come on, when Clark bit into that sandwich, was it really a surprise when you found out the dog peed on it? John Hughes, who wrote the script, obviously wasn't aiming for great punchlines. I got a lot more chuckles than full-fledged laughs, but it's still a funny, likable comedy. But I really could've done without that lamer-than-lame score. I like the theme song, "Holiday Road," but the rest of the music is almost vomit-inducing. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the never-ending series of National Lampoon's' movies, I only saw the vacation flicks and I can really place this one in the middle. Because "Christmas Vacation" is on number one, this one is on number two and "European Vacation" is on number 999 (check the respective comments to see why). Let's talk about this "American Vacation". Well, I can say that they still had Harold Ramis to direct this one, since it could really turn out a crappable movie - an american family travels to the other side of the country to see a theme park? Talk about thick premise... But this is exploited to the best that they can take of it, and this journey really looks good, Chevy Chase being the real clownish hero which manages to save the day thanks to a really naive and stubborn dedication to causes no other person would embrace. As he says during the movie "this is a quest". This phrase practically says it all. The movie really has its moments, and this makes it worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clark Griswold just wants to spend some time with his family. So he plans a big old family vacation, a cross-country drive from their home in Chicago to California. Ultimate destination: Wally World. That's Disneyland with a moose instead of a mouse. Unfortunately Clark's best-laid plans go horribly awry. You see, Clark is a bit of an idiot. And a rather spineless idiot at that, constantly taken advantage of. The tone is set right at the beginning when an unscrupulous car salesman foists a total lemon on Clark. And thus the Griswolds set out on the road in the Wagon Queen Family Truckster, the most ludicrous station wagon to ever hit the highway. Let the laughs begin. Except...where are the laughs?Vacation is a movie which has acquired a glowing reputation but truth be told it just isn't funny enough. There are no huge laughs. There really aren't even that many mild chuckles. Much of the humor falls flat and there are some lengthy lulls where there is absolutely nothing funny going on. Chevy Chase puts in a game effort as the bumbling Clark but he gets very little help. Beverly D'Angelo has nary a funny moment as Clark's wife. The two kids are nothing more than annoyances, unfunny annoyances at that. A stop at Cousin Eddie's house to meet up with the Griswold hillbilly relations provides a few decent jokes but some real groaners as well. This pit-stop also saddles the Griswolds and us with Aunt Edna, a character which doesn't work at all. Anything funny the movie tries to do with her pretty much fails completely. The Griswold family adventure continues, mishaps and misadventures all along the way. The movie tries for a madcap big finish. It needed a big finish after being rather mundane throughout. But much like everything else that finish is a bit of a dud too. It's a movie which has its moments. But not nearly enough of them to make you want to relive the Griswold family journey again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy of mishaps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by his own family holiday disasters, John Hughes wrote this comedy of mishaps for the National Lampoon crew.Chevy Chase plays the goofy, very stupid Mr. Griswald, a man who has determined to drive his wife and two children (Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron) from Chicago to LA to see Walley World, no matter what the cost.Not the funniest movie on offer from Hughes, Harold Ramis (director) or Chevy Chase, but this family road movie remains fairly amusing throughout. The comedy is never sharp nor brilliant, rather it is a combination of comic catastrophes and predictable predicaments. Reasonable.Sunday, August 22, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Summer Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>National Lampoon's Vacation in my mind is one of the best Summer movies of all time. This is a definite summer movie classic to rent. I remember when this first came out, it was the biggest National Lampoon movie ever. It was my favorite National Lampoon movie of all of them. Christman Vacation was good but this is just a classic.Meatballs tried to beat this movie, but everyone has to agree that Vacation was better by far. Walley World is the best idea ever for a movie I still can't believe how well John Candy played that part.John Candy is hilarious he is a definite funny fat man he stole the show in this movie, he did really. Everyone has to believe that John Candy stole the show. That is true.My thoughts are with you John Candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rememdered it as a really funny movie but not so funny now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well i rented this movie expecting the world as i distinctly remember seeing it as a child ...now I'm not sure which of the vacations i saw but this movie let my expectations down.Not that this movie lacks the kind of humour i normally enjoy but somehow maybe the really high expectations that i set for this movie was the reason i really couldn't enjoy this movie.I mean put a hot wife, a hot girl in a Ferrari an irritating old woman who dies, jokes about southerners, drug use and normally this would be a winning formula anytime i decide to watch such crude comedies.I mean face it if you rent such a movie your not expecting some cinematic masterpiece your looking for some childish fun.Chevy chase was fantastic in this movie and it was fun seeing so many faces that are recognisable in todays comedies. The sound was mono though i really felt that National Lampoon could have easily remastered the movie into at least 2 channel sound.But alas although this movie had some really funny moment and some humour bordering on intelligent. I really didn't like this movie too much.However this movie deserves as 6 because i know in different circumstances i would probably would have enjoyed this movie a great deal and indeed did albeit many many years back.Give it some slack expect crude fun and rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>national lampoons vacation can be a great film to some to others it can be terrible so which kind of person are you? Vacation was funny at times stupid at others and like i said depending how you were you could either put up with the dumb bits and enjoy the funnys or grow tired easily.I was in between at its best it would have me in a fit but there was a lot of dead time in this film so be warned. Not one of the most fast paced comedies it does have some dull times.anthony michale hall was brilliant in this film as rusty.Chevey chase is one of my favorit actors or should i say was until he hit the nineties.in summing up i gave this movie a 5 and i know there will be a lot of people who will argue that it deserves higher or lower but that's my assessment of it. hit or miss?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very basic ? barely made me laugh more than a handful of times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Griswold decides to have some quality time with his family and drive from Chicago to California to spend an holiday at the WallyWorld theme park. However being accident prone is not a great start for a 2 week road trip and mishap follows mishap the whole way West.National Lampoon is never a stable to avoid targeting stereotypical groups and with the `Vacation' series they target the WASP family with 2.3 kids taking road holidays in the USA. However many of us may be able to identify with holidays taking in things such as `The House of Mud' and ` The Second Largest Ball Of Twine In the World'! However the humour here never gets to the level where it is sharply making fun of how the middle classes holiday ? instead it is like one other critic described it `one big long banana skin joke'.This is totally true ? the humour never gets above silly and I found myself laughing very rarely and mostly only smiled out of how silly it was. Chase is OK here and his style suits the comedy. D'Angelo seems content to flash her breasts as she has little else to do to help the comedy. The rest of the cast is made up of some interesting faces ? Quaid, Anthony Hall, Candy, Levy (Jim's Dad) and early appearances from Krakowski (Ally McBeal) and Navin (The Toughest Man in the World &amp; the first customer in Cheers!).Overall this is basic and the fact that it created 3 sequels make it's even more regrettable. The comedy never rises above crude or silly routines and will please you if you're drunk or very easily pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbest Movie In all of History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely the worst movie of all time. It isn't possible to put into words how badly this movie sucks. It is the black hole of movies it sucks so badly light can't even escape it. It sets the standard for lemon movies worthy of complete erasure. It could be used for torture, I'm sure its regular viewing at Gitmo.The characters are so devoid of intelligence they make pond slime look smart.Don't even waste your time watching the trailer or a review.Chevy Chase will go down in history as the worst actor ever to waste film. It could be used by the medical establishment to induce vomiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well, it is one big length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it is because I am from Europe and there are slight but definite differences in the definition of humour.Anyway I had many good laughs on many hollywood movies. not on this one. definitely not. The film does not really have a plot, i almost never laughed or even smiled and i gave up on it 10 minutes before the end.nothing more to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that I'm in a minority. Yes, the film IS directed by Harold Ramis, who was responsible for the delightful `Groundhog Day'; and it was written by John Hughes, who wrote some pretty good scripts in the 1980s. I'll even admit there are funny moments, although the only one which really gets me is the climax in Wally World. (It's a proper comic climax, I'll give it that.) But ... ... spoiler ahead ...I don't hold with cinematic cruelty to dogs. Not that it can't be done funnily - see, for instance, `A Fish Called Wanda'. But it ain't funny here. The Griswolds tie a dog to the back of their car and drive off; later, they (and we) are only reminded of the dog when a policeman pulls them over for having killed it. As I've described it the scene could yet be funny. Instead it comes across as merely sick. A nasty mind was at work here: the writing, like so much of the film's writing, is just plain tacky, something that makes us cringe while we think we're being amused. Hughes doesn't even seem to be taking a joyous delight in stepping outside the bounds of good taste. He drags out the scene in a leaden way until it cries out to the heavens to be finished and done with. This is NOT black comedy, whatever else it is. Black comedy is a wine: this is rather a shot of unadulterated gin which leaves a sour taste in your mouth and makes you feel as though you've been clubbed on the back of the head.There's poetic justice in the way `Vacation' has aged. It takes such grim delight in making fun of its uncool and behind-the-times protagonists. It now looks even more out of date than they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting, cruel and offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah what to say about vacation. The entire movie can be summed up in two words `Stupid' and `Horrendous'. In fact if it were possible to give negative ratings on the IMDB scale, I would do so for this movie. I very seldom hate movies, but I cannot even stand the thought of this one. It is one thing to have slapstick humour, but this goes beyond the pale to just plain tasteless and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. There is nothing funny about most of the jokes in this film (a grandmother dying in the car is not funny, it's sad and strapping her to the roof and leaving her in the rain is just plain disgusting and disrespectful). The entire movie, in fact all the Vacation movies (and there are FAR too many) is nothing more than a series of crude humour and disgusting jokes that go beyond the borders of black humour and into the realms of just plain cruel. If this is the best comedy the 80's could produce, you're better off looking at the classics or the moderns and leaving 80's in the dust.</fullReview>
