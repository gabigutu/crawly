		<shortDescription>"Ummm... Filled with such fun good fellowship..."- Nathan Detroit, "Guys and Dolls"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guys and Dolls" is a thoroughly enjoyable example of musical comedy at its very best. The acting is impeccable, and what's more, almost believable (for a musical at least), the singing is pretty decent (well, Marlon Brando is another story, but I'll get to that) and the whole thing is just so amusing and entertaining that you'll be singing the tunes and quoting the lines long after you've finished watching it. Critics and viewers seem to sometimes have a difficult time with taking the film too seriously, by this I mean that a) Marlon Brando was not cast because of his singing voice (which was admittedly not good, but bearable), I like to think it was because he had irresistible charm, b) the whole premise is so unbelievable, to which I say, "name me a musical that IS wholly believable", and c) the movie moves too slowly, which is patently absurd, unless one does not have a taste for the slower pace of old movies and long, well articulated dance numbers, and romantic love scenes. This film pre-dates my existence by some 3 decades, but it still manages to rank among my very favorite pieces of movie-making and is an absolute must-see for musical and non-musical fans alike. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Times Square according to Damon Runyon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Damon Runyon's world of Times Square, in New York, prior to its Disneyfication, is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about movies, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world" that show us that underside of New York of the past. Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area. People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights, the action, the possibilities in that part of town. This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense.Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film. We don't know whether this makes sense, but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage. That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution.The film, visually, is amazing. The look follows closely the fashions of the times. As far as the casting of Marlon Brando, otherwise not known for his singing abilities, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, seem to work in the film. Sky Masterson is, after all, a man's man, who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different 'look'. Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, as Sarah Brown, does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save.Vivian Blaine is a delight. She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold who's Nathan Detroit's love interest. Ms. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be. Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson.The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows, who made the adaptation to the screen. The costumes by Irene Sharaff set the right tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a great screen adaptation of a stage classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954 Marlon Brando was THE hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had yet to re-invent himself on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portrayal as the erstwhile Nathan Detroit, helped re-establish Sinatra with his fans.It is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? This was his one and only singing role as he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition the female leads, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine(replaying her stage role as Nathan's long suffering girlfriend Adelade), put in superlative efforts. Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye(as Nicely Nicely), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no one's version of Rockin' The Boat even comes close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who would go on to fame as TV producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does "Harry The Horse" wonders, B.S.Pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking "Big Julie", and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "Brother Arvide".It is one of the fun musicals to see, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother..."it's your dice"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Still It's Better Than Even Money"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title song of Guys and Dolls philosophizes what we guys will not do to our dolls to win a bet or get a dice game going. That's the dilemma facing promoter of said dice game Nathan Detroit who can't come up with the $1000.00 for the Biltmore Hotel garage for the what is generally known as the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York.What to do, bet a reckless gambler Sky Masterson. Sucker him into betting he can't sweep a doll off her feet for a romantic idyll in pre-Castro Havana. The doll you pick for Sky is Sister Sarah Brown of the Salvation Army. Of course Nathan's life is also complicated by his 14 year long engagement to Adelaide of the Hot Box Revue.Considering the resentments that festered between Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra who played Sky and Nathan, I can't believe this film got made at all. Especially when you consider both these guys never hesitated in walking off film sets if their anger was aroused. In Sinatra's case I can understand since Brando's playing the part he should have done. Proof of that can be found on Guys and Dolls cast album that Sinatra did for his Reprise record label in the early sixties where he shows what he could do with the Masterson songs.Still Brando is not great, but not bad as a singer and Frank Loesser did write the Adelaide song for Sinatra for the film. Unfortunately he also wrote A Woman In Love for the score which Brando sings and which became a big hit. Not for Marlon Brando, but for another Frankie named Laine.Jean Simmons is our Salvation Army Sergeant and she shows once again why was the most under appreciated film star of the fifties. That woman was in so many of the best films of that decade and never got any real recognition for her talent. I like her the best from this movie.Vivian Blaine, Johnny Silver, B.S. Pully, and Stubby Kaye all came over from the original Broadway cast. They all contribute their unique talents to parts that became career roles for them. With some smarter casting it's better than even money that Guys and Dolls would be a great and not a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Mankiewicz is a film genius, in my mind one of very few intelligent men in the old Hollywood until destroyed by Cleopatra. But here he is in his element.Here's the opportunity: it is as far from Broadway to film as from a book, comic, or TeeVee show. In fact the distance is greater because it is apparently less.And since Mankiewicz is an intelligent writer (who makes up a lot as he goes), he has here devised three films in one: three visions co-existing.We have the Broadway piece, supported by actors from the show. Mostly, this is nicely in the `stage' numbers at the Hotbox plus anything from Adelaide, but there are two male dance set scenes in this vein. And the `siddown you're rocking the boat' number.Then we have the Frankie stuff. Adelaide is played straight -- that is she is played as a stage character, a fiction. Frank plays himself, because he actually is a cheap hood. The director relaxes all these scenes, and the music is allowed to become languid. See how the sets and camera differ for him.But the most remarkable is Brando. He is in his prime here. What he does is act the role of a Broadway actor! Watch him look at the camera in fleeting moments as if to say, watch me do this. I can't sing or dance, but I can become someone who can. As with the Sinatra songs, the musical tone is adjusted for Marlon (and Simmons), to become led by the orchestra rather than the other way around as with `real' Broadwayites.Mankiewicz had just directed Brando in Shakespeare, and knew what he had. Check this out -- it is the first selfreferential film musical, and you can't watch `Dancer in the Dark' or `Moulin Rouge,' without referencing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, its the one where the gamblers find a sort of redemption in their dolls after much singing and dancing and stuff. Maybe. This film seems to have lived alongside me for years - round exam time, through getting ditched, you name it. Sister Sarah and Sky and Nathan and Miss Adelaide and their chums were always there with those great Loesser melodies. Top of the tree is the Luck Be A Lady number which Brando puts across quite nicely, despite hardly being a singer. His great charm makes him a very good Sky. The scenes in Havana are hilarious and Vivian Blaine back at the club gives good value in her two big stage numbers. Looks like it belongs in a theatre, this film, but I bet you remember the tunes and huge chunks of the dialogue for a long time afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Some Very Good Sequences; A Bit Uneven Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something of a mixed bag, the screen version of "Guys and Dolls" is worth seeing for the cast and for a number of very good sequences. Its main drawbacks are that it is rather uneven, and that there are too many times when the pace slows down, making it somewhat overlong.The cast is good, although the performers do not always get the chance to use their abilities as fully as they could have. Frank Sinatra is always good in any singing role, but his character here does not give him much to work with aside from the songs. Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons were interesting choices. There are times when they work well, and other times when the material really doesn't suit them all that well.The story is entertaining, yet slight, and is certainly not meant to be taken as anything more than a pretext for the musical numbers. The songs are good in general, with "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" as the highlight. Yet not all of them quite reach that standard, for one reason or another.Overall, the movie is not bad, just not as much as you might hope for given who and what went into it. It's possible that this is simply a show that works better on stage, or it's possible that the movie could have been even better with a few improvements here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of its own time, and still memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with South Pacific, Guys and Dolls is for grown-ups - - it is sassy, sexy, and full of men being men and women being strung along.There is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the strength of Jean Simmond's performance, and the charm of a young Brando, and an already masterful Sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece.Guys and Dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is: an MGM musical.Still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th Century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come.Warmly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I like this film I can still see the missed opportunities. It does work, Brando has a certain charm as Sky Masterson but be honest, he cant really do justice to the multitude of classic songs he has got. This is where the dilemma lies. Sinatra is a fantastic Nathan Detroit, but he doesnt get many songs. Sinatra could easily play both roles but Brando would not make a good Detroit. However getting these to together in a film as well as the unlikely opportunity of getting Brando singing and dancing in a musical (!!!) is its saving grace. Any other actor and it may have seemed as bizarre as it really was. However its carried off with style. Its lunacy is its backbone, heres an established "serious" actor crooning and dancing, while the serious singer acts more than he sings. Its not often you see Sinatra taking a back seat; albeit reluctantly! A great film for what it is, but if it had been given to a musical director I think it would have been in a completely different league.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's chemistry! Enduring and quirky musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards (or sympathy for!) Sinatra in the other reviews here. I've read elsewhere that Sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for *not* being cast as Sky Masterson.OK, so who wouldn't want to be cast as Sky Masterson? ? it's a great part: the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet, in which he must take Salvation Army Sargeant Sarah Brown on a date to Cuba, or lose. It's not the money ? it's the pride, but he and she meet their match. Meanwhile Nathan Detroit must juggle his long-suffering fiancée Adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it doesn't alienate his fiancée forever first.The film started life as a series of short stories by Damon Runyon: that's his unique dialogue you hear, and those are his great character names, and that's his horse-racing/nightclub/late night gambling world. Then it became a musical, and you can't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage. The camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably ? and not pleasingly ? flat and childlike. Fortunately the music is so great, I don't care that much.My absolute favourite thing about this film, though, is the singing and acting of the two non-singers, Brando (as Sky) and Jean Simmons (as Sargeant Sarah Brown). Of course, putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music; but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead: what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto, acting ability, and pathos, pathos, pathos. You're with Sky as he argues with Sarah against reason, steadiness, pipes and safety. You enjoy Sarah's loosening up under the influence of Cuban "milk". You feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home. As Sky rightly says, it's "chemistry". Pro singers ? be they Broadway belters or smooth crooners ? can't necessarily be relied on to make this happen. (And they certainly didn't.) I read somewhere that Brando criticised Sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of Nathan Detroit. Sinatra in turn was infuriated by Brando's four-take acting method. As a Brando fan (does it show?!) I'm bound to take the other side, but I can't imagine that this film would have been the much-adored classic it is today if Brando and Simmons hadn't been in it with their wonderful chemistry; Brando's unpredictability; Simmons' face, all pink cheeks and brown hair, drunk and ashamed in a Cuban bar. Beautiful. I'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case I need to feel good again. You'll forgive me if give some of the Nathan (sleep)talking parts the 100% brush-off though, won't you? You won't? Oh, be quiet and have some more of Mindy's cheesecake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Parts Still Shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost seems like they went out of their way to muck up this film as best they could. First they dropped several great songs from the original score ("Bushel And A Peck", "I've Never Been In Love Before", "More I Cannot Wish You", "Marry The Man Today") and replaced them with songs that are distinctly inferior. Then they badly miscast Marlon Brando in the lead (his one great moment in the film is when he delivers the line, "Dad, I've got cider in my ear!") and tampered with the ending, in effect eliminating the final punchline of the show.But what makes "Guys And Dolls" ultimately different from other Broadways shows mucked up by the movies is that the parts that are great elevate the film so much that you can be charitable for the mistakes made. Jean Simmons' lack of vocal training hurts "I'll Know" but she redeems herself wonderfully on "If I Were A Bell" and gives a great performance overall as Sister Sarah Brown. And thank goodness Stubby Kaye's memorable "Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat" was transferred intact. Great sets and other supporting characters also help too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the smalltime gambler Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has been eloping from getting married with his girlfriend Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) for fourteen years. Nathan needs one thousand dollars in advance to rent a place for the crap game but neither he nor his friends Nicely- Nicely Johnson (Stubby Kaye) and Benny Southstreet (Johnny Silver) can afford. Nathan decides to bet against the gambler Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), challenging him to have a dinner in Havana with a woman of his choice. Sky accepts the bet and Nathan chooses the prude Sergeant Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), who runs a mission for sinners. Sky visits Sarah and invites her to have dinner with him in Havana; in return, he would bring one dozen sinners to the mission. Sarah refuses the deal, but when General Cartwright (Kathryn Givney) comes to New York to shutdown the mission, Sarah feels that the only chance to keep the mission operating is accepting Sky's invitation. They travel to Havana and fall in love with each other; but when they return to the mission, Sarah discovers that Nathan used the place for his crap game. Further, she believes that Sky has plotted the scheme to use her. Now Sky has to convince the gamblers and gangsters that arrived in New York to the crap game that they should go to the mission to help Sarah."Guys and Dolls" is a delightful musical version of a Broadway successful play with Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The romantic comedy is highly funny and entertaining with great musical numbers. Marlon Brando dances and sings and the number in Havana with Jean Simmons if one of the funniest moments of this movie. Despite the running time of 150 minutes, the viewer never feels tired or bored. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Eles e Elas" ("They (he) and They (she)")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luck WAS a lady with this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{Possible spoilers coming up... you've been forewarned.}This is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen. This is, for the most part, DEFINITELY not the case here.The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer)All of the actors "bounce the ball" (that is, have unbeatable chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York, and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things-- such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. Sweet, fresh faced Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true, her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman)-- the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all. And last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, reprising her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide-- the Hot Box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to Nathan with marriage, and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he's given her.First off, kudos to Stubby Kaye and B.S. Pulley as they reprise their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys.Brando is superb, as usual, and though he's not got the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it-- as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me chills every time I see him perform the number. Especially enjoyable is hearing him say "Daddy... I got cider in my ear."Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks, voice and the way she carries herself. You long so dearly for her not only to win Sky (or, toward the end, believe him), but to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and live a life with God. Her rendition of "If I Were A Bell" is splendid, to say the least!Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit-- and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never could (terrific actor, but the chap was tone deaf... go figure). I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide"... wish some guy would sing like that to ME. Frankie's cool, slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide.And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just sheer perfection in this role. From the accent to her belting out "Adelaide's Lament", she's just terrific. And she's also my favorite part of the entire movie. She really makes you feel for Adelaide... especially when she cries right before and then again during "Sue Me". I still haven't decided whether I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck"... maybe I like them equally. Either way, she does fantastic with those as well as "Take Back Your Mink." (I'm sad that they left out "hollanderize" from the film...) She's absolutely MARVELOUS, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the entire film.One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It's a mixture of high class and street slang. Never do they use "It's", "I'll" or "That's." It's always "It is", "I will" and "That is." Overall, Guys &amp; Dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals, and it's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on. My only complaint? No "Marry The Man Today." Now THAT'S a good song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters. Sky Masterson(Marlon Brando) is a high-class gambler who takes up a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for one-thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he canrun his usual crap game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky wouldn't be able to take just any girl to Havana, Cuba and the "doll" he chose was SarahBrown (Jean Simmons) who was in charge of a missionary. Sky finally bribesSarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he had no part in. Nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone. Nathan's 14 year fiancé Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapproves of Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it. However, when the movie ends it all ends happy with a doublewedding.The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it. MarlonBrando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it didn't really matter. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously seeing as it's Brando) and played his character very well. I have seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one, she also couldn'tsing at all. However, the singing is made up by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine, and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye was also in the originalBroadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like musical, and even if you don't, i advise you to watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of musicals, I saw Guys and Dolls, and was really impressed with it. The film does look great, with elegant set design and cinematography while the scenery and costumes are pleasing to the eye too. The score is outstanding, all the songs are so good and the accompanying music is very energetic, while the choreography just adds to the energetic feel of the film. It is very well-directed, has some great witty dialogue and an engaging story and characters.Also, although the film is about two and a half hours, it doesn't feel like it. Thanks to the quality of the songs, choreography and performances the whole film whizzes by right up to its conclusion. Marlon Brando just exudes charisma as Sky, and Jean Simmons is a perfect match as Sarah. Even if their singing is not amazing, it is compensated by their acting and the chemistry between them. Frank Sinatra shows a great voice and appealing presence as well, and his acting is reasonable enough. All in all, a hugely entertaining musical with lots to like. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.It's true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing.I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" is a foot-tappin', sing-a-long that I just love. He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his the best.Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs.I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part, it made sense.Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it were being re staged in the year 2008, I would not change a thing.I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage, even though it was on film.I thought the movie was well cast. I performed in regional versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening says it all. Or rather, shows it. A beautifully choreographed piece sets the tone of the film, the city, and the characters. As we follow a watch being stolen numerous times, it shows us the petty crime, and the fun and exuberant dances show us the whimsical nature. Sinatra is great as Nathan Detroit, and Brando shows us a completely new side to himself. Sure, his singing may have been cut and pasted from multiple takes, but cinema is all abut creating illusions. The film may be gentle and obvious, but none can deny the sheer excellence of routines, such as the sewer craps game. Making good use of color, movement, humor, and songs, this is a classically addictive film.</fullReview>

I couldn't stand violence, death, scary netherworld creatures of any kind, etc. Those gave me nightmares and made me cry for hours. Guys and Dolls was a gentle, musical story about people falling in love and working things out... I loved it. To this day, over 50 years later, I remember this movie as a rollicking but gentle good time for even a child who couldn't stand to see 'bad things'. Yet, the story itself is not a kid's story - it involves gamblers who skate both sides of the law, and the girls who attempt to tame the wayward men (reaffirming the popular belief that men are naughty and women make something of them!) Hey it was the 1950s, eh? It was a more innocent time, but certainly not sedate -- it was a time of gamblers in tilted fedoras and impressive platinum hairdos...</fullReview>

Sadly, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece. With these two flaws in mind, the movie is otherwise magnificent. Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can't sing worth beans, but pulls it off anyway. Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role (it was written for him). Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well. This is on my see-it-every-chance-I-get list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a famous musical and this version casts a great actor but unfortunately not one known for his singing and dancing abilities. The story is about two guys who make a bet. Nathan Detroit (himself engaged for many years to a showgirl) who is running a permanent craps game in New York bets top gambler Sky Masterson that he cannot take a doll of his choosing to the then party and gambling capital, Havana. That girl Nathan picks is Sister Sarah Brown of the Salvation Army mission.Of course in Havana both Sky and Sister Sarah with the aid of sweet milk fall for each other. In New York Nathan is getting pressured to elope with Adelaide.The film has a stage bound setting with some arch but playful dancing. It was probably regarded as avantgarde and hip at that time, although a few moves were copied many years later by Micheal Jackson in his Smooth Criminal video.Vivian Blaine, Johnny Silver and Stubby Kaye were in the original Broadway play and its shows in their performance in contrast with Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando. Sinatra's acting is less convincing although his singing is fine. Brando's Sky Masterson is measured and masterful but of course the singing is average at best with just the dancing in Havana that stands out. Even Jean Simmons who looks beautiful was not that great at the singing and I doubt she was that much stretched with the acting in my opinion.As for the songs Guys and Dolls has a few signature and now famous songs, but there is also a lot of forgettable filler songs that seems to have always plagued musicals.Ironically its the casting of Brando that drew me to this version and it is his acting that kept me watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my least favourite musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GUYS AND DOLLS should be a fantastic, show-stopping musical...but it isn't. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something about this one that leaves me a little cold. Sure, it looks the part, and the cast is fine, but it's the storyline that I find lacking. It's just a little defunct, a little set back, so that you never really get involved with the various characters and their relationships.The problem I find with some musicals is that, between the song-and-dance numbers, they can be a little, well, dull. That's the case with GUYS AND DOLLS, particularly early on. This is an overlong film that feels notably drawn out, especially in the first half. Even worse, it lacks the razzmatazz that you come to expect from a Hollywood musical during the golden era.There's little to dislike in the pairing of Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra, but to be fair these two don't get much screen time. I found the character played by Jean Simmons - a prim-and-proper Salvation Army girl - drained energy from the proceedings. It doesn't help that the songs aren't all that memorable, either, with the exception of the climactic "luck be a lady" number, which is the sole moment when GUYS AND DOLLS feels like a "proper" musical. Sadly, the rest is just so-so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls was regarded as a bit of a disappointment when it came out in 1955, but it's surprising just how much fun it is. Damon Runyon's elegantly stylised dialog is complemented by the wonderful production design of a stylised New York that's as unreal as the characters while at the same time not overstated enough to make it purely an exercise in style over substance. The score is a real killer, with more great numbers than any musical deserves, and Michael Kidd's wondrously energetic and imaginative choreography is amazing without ever overwhelming the film. The casting is pitch perfect even if Brando isn't a great singer and Sinatra hated the film because he wanted to play Sky Masterson instead of good old reliable Nathan Detroit. The two and a half hours just float by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the New York's longest- established floating craps game, and he needs $1000 to secure a new location. Confident of his odds, he bets the city's highest-roller, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can't woo uptight missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues. Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial. As I write this review, I've just received word that Jean Simmons has passed away, age 80. This, unbelievably, was the first time I'd seen her in a film, yet she dazzled me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually-repressed Sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in Havana, letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of "If I Were A Bell." Even though both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals, contending that "maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you." Despite Goldwyn's backhanded confidence, the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same child-like liveliness that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role, and Brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there.</fullReview>

Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson. The fact that he couldn't sing added to his character. The ladies in the film were alright, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show.It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the Mafia. "Guys and Dolls," the seemingly indestructible stage musical, was captured on film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful, enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including Vivian Blaine (from the original Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character bears an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of the all-time great leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom had recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and were on the top of their game. One listen to Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings down the house with "Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat." The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it's all great fun, and even the gentle kidding of the Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion. Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works on levels it should not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves that he is. Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can't sing too well. He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors do their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit. Still, Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guys and Dolls on Reel 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What many people don't know is that I started in musical theater before I got into film-making, so my familiarity with Guys and Dolls, in all its incarnations, goes back a long way. (Fun fact: Did you know that Damon Runyan's character of Sky Masterson was actually based on famed Western lawman Bat Masterson, who actually lived the last part of his life in NYC?). And the plain fact remains: I've never liked the show to begin with so director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve) and his creative team had their work cut out for them if they were going to change my mind.There is one key improvement the film makes over the show and that relates to the character of Sarah Brown. As written in the show, Brown is a flat, uninteresting character, but here Jean Simmons, with the help of some fine rewriting by Mankiewicz elevates the character to a new level and gives her much-needed depth. I have already expounded upon the wonders of Jean Simmons in the blog for The Robe and her legend increases here. Apparently, she even used her own voice for the songs, which is noble, even though she struggled on some of them (as did co-star Brando). Her version of "If I Were a Bell", though, is even better than the original from the show, especially given the change in orchestration from a soprano ballad to an upbeat alto song. As a matter of fact, the best scenes in the whole film are the snappy dialogue scenes between Brando and Simmons, those scenes in which they really get to act. It seems that Mankiewicz really took his time to work on these scenes ? especially as a writer ? and improve on a part of the show that came off as trite.Conversely, he seems to have de-emphasized the most memorable character from the show, Adelaide, played in both versions by Vivian Blaine. One of her key songs ("A Bushel and a Peck") was cut (or actually replaced with something less memorable), the balance of screen time severely shifted toward the other couple and her more famous punch lines that would draw guffaws in a live audience seem to flounder and die on the screen. The film is really long as it is, so I guess something had to go ? it's just odd that Mank (Mr. Mankiewicz's nickname throughout his career) would trifle with one of the keys to the success of the show.The biggest disappointment in the film version of G&amp;D are the musical numbers themselves and as you can imagine, in a movie musical, that's a big problem to have. Too much screen time was given to choreographer Michael Kidd to play with ? his dancers are often acrobatic, but rarely are they (and their blocking) interesting enough to warrant the time spent on them (Kidd does a much better job in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers). The opening sequence is a perfect example ? Kidd seems to be doing an homage to the final sequence in 42nd Street with his dancers/performers doing little vignettes to give the flavor of the Times Square life at the time. But Kidd is no Busby Berkley. First of all, Berkley was less than a choreographer with dancers than he was with the camera. Secondly, Berkley was a better storyteller. Kidd's vignettes are lifeless and boring ? Berkley managed to weave tap dancing, comedy, fun, high drama, sex and political commentary all into the six or seven minute sequence. Kidd barely manages a laugh here. I'm surprised Mankiewicz gave him that much of a leash ? it seems a much better opening would have been a long track through the streets (sans vignettes) into a tight shot of the racing forms. The racing horn starts. Pull out to reveal out three singers and start the fugue. There's your opening ? efficient, cinematic and effective.I don't mean to wholly blame Kidd for the failure of the numbers. Mankiewicz is also culpable - he doesn't seem to know how to shoot a musical sequence. The shot choices are unusual and often poor. Musical sequences and dances require more coverage than usual ? they need to match the rhythm of the music and perhaps more importantly, the shot choices have to take advantage of being a movie. In other words, Mank frequently used static long shots, presumably shot on a sound stage. How is it really all that different from seeing it on stage? (For a good example of movie musical film-making, check out Meet Me in St. Louis ? Minnelli's masterpiece of camera usage and the mise-en-scene).You can certainly argue that I had a predisposition against Guys and Dolls to begin with and that explains my negativity. And there's something to that ? I only like two or three of the songs, I don't like the stylized way in which the gamblers talk and worst of all, the story just isn't that good. I heartily commend Mankiewicz for his efforts to shore up the screenplay, but it seems even some of Hollywood's greatest can't turn water into wine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando and Simmons save it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This musical was not quite what I expected, foremost being there weren't many scenes between Brando and Sinatra. As it was based on a Damon Runyon story, I expected irony and surprise, of which there was one really good one - when we find that Sinatra's gang has used the Salvation Army office for their crap game while Brando was in Havana with Simmons. If course it comes at the right moment too, when Brando brings her back. I really didn't expect much from Brando as a singer, but he surprised me. He wasn't great but he was just fine in the role. His big number in the sewer, however, with the rest of Sinatra's boys was the only place I felt Brando's voice was weak. He just didn't have the power the grand climax demanded. Overall I found the scenes between Brando and Simmons to be filled with electricity, something I didn't think would happen when we first see Simmons by herself, and later when we're introduced to Brando in the restaurant with Sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him. It wasn't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life. Frank Sinatra, on the other hand, was flat, even his vocal performances. And Vivian Blaine, who I never heard of, but who I guess played the role on Broadway, just seemed to slow the proceedings down. The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious. Also, her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character. On top of that, all the Goldwyn Girls numbers seemed shoe horned in, just there for glitz. For example, when Frank meets with Brando in the nightclub, we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number - then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there hadn't been any dance number at all. Whenever Brando and Simmons were on screen, I was having a great time, but each time we return to the Sinatra-Blaine story, my interest level waned. As for the songs, there were some good ones, particularly the very first number with Stubby Kaye, the Fugue for Tinhorns number (Can Do!). That's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in The Music Man - Cash for the Merchandise... whatever it's called. And the number in the sewer - I couldn't help but be reminded of "Cool" from West Side Story - which brings me to a point. I really did not like the art direction in this film. The fake Times Square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself. Same for the Havana sequence, and particularly the sewer. I realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets, but things were changing - Carousel, for example, made great use of location photography. Even On the Town shot scenes in Mahattan in 1949. By the time we get to West Side Story in 1961 it's a given that stuff taking place in Manhattan had to be actually shot in Manhattan. So by comparison, Guys and Dolls set-bound Manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute. And changing Lindy's to Mindy's - did they really have to do that for legal reasons? Now, I always thought Guys and Dolls was a musical about Sinatra and Brando and their adventures with various girls. It was much more focused than that, which is to its credit. In that regard it is much better than Les Girls, which was interesting in it's own right, but had a certain shallowness to it. My one major complaint about Guys and Dolls, and I don't know if this is endemic to the original stage show, but when Jean Simmons realizes that Brando never took any money for a bet that he made with Sinatra and even said that he lost the bet, she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding. It seems to me a scene between Brando and Simmons would have added to the impact of the story. To see Brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene. There is such a scene in The Music Man (SPOILERS AHEAD), when Harold and Marion have that duet while he's waiting for her to change. She's upstairs in her house, he's down on the sidewalk. He's singing 76 Trombones. She's singing Goodnight My Someone. They suddenly switch and sing each other's songs - a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other. It's an emotional high moment of the film. Still, Guys and Dolls had a lot going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay film version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an "okay" film version of the smash Broadway hit. Part of the problem was the strange casting of Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons in the leads. That was just nutty when there were plenty of more than competent singer/actors in Hollywood at the time. Actually, Sinatra could easily have been cast as Sky Masterson. That part was much more his style than the comic Nathan Detroit. What was wrong with Gene Kelly or Dean Martin as Sky? Any of those three would have been a huge improvement over Brando. And Jean Simmons? Where was Jane Powell or Ann Blyth? I would have even tolerated Kathryn Grayson in the role, if a bit too operatic sounding for it. And Sinatra as Nathan Detroit? That was just plain silliness casting a bona fide singer in an essentially non-singing role. Someone in an earlier comment mentioned Phil Silvers. That would have been wonderful casting. As it was, the musical part of the Nathan Detroit role was significantly beefed up for Sinatra.Which brings me to another comment. What was with cutting some beautiful numbers from the original score (My Time Of Day, I've Never Been In Love Before, Marry The Man Today, Bushel And A Peck, More I Cannot Wish You), and putting in those awful replacement numbers (A Woman In Love, Adelaide, Pet Me Poppa)? Hollywood strikes again! With that said, there are some very good aspects to the film. It stayed fairly true to the original stage production, and although their singing was less than stellar, Brando and Simmons gave fine performances, as did the bulk of the cast.One small comment to the person who talked about it not being "realistic". "Guys and Dolls" was never meant to be realistic. The stage production was billed as "A Musical Fable Of Broadway". Also consider the source material. Damon Runyon's stories about the New York underworld were never meant to be realistic portrayals of the real-life mobsters of New York City. I also think that many people out there have missed the whole idea behind musicals, especially musical comedy. In musicals, people sing and/or dance when their emotions become too strong to simply speak what they want to say. It's much more effective for Sarah Brown to sing about the way she feels when she realizes she's in love with Sky than for her to say, "If I were a bell I'd want to ring right now." Adelaide says so much more in her musical lament than she ever could with a speech about her long engagement to Nathan causing her cold-like symptoms. The crap game in the sewers would be so much more dull without the lively dancing. Perhaps what is lacking in this age of video games and reality television is imagination and the ability to suspend disbelief. Too bad that a musical like "Guys And Dolls" can't be enjoyed for what it is -- a fun adaptation of Damon Runyon with a wonderful score, not ever to be taken too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers &amp; the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the East Coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; "the Lemondrop Kid," and "Little Miss Marker," both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly funny, too!) Damon Runyon lives!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful and Different; Runyon, Burrows and Loesser in top form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Frank Loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics, competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted Damon Runyon material to the musical's "book". What is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline. Abe Burrows did the book with contributions from Loesser; Michael Kidd was the choreographer, and the outstanding art direction was contributed by Joseph Wright. The storyline can be told in two sentences. Nathan Detroit, played by Frank Sinatra, needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie, a Chicago Mob Boss. He bets odds-player Sky Masterson, well-presented by Marlon Brando, that he cannot get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him; Masterson wins the bet, saves the Mission, falls in love with the girl, gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service, and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms--a complete lie. Of course he ends up with the lady; and Detroit marries hi long-suffering fiancée, Vivian Blaine. Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye, Johnny Silver, Robert Keith, B.S. Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster, Sheldon Leonard, Regis Toomey, Mary Alan Kokanson, Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader, Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl, Sarah Brown. The famous musical numbers in this award-winning Broadway smash include "Fugue For Tinhorns", "Guys and Dolls", "Luck Be a Lady", "I'll Know", "A Person Could Develop a Cold", and "The Oldest Established Permnanet Floating Crap Game in New York!". Joseph L. Mankiewicz of "Cleopatra" and "Letter to Three Wives" Fame directed the proceedings; and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving. He is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as "Luck Be Lady", the varied and challenging brawl section, the Havana "A Woman in Love" section created for the film that precedes it, the presenting of the title song "Guys and Dolls" and "Pet Me, Poppa" set in the club where Blaine works. The acting is very uneven. Simmons seems wrong for the part at times, Brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct, charm and underplaying, even in the comedy. scenes. Sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as Nathan Detroit; Blaine is a bit too-theatrical in selling her numbers, which she of course sings professionally. Leonard, Toomey, Kaye, Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more at all points. The stylized opening and closing are made to work well; all in all, this film is a triumph for Loesser's amiable and subtle lyrics, for director Mankiewicz as ringmaster, and for the genre of musicals itself, so ably justified in this instance. Delightful and very different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really horrible, not all that great, just... very different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having listened to the recording of the 1992 revival with Peter Gallagher, Josie de Guzman, Nathan Lane and the one and only Faith Prince over and over again and having seen the recent national tour with Maurice Hines, I was used to seeing "Guys and Dolls" played pretty much entirely for laughs. And an over-the-top, even in some aspects cartoonish approach to this story of gamblers with hearts of gold who halfheartedly but more or less willingly get mixed up with missions and the dolls who run them and get engaged to nightclub singers for 14 years works just fine for me. So, it was a bit of a shock seeing the movie version of the musical (Made 5 years of the original Broadway premeiere), because almost everybody played it pretty much entirely straight. Everyone took themselves so SERIOUSLY, which is probably why so many of the scenes dragged quite a bit, rather than moved along at a snappy pace. Maybe I'm just too used to seeing and hearing "Guys and Dolls" played as a cartoon to be comfortable with this new, much edgier approach. I got into it after a while, and the film has many good points. It was just... very different from what I was used to.First of all, a couple of great Frank Loesser songs from the Broadway show were cut. This has good and bad consequences. There is no real excuse for cutting the great "11-o'clock-number" "Marry the Man Today," but even without it, the (Am I really spoiling anything here?) final wedding procession is hilarious to watch. Also, while I really miss "I've Never Been In Love Before," I'm just as glad they kept "I'll Know," even if the singing of it wasn't the best (More on this later). I definitly don't miss "Bushel and a Peck," (I'll never understand why that song became so popular) and am very grateful "Take Back Your Mink" was still included. Don't miss "More I Cannot Wish You," and at least they kept "My Time of Day" as some nice underscoring. But what's worse is all the songs added to replace these, with the possible exception of "Pet Me Poppa," just aren't that catchy or memorable and definitly not in the same class of their Broadway predeccesors. And THEN they had to go and tweak a bunch of lyrics to the other songs for unknown reasons and mess with "Guys and Dolls." Those darn Hollywood people...So now to the casting. For the main pair of lovers, who at least were meant to be played more or less seriously, we have Jean Simmons as represeed missionary Sarah Brown and, here we are, Marlon Brando as smooth-talking, hard-playing, charming gambler Sky Masterson. Brando is actually really good... in the acting. His rendition of "Luck Be a Lady" has a certain intensity that is interesting to watch, and he doesn't embarrass himself in his bits of dancing, but as for the rest of his musical performance... why, why d'ya think he never made another one? Likewise, Jean Simmons does pretty well for herself, acting-wise, and it's a delight to watch her let go in the "Havana" dance sequence, and she even sings "I'll Know" more or less well, but let's not get into "If I Were a Bell." Still, even if these two aren't exactly world-class singers, they really embody their roles, so it's hard not to forgive them. As for Frank Sinatra as the scheming crap-game runner Nathan Detroit, in a role meant for a non-singing comic rather than a singer who can act and toss off a precious few one-liners, he carries his offscreen dissapointment at not being cast as Sky (How about him as Sky and Peter Falk as Nathan Detroit? Wouldn't that be something?) with him. He sings great, but his acting, again taken WAY too seriously with the saddest of expressions throughout, is depressing to watch. The majority of the rest of the gamblers also are so darn SERIOUS, you think you're in "The Godfather" instead of a "musical fable of Broadway." Still, the lingo is fun to hear. Only Vivian Blaine, Stubby Kaye, and B.S. Pully, ironically three of the main holdovers from broadway, have any sense of comedy, and even Blaine, as Miss Adelaide, that singer who's been engaged to Nathan for 14 years, is oh-so-seriously determined to get Nathan to marry her. This more restrained approach, and her more natural "Noo Yawk" accent, are big changes from the slightly more over-the-top (Yet still incredibly touching) performance of Faith Prince (My definitive Adelaide) and the just-plain-ridiculous performance of the woman in the Hines tour. Very interesting changes, but big ones nonetheless. Kaye, as Nicely-Nicely (thank you), is a loveable lug if ever there was one, and his "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" is one of the few numbers to really come to life and stop the show. Pully, as "dangerous" Big Jule, has a good mix of comic timing and edginess, without going too far in one or the other direction.So to sum up, Joseph Mancewicz probably wasn't the best choice to adapt and direct this for the screen. He almost wants to remind us it's a musical and not supposed to be reality, what with those bright and highly stylized sets by Oliver Smith (who I believe designed the original broadway sets as well), but yet almost everyone plays their roles completely straight and as realistically as possible, which adds an edge to the film that takes much of the great fun of the stage production away. An interesting new approach that has mixed results. There's stuff to like, stuff to want to forget, but on the whole it's just... really different from the average production of the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A luck out but didn't quite rock my boat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been meaning to see this properly since it was on TV once in 1975 and occasionally over the decades afterwards ? I finally managed it tonight, against the run of the dice too. Maybe it's a little too drawn out for me; but I guess all it means is Damon Runyon and Frank Loesser appealed less to me than Raymond Chandler and George Gershwin did.Amidst a sea of gambling hoods who speak - and sing - brokenly but dance fluently two people find themselves convolutedly falling in love. There's a spectacularly uninteresting storyline for a non-gambler but which is enlivened by some great songs and performances and precise choreography. Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando were good choices as a pair of reference points to the procession of cartoon characters inhabiting Runyon's woyld. Sinatra's silky voice was sadly underused or not used at all with Luck Be A Lady while the underused Stubby Kaye stole the show with the sublime Sit Down Stop Rocking The Boat. But I'd probably run a mile to avoid the sight of any of Vivian Blaine's dance routines for sexy gargoyles, or should that be ghouls. And at the end just like many other routine films including High Society the rough diamonds paired off on conventional lines as did the polished gems.It's arty, worth watching and isn't a crap film - I like it, don't love it; sue me.</fullReview>

Rich characters that you love from beginning to end. Of course there are better singers than Brando but Brando did hold his own with every tune, and he was the best one for the part with his usual magnificent acting and likability. Frank Sinatra is in top form and I always love watching the great and stunning actress Jean Simmons. You are in for a great time with this enriching musical. Fun for everyone.

		<shortDescription>Classic musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the edges of New York's criminal underworld, Nathan Detroit finds it increasingly difficult to find venues for the illegal games of craps he arranges. A complicated bet sees a venue forthcoming while gambler Sky Masterson takes Salvation Army sergeant Sarah on a date to Cuba. Meanwhile, Nathan is trying to avoid marriage to his fiancée of 14 years, Miss Adelaide.Based on a hit Broadway musical which was, in turn, based on stories by Damon Runyan, Guys and Dolls is bright and colourful, with highly stylised city backdrops, some great songs and engaging dancing, a distinct and individual identity thanks to Runyan's unique dialogue, and great performances from the principles.It's one of the classic musicals from the 50s, and deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guys and Dolls: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a movie itching for a remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake, with big stars now, would be box-office success, it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version. Its boundless energy can't be recaptured, nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this: a huge, widescreen, big entertainment movie.Marlon Brando (who last clocked in at 409 lbs. last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest gamblers in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose as-often-as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it crap game is city-wide famous. However, when the one place he has left to hold it is charging $1,000, Detroit needs the money fast. He bets Masterson $1,000 that he can't take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day.Guys and Dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing, which usually, as it does here, add up to fun. It's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical: there weren't that many sets, and the scenes were long. If I was to complain about one thing, it's how uneven the songs were. At times, there were two songs in a scene; other times, thirty minutes went by without one. Guys and Dolls is never boring, just a great time.My rating: 8/10Not Rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What dont people understand? If I hear one more person say that Marlon Brando is a bad singer I'm gonna kick the S*** out of them. Naturally, he is one of if not the best actor ever. Maybe because most people know him from "The Godfather" and "On the Waterfront" they dont think that he can pull of a role like this. But his success in this movie(in my opinion) really shows how great of an actor he really is. And if you have not seen him in this movie you probably would think that he can't sing which is understandable. He has a very distinct, different kind of voice. He also hadn't sang before in his life before this movie. And yes its true the songs have been altered for his vocal range and people have knocked him for that too. But his singing in Guys in Dolls is unbelievable. In the movie he sings three songs: I'll Know, Woman in Love, and Luck Be a Lady. His version of Luck Be a Lady highlights his tremendous acting ability and if you listen every note is right on. Woman in love is sang beautifully also and he hits a pretty high note in it. But the song that amazes me is I'll know. Listen to him sing it. Its unbelievable. Anyone who says he sucks at singing hasn't really listened to this song. And for this i believe that his role as Sky was money in this movie and was a perfect choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best that this movie could possibly be called is mediocre. After having seen a real theater show of this musical, I found that the movie version wasn't nearly as good. To begin with, neither Jean Simmons nor Marlon Brando are very good singers, and as they have the biggest singing parts, they weren't very good choices. Another part that disappointed me about the movie is that four songs were taken out (I've Never Been in Love Before, My Time of Day, Marry The Man Today, and A Bushel and a Peck) and three songs were written for the movie (Adelaide, Pet Me Poppa, and A Woman in Love). Some parts of the story, such as the end, were changed quite a bit, and some were taken out altogether, probably to make it shorter. There are some good parts of the movie. Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine sung very well and added humor to the movie, and You're Rocking the Boat was very well done. I would recommend watching a stage version over the movie version, since it will probably be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Adaptation of a Nearly Perfect Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 1992 revival of "Guys and Dolls" on Broadway when Nathan Lane and Faith Prince were playing the roles of Nathan Detroit and Miss Adelaide. That show was so colorful, vibrant and pulsing with energy, that it made Joseph L. Mankiewicz's screen version pale greatly in comparison.Mankiewicz replaces Damon Runyon's cartoon world of stylized sets and goofy gangsters with what passed for realism in the 1950s. Much of the original musical's score is gone (even the well-known "A Bushel and a Peck"), in some cases replaced by forgettable tunes written expressly for the film. The stunt casting of Marlon Brando in the role of Sky Masterson works better than you might expect; Brando displays a humorous and charming side to his personality that he hadn't yet shown on screen. Frank Sinatra is too smooth and collected for the addled Nathan Detroit; Jean Simmons is bland as missionary worker Sarah Brown. Vivian Blaine nails the role of Adelaide -- every ditzy blonde role since owes at least a trifle to her performance.The film never comes alive. You would think Mankiewicz would be a perfect choice for directing screen adaptations of stage material; his films always felt more like plays anyway, and his strength lay in directing actors through long passages of witty dialogue. But he's not up to the task of directing a musical -- the numbers just sit on the screen; there's no snap to them.A worthy effort, but one that doesn't meet its potential.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Uneven But It's Charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls (1955) *** (out of 4) Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) makes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) that he can sweep a missionary woman (Jean Simmons) off her feet. While Sky works his magic on the woman, Nathan must try and find a new place to hold a large gambling ring.GUYS AND DOLLS will always be a hotly debated film because of the casting of Brando. Up to this point people had only seen Brando in some hard-hitting dramas so what were the producers thinking by putting him in a musical where he'd have to sing? The on-set tension between Brando and Sinatra are somewhat legendary due to the legendary singer wanting to play the Sky Masterson part. Brando, being the constant joker, knew this and didn't hold back pranks.So, does the film work? I personally think it works pretty good even though one of the reasons it's so charming is the same reason it's uneven. I love Marlon Brando and he's one of my favorite actors but there's no question that he wasn't right for this role. With that said, he might not have been right for it but I thought he did a fine job with it. He looks rather uneasy at times but this "different" type of performance actually makes the character quite interesting. I thought Brando did a good job with the singing, although they had to apparently take various takes and edit them together. He certainly knows how to play the romantic and charming parts.Sinatra, probably better suited for the Sky role, does a good job in the supporting role and manages to bring some life to the film. Simmons makes for a very good love interest and I thought she had some really good chemistry with Brando. Vivian Blaine is also quite charming in her supporting role as Sinatra's fiancé for fourteen years.The cinematography is quite good and the musical numbers are well-staged and performed. The songs are also quite good, although I wouldn't call all of them masterpieces. Brando's performance of Luck Be a Lady is quite good and catchy. There are problems with the film including it being a bit uneven at times. I'd also argue that 150 minutes was way too long. Still, even with the flaws, GUYS AND DOLLS is a charming film that's certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Musical Battles of Film: Marlon Brando vs. Frank Sinatra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brando completely outclasses Sinatra in this film. Perhaps credit should go to their supporting actresses: Brando plays opposite a very likable character in Sarah Brown whereas Sinatra's "doll" is naive bordering on bimbo-ish with an irritating spoken voice (despite excellent singing and dancing skills). Perhaps credit should go their roles. Brando has much more screen time; Sinatra fills a supporting role.In truth, throughout the film, Brando excels at singing to the best of his natural ability, dancing--a little stiff, but he tries--and acting. Whenever he appears in a scene, the audience knows that Brando is an actor whose legacy will live far beyond this one film.Sinatra, by contrast...only momentary glimpses of his famous crooning voice. Does he ever dance in this film? If yes, the performance was obviously not memorable. His acting lacks distinction from the other gambling thugs.WHO WON? WHO'S NEXT? YOU DECIDE (I say "Brando")</fullReview>

Jean Simmons is , in my mind, stunningly beautiful, so can do no wrong for me. Vivian Blaine is terrific but just does not look right. Stubby Kaye is good value and the whole thing is colourful and has some real great moments. I really love musicals and was disappointed how I found my mind wandering at times. It is overlong and needed better editing to make it move along. Seven Brides was so much better as was Gypsy and some of the musical numbers in Guys and Dolls, choreographed by Michael Kidd work really well.Overall it has a comic strip feel a bit like Lil Abner , which disappointed me too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, Stylized Rendering of a Broadway Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes reviewers need to rid their minds of their knowledge of a film's production history and approach it on its own terms. This is certainly the case for Joseph L. Mankiewicz's GUYS AND DOLLS, which was beset by problems arising from the antipathy between Sinatra and Brando in the leading male roles. The finished product turns out surprisingly good, not least because there are few sequences in which these two actors appear on their own. They are part of an outstanding ensemble in which many of the stars of the original Broadway production (Vivian Blane, Stubby Kaye) recreate their roles. Jean Simmons offers a winning interpretation of Sarah Brown although her songs are dubbed. Designer Oliver Smith creates a surreal yet haunting world of Runyoneseque New York, full of small shops with Expressionist facades, iconic mid-Fifties automobiles and passers-by thronging the streets. The costumes are both colorful yet indicative of an underworld where outward show mattered as much as honoring one's marker. These guys might have been small-timers but they were proud of their images. Brando is surprisingly good as Sky Masterson; he brings a Method Actor's sensibility to the role, which means that each gesture matters, even during his songs. Sinatra doesn't do much, even though he has a song especially written for him. The stand-out performances come from Blaine and Kaye; their interpretations are just definitive. For lovers of the Broadway version, Skip Martin's orchestrations of the Loesser score are perhaps a little too lush; and the arrangement of Kaye's classic "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" is just too speedy, preventing from appreciating the sheer brilliance of the lyrics. On the other hand Michael Kidd's choreography is truly miraculous - a riot of color, energy and subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can gamblers like Brando and Sinatra really change?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more than just another one of MGM's musicals of the 50's.(It was released in 1955.) It is, after all, one wonderful story about an obsessed gambler (Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit)and another not-as-obsessed gambler (Marlon Brando as Sky Masterson) who want to make a bet on just about anything ever thought of. And so, in New York Nathan Detroit makes a bet with Masterson that he can not take the Salvation Army Sergeant Sarah Brown (played so capably by Jean Simmons)to dinner in Havana. Much to the surprise of both of them, Sky Masterson and Sarah Brown end up falling in love with each other after the dinner date in Cuba. At the same time, Masterson promises the Salvation Army General Cartwright, played by the sometimes-serious-looking Kathryn Givney, that he can keep the Salvation Army mission from an imminent closing by providing several men to attend a midnight prayer meeting thirty-six hours from the present time. But the story does not end there, since something takes place that puts a strain on the relationship of Sky and Sister Sarah. Still, the story is, again, wonderful and heart-warming. Several other actors give support to the movie, such as Regis Toomey as the Salvation Army member Arvaid Abernathy, Vivian Blaine as Sinatra's girlfriend Adelai, B.S. Pully as Big Louie from Chicago, Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse, and Stubby Kaye, just to mention a few. Naturally, the Goldwyn Girls add glitter to the movie. Of course too, the musical numbers are entertaining, such as "Guys and Dolls", "I'll Know when My Love comes Along", and the unforgettable song "Luck, Be a Lady tonight". Beautiful color, pretty songs, and an endearing story. A very entertaining movie in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would grab the first time machine available to take me back to the Times Square of "Guys and Dolls".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not a gambler in the sense of rolling dice or pulling slot machine levers, I do gamble in life, as we all do, and in moving to New York, it is agreeably one of the biggest gambles you can take in life. To see the New York of "Guys and Dolls" is to see one that probably only existed in the mind of its sources' author, Damon Runeyon, but it is one that makes the shady gamblers of New York (and their molls) a delightfully cartoonish fable. "A Musical Fable", this was called, and that it remains, one perfect in story, songs and dances, and to do "Guys and Dolls" successfully is a difficult task. A recent Broadway revival (2009) failed as it was literally flat; The 1990's revival practically jumped off the stage with the greatest production a Broadway revival can, a dream cast that is equal to that of its earlier movie version.Take two talented actors who really can't sing (Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando), pair them with two who can (Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine), and you have a criss-cross of metaphors to discuss almost 60 years after the release of this movie. Metaphorically, a "mission doll" probably can't sing, so Jean Simmon's somewhat raspy voice is a perfect choice for Sister Sarah, and Brando's practically whispered singing is actually very charming for the role of Sky. The more colorful Nathan and Adelaide are characters who do sing, so their performers need to have a streetwise but pleasant sound to them. Vivian Blaine proved in Fox musicals of the 1940's that she wasn't the nasally voiced singer of "Take Back Your Mink", and she gently pokes fun at nightclub dames of the 1940's and 50's with a "Dumb Dora" spoof that really isn't as dumb as she looks to be. Sinatra, back on top after an Oscar win, shares the spotlight, and his comic timing here is perfect, contrasting nicely with Brando's suave lover who has a force-to-be-reckoned with reputation.A dance lover's delight, this has several hot production numbers, starting with a jazzy ballet right in Times Square which shows off every kind of character who had been there long before Ruby Keeler sang of sexy ladies from the 80's who are indiscreet. Going from Manhattan to Havana, Cuba erupts into another hot dance sequence that seems straight out of a modern music video. Stubby Kaye steals every moment he's on as Nicely Nicely, repeating his Broadway role, and shooting the roof off of the mission house with "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat". In fact, it is this song that gets a Tony number every time the show is revived. (For a nice contrast to Kaye's Nicely Nicely, see Eugene Palette's take on the character in "The Big Street" opposite Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.) Hard-as-nails Adele Jergens gets some wry commentary as Blaine's chorus girl pal, and Robert Keith takes on the law as the Lieutenant who declares to one of the gambler, "Don't ever help my mother across the street" when he claims to be a boy scout master.No review of "Guys and Dolls" could be complete without mentioning the brilliant score (Broadway's best, perhaps?) by Frank Loesser, combining sardonic comments on New York life, romantic idealism and even how the common cold can take over when love steps out. I quibble a little about the deletion of "A Bushel and a Peck" for the inclusion of the new "Pet Me, Papa" (as far as I'm concerned, there was room for both of them), but the addition of "A Woman in Love" over "I've Never Been in Love Before" was certainly acceptable.As for the art direction, no other musical (except perhaps "Li'l Abner" or the made for film "Red Garters") utilized the cartoonish color so vividly. There is not one disappointing moment in the film, so many high points (Simmons' obvious recovery from getting sick from too many Bacardi's before breaking into "If I Were a Bell") that when you ask whoever you watch this with for the first time, "Ask Me How Do I Feel", the only answer can be "Wonderful!".</fullReview>

This movie is character-driven, meaning that if the actors fail to make their characters believable, then the movie fails. This the movie avoids. Instead, what the movie delivers is first rate acting, a wonderful story, and first-rate music. Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons deliver surprisingly strong performances, which include dancing and singing (not dubbed). The chemistry between them is so strong that is it almost palpable. Although the story has an offbeat satirical quality, nevertheless it is strong dramatically. Vivian Blaine is also excellent as frank Sinatra's perennial fiancé, and the other members of the cast, especially Stubby Kaye and Johnny Silver, deliver wonderfully entertaining performances.

It went over budget. Sinatra and Brando didn't get along. The story is unbelievable, but then this is more of a fable than even most musicals.Great choreography and dancing. So many memorable songs. My favorites are "Luck Be a Lady Tonight," "Adelaide's Lament," and "Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat." The inspiration for another great movie "Robin and the 7 Hoods."

Colourful and full of energy, filled with songs, dance and gambling, the pacing does occasionally stumble as it sometimes feels as though the songs overshadow the story. In my opinion, some of the songs could have been left out, like the pussycat number. The overall dance numbers are very well choreographed. Hats off to the art department for making the film look so beautiful and vibrant with different colours. The cinematography is brilliant.I never thought I'd see Brando sing and dance. It wasn't something I'd even imagined but he does a decent job. Sinatra is already familiar with this genre. However, his role is barely developed. Of the women, Vivian Blaine and Jean Simmons do a fine job using their comic flair. Stubby Kaye provides fine support as Nicely.Finally, in my opinion, 'Guys and Dolls' is among the better musical of the 50s. Amusing, entertaining, energetic and (at the very least) foot-tapping, just what a musical should be.</fullReview>

I would like to encourage you to give yourself a treat and give it another look.I enjoyed very much this last time. I focused more on Michael Kidd's choreography. His work anticipates Bob Fosse's in Sweet Charity and Cabaret. There is so much inventiveness and mini dramas going on simultaneously. You might call it "contrapuntal dance". You can watch it over and over and keep seeing something you missed earlier. Kidd used angular, sudden and sometimes grotesque twistings and huge casts. He did not waste them on chorus lines. It is like watching some three dimensional Rube Goldberg contraption.Frank Loesser' music is classic. It is more like opera than popular music. There are so many songs with multiparts dancing interweavings. Others play with irresistible syncopation like Fugue For Tinhorns (I got the horse right here, The name is Paul Revere). Adelaide's Lament (Shows a neurotic tendency, see note:, Chronic organic symptoms, Toxic or hypertense, Involving the eye, the ear, the nose, and throat) where she sing-reads a medical textbook is so weird and so compelling. The is a work of love.The blatant lack of political correctness becomes naughty humour, viewed today.I saw Sky Masterson (played by Marlon Brando) as a much more heroic character than previously. I think in earlier watchings I pegged him early in the movie as a rat, and failed to notice the contrary evidence. This time I also noticed, that for dramatic actor, he did a remarkable job of singing and dancing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Thrilling And Thoroughly Entertaining Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a musical starring Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine. It was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also wrote the screenplay. The film is based on the Broadway musical by composer and lyricist Frank Loesser, with a book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows based on "The Idyll Of Miss Sarah Brown" and "Blood Pressure", two short stories by Damon Runyon.Opening late in 1950, Guys and Dolls was one of Broadway's hottest tickets for several seasons. The plot involves a certain Broadway citizen by the name of Nathan Detroit, who maintains the "Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York." Seeking a location for his latest high-stakes game, Nathan has an opportunity to rent out the Biltmore Garage, but he needs $1000 to do so. He decides to extract the money from high-rolling Sky Masterson, known for his willingness to bet on anything. Nathan wagers that Sky will not be able to talk the virginal Salvation Army lass Sarah Brown into going on a date with him. While Sky goes to work on Sarah, Nathan endeavors to fend off his girlfriend Miss Adelaide, who has developed a psychosomatic cold because of her frustrating 14-year engagement to the slippery Mr. Detroit. Thanks to some fast finagling, Sky is able to take Sarah on that date, flying to Havana for this purpose. By the time they've returned to New York, Sky and Sarah are in love, but their ardor cools off abruptly when Nathan, unable to secure the Biltmore garage, attempts to use Sarah's mission as the site of his crap game.This is one of the most thrilling and thoroughly entertaining of all musicals. Mankiewicz's brightly stylized film of Frank Loesser's classic musical casts the criminal underworld as a harmless fantasy in this whimsical vision of the Big Apple. Non-singers Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons acquit themselves fine in the lead roles. It's odd casting, to say the least. Frank Sinatra, who plays the good old reliable Nathan Detroit is left with novelty tunes while husky Brando delivers the love songs and hits, including "Luck Be a Lady." But in the context of the colorful dialogue and comically affected speech patterns the song performances aren't the least out of place. Stubby Kaye, reprising his role as Nicely Nicely from the Broadway run, practically steals the show in his few scenes and his show-stopping solo "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat." The film is overlong at two and a half hours and somewhat stagily confined in the stylized, studio-bound sets--perhaps the mark of a director who had never helmed a musical before--but a terrific cast of eccentrics and Michael Kidd's high-energy choreography gives the film a memorable and enchanting character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Marlon Brando can sing too. He was the biggest star of the day with Frank Sinatra (played Nathan Detroit) who also wanted to play Skye Masterson but it didn't happen. Still, Sinatra sang Lucky be a Lady Tonight thousands of times. Vivian Blaine was really the original Miss Adelaide who went from Broadway to the film without missing a beat. Jean Simmons played Sarah Brown, the lovely missionary leader, who can also sing very well. Jean and Marlon were in a movie prior to be casted and they worked well together. Sinatra and Blaine played Nathan and Adelaide very well and smooth. There were some songs that didn't quite make it from stage to screen but the film does a remarkable adaptation from stage to screen without missing a beat. The dancing is a superb as is the art direction. The weaknesses are with the story lines. While they do work out, they can be a little bit over the top at times. Still, it's a film to be enjoyed and entertained about love and romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1950s were not necessarily the best era for musicals, but they were certainly the era where movie musical production reached the pinnacle of its professionalism. Studios had whole production units devoted solely to the genre. Stars were picked as much for their ability to act as to sing and dance. And it was now a matter of course for the biggest and most prestigious stage hits to be bought up by the industry and given the Hollywood treatment.Guys and Dolls, the 1950 Tony Award winner for Best Musical, was the work of a little-known songwriter called Frank Loesser. Loesser had spent the bulk of his career in cinema, mainly as a jobbing lyricist. For someone normally a man of words only, Loesser has composed a score of considerable musical complexity. Appropriately enough though it is very much the words that seem to drive the melody. "Fugue for Tinhorns", while technically being a fugue, sounds like it was approached more as overlapping dialogue set to music. In "Adelaide's Lament" the tune skitters along to keep up with the verbose lyrics. The result is a score which is not only satisfying to listen to but really speaks out at the same time with words that are as enjoyable as the melody. Bits of it are even in the same league as the finer works of Lerner and Loewe.To helm the screen adaptation, producer Samuel Goldwyn selected Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz was certainly a capable director ? he had won two Oscars for directing in recent years ? but could this craftsman of mature drama and high theatre handle a Broadway musical? Fortunately Mankiewicz seems to have pulled it off by focusing on his usual attention to visual detail, and bringing out the heart in the more intimate numbers by shooting them as an extension of the drama. A great example is the scene in the mission house where Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons first meet, featuring the song "I'll Know". At the start of the scene, which is just inconsequential bickering between the two, there are busy crowds buzzing distractingly past outside. However at the moment when the pair really click over the bible quote, Mankiewicz gently eases the window out of the shot and leaves the actors isolated against plain still backgrounds. This continues when the song begins, and there is some neat balancing of colour and pattern to bring harmony to the images. My favourite example of this is when the bottom row of stars on the US flag in one corner of the screen matches the row of organ stops in the other. At the song's rather abrupt finish the crowds are suddenly back in shot ? dumping us (and Brando) back into reality.Speaking of Mr Brando? now there is a man you wouldn't associate with the musical genre. But then, at this point in his career, why not? He had convincingly played a Mexican bandit, and done Shakespeare to boot, so he was clearly no one-trick luvvy. The thing is, we all know Brando could act, but could he sing? Well surprising as it may seem he pulls off the singing fairly well (despite the recordings apparently being cobbled together from numerous takes). However, good as he is, it seems he really can't do everything, because he fails totally to ignite a spark with Jean Simmons. The pair of them do a good job as individuals, but there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Frank Sinatra may have been peeved to get lumbered with the smaller Nathan Detroit role, but ironically he and the marvellous Vivian Blaine are the more memorable couple because they are able to make a touching and believable romance.And this is really a big problem with Guys and Dolls. It is a typical professional 1950s big musical, but that is all it is. The music is excellent, the direction and choreography spot on, and while much of it is good fun the whole thing seems oddly mechanical and lacking in spirit. The musical numbers are wonderful moments in themselves, with a real feeling of life turning into song that is missing from so many such pictures, but to be a great picture a musical needs to be more than simply a collection of great songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had the privilege of playing Nicely, Nicely on the stage. The joy for me, as it was my first musical, was that Nicely gets to open the show with the "Fugue for Tinhorn" joined by Benny Southstreet and Charlie the Horse - notice no Nathan Detroit in this number. Also Nicely shares the stage with only Benny on the duet, "Guys and Dolls" - again notice no Nathan Detroit.When you sign a great singer as Sinatra to play Nathan he must have something to sing so in the film Nathan is in the Fugue and Guys and Dolls. Therefore I will not add this movie to my collection. Instead I will seek out theatrical productions for the stage version.On the plus side Jean Simmons one of my favorites is wonderful, Marlon Brando very winning as Sky. Too bad the world of film did not see Stubby sing the songs he created on stage. Vivian Blaine - wonderful.Well there you have it. My opinion! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a perfect musical, but it has a lot of great, pure moments, with great stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. It's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando (and, contrary to Sinatra's original wishes, the casting works), it's got a really cool 1950s feel, even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption. And most of the songs are often a lot of fun, and catchy, and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. If it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk, it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Not all the songs entirely click, and a little of the dialog feels like it's being performed for the stage as opposed to film (it's hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the "stage", while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen).The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period, even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999's She's All That (well, not quite, but close). A gambler (and 14-year betrothed), played by Sinatra, wants to host a big-time game, but is told that the "heat is on", meaning the cops are on watch. So, he has only one choice to host the game, with a thousand dollar tab. The only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler Brando, who's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker. It allows for the predictable twists in the story, in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character, of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and the "saitn" played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando). It is, in its basic concept, about this whole world of guys and dolls, and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised.Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece, even when keeping still with the camera on the subject, and his stars are properly reeled in. Hell, even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality. The story and characters eventually wind down to what you'd hope will happen, and that's fine. All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty, involving dialog, and a few songs and dances that bring the house down (my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club, Luck be a Lady, and the two numbers down in Havana, Cuba).

		<shortDescription>Guys and Dolls was a compelling film version of a Broadway musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the Havana sequences where Simmons and Brando dance up a storm were excellent. Those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this movie which originated as a story by Damon Runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non-musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine wasn't as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the "Sue Me" number. Also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical look throughout, Guys and Dolls isn't a great film musical but certainly a very good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices Sky Masterson to try and get salvation army girl, played by Jean Simmons, to go with Masterson to Havana.5 years later, Simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous "Elmer Gantry." There she was sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story.Frank Sinatra is that devilish Nathan Detroit. He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit.In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his own singing here!The film is saved by superlative choreography. Those dance and singing routines are fabulous. They are especially realized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson).All in all, it's a very nice production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent musical with terrific music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best musicals ever made, this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent, rather than for what people might expect. The lighting and set are unique, giving it a very interesting effect (this has a special name that I cannot think of). The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. The movie is well paced, beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is the MUSIC. Such an array of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, that are perfectly performed and orchestrated. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, that might have only two or three. Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever. It is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals were made to entertain, not to to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can't sing! It was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when I couldn't understand him. If it weren't for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls provides old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. Watch it to have a good time!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical with a Hidden Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting. At his best he turns in such oddball performances, insinuating so many things at once, that it doesn't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct. Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others, a concentration which, if followed, turns out something of a red herring, as he turns out subtler, craftier than at first appeared. This is a mastery of artifice, not naturalism, as might be associated with the Method. The role of Sky Masterson, as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized, seems tailored for him, which is to begin with odd, and odd still at the end, because whatever it is Brando has done, he has managed a grace maybe all his own, but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again, odd, coming from an actor with limited musical ability, not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy. Jean Simmons, also oddly cast, is not quite as impressive, but certainly above just-adequate, really delightful in the Havana sequence, and never less than enjoyable throughout. And yet...perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing, and characters on what it is they intend of each other, there doesn't seem to be the lovers' "chemistry" brought up so insistently more than once. Brando/Sky Masterson and Simmons/Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough, but I for one don't see more beyond that. In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining (and most everything about it, craft-wise, is just that -- dazzling), that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked, but so much would depend upon true chemistry! An, at least partial, transformation of the characters through such chemistry, would lend something positively moving to the final scene. As it is, one leaves this film certainly delighted, but not really moved, except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union. Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary's uniform, Sky Masterson in his same natty man-about-town duds rather than wedding tux. And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!Funnily enough (that is, insightfully), the most touching, and most serious, scene is, I think, between Brando and Vivian Blaine, as Sinatra/Nathan Detroit's doll, Adelaide, the only scene where these two are exclusively together, not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide's dressing-room while Adelaide is about to change. Though one may submit there is no place for that, Sky really is the type to "check out" Adelaide in this sort of circumstance. He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope. Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan, even piteous of him, as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange. Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed, but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan, as Sky is admonishing her that she can't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes, around the themes of gambling and salvation. Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair, there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando's and Simmons' lack of chemistry. After all, that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation (echoed by the Sinatra/Blaine pairing, though with considerably less self-deception involved), which might explain Brando's and Simmons' odd, rather provoking, interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah. I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism, but Brando, though playing to confront her, isn't exactly heated and eager, and is more than keeping his distance -- he's also assimilating it, keeping his balance through it. His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba, a kiss, whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf. This may be shrewd, as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary, and through. But it makes Sky's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive. Yet why does he want her? What does falling in love mean to Sky? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in, and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah, so he does, as he's promised her, need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting, make good by his "marker," as he puts it, as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her. But this still denotes self-concern more than anything. However, it also allows for Sarah Brown's own self-concern, as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover. Neither, at least it seems, will change much by their union, except perhaps in the acceptance of the other. Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition: acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other, let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by "chemistry." And behind all this, I suspect is Mankiewicz's full knowing.For all those who might say, in defense of Guys and Dolls yet, that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth, I need only remind them Cabaret, The Three-penny Opera, Carousel, A Star is Born, even The Sound of Music, which I don't care for as much (and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post-Cabaret musicals), all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the movie, I might not be as fond of it as I am. Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.)As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant. I find it to have a rather shrill quality. Jean Simmons' voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals. Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of "Luck Be A Lady" and only there because I was previously familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find Vivian Blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption. (They weren't) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. Also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, I beg to differ. 'A Bushel and a Peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa" and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material. I personally do not care for 'Marry the Man Today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie. I adore 'I've Never Been In Love Before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song 'A Woman In Love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach. And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, I'd recommend purchasing it instead of the Broadway. Though I have not seen the original production, I cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors. The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched Guys and Dolls again for the first time in years on a rainy Saturday afternoon, surely the best time to watch any "classic" Hollywood musical. As a fan of Damon Runyan's source material, I was pleased with the script's wry one liners and the cast, particularly Sinatra's way with the Noo-Yoik accents. The sets and dancing are excellent, the Michael Kidd choreographed ensemble work in particular blazing a trail for "West Side Story" in the next decade. The performances are generally satisfactory, Brando cast against type as the smooth talking, wise - cracking Sky Masterson in no doubt deliberate contrast to his "Stella" - bellowing primitive performance in "Streetcar Named Desire". He's no song and dance man though he does his best. Sinatra comes off best of the leads - who better to play a NY shyster after all, while Stubby Kaye does great in his supporting mobster role, especially during "Sit Down You're Rocking the Boat". Jean Simmons contrasts well in her Sally Army role opposite Brando and acts a good drunk when she flies down to Cuba and gets her rocks off! And yet it plays just a little too long, one yearns for a starrier second female lead opposite Sinatra and the songs, whilst good seem to fall just short of greatness to my younger ears, although "Sit Down.." and "Luck be a Lady" certainly cut the mustard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to disagree with Sue Lee comments on this movie - I think that Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando did extraordinary work in this film. Both actors are usually seen acting in serious roles (for example: their boring pairing in the previous year's film "Desiree") and looked as if they were actually having a good time.I also have to disagree with the comments on their singing. I think they did extremely well for two non-singers who had to hold their own in a movie with Sinatra, Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye. I've heard worse caterwauling by other big name stars in other movies.Lastly, in your trivia section, you reference Jerry Orbach in an uncredited role in the barbershop during the number 'The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game'. He is kind of hard to miss but I must disagree with your statement that his one sung line was probably sung by someone else -- anyone with ears can tell that the voice you hear belongs to Jerry Orbach -- in fact, that's how I first realized that it was him in the seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nathan Detroit.Big Julie. Nicely-Nicely Johnson."Fugue for tinhorns"."Pet me Poppa"."Sit down you're rockin' the boat". The very uttering of those names evoked the excitement and glamour of New York to us in the dull boring monochrome society of England in the mid 1950s.We still fondly remembered Jessie Matthews and Jack Buchanan.Our heroes were called Priscilla or Clive and wore silk pyjamas accessorized with long ivory cigarette holders.Nathan Detroit wore wide-striped suits,fedora hats and had a permanent floating crap game which might have been a painful medical condition but turned out not be. The film was brash,noisy,glitzy and everything we wanted to believe New York to be. Mr Sinatra and Mr Brando were hot potatoes at the time and we gasped at Brando's chutzpah in taking the role of Sky Masterson.Sinatra's film career reached a peak with "Guys and Dolls" which he teetered on for a year or two then began his slow decline into self-parody.Nathan Detroit rather than Private Maggio is the role that he was born to play,although rumour at the time had it that he went after the part Brando ended up with. Jean Simmons was sweet and English and innocent as Miss Sarah Brown. The film benefited greatly by the presence of Broadway talents like Vivian Blaine ,Stubby Kaye and B.S.Pulley The plot and the songs are too well-known to discuss here,suffice it to say they "Fugue for tinhorns" and "Sit down you're rockin' the boat" receive their definitive performances in this movie. Along with "Oklahoma","Guys and Dolls" represents the height of popular American Musical Theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Loesser's spirited Broadway musical, "Guys and Dolls," was given a serviceable presentation for the screen version.In a most unusual piece of casting, Marlon Brando took on the singing-acting role of Sky Masterson. What I found commendable was the way he used his singing voice as a creative extension of his speaking part.The result was most interesting: a pleasant, sweet quality emerged; yet he didn't shortcut halves and whole notes, rather sustained tones in a legato, musical manner. Likewise, Actress Jean Simmons nicely matched him in her specialty solos and their duets.Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye all added high quality to their respective roles, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's direction was most adequate.One omitted original score song, "More I Cannot Wish You," was Loesser at his most was classical and poetic. Probably considered too abstract for the film production, (and granted it requires an exceptional singer to put it across) it was still missed.The production design was most colorful and the sets a nice carryover from the stage. All in all, a good presentation of a beloved musical.</fullReview>

Other than that, Brando is casted wonderfully as Sky Masterson. He fits the role to the T, but should of been exempted from singing. Same goes with Simmons.Sinatra was excellent as Nathan Detroit, but could of put a bit more effort into it. Goldwyn was smart to cast Blaine again, an excellent Adelaide. I'm doing the show, casted and Sky, and take it from this actor, if you do the show, and want some character help, buy the movie. Brando is the ultimate Sky.

		<fullReview>Agree with many of the foregoing comments, especially the removal of several great songs from the Broadway original, but my major problem was the LONG romance setup and LONG Havana sequences with Brando and Simmons. This detracted from the Damon Runyon "Noo Yauk" milieu to the point where I always hit the fast-forward button, so I can get back to those wild outfits on the gamblers and all their clever lingo. One other problem, the very stage-bound set, clearly shot entirely on Goldwyn's backlot. Perhaps it was intentional, in tribute to the stage production, but it always bothered me....I'd have much preferred to have seen it shot like ON THE TOWN, right on the streets of NYC. Finally, I agree that you MUST have a fairly large-screen TV, and see this only in widescreen. The pan and scan format totally ruins most of the musical numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is my "happy movie." Could there be more of an upper? I love that it doesn't need special effects or violence or swearing to be a good movie.Granted, Brando is not the best singer. But I don't think that's what they were looking for. If they wanted a Gene Kelley or a John Travolta or a Pavarotti, they would have gotten one. I think that Brando did really good job, especially with "Luck be a Lady." He just has the right kind of attitude.I will admit that the songs should not have been altered. My high school did this play, and it was amazing. We had a lot of talent that year. Anyway, we kept the original Broadway songs and ending, and it was just amazing.On the whole, it is an excellent film that I would recommend to my friends and family. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it doesn't measure up to the truly "great" musicals, Guys and Dolls is a fun film and since the stage show is great, the music is the best part. It's especially fun if you've seen the show on stage, while several problems include a) the changing of the songs. The film took out four songs, including two of the best, I've Never Been in Love Before and Marry the Man Today, doing a little replacing with not so worthy songs. b) While I love Marlon Brando and found him fine here, it was just his singing that bothered me. I would have preferred him dubbed (after all, West Side Story, The King and I, and My Fair Lady's leading ladies are all dubbed) or maybe he could have studied more??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this film so excruciatingly boring? I think it's because it's not about anthing, but gambling...and who wants to sing about gambling. OK, OK...it has a love story, but it just doesn't seem feasible; I mean, either one of the couples. Musicals can so easily become corny, and when Sinatra and Brando are not on the screen, all the sparks fade. Compare it to "Swing Time" and "Singing in the Rain,"...I mean when I watch them I smile all the way through, but this is a highly over-rated movie. It's just not done well, and anyone who thinks it is has some delusions of neurosis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That musical, if it did not have the music, and I do not say the singing, would be today forgotten. The story is zilch. The plot is null. The drama is hilarious. The suspense is non-existent. The décor is surrealistically realistic. The cops are puppets. The gamblers are marionettes. The guys are caricatures. The dolls are evanescent. And I said, the singing is mediocre, apart from Frank Sinatra who was a singer by profession. The others, particularly Marlon Brando, are hardly good enough for a chorus line. That was 1955. The USA had no competition in the world and they thought at the time they were building the future of the cosmos. So everything they did had to be best, even if it was crap, quite the proper word for it since the main attraction of the film and the main interest of the cops were crap games. Yet the music is innovative and in a way surprising, half Broadway traditional musical and half jazzy, swinging definitely and yet missing the point due to the poor quality of the singing and the very stiff dancing. The choreographer must have been movement-challenged and he was not able to conceive of supple and flexible bodies moving along curves and curbed lines with bodies that should be continuously changing opening and closing arcs. Too bad, because a real musical could be done with some of the elements of the scenario, though there would be a lot of rewriting to do. And I must say that the Salvation Army in disguise in this film is not exactly fascinating, even if the general is a woman and the sergeant is another woman. Apart from the heavy presence of women in this good-doing-or-is- it-doing-good army that wants to save our souls it is talking gibberish most of the time, and that gibberish does not concern us really. It is from another time, another galaxy, definitely another universe.Luckily it was in a box set of five musicals, otherwise I doubt I would spend one dollar to buy it, certainly not a pound, not even a euro. If pirating is stealing, to wrap up this zilch thing between West Side Story and Man of La Mancha is really high way commercial robbery.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly cast to say the least...but it does still work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guys and Dolls" was a very successful Broadway play based on a Damon Runyon story. However, when Sam Goldwyn bought the movie rights, apparently he lost his mind. Think about it--you sign Frank Sinatra for the film but you DON'T give him the lead. Instead, you cast a guy who is NOT a singer--just an actor whose career happens to be very hot. And, in the female lead, they cast a non-singing Brit...to play a New Yorker! You truly must assume that the folks making this film were insane....this is the only thing that would make this make sense! Now I am not saying that the non-singers were terrible (like the non-singers were in "Paint Your Wagon")--but their voices clearly are a bit lacking. The film begins with Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) learning about a BIG business opportunity. In other words, there's a chance for this shifty gambler to strike it rich. All he needs is $1000...which he does NOT have. So, the quick-thinking Nathan bets his associate, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), to make a strange bet--that Masterson can't get a local Salvation Army missionary (Jean Simmons) to go with his to Havana! Sky's plan works...of sorts. But there is a HUGE complication when he starts to have feelings for the lady.Populating this film are a million and one mobsters who ALL wear very stereotypical costumes and have all the subtlety of a stripper at a Baptist social! The sets are also big and very stage-like. But, considering it's supposed to be a musical based on a play, all this and the weird dialog is pretty much what you might expect. It all also comes off as a bit cartoony and shallow--and that isn't necessarily bad--it's just silly, mindless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Samuel Goldwyn Rolls the Dice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Damon Runyon's New York City, high stakes gambler Marlon Brando (as Sky Masterson) bets he can bag any woman, so floating crap game shooter Frank Sinatra (as Nathan Detroit) challenges him to take prudish missionary Jean Simmons (as Sarah Brown) on a cruise to Havana. Having Brando and Sinatra playing gangsters in "Guys and Dolls" was too much ego for one film, obviously. Both have stated some unhappiness with their roles. Brando doesn't normally sing, but he's fine here, as is Ms. Simmons. Sinatra doesn't perform his role as written, which songwriter Frank Loesser has accurately noted, but he's okay too.No matter. Brando and Sinatra have the star power to help make the too long length bearable, but they aren't the most memorable attractions. The musical highlights are the newly added "Pet Me Poppa" pussy-cat sex tease and the later contraction-allowing "Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat" by original Broadway players Vivian Blaine (as Adelaide) and Stubby Kaye (as Nicely-Nicely Johnson). Michael Kidd's energetic choreography also livens up a couple of the big production numbers.******* Guys and Dolls (11/3/55) Joseph L.

		<fullReview>First in foremost, I ADORE THIS FILM. I had always known about this musical "Guys and Dolls" so I decided to buy it from Amazon a couple of months ago and after a span of about 10 minutes into it, it became my favourite musical and one of my favourite films of all time. The casting is great; MARLON BRANDO as SKY MASTERSON; Terrifc job of the part of the sly gambler. I couldn't imagine anyone else, not even Sinatra playing this part. His unique singing voice polishes his part completely. JEAN SIMMONS as SARAH BROWN; Good choice, good voice and actress. FRANK SINATRA as NATHAN DETROIT; Even though Sinatra wanted the part of Sky Masterson for himself, I don't think he would have pulled off the part as well as Brando did. Sinatra gives a really fun, believable performance as fly-guy Detroit. VIVIAN BLAINE as ADELAIDE; The definitive "Marlyn Munroe" like woman. GREAT ACTRESS/SINGER/DANCER. All the supporting cast were amazing too and, it's actually really hard for me to accept that this movie was made 54 years ago!!

Brando and Sinatra were both absolutely fantastic. The rest of the cast wasn't too bad either.The elaborate dance numbers are a great reminder that even before CGI you could make a pretty good movie. Of course, if you have kids, get ready to explain how to shoot craps! A little on the long side (although it never really drags) and perhaps just a little bit too predictable. Also a little racy in a few spots for the young ones, but overall just a great film worth seeing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Supporting Cast in Film History, Led by Stubby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons are the headliners of "Guys and Dolls," but they aren't why I like it so much (I have a fancy DVD of it). Sure, it has evocative NYC locales of the past and that classic Damon Runyon feel, but the glossy shine and sets hide the real treasures contained within.Stubby Kaye, where have you gone? If there's one Broadway performance I would take to a desert island and watch over and over, it's Stubby doing "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat." It's just so perfect. There are other versions floating around from other productions, but Stubby owns the character and the song.Then there's Sheldon Leonard, B.S. Pully in a marvelous turn as the blow-hard gambler Big Jule, Robert Keith as Lt. Brannigan, and of course the inimitable Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide. I'm not a big fan of her interminable scenes doing her nightclub act, which are most definitely not in accord with today's taste, but as a character, she's the tops. "Take back your mink, take back your poils, what made you think I was one of those goils...."If I have to talk about the headliners, I will admit that Sinatra and Brando probably should have switched roles. Brando does give a solid presence as Sky, while Sinatra was still not too far from the awkward shy-guy roles that he did in the '40s and so at times is very believable as his hesitant character (Don Knotts in that role would have been unbelievably awesome), but still.... Brando was by far the better actor, and Sinatra by far the better singer, so why they gave Brando the role with the best songs and Sinatra the part with the awkward situations is beyond me.Jean Simmons does a fine job as Sergeant Sarah Brown, though she doesn't portray some of her character's changes in emotions (such as when she finds out Sky's cronies were using the mission for gambling while she and he were in Havana) as sharply as I might like. The women I know would have started throwing things, or at least sent a sharply worded e-mail, you know what I mean.... But she is convincing as a woman confronting her own forbidden love.The stage origins of the film are a blessing and a curse. The songs aren't really all that great, aside from "Luck be a Lady" (which Brando NEVER should have been asked to sing, with Sinatra standing right there) and a couple of others. Plus, it is marred by the over-exaggerated dance scenes (such as at the crap game in the sewer) that were so popular in the mid-Fifties and seldom ever again. The costumes are colorful, perhaps too colorful for any kind of realism. And the sets are intentionally impressionistic in a stagey kind of way, which is charming but gets a bit hard on the eyes after a while. And, after Sky and Brown return to New York, are my eyes deceiving me or don't one of those stores have "Havana" as part of their name? Hmmmm....But if you can suspend your disbelief and just go with iconic actors playing flamboyant, honorable gangster types, this is the best musical you'll ever see.Anyway, at heart it's all about Sky seducing Brown, and I like that part, even though it's a fairly ordinary seduction. But Stubby singing "Don't Rock the Boat," now that's sublime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without Marlon Brando makes this movie great, without him it would have been just another boring musical. Jean Simmons is good to, but Sinatra clearly shows that he should sing instead of acting. I especially enjoyed the scenes in which Brando and Simmons are in Havana, Cuba.I usually hate to watch musicals, but this one was pretty entertaining. The only reason to why I saw this movie is of course because Marlon Brando is in it, and he is my favorite actor. And he is without any doubt the actor who has the most charisma of all the actors. I would much rather want to see Marilyn Monroe as Adelaide in this movie. Other charismatic actors are Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery, Al Pacino, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The heat is off as Brando and Sinatra take a New York success to Hollywood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapted and directed this lavish screen-version of the long-running Broadway hit musical, retaining much of Frank Loesser's fine score in a romantic Damon Runyon story about two gamblers in New York, one trying to stay ahead of the cops and the other trying to stay ahead of a female missionary with the Salvation Army. Frank Sinatra is the proprietor of a floating gambling ring who bets smooth-operator Marlon Brando a thousand G's he can't conquer Jean Simmons, a prude in uniform. As agonizing as it is to hear the men constantly referring to the ladies as "dolls", this is a tuneful, colorful enterprise which includes a fun group of shady characters but ultimately sags from the weight of Mankiewicz's disappointing staging. At one point while singing, Brando's head is framed by the American flag (it looks like he's wearing it as a hat); later, Vivian Blaine is up on stage performing and her head is framed by a neon bird in the background. Trimming might have helped since the show is a good 30 minutes too long, yet the picture has a galumphing rhythm, harmed further by Michael Kidd's comically physical choreography and Brando's too-high intensity. The wordy scenes of Brando attempting to seduce Simmons are rather surprising in this otherwise cartoon-bright setting with attention-deficit disorder, yet his manner and delivery are all wrong (he acts like he's going to belt her). Amusing performances come from mostly from the supporting cast, with Stubby Kaye and B.S. Pully always nice to have around. Sinatra gets the short shrift, but he's in good voice and makes the best of what genuine razzle-dazzle there is. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Yes, it's a dated, very much "pre-PC" piece, but if anything, that's a Plus. Even Marlon Brando's singing made me smile--you have to give him an "A" for effort, and for carrying it all off with class. Frank Sinatra gives a charming and convincing performance as Nathan Detroit, a New York hood enamored both of gambling and of his long-suffering fiancé of 14-years, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine--superb!).One of the amusing insights into the making of this film is that Brando originally didn't want to play Sky Masterson, but the director (Joseph Mankiewicz) convinced him by saying "I understand you're apprehensive because you've never done a musical comedy. You have nothing to worry about because neither have I." Sit back and prepare to be entertained by one of the better musical films ever made from a Broadway show.

		<fullReview>I will admit as many others who have placed reviews here that this movies biggest problem is the attempt at singing by Marlon Brando. However, I think it is wrong to include Jean Simmons in the same boat. despite this I do find the film really enjoyable and Marlon Brando is convincing as the gambler who repents. His smooth talking character Sky is everything he should be but as mentioned earlier his singing lets him down. The rest of the cast manage to bring a certain amount of class to this film when so many stage versions have made it appear dull and lifeless. I find Frank Sinatra a brilliant Nathan Detroit and his co star a brilliant Adelaide. As for the cutting of some songs from the stage musical in the film I think they were justly left out. The films pace would have been to slow if they were included. Overall I watch this movie a lot and givie it a 9 out of ten. The last mark is for the late Marlon Brandos singing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is one of the most famous of the 1950s, but IMHO it has dated more badly than most of its contemporaneous pieces, at least as far as the film version goes. The reason, I think, is down to 3 things: characters, plot and music (in other words, basically everything).The best moments in the film are the musical numbers, although these are hardly the equal of say West Side Story. There are a lot of dated songs, either what might be described as patter or list songs or else sickly sentimental romantic ballads. The songs given to the "Dolls" are forgettable and quite tedious despite being quite short. There are a few interesting ensemble piece for the "Guys" such as Fugue for Tinhorns, The Oldest Established and mostly memorably the title Guys and Dolls. Of the solo songs, the only two of note are "Luck Be a Lady", unfortunately "sung" by Brando (Couldn't a way be found to have contrived Sinatra to sing it?) and "Sit down you're rocking the boat".Although these songs are good they are short, lasting usually less than 2 minutes. In total I would say that the musical numbers add up to less than 40 minutes (probably less) of the film's 150 minutes, and as stated, many of these are substandard. But that leaves well over an hour of film, made up of a silly plot and badly drawn caricatures, and it is for this reason that Guys and Dolls is a failure.The characters are broadly drawn even by the standards of the time. In keeping with the convention of making gangsters non-threatening, they all talk in a comically over precise and genteel way always saying "I do not" rather than "I don't". Now this would be fine if it was limited to short bursts or to one or two characters, but most of the male characters talk this way for most of this (lengthy) film. It gets old very quickly and actually becomes annoying.As far as the females goes, there are only two of note. One talks in a "comical" broad New York accent and the other, more serious one, is depicted as a sexually repressed spinster eager to become wild. This is greeting card level psychology. As to why Sinatra and Brando, two serial womanisers, would suddenly both be overcome by urges to marry these women is never seriously explained. It simply happens because that's what happens in a romantic comedy.This is not the only aspect of the plot that is weak. One gangster, Big Juli, is depicted as being feared yet Brando knocks him out with a single punch at one point without there being any ramifications. And why is the crap game being held in a sewer? Is it believable that extremely rich men would travel great distances to play a high stakes game to walk 10 minutes in a stinking sewer? Maybe it was a crap game in more senses than one.The Police Chief walks in and out of scenes with all the realism of a character in a bad sit-com. He just walks in, speaks a few lines, then walks out again. I could give many more examples of the weak and contrived plotting, and of course the counter would always be "well its just a piece of light hearted entertainment, not to be taken seriously." But even the light hearted must be competently constructed in order to be enjoyable. Things simply can't happen one way at one point because the plot demands it, and another way at another point because the plot demands it.Despite several numbers being cut, the film seems all of its 150 minute length. There are many longueurs, the most interminable being the scenes with Brando and Simmons in Havana, with the implausible seduction of Simmons by Brando which is really the seduction of Brando by Simmons. Despite her handing herself to him on a plate and him previously telling us his easy conquests of women, he declines and acts like a gentleman. One might argue that her purity appeals to his jaded sensibility; however, inexplicably, he starts to fall for her AFTER he has seen her act like a totally selfish and violent drunken tart.Verdict: watch the best bits on youtube and give the film a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripe for a Remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GUYS AND DOLLS is one of the few screen versions of a Broadway musical that I would love to see a remake of as this 1955 version has several problems. Primarily there are some real problems with the casting of the leads...I, too believe Frank Sinatra should have been playing Sky Masterson, not Nathan Detroit and Detroit should have been portrayed by someone more comedic. Nathan does not have to be a great singer, but he does have to be funny and Sinatra was not. Jean Simmons made a lovely looking Sarah Brown but I would have liked to have had someone dub her singing, or they could have cast someone who could sing the role, like Shirley Jones or Jane Powell. There were also major alterations to the score which were just unnecessary. They cut "A Bushel and a Peck" and replaced it with "Pet Me Poppa". They cut "I've Never Been in Love Before" and replaced it with "A Woman in Love". They cut "My Kind of Day" and "Marry the Man Today" and replaced them with nothing. They even added a song for Sinatra "Adelaide", which was totally lame. Vivian Blaine still stops the show with "Adelaide's Lament" and Stubby Kaye still brings down the house with "Sit Down, You're Rockin the Boat"; however, as someone who has appeared in three different stage productions of the play, this film is not even close to a proper rendition of this story for the big screen and I would love to see it remade. Even the Broadway revival with the all-black cast was better than this was, as was the latter very successful revival with Peter Gallagher as Skye, Josie de Guzman as Sarah, Nathan Lane as Nathan, and Faith Prince as Aidelaide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two non-singers star in musical...results are only "okay"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I've never been a Damon Runyon fan. His characters are almost always cartoon-like (LITTLE MISS MARKER, THE BIG STREET) with odd names usually derived from gambling terms. Here the choreography uses a stylized approach that is probably in keeping with the cartoonish characters involved in the flimsy plot.A few of the songs are top notch, but the choreography lacks something, even from the opening number. And the songs, in the hands of capable singers, would have been a lot more enjoyable. As it is, MARLON BRANDO was chosen to play Sky Masterson, he with a less than average way of belting out a tune--and prim JEAN SIMMONS plays the pretty Salvation Army miss in bland style (until the Havana nightclub scene) with her own unimpressive singing voice. She and Brando both fling themselves around amusingly for the impromptu nightclub dance number--but it seems totally out of character for her Salvation Army image.That leaves VIVIAN BLAINE as Adelaide to give some professional polish to her songs (which she does, but in that nasal Adelaide voice that gets irritating after the first half-hour). Then too, STUBBY KAYE ("I've got the horse right here") is right at home with the Runyon material and the songs, as is the always dependable SHELDON LEONARD. And, of course, FRANK SINATRA, as Nathan Detroit (too bad he's not the one who gets to sing "Luck Be A Lady") is equally at home with Runyon's style.But it's a musical about floating crap games that must have worked much better on the stage. The film is too long, sags in the middle during the Havana sequence, and the entire affair looks artificial and stylized to such an extent that believability suffers. No one sings or acts naturally, which is another big drawback. You almost expect the curtain to fall after certain scenes are played.Definitely not the kind of musical I'd watch again. Once is enough.However, I'm sure fans of Brando and Jean Simmons (who think both of them can indeed sing) won't mind watching this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining musical comedy that features Sinatra as the mischeivous Nathan Detroit. He should have played Sky, but it's here where he has a little fun. He may not sing as much as people like, but he adds flavor to the film. Brando is horribly miscast as Sky Masterson. He has the tough guy persona down in the look, it's just when he talks...and when he sings, that it all goes to pot. Simmons is fine as Sister Sarah Brown, while Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye beautifully reprise their Broadway performances. The saucy world of Damon Runyon is brought to life by the cast, filled with show stopping numbers and wonderfully choreographed dance numbers. Brando is the only thing hurting this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly would star in, but when the makers couldn't get him they got "the greatest actor in the world", and the result is pretty good. Basically Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is having trouble doing what he does best, setting up a high stakes crap dice game, because he needs $1000 to get the place. So to get the money he needs, he has a $1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can't get Sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations' Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule. An interesting romantic comedy musical, with Brando singing all his own songs, and Sinatra being smooth and cool. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando was number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for , the film was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If the size of your bundle you want to increase, / I'll arrange that you go broke in quiet and peace." These words are sung by Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra), who promises his tough gang of New York high rollers that his floating crap game shall live on, especially now that the highly respected big-city gambler Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) has just arrived in town. When the two high rollers meet up, they just cannot resist placing a bet on anything imaginable. Complicating their lives are the romantic interests of Sky with a straight-laced missionary (Jean Simmons) and Nathan with a nightclub singer (Vivian Blaine), and both of these respectable women want absolutely nothing to do with gambling. Such is the plot for "Guys and Dolls," a very colorful MGM musical with a fine cast of characters. Frank Sinatra's vocalizations are top-notch as usual, and even though many will claim that Marlon Brando cannot sing, I personally feel he vocalizes quite well in this picture. Not to mention the heavyset Stubby Kaye as the friendly &amp; harmless Nicely-Nicely Johnson, and B.S. Pully &amp; Sheldon Leonard as the two toughest gamblers in the bunch, respectively Big Jule &amp; Harry the Horse.For myself, the main highlights of "Guys and Dolls" are primarily the musical numbers. The opening song, "Fugue for Tinhorns," indicates a conflict between racehorse pickers Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet (Johnny Silver), and Rusty Charlie (Dan Dayton). The musical crap shoot in the sewer is very lively and exciting what with all the fine choreography. "Adelaide's Lament" is perhaps the greatest show-stopper for Miss Adelaide (Blaine). The patriotic song "The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York" is sung by Nathan, Benny, Nicely, and a bunch of other barbershop employees &amp; customers praising "good old reliable Nathan." The tune "If I Were a Bell," well performed by Sarah Brown (Simmons), later became a jazz standard. The title song "Guys and Dolls" is well executed by Nathan, Benny, and Nicely. Nathan sings a beautiful romantic number, simply titled "Adelaide," in Mindy's Restaurant as all the New York gamblers celebrate the fact that Nathan shall finally marry Miss Adelaide after a fourteen-year engagement. And finally, Nicely is best featured in the song at the midnight prayer meeting, titled "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat." "Guys and Dolls" was originally a musical play, and this might be the major contributing factor as to why certain folks do not appreciate the movie quite as much. As of this writing, I have never seen the play, but it is my understanding that a few of the musical numbers from the play have been deleted from the movie, including one particular song sung by Sarah &amp; Adelaide titled "Marry the Man Today"; in the movie, Sarah &amp; Adelaide do not even meet, nor do they exchange even one line of dialogue during the joint wedding at the end, their only scene together in the film. In addition, by the time the film reaches its midpoint, in which Sky takes Sarah to Havana on a bet, it tends to bog down a little. But, with all that aside, "Guys and Dolls" has quite a bit to offer. Romance, funny dialogue, lively choreography, vocalizations of swell musical numbers, they're all intact! I therefore recommend that you enjoy this picture for what it is, a lavish &amp; colorful musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times and have enjoyed it every time. The music was fun and had a wonderful story line. The banter between Nathan Detroit and Miss Adelaide was classic. The storyline takes us from New York to Havana and back to New York. Sky Masterson is a high class gambler who accepts a bet from Nathan Detroit to take Sarah Brown to Havana. Which he does with much difficulty. Then enter Miss Adelaide who has been engaged to Nathan Detroit for fourteen years who keeps pressuring Nathan to marry her but his "floating crap game" keeps getting in the way. As the story goes along, in the end it all comes together. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando Sings!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brando Sings! Well, actually he talks/sings...sort of like Richard Burton and Rex Harrison did when they made their musicals. GUYS AND DOLLS is an exuberant movie directed, surprisingly, by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. This is surely Mankiewicz's lightest movie! The wide screen and stylized art direction are big pluses. Brando is Sky Masterson, who bets Frank Sinatra's Nathan Detroit that he can woo Sister Sarah, a Salvation Army volunteer, in one night. Brando is terrific and Sinatra has his only really good musical role of the 1950s --- his great musicals were all made in the '40s. Jean Simmons is appropriately uptight as Sister Sarah and Vivian Blaine, as Miss Adelaide, steals the movie. Her rendition of "ADELAIDE'S LAMENT" is a real showstopper as is Stubby Kaye's "SIT DOWN, YOU'RE ROCKING THE BOAT." DO NOT bother seeing this movie unless it's a widescreen version...you'll miss A LOT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guys and Dolls" is a high water mark in American movies with great performances from Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, and Jean Simmons. There are great supporting performances from Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Brando and Sinatra in the same movie, and in high spirits should be enough to carry the day but there is so much more to the movie. Jean Simmons is adorable and kills it with her two numbers "How will I know" and "If I were a Belle". See Elmer Ganry for another view of the repressed Bible thumper who breaks through some repression and falls in love. Grace Kelly wouldn't have worked in the role of Sarah Brown. She's too precious and can't sing and dance. Jean Simmons is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS***Guys and dolls is one of those movies where the main parts aren't exactly good at singing ( well Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine were, but the others weren't professional). The cast could have been a little better but it's one of those movies where you can't really imagine anyone different in those parts. Casting Marlon Brando as Sky Masterson was a good choice because that part required someone who was slick, cool and sexy and Brando provided all of this and he made an effort to sing, which was a good effort. The musical numbers were good (especially Luck Be A Lady, Brando looked so cool in that part!). Some of the cast had been in the Broadway production of it and made it quite a good movie. This movie is probably the most under rated musical I've seen and it doesn't deserve to be as it is a great story line and and has a good cast.I would give it a respectable 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful colors and some great songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie version of the Broadway show has the illogical casting of Marlon Brando in the singing lead of Sky Masterson, but it's also the only pairing of Brando and Frank Sinatra. Like many of the great MGM musicals, this one features costumes with about 40,000 different colors (compare "The Harvey Girls", in which the cowboys have shirts and bandanas, with no color repeated).The great songs in this show are, IMHO, "Luck, be a lady tonight" (one of those songs that you always wonder where it came from) and "Sit down, you're rocking the boat", guaranteeing Stubby Kaye his fifteen minutes of fame. The plot is just substantial enough to hang the songs on: Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) needs some quick cash to rent a site for the night's big craps game, so he bets his gambling buddy Masterson that he can't score on a date with the attractive but prudish Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), leader of the local mission. I don't consider this one of the classic musicals, but many do, and it's enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only copy I have of this musical was recorded off of the A&amp;E Channel, so unfortunately I have never actually seen the opening numbers. Where the tape starts has Frank Sinatra weighing himself and then going into the "Oldest Established" song. But unless the first 20 minutes are just plain wretched, Guys and Dolls is one of my favorite old fashioned musicals. There are no twists and turns in the plot, but that's to be expected. Musicals were never known for their complicated stories, but for neat little tales where people meet, sing, and fall in love in less then two and a half hours. When I was in the eighth grade we put on a junior version of G&amp;D, but it cut out about half of the songs and made the story even more simple. Thankfully I stumbled upon the 1955 classic, which apparently doesn't have all of the songs from the Broadway version but still features a great cast, catchy tunes and a wonderfully funny script. One critic here complained that the film does not have the song "All I Wish For You," but if I'm correct that was song by Sarah Brown's father and was probably the most boring ballad of the lot. When I saw this on stage at a local theater and heard it, I was shocked by how dull it was. I much prefer "I'll Know," "Sit Down, etc." and the many stage productions with Adelaide over the stuff they cut out. Besides, you usually can't include everything from the stage show in the movie counterpart, because then it would be too long and audiences would get bored. I say that their cuts were necessary. Before I leave, I must give props to Marlon Brando, who hasn't been in a musical since Guys and Dolls. He's a great singer and perfect for the suave conman, Sky Masterson. I give G&amp;D 4/4 stars for being the perfect old-time musical showstopper.</fullReview>

Or Sarah, learning that he took her to Havana to win a bet, saying "You're a gambler, that's what gamblers do...they try to win bets"Or the Mission guy noting he didn't see many rich gamblers seeking salvation and Sky answering: "Is it a sin to gamble or only wrong to gamble and lose?"

		<fullReview>It seems that all movies made from theatre productions end up pretty darn good, and this is definitely no exception. I love Marlon Brando and he was one of the sexiest guys back in the day. And Frank Sinatra is immortal, even to a naive little 17-year-old like me. I first saw "Guys and Dolls" as a musical that our high school put on about eight or so years ago. I didn't really understand the plot (hey, I was still in the single digits age-wise), but when I saw it on screen last year I instantly fell in love with it. At any rate, the characters are realistic (compared to the rest of Hollywood anyway) and definitely unforgettable, whether they are being portrayed by big-name actors or high school students - Jean Simmons or my oldest sister's best friend... I loved this movie. The musical score was excellent, the plot was sweet and love-driven enough to make me happy, and like I said, I love the actors - can you get better than Frank and Marlon? Well, this is a must-see movie. That's all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of moving musicals from the stage to the screen or vice versa; but this is my absolute fave stage musical of all time and the one bad song from the score was cut from the film!!Anyone who considers themselves remotely to be a fan of Brando, in the old days, owes it to themselves to see this film. He has never been sexier- no leather required! And he more than holds his own in the songs, it shows how a good actor can get away with being a mediocre singer.Brando apart, this contains some wonderfully subtle comic performance in the form of Vivain Blaine as Miss Adelaide, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely and of course the marvellous Frank- who was going to play Sky but then didn't. Some people consider this to be a shame- personally I think it worked out just fine.Because it was a stage musical and the film makers have padded things out a bit- giving us more of the Sky/Sarah relationship (good) it does end up feeling slightly overlong- but ultimately it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that most of us with an artistic bent, have played some part in this musical in high school drama, or tried out for part in the theater, or in some community theater, or watched the tape a bizillion times. Well, I sure have watched it many times, I have the sheet music and sing all the songs. They are such great songs. I think Rosie O'Donnell (The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Sleepless in Seattle), should make fewer mistakes in the lyrics, though. She is great about knowing all the words of the musicals. She always amazes me. I liked "Sky Masterson" Marlon Brando (Apocalypse Now), he sure was a very lovable and to a certain degree an innocent sinner, who knew a lot about the Bible. "Sarah Brown" Jean Simmons (How to Make an American Quilt) all stuffy and self-righteous getting drunk with a few drinks was hilarious. I love the words of "If I were a bell," "My Time of Day". "Nathan Detroit" Frank Sinatra (From Here to Eternity) postponing that wedding trip that gave "Miss Adelaide" Vivian Blaine (Public Pigeon No. One) the whizzes and the sneezes. I love Barbra Streisand singing "Adelaide's Lament" on her The Broadway Album. Stubby Kaye (Cat Ballou) played one of my favorite characters in the play Nicely Nicely Johnson, he was so cute and chubby. I feel that probably the entire world has seem this tape, but I know that is not true, there are tones of young people that have to be exposed to such an innocent and beautiful era. Do yourself a favor watch this one, if you have not seen it, if you have just watch it again, it will brighten your day. Favorite Scenes: Adelaide and Sky in Havana. The poker game at the sewer. That is some great dancing. Favorite Quotes: Anyone "Hi, Nicely, How are you?" Nicely's reply: "Nicely, Nicely, thank you!" He said that every time someone said hi to him. He was so cute.

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a must-see for musical aficionados. Given what he had to work with, Joseph Mankiewicz might have made the greatest musical of all time. Unfortunately, because of its flaws, it's hard to savor everything that is good about Guys and Dolls. Imagine a beautiful woman with an horrendous scar on her face or the girlfriend Seinfeld dropped because she had 'man hands'. Guys and Dolls is like that. It was already a long-running hit on Broadway and the elements that it brought along with it made it a surefire winner. The book, an adaption of a Damon Runyon story is perhaps one of the most successful musical comedies ever. Abe Burrows, Jo Swerling and Frank Loesser integrated words and music as well as has ever been done. None of that 'hey kids, let's put on a musical' garbage. Every song belongs to the story and makes the story better. At least two of the songs are fixtures in the Standards repertoire and there are no lame songs at all. If that isn't enough, the story would stand on its own as a comedy without the music. Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) needs a thousand dollars to keep the oldest running floating crap game in New York afloat. The only way he can think of to accomplish this is to lure Sky Masterson, (Brando) into a sucker bet that he just can't possibly win. Masterson claims he can get any woman he wants, so Detroit bets him he can't lure the girl in the Salvation Army band on a trip to Havana. It's got romantic comedy cliché written all over it, but, chock full of Runyon characters, it provides great fodder for comedy and music. Michael Kidd's choreography, moreover, is superb - in league with Fosse or Kelly's great work, and although there's nary a dancer in the cast, the chorus pulls it off as an ensemble. For a musical with no dancing stars, this has some of the best dance ever. Looking at Mankiewicz's bio, I notice that he has only one musical to his credit and this is it. So, he didn't do too bad. This musical is a visual delight. The dance scenes are one of the reasons this is a landmark film. He takes Kidd's choreography and integrates it seamlessly into the fabric of the movie. Where 42nd Street's 'Forgotten Man" sequence creates a world on stage, Mankiewicz takes the stage out into the world. His street scene, following a pickpocket through the traffic of New York, just throbs with life, energy and color. That scene alone makes the movie worth watching. However, this movie has a tin ear. Although, the music is wonderful, the performance is not. Another fact gleaned from Mankiewicz's bio is that he worked a lot with Brando. This seems to be at the root of the problem. The casting is a disaster and points to bias on his part. Did Brando, star of some of the fifty's most compelling dramas approach Mankiewicz and whisper, 'C'mon Joe, I could do a musical, I can do anything I'm a method actor.' And, he does nearly act his way out of a jam. His Masterson is charismatic as only Brando can be. Trouble is BRANDO COULD NOT SING!!! As a result the romantic ballads that should be transcendent are painful. To add insult to injury, just as Gene Kelly had done before him, Mankiewicz uses arguably the finest ballad singer ever, not as the romantic lead, but as the comic foil. This is a major artistic crime. In this case, it's compounded by the fact Sinatra was not a comedian. He managed a credible Nathan Detroit, but I can't help but wonder what this would have looked like with someone like Phil Silvers, or Dan Daily. I could see Daily in either role actually. The musical injury extends also to the revue scene with Adelaide and the Kittens in the nightclub and to the singing of Jean Simmons. Viviane Blaine was in the original cast, so, I can hardly blame Mankiewicz, still the numbers which just don't sound as well as they should are painful to a musician's ears. Was this some kind of Bertold Brecht alienation thing. Well, I was alienated, but this wasn't supposed to be Mother Courage was it? All in all, there's lot's to enjoy but you can't help wishing that someone would remake it with the right cast.</fullReview>

I guess if one hasn't seen G&amp;D done right on stage, they don't know how far short it falls on-screen.Dialogue - achingly slow. This musical is not supposed to be spoken in slo-mo but much of the dialogue is done that way. And with long pauses too."I'll Know" - someone here says the song is fine. But she's off key! I have to mute the TV to get through that scene."Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat" - yes, wonderfully sung, but why is the chorus sitting still, and Nicely Nicely staying in one place? (Choreography "stunning"? No way!) I was in a local stage production of G&amp;D where we had this number all over the floor; with that great music and an excited crowd tearing around the stage with Nicely, the audience roared and wanted encores every time.I hope the upcoming remake will show this musical the way it should be, with speedy rat-a-tat dialogue, kinetic song-and-dance numbers, and no dead time. I hear the crew that was behind "Chicago" will be working on the remake, so perhaps there's hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Frank Loesser's songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer, they're bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical. Mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `Adelaide's Lament', concludes by having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual `Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has none of the wit that his films like `All About Eve' have. Part of the blame has to go to the leads, just about all of whom are miscast: Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential (the songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might. Only Blaine, as the lovelorn showgirl Adelaide, commands our attention like a Broadway pro should. The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great Hollywood musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big splashy film of the Broadway musical. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him IF he gives up craps. He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), who bets big, is in town. He bets Sky that he can't get mission worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. That may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie!This is a real mixed bag--there's some wonderful stuff here. The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible. The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end. Also Brando is really quite good here--it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off. I have to admit seeing big, bulky Brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! Also Sinatra is pretty good and Blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.Now for the bad parts--Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab colorless role and can't do much with it. The movie is far too long at 150 minutes--the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have been shortened. Also most of the characters speak in very precise English--contractions are never used. Maybe it's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but I found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie.It's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls tells the story of gambler Nathan Detroit, who in an attempt to raise money for an illegal craps game bets playboy Sky Masterson that he will be unable to get any girl he wants. Sky goes after the prim and proper charity worker Sarah Brown. As the movie progresses, Sky begins to fall in love with her. While this is an okay movie, it is basically the same as any generic 1950's musical, complete with goofy songs and silly dance numbers. I mean, I don't mind dance numbers in musicals, but when you have to do back flips and electric slides to roll a pair of dice, you might need to get some help.As I said, the plot is pretty generic and can be found in any 50's musical as well as modern romantic comedies. Guy makes bet that he can get girl. Guy gets girl. Guy falls in love with girl. Guy feels bad about bet, tells girl truth. Girl dumps guy. Girl takes guy back. However, the movie doesn't strictly focus on Sky Masterson and Sarah Brown. It also looks at the relationship between Nathan Detroit and his (hopeful) bride to be Adelaide.The roles are played really well. Frank Sinatra is funny as Nathan Detroit. His whole performance just makes you crack a smile. And of course, the master Marlon Brando's performance as Sky Masterson is perfect. To tell you the truth, one of the reasons I watched this movie was to see the what I was expecting to be terrible rendition of "Luck Be a Lady", but he shocked me with how good he actually sang it.Overall, this movie is okay if you like light hearted musicals, but it's kind of silly.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brando &amp; Sinatra were miscast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Guys &amp; Dolls is the usual problem with Hollywood's refusal to get actors who can sing when they adapt a Broadway musical to the screen.Just think of 'South Pacific' and 'Camelot'. Why would you not have Robert Goulet &amp; Julie Andrews reprise their roles?In contrast,the best adaptation was done with 'Oklahoma' where you had terrific actor-singers in the lead.Brando's acting was good, but his singing was flat and lacked volume. How could anyone sing so badly? Even Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin sang better in 'Paint Your Wagon'. Brando was cast strictly because he was the hot actor of the moment. Some lovely songs were ruined. I also think Brando was too young looking to be intimidating to all those hoods. He's the 'highest roller of them all'? Sinatra was miscast. Nathan doesn't have to be a singer; he does have to have comic timing.I'd have cast Robert Mitchum (who could actually sing) as Sky Masterson and Phil Silvers as Nathan Detroit.Jean Simmons was fine as Sarah and Vivian Blaine was great as Adelaide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I bought the movie, I listened to the Broadway recording many times to tide myself over. Overall, I like the original book a whole lot more. "More I Cannot Wish You" and "Bushel and a Peck" are my two favorite songs on that album! Most of the Broadway leads are better...i.e., they can sing...except that Vivian Blaine was a much, much better Adelaide. Overall, though, the Guys and Dolls movie is always enjoyable. Fred Astaire and Marlon Brando play off each other very well...and except for his voice, I can understand how easily Sarah Brown fell for Sky. He was a very handsome man! "Luck Be a Lady" explodes with energy and truly wonderful dancing, and again, Vivian Blaine is hilarious. I guess I'm biased towards musicals in general, despite a few flaws here and there. So what's a little cider in the ear?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Stage Musical not done justice in film version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could never understand why Guys &amp; Dolls had the great reputation it did until I recently got involved in a theatrical production of the show. The first thing I did was get a hold of a CD of the score. I happened to listen to the Nathan Lane/Broadway version from a few years ago. Much to my surprise the songs were top notch. Even more surprising was that some of the best songs in the show are given to supporting players, like the title song, Guys &amp; Dolls, or You're Rocking the Boat or the opening 3part harmony "Fugue". The 'book' is fast paced and hysterical. So how come I never liked the movie all that much I asked myself? Well after talking with some people familiar with theatrical productions of Guys &amp; Dolls, I was informed that some songs from the original show were dropped in the movie and lesser quality songs were added to the movie. Second of all, I had always dreaded the musical numbers with Marlon Brando &amp; Jean Simmons in the movie version. While both are extremely talented actors, singers they are not! Why oh why I always felt couldn't their voices have been dubbed!?!? Also, the pacing in the movie I've always felt dragged. Let's put it this way, I'm 42 years old as of the writing of this review and all the many times this movie has been on television and I've tried watching it, I can never get past the "If I were a bell I'd be ringing number". By then my ears hurt from Brando &amp; Simmons and I'm sleepy from the slow pace! This is definitely one movie version that needs to be remade and given the razz-matazz and fast pacing and vocally talented stars it deserves!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie and a great piece of miscasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Simmons, who is never seen in this kind of role, is astonishingly good as Sister Sarah. She of course was dubbed. I know the rule has always been "grab Brando if you can get him," but the inscrutable decision not to dub him, something I'm sure he insisted on as a condition of taking the role, does mar the film. He is an awful singer, which is a shame because Frank Loesser wrote a beautiful number just for the movie (The Eyes of a Woman in Love"), which replaces the nice but inferior "I've Never Been in Love Before" from the stage version.Casting the Broadway originals of Nicely and Adelaide was a real coup. Neither one is known for much else but they are sensational here. Still, I have to wonder if Loesser really had in mind that "let's get it over with" tempo for "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat." I know that Bernstein envisioned a slower tempo for "I Feel Pretty" in West Side Story. The original creators don't always get their way.Oddly, Sinatra doesn't get to sing much, which is just as well. He was the original choice for Billy Bigelow in Carrousel and would have been an absolute disaster, not from lack of talent, but because his voice is not right for operetta-type musicals. (Listen to him sing "Old Man River" in When the Clouds Roll By. It will make you gag.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame Hollywood Version of a Perfect Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers most from Hollywood executives and their unending urge to 'fix' the material. The original Broadway show was impeccable! One of the two shows that to me are 'perfect musicals', the other being 'Gypsy'. The original stage show moved like lightning. The film gives you several opportunities to make a sandwich, or give you a 'lot' of bathroom breaks. The cast is wrong, except for Stubby Kaye and Vivian Blaine,who created their roles on Broadway. They made Frank Loesser write additional music for the movie, and then they dumped 'More I Cannot Wish You', one of the sweetest, most beautiful, lump-in-the-throat songs you will ever hear. The saving graces of this movie are that Stubby Kaye's and Vivian Blaine's performances are immortalized on film, two great stage actors, most of whose work, being live performance, is gone forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys &amp; Dolls is a title any and everyone has heard of, if they pay any attention to the stage, and this show came out first on stage. I'd certainly heard the name, but knew nothing about it until the movie showed up on public television. I was disappointed. Every character delivers each line as if they'd just completed a course in Brooklyn elocution. They use slang and contractions with the precision of automatons. This makes the dialogue sound stilted, oddly artificial. The choreography and every gesture reflect the same wooden, inhuman take on life in the recent past (the film was made in 1955 and the story takes place during the Depression). Perhaps this approach lessened audience discomfort in identifying with card sharps, crap players, gamblers, the ignorant and shiftless. At any rate, I found it painful to watch and listen to. That's a shame, because I expected to enjoy Sinatra, Brando and all the rest. The tunes proved familiar. Take for instance, "I Got The Horse Right Here." I've heard it a dozen times over the years (I'm in my fifties) and had no clue it came from this show. It was easy to follow the three vocal lines, yet was hardly beautiful. Remember the scenes in Music Man, where the salesmen sing (speak) "He Doesn't Know The Territory" or when the leading town ladies do "Pick A Little, Talk A Little"? Multiple lines come through clearly,without sounding as if everything's overdone to make up for my lack of exposure to English. And they were performed beautifully. Maybe this is why I'd never bumped into this movie 'til now. If such things don't trouble you, by all means see it and draw your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Average Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is not one of the worst musicals ever but it is also far from being one of the best. It is simply average. The plot isn't anything wonderful but pretty much works. It has the ability to prevent the film from dying but not the ability to make it work very well. The performances are mostly decent and that of Marlon Brando is several steps above decent, but the best performance comes from Jean Simmons of the old Lawrence Oliviers Hamlet. Jean Simmons is amazing in her performance as a Red Cross preacher who falls in love with Brando's heavy drinking and heavy gambling character. The direction is about just the same level as the story. Decent but nothing special at all. The visual effects are also pretty decent. The music is exultant at times but is more than a little repetitive in it's tunes and so only one or two songs are really good out of the many they sing. A decent film and a classic but not great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aged badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few musical comedies from the 50's and 60's managed to survive the test of time and remain universally entertaining; Guys and Dolls is not one of those. The value it holds is mostly nostalgic, and although it has some fantastic choreography and memorable musical numbers, not enough is done to transfer them in any interesting way from the stage to the big screen.Of course, we wouldn't even be discussing Guys and Dolls if it wasn't for its star power; the two leads are indeed fantastic, although neither Brando or Sinatra are quite at the top of their game. In fact, Jean Simmons nearly steals the show from both of them. So if you're really curious about how Marlon Brando sings, you should check it out, but don't expect too much - he does a passable job but no more, and as acting goes he had better moments. Otherwise, Guys and Dolls is essential viewing for Sinatra completists, for major fans of 50's comedy movies, and for musical film buffs, but for anyone else it's too long, too filled with clichés and very outdated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its Moments, but not one of my Favourite Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never really been able to see the point of Damon Runyon. I know he still has his admirers, but I doubt if many of them were born very far outside the New York city limits. His stories of New York gangsters, gamblers and lowlifes, with their eccentric nicknames and picturesque slang, have always struck me as artificial and mannered."Guys and Dolls" is based on two of his short stories and has a typically Runyonesque plot. Nathan Detroit is a New York gambler who is trying to organise an illegal craps game under the noses of the police. He needs to hire a venue for the game, but is short of money for the down-payment. He bets an acquaintance, Sky Masterson, that Masterson will not be able to persuade a young woman, of Detroit's choosing, to accompany him on a date to Havana. Masterson, who is an inveterate gambler and proud of his reputation as a ladies' man, accepts, whereupon Detroit nominates Sarah Brown, a beautiful but puritanical young Salvation Army officer who runs the local mission. (Actually, Sarah's organisation is referred to as the "Save a Soul Mission", and they wear red uniforms rather than blue, but they are obviously modelled on the Salvation Army). Of course (this being a musical), he manages to persuade Sarah to come with him, and the two find themselves falling for one another. Intertwined with this is the story of Detroit's own romance with his long-suffering fiancée Adelaide, to whom he has been engaged for fourteen years. (Adelaide claims that Nathan's treatment of her has caused her to develop persistent psychosomatic colds).Marlon Brando was cast as Masterson, even though his is not a name one would normally associate with musicals. He was, however, an actor who resisted becoming associated with only one type of film. After he first made his name in the early fifties in social realist dramas such as "A Streetcar named Desire", "The Wild One" and "On the Waterfront" he widened his experience by ticking off one genre after another. "Julius Caesar"- tick Shakespeare. "Desiree"- tick costume drama. "The Young Lions"- tick war. "One-Eyed Jacks"- tick westerns. With "Guys and Dolls" he ticked off musicals, although because of his mediocre singing voice it was not a genre to which he was really suited. Jean Simmons is not a name normally associated with musicals either, although she had a much better voice than Brando's and had sung in one of her early British films, "The Way to the Stars".There was, however, a logic in casting these two actors. The role of Masterson- a man so charming and persuasive that he can persuade a girl to come on a date with him, even though he represents the complete opposite of everything that she stands for- demanded an actor with powerful charisma- and who, in the fifties, was more charismatic than Brando? (Joseph L Mankiewicz had doubtless been impressed by Brando's performance in his "Julius Caesar"). Simmons may not have been associated with musicals, but by 1955 she had become strongly associated with sweet, innocent heroines, so seemed just right for the idealistic Sarah.The other two main roles were taken by actors with much more musical experience. Frank Sinatra had been disappointed not to get the role of Masterson himself, and behaved rather gracelessly towards Brando in consequence, but in fact he was very good as Detroit, a cynical, worldly wise wheeler-dealer of the type he excelled in portraying. I doubt if he would have been as effective as the big romantic lead Masterson.I was, however, less impressed by Vivian Blaine as Adelaide. She was a major star of the musical theatre who had created the role on Broadway, but I felt she lacked the presence and charisma on screen of her co-stars. (If only Mankiewicz had been able to overcome his dislike of Marilyn Monroe, who had wanted the role). She also makes Adelaide a rather unsympathetic character, the sort of woman who has fallen in love with an idealised image of her man which bears no relation to reality but who spends all her time trying to force him to conform to that image. (Her whining, nasal accent doesn't help, either). Although the film ends with a double wedding, I got the impression that the marriage of Adelaide and Nathan was not destined to be a happy one. I wondered, in fact, whether there was a hint that Nathan is supposed to be gay. Although this is something which in the fifties could not have been made explicit, it would explain why clearly prefers the company of his male friends to that of Adelaide, and why he has gone so long without proposing. (His main interest in her seems to be that he will lose street credibility without a "doll" on his arm).The general air of unreality is heightened by the flat, artificial-looking stage sets; the film might have been improved if some of the scenes had been shot on location in New York, as had been done a few years earlier in another Sinatra musical, "On the Town". There are one or two sweet ballads for Masterson and Sarah, but in general the music is not particularly memorable, with the exception of the well-known "Luck be a Lady Tonight" and perhaps "Siddown, You're Rocking the Boat". Overall, this film has some enjoyable moments, but I would not class it as one of my favourite musicals. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guys &amp; Dolls" on stage is one of the three great classic musicals (the others are "Music Man" and "Oklahoma." Unfortunately, the transition to the screen is a disaster.The casting is abysmal. With all the talented singers in the world, casting Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando as the singing leads was a tragedy. I like both of them as actors and I once had the pleasure of seeing Jean Simmons as Desire in "A Little Night Music" (a role originally played by Glynnis Johns. . .), but they simply cannot pull off the ballads. I put these casting errors up there with Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady."In addition, apparently the stars had too much pull with the filmmakers. Cutting some of the songs from the stage production (especially "Marry The Man Today"), yet adding the dreadful "Adelaide" is unfathomable.The pacing is slow and there is no energy.For those of you who like this film, I beg you to go see a professional stage production of this show if you ever have the chance -- you will be truly blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fugue For Tinhorns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location. He bets chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky can't make a prim missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store ?This is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I don't. My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat (nicely performed by Kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. The movie's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this as I know the music but had never seen the musical. The film was extremely slow at times, boring in fact. I do wonder about the casting as you would expect 'real' singers to play the main roles. Brando was very good, but thanks only to his acting. Sinatra's singing ability was wasted.The ending was as expected, but happened so suddenly it was ridiculous! Was a whole section just removed? (I know all plots are ridiculous, but at least most pretend the ending will be a surprise!) I would like to see the original stage production as I understand several songs were cut. If the part in Havana had not been so long, despite being good, or the boring parts removed, there would have been time for these.A re-make would be an excellent idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys and Dolls is a great musical, with terrific songs, snappy dialogue and memorable characters. Unfortunately, the movie version features a cast who, with the exception of Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide, basically sleepwalk their way through it.For example, the would-be crackling back and forth patter of "Sue Me" comes off as one-sided, as Ms. Blaine sizzles in her diatribe against Sinatra's (Nathan Detroit) half-hearted protests that he loves her. And the supposed chemistry (yeah, chemistry) between Brando and Simmons never even gets started. Only when her character gets an overdose of Bacardi does Simmons wake up for a lively rendition of "If I Were a Bell." You want to get a kick out of watching this classic show? Seek out a high school production or a community theatre revival.</fullReview>
