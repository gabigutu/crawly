		<shortDescription>"Death Wish" brought to the 21st century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No logic but lots of action, violence, gunfights and gore in this one. There is very little meat on the story-bone and in times where, thanks to TV, everyone is an expert on police procedures the lack of logic is almost appalling. But throw the CSI-knowledge over board and you're in for a crazy and entertaining ride. Nicely shoot with some great camera movement Wan is shooting stuff to pieces almost like Hong Kong directors did in the early '90s. No marksmen here, but who cares, this is pure pleasure for the eyes. Kevin Bacon delivers nicely and adds a whole new facet to the dad-on-a-rampage character. There's even a little "Taxi Driver" in him ? and not only because of his gun and hairstyle.If this is your poison go give Death Sentence a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I think Bacon never fails to perform. The movies he picks to do show a lot of his depth as he very rarely plays a one dimensional character. There was a story to this movie. A very complicated story. If you didn't notice the story you got distracted by the violence. Some of the dialogue was cheesy but that is what makes it great.The only problem I had with the film was the detective role. She seemed to serve zero purpose whatsoever. I am not taking away from the acting done for that role. But every scene she was in was slower and just did not fit with the rest of the movie. Other then acting as a very short winded inner monologue for Bacon's character, all she did was say no no, your safe, they're dead, and no. We all knew where this movie was going we didn't need the attempt to turn into a crime drama. If you did not like this movie you went into it expecting the wrong thing. This is a revenge movie. It had no supernatural parts. When someone was shot they bled a lot and they were in pain. If you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone in your own mind or in your dreams go see this movie it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vengeance, pure and simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reminiscent of previous vigilante films like Death Wish and The Brave One, this film is much more action-packed and gripping. Kevin Bacon gives an excellent performance as a traumatised father who witnessed his son's murder and decides to punish the killers himself, rather than depend on the police.The action scenes are truly suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat, especially a foot-chase that culminates in a deadly game of hide-and-seek within a 5-storey parking garage. Another factor that sets this film apart from previous vigilante thrillers is that it still manages to serve up quite a few twists and turns that add to the tension.As exciting and gripping as this film is, please be fore-warned: the violence shown on screen is not for those with weak stomachs. It's graphic, brutal, edgy and tense. Still, this does not detract from the film at all. If anything, it makes the whole experience more visceral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not listen to all the negative reviews!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything is going to hurt this movie, it is going to be all of the negative reviews it has been receiving from all of these stuck up critics! Death Sentence is exactly what everyone is expecting it to be, and fans of the 'Revenge' genre will have a blast watching Kevin Bacon chase after his son's killers in this gruesome and riveting storyline.Kevin Bacon gives an almost scary performance, and the movie will have moments that make some people cringe, and surprisingly some moments that will bring people tears.Mixing revenge and violence with the struggles in the main character's life works well, and the movie never slows down or gets boring. It is not as if the director really messed anything up, and I don't know what the negative feedback was for, but this movie will certainly entertain the majority of people who go to see it. Have fun!</fullReview>

The action sequences got me to the edge of the seat and boy, this really doesn't happen very often I must confess.

		<shortDescription>Things I've Learned from Watching "Death Sentence (2007)"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD * (duh!)- If your son is bleeding to death, it's a lot more useful to shout for help when there's nobody around than to call an ambulance.- If your son is bleeding to death, let him walk by himself instead of carrying him - it would help stopping the bleed.- When you are angry - stand in the middle of the road and wait for a car to smash you.- Gang members only get flesh wounds when getting hit by a car on the highway.- Montages are NOT a cliché.- Gang members look super-cool in red light.- When you want to sentence a murderer - it's enough to go to trial with one single evidence at hand (a witness).- You can kill the guy, who murdered your son, at the same day he was released - the police would never suspect you did it. And if a policewoman would know you did it, she'll just tell you it's "not OK".- Your friends at work would never ask you why your hand is all wrapped in bandage and is bleeding. But if you want to be sure - put your hand behind your back.- Working in an office would put you in better shape than any gang member.- There is no bullet in the world that can hit Kevin Bacon - unless he's running in slow motion or found in red lighting environment, which tends to make him vulnerable.- Kelly Preston never learned what "overacting" means.- If you secured the entire house and locked all the windows, it's OK to open the door to whoever rings the bell.- If you're working in a hospital, it's good to tell a joke to someone whose entire family has just been murdered.- If you're working in a bank, it's good to tell a joke to someone who draws all his savings.- If you're working in a bar, you would never believe that anyone else speaks Spanish.- Always read the instructions before using a weapon. It will also teach you how to shoot.- Having your son in hospital would give you immunity when murdering bad guys.- It's important to shave your head before going to kill your family's murderers.- If you're going to crash into another guy's car, don't put your seat belt - it's for pu**ies.- Mutilation is super-cool.- Even Kevin Bacon can't save this movie from James Wan's direction.1/10 Hilarious movie. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know many people on here have posted that this film isn't based in reality and I for one am GLAD!!! We see reality too often day in and day out on the news, and the sad truth of it is, the bad guys usually get away with murder and don't suffer any repercussions for it. So it's great to see a film that delivers to us what it would be like if justice was served! Director, James Wan of the original "SAW" movie shows us he is not a one trick pony and can deliver his talents past just the horror genre. Kevin Bacon and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job delivering a very believable grief stricken family, I would definitely recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least in walking tall he recuperated before going on a revenge spree. The police were made to look very stupid. After 2 policemen are killed and they know who the killers are, no one tries to track them down. Please... If I knew a gang was after me and my family, I certainly would not keep them at home. They would be on the first flight out of town. He escapes from the hospital and the police know that he is out for revenge, but no one bothers to look for him at his house. Someone who has never handled guns before becomes an expert marksman by reading the manuals. It would not have taken much to have the plot make more sense. They could at least have the police trying to do something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie surprised me. I expected something over acted and plot less. Boy was I wrong. This movie was really good. They show the reality of things that do happen. Kevin Bacon gave a good performance along with Kelly Preston. The Action was good. The violence was brutal and done in a realistic fashion. The language was also heavy and use in every sentence. The only problem with me is that the gang members were a little over done. I think they were kind of over the top including all the tattoos and what not. But besides that the movie was fun and intense.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>$hit Sentence* (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(*Respect to Spinal Tap's Shark Sandwich.) First off, I love me some revenge films.From the masterful (Park Chan-Wook's vengeance trilogy, Straw Dogs, or Dead Man's Shoes) to the brutal (I Spit on Your Grave or Thriller: En Grym Film), there is no genre that does it for me quite like revenge. So when I first heard about Death Sentence, I figured it'd be worth a viewing: Kevin Bacon, murdered child, director of Saw, I expected it to be at least passable.Well, I humbly stand corrected. I'm pretty sure if you are someone defending/championing this movie, you are either a) semi-retarded, or b) you need to see a real revenge movie. Everything about this POS is so blatantly one-dimensional that I'm amazed it doesn't slide off the celluloid it was filmed on...The victim's family doesn't seem THAT upset that their son was murdered, there's no real passion about anything - it's all just very go-with-the-flow. The courtroom scene is pure comedy gold, with the 97-pound-weakling 'killer' smirking and leering at a pretty-much-nonplussed Kevin Bacon. Bacon's character, Nick Hume, doesn't appear too tortured about losing his 'golden boy' (okay, he sobs in the shower once) , and the murder of his son's killer seems almost spur-of-the-moment.As for the thugs, they're all hilarious - a bunch of didn't-quite-make-the-cut extras from a circa-1997 nü-metal video shoot and should be filed under 'outdated badass' at Central Casting Come on, tribal tattoos and facial piercings!? What are they, a MySpace 'gang' who still listen to bands like Staind or Disturbd, or some other group of no-talents who can't spell, either? And look, there's Johnny Goodman! Just a day or two before seeing this I was thinking to myself, 'Why haven't I seen John Goodman in anything good lately?' I guess now I know why, he's way too busy making turkeys like this. The one-liners aren't clever, not even in a juvenile way, and one line of dialogue, ("Fear is for the enemy. Fear and bullets.") is ripped almost word-for-word from James O'Barr's The Crow (another epic revenge story turned into a lousy movie).As for the acting? Kevin Bacon is the only one who almost pulls it off, but only almost.Kelly Preston? Obviously not, she can't even act like Travolta isn't gay.Goodman? Nope. Sorry.Garrett 'You-just-bought-your-family-a-death-sentence!' Hedlund? Hey, if I wanted to see a goth kid have a temper tantrum, I'd just e-mail Weston Cage that Little Debbie's had gone out of business , or that there was now a worldwide shortage of blue-black hair dye?.I digress - you know how certain foreign markets tend to eat up some movies better than the film's own home country does? Well, apparently my fellow Canadians love this movie because it has so many references to their national excuse, hockey. The murdered son (the one Nick Hume actually likes) is a hockey player and wants to go to Canada, and we see a cop picking up a broken hockey stick at a crime scene, after Hume has killed one of the 'gang' members. I counted at least 3 or 4 references to hockey in this movie, and I heard the movie was intended to be released here under the name Sudden Death Sentence, Eh? Back to the topic at hand ? this movie sucked. The bad guys get off way too easily, same as in every other revenge movie. Nobody's cracked it yet ? the revenge film that goes all the way. We don't even get to see Nick Hume waste Billy Darley in this movie. All that time wasted and there's not even a bloody payoff for the audience. What a waste of 110 minutes. James Wan, whose first Saw film was at least memorable, has dropped the ball horribly. He should instead stick to casting winners like Donnie Wahlberg in his movies and coming up with cheesy gross-outs like the needle pit in Saw II. Truly, the only death sentence in this cinematic abortion is the viewer's own ? knowing that they are now 110 wasted minutes closer to their own demise.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good golly, this is one bad, bad movie. I must agree with one poster on the message boards: Sitting all the way through such a dumb movie leaves one feeling pretty stupid.What's wrong with this movie? Well, when creating fiction, a good rule of thumb is to come up with some sympathetic characters -- at least the main character should be someone with whom the audience can empathize. The plot should also be plausible. Unfortunately, the main character in Death Sentence is a complete idiot, and the plot is so ridiculous I cannot even come up with an adequate metaphor. If you are tempted to watch this movie, please allow me to save you some time with this short summary. First, the main character, Nick Hume, (played by Kevin Bacon) almost runs out of gas with his oldest son in the car, and has to stop in a very bad part of town, an irresponsible oversight that directly leads to the death of his son. Then, rather than send his son's murderer to prison (where he could at least take some comfort in the fact that the murderer would spend the next five years or so being forcibly sodomized), he decides he's Charles Bronson and murders the guy instead.Thus, Mr. Hume invites the wrath of the killer's brother and his drug-crazed gang of psychopaths, directly leading to the murder of his wife, and the critical injuring of his other son and himself -- because apparently the best thing to do when you know a gang is coming to kill you is to just stay home and wait it out. (Luckily, he and his son are only injured, because as lustful as this gang is for revenge, they only put one bullet in each family member, and don't bother to check if they are dead or not.) When he wakes up in the hospital, he does not cry for his dead wife or kick himself for being such reckless idiot. He spends a minute with his presumably dying son, then goes out the hospital window to finish what he started. Remarkably, the police do not think to look for him at his home, which is the first place he goes, and is also a crime scene. Neither do they try to call him on his mobile phone, which he is carrying, or look for his car, which he is driving.Mr. Hume buys a bunch of guns, gives himself a very bad haircut for no apparent reason, and then sets about wasting the rest of the gang in a very graphic fashion, shooting like Jet Li -- pretty good for a stockbroker.Critically, perhaps mortally, wounded, Mr. Hume goes home -- where the police finally figure out he might be -- sits down on his sofa and watches old home movies. The police tell him his son might pull through. The movie ends there, but we can assume in a final act of idiocy that Mr. Hume dies, thereby leaving his sole surviving son an orphan. Thanks, Dad.In closing, I suggest that if you need to see a revenge movie, rent Death Wish instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning And Gut-wrenching Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been debating about how to review this film...and you know what? I'll keep it as lean and focused as "Death Sentence" was. I got to view some fine film-making, expertly acted and directed. Bacon has always been an actor whose dives head-first into difficult roles, and this one covers a wide range of emotions...from family concern and love to grief to rage to fear to finally cold machine-like calm. I was particularly impressed with James Wan, who really raised his game to A-list level, easily creating moments of drama, action and suspense. His skill gave the film moments of real entertainment, because the plot was not...it's bleak and brutal, and hardly ever lets up...but like Rob Zombie's "The Devil's Rejects" or William Friedkin's "Bug", the film will stay with me for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I write this, Death Sentence has been rated a 7.1 by the IMDb community.I can only assume that these people have never seen the far superior (and original, in its time) Death Wish series, or even The Brave One for that matter.C'mon, people!Every single beat of the script is as predictable as it is stupid, with plot holes that make you want to gnaw the arms off the theater seats.After getting the "Death Sentence," Bacon stays with his family in his house wielding only a baseball bat? Ever heard of a well-timed vacation in, say, Argentina? Or even the neighbor's house?The cops, knowing how vile and dangerous the bad guy is, send only two inattentive, donut- eaters for protection?Bacon can't load a gun but turns into Jason Bourne when he goes to get revenge?John Goodman lets Bacon go to kill Goodman's son, yet goes there to warn him anyway (and gets shot for it)?And when the plot holes aren't grinding on you, there's always another inane, cliché line waiting to smack you in the face:"If you started a war with Billy Darby, god help you.""Which one of these guns you want?" "I'll take 'em all."Unfortunately, it's not quite bad enough to be campy in a William Shatner sort of way. It just leaves you embarrassed for Kevin and Kelly.Luckily for them, I expect everybody will forget about this one fairly quickly. Like two steps out the theater door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much of Death Sentence as I didn't like Saw, filmed by the same director James Wan. However, I've witnessed a total control over film making through this "old fashion" yet original "revenge" movie. Original because James Wan managed to find a way to film this story in a very accurate and sensitive way. Take the scene of the pursuit around 45 minutes of the film : the work of the camera, on sounds and the very ideas of the pursuit (when Kevin Bacon starts to jump over every cars to trigger the alarms) was both realistic and yet somehow out of time and space, and so it conveys the very idea of a pursuit : real and unreal because unusual. An this is exactly what's this story is about : a normal man in a surrealistic situation. Why not 10 ? I did not like the photography, so main stream (like Saw... and many productions from Australia !). However,a great great direction for a great great movie. Grats !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hell Of A Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Wan has yet again made another successful film, only this time he focus's on an action perspective rather than a horror selection. The story centers on the life of Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a respectable father and husband whose life gets turned around when a vicious gang brutally murders his son. Now he is on the rampage and decides to take justice into his own hands, no matter what the circumstances hold before him.I really enjoyed the first "Saw" very much and thought it was incredibly well-made. However I thought the idea of James Wan making an action thriller was questionable. I was proved wrong after I saw this film. Kevin Bacon gives another grueling performance with some new raw material under his belt. The action is this film was very surprising and extremely entertaining to watch minute after minute. It was also entertaining to see John Goodman play a disgruntled arms dealer with a bad attitude. That was fun to watch. Overall this film delivers what the title promises: A Death Sentence. Trust me when I say this; this movie is one hell of a ride! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't agree with the critics on this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually agree with the mainstream critics about movies, for the most part. However, this movie, like the 1st Saw film, is a major exception. If you are looking for a best picture candidate, you will not find it here. However, it is a very entertaining, engrossing movie that will probably not appeal to the squeamish. The movie fits right into the Parent Revenge mold quite well. The oldest son is killed by gang. Dad avenges death. Gang fights back. Dad goes crazy and kills gang members, before the whole thing culminates in a final shootout full of graphic carnage. If you are looking for an insane action movie, this isn't quite it. In particular, the first half is very deliberate in trying to convey Bacon as a real guy, trying to avoid violence, but ultimately succumbing to it. I found this journey that he takes to be quite believe, up until a scene near the end in a hospital in which he turns into Rambo. Rather than being moving, it is slightly laughable. Then the movie turns into a straightforward, albeit very well shot, action flick full of gore and carnage. Many critics bashed the film for it's hypocrisy in having the movie condemn violence while later depicting it in stylish, perversely entertaining detail. However, I think this was justified by a gang leaders quote at near the end of the film. "Look at you," he says to Bacon. "You've turned into one of us." The man is right. The gang leaders have slit throats and shot heads. But so has Bacon. He is a lesser of two evils to be sure, but an evil none the less. While this may be a cheap attempt by the director the make the film more serious, it does work. It is true that Bacon has transformed into a kind of monster. I give great credit to Bacon's performance, along with almost ever other actor. If a dark, violent, disturbing movie is what you are in the mood for this weekend, skip Halloween, and go see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you are looking for a movie which has plenty of violence mixed with a bit of gore then look no further. i'm told the novel on which this movie is based is the sequel to the classic revenge thriller death wish released in the 70's &amp; starring Charles Bronson. if like me, you enjoyed that movie then you will love this. kevin bacon stars &amp; is outstanding as always &amp; is always better when he is playing a psycho!!. the rest of the cast support very well with john goodman doing an unfamiliar turn as the bad guys' dad &amp; very good he is too! also garret hedlund who plays billy is very powerful as the movies main nutcase. all of the other bad guys could have been taken from real gangs as they are so nasty. anyway this is a good Friday night film to see with your girl or your mates and the soundtrack is haunting especially the song at the end scene. the subject matter is quite harrowing but it is very satisfying watching a mild mannered man transform into the vigilante we would all like to become after the events put before him in this movie. all in all a top film directed by one of Hollywood's most promising new directors James wan who is not afraid to push the gore &amp; explicit violence to the limit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. I was fooled into watching because I think Kevin Bacon is excellent, and the high scores on this site. So I felt compelled to help lower the average score, and warn as many people away as I can.I like revenge movies. I liked concept of a man who's family is killed, who turns into a super-vigilante. I am willing to suspend a great deal of disbelief to enjoy this kind of escapist fantasy.This movie, however, was nearly unwatchable for me. Suspending disbelief is one thing, but this movie pushed way too far.First of all, as others have mentioned, the police/da are laughable. They are so completely ineffectual, and unwilling even to try to stop the criminals that it defied all of my efforts to swallow the plot. I mean, if this were, say ... Gotham city, I might have been OK with it, because the city depicted in that movie is not _meant_ to be realistic. Rampant crime and corruption are expected, which is why they need to use the bat signal every so often to call in a superhero.Death Sentence is placed more as a "drama" than "superhero fantasy," and that's why the same sort of attitude that "the police department is _powerless_ to stop the violent gang members" is, well, ridiculous. Especially considering that there's only like 10 criminals involved in the entire operation. And as far as I can tell, it doesn't go any higher than, some greasy small arms dealer, who works out of a garage. The cops can't deal with small time crooks and thugs?Here there is a gas station robbery, and a gang-initiation homicide, with the suspect, who is id'ed by a witness, and is then hit by a car outside the gas station immediately afterward. The DA can't win this case? It's a Tee ball case, he should be hitting it out of the park. "The defense will ask you questions like, when was your last eye exam, or what do you have against inner city youth." Really? These are concerning questions, that might sway a jury? Again, laughable.And the idea that 2 police officers are murdered, and the PD hasn't organized their own hunting party for the criminals is just plain stupid. 2 police officers murdered, and the best that the police can do is to 1. station a guard outside bacon's room to stop HIM from doing anything? and 2. blame him for the death of his family. Huh.The problem, as I see it, is this. The "police" in this movie weren't meant to be, you know, policemen. They were written as a foil to the protagonist, an additional hurdle that he had to overcome. It felt like this was based on a bad comic book.It felt like the screenplay was written by a 13 year old, with no exposure (even on TV?) to the actual, real world. Sure in this world, there is corruption, there is incompetence. But it's not this open, not this blatant, and not this systematic ... at least in a major US city, when the murder victim is the son of a senior VP of an insurance company. And especially not if the criminals are just a bunch of drug using, gas station robbing thugs.Maybe if it was set in the wild west, or some place that is normally perceived as lawless (like a central American country, as in Man on Fire), or Gotham City, it would be more acceptable. But this movie was trash ... immature and unrealistic to the point of being difficult to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just like two movies tied together loosely. In the first movie (up until the break, which I suppose differs from theatre to theatre), a very intense drama is played. You buy pop corn while pitying for the family and thinking deeply into the world of crime and backstreet gangs and coincidences in life... And then the second parts come, starring Kevin Bacon as Rambo VII. In my opinion, there may be two reasons the interesting screenplay suddenly turns into a B-type action. Either the budget controller left the job before finishing the project and the team didn't allocate enough money to shoot the second half, so they found the cheapest possible way to end it, or the scenario writers had some kind of fever and they had to hire the writers from the adjacent studio, which was then shooting a commando-hero movie at that time... There are many bad things about second part. A scene where Kevin Bacon walks under heavy rain with decisive look, just to give the audience the feeling that he will be killing whoever he stumbles upon in the first place! And then there is the third-tier quality detective who walks as if she is on a catwalk and who talks out of the reality. A lifetime insurance expert suddenly turns into a killing machine overnight, with some instruction manuals he bought along with the rifle and the handguns. .. What can I say? If you want to start with a drama/thriller and see how it badly ties to a one-man-kills-all action movie, please see Death Sentence. If you don't, then go see another movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there have been some great films that have used violence to make a point and maintained excellence(pulp fiction,silence of the lambs and scarface,for example)..this movie has set the bar so low,you wonder why bacon and Goodman would bother..you expect gigantic plot holes and head-smacking unbelievabilty from Friday the 13th part 29 or Godzilla meets x-men,but i was not expecting it here.. a wealthy businessman's son is murdered,but the d.a. and the cops treat it like just another case..2 cops are murdered,and the police Don't tear the city apart to catch the obvious suspects..bacon's house is not cordoned off and protected as a crime scene after his family is shot..the murderous gang is neither arrested nor put under surveillance after bacon's family is threatened..despite no prior military or police background,bacon becomes adept at use of weapons and hand to hand fighting just because he's angry..he neither sends his family into hiding nor uses his financial resources to hire armed bodyguards,even though he knows the seriousness of the threat..the gang doesn't hear the gunfire on the garage roof and on and on and on..it wouldn't have taken much for the writer and director to tighten it up,but they just didn't care...so,why should we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit me hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect at all, but by the time it was over, I found myself relating to a character (Kevin Bacon) more than any other since Braveheart. I could feel the anger, the loss. Even though my mind understands the idea that vengeance is futile (which is well depicted in a closing scene), I could not say that I would not do the same thing my self. Trying to relate to that family was what really drew me in. Beautiful camera work, lighting, production design. I sat in the theater alone for 15 minutes, going through a myriad of emotions. When a movie can touch you like that, then its worth it's weight in gold. Congrats to the whole team on this one. The Baldwin's, Woo, Kevin Bacon, everyone involved. They should be proud of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is truly a terrible movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for starters I'm going to tell you what happens. Loving family lalalalala Bacon is a great father, he brings his boy home from a hockey game, makes a pit stop, bunch of psychos kill him at the gas station as an initiation for a new gang member. The rest run away while Bacon grabs the killer then the guy gets loose, yells in the middle of the street at his buddies for abandoning him and gets hit by a car from behind. The rest is very self explanatory, Bacon kills him and a war is started between Bacon and the rest of the psychos. Now, there is so much wrong with this movie it's insulting to mankind. Star Wars and The Matrix are more realistic than this movie is. First off, Bacon has a cell phone, so instead of calling the cops, ambulance etc he decides to hold his son whose jugular just so happens to be pouring out blood and scream at the top of his lungs "HELP" several times. It's this scene that begins the very annoying and repetitive little sob story tune that starts playing literally every 10-15 minutes of the movie. I know this because I actually timed it. Thats how often it is. During the time that the song plays there is a lot of slow -mo and dumb little scenes that are supposed to make you cry but just don't. The problem is you can't tell if this is an action movie or drama. I started watching hoping to watch a cool simple gory action movie. Instead I got an hour and 45 minutes of contaminating cheese. To say that this movie is cliché would be an insultingly gross understatement. This movie is so full of stereotypes and cheesy lines that I truly wanted to vomit at many points. I honestly think that soap operas are more dramatic and realistic. The acting, to put it simply, is unfair. I don't think that people deserve such treatment. If you paid to watch this movie, I weep for you. Each character is so unbalanced it is shocking that the movie actually stayed together. There's a terrible mix of overacting and underacting. Most of the overacting is done by Preston, who obviously enjoys acting like a deranged schizophrenic in one scene and a calm cheesy housewife in another.Next is how unrealistic the physical and real life aspects of the movie are, since the "emotional" ones are made of cheese. In the beginning of the movie, the killer is hit by a car from the back, flies over and falls on his back. However, for some reason, he seemingly escapes with only a few cuts and bruises and ironically has no damage to his legs or butt even though thats where he was hit. Next, if you called the cops and the perp was with you, they wouldn't have you point him out in a lineup. In the "car fight" where they actually fight inside the car, Bacon at one point hits the guy in the face with a metal rod of some sort then sticks his head between the door and slams it a few times. Some how, the bad guy apparently has bones of steel (like wolverine from xmen lol) and has no pain in his neck and easily jumps up and continues fighting. In the same scene, the car they are in is not theirs' yet Bacon was able to get it in reverse mode without ever having put in any keys or even sparking some wires. For those of you who don't know how to use cars, the handle that changes the driving mode only works if your foot is on the brake and the car is on; but anything is possible if you're Kevin Bacon. In the end, Bacon speeds up and crashes into the bad guy's van and somehow is able to break it in half all the while not getting hurt at all nor denting or even breaking the cars' headlights. How realistic. Having John Goodman in the movie was the dumbest thing possible. He really serves no purpose. He just takes up lines and space (no pun intended). The worst aspect of this movie, which I hope others have noticed, is that they completely steal the last scenes of the movie from Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver" with Robert de Niro. Here is a list of things they stole from that movie.1) Bacon shaves his head, like de Niro did 2) He buys a magnum handgun, like de Niro 3) There was red light in the last firefight of both movies 4) In the last firefight, Bacon shoots off the bad guy's fingers, gets shot in the neck, and shoots the guy behind him; all of which happens in Taxi Driver. Bottom line, this movie is failure. Don't waste 100 minutes of your life watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As revenge thrillers go, this has got balls!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing new and exciting here for what is fast becoming a tired old genre, but boasting the considerable talents of Kevin Bacon in the lead role, Death Sentence is way above average and never outstays its welcome. Nick Hume &amp; his son Brendan stop at a gas station one night and a violent turn of events transforms Nick into a maelstrom of fury...Asking the question of just what lengths we would go to to look after our families, Death Sentence is merely following on from the likes of Death Wish and Eye For An Eye. But here the violence is upped to such a gruesome standard, it creates maximum impact. Yet it's not the violence that leaves the lasting impression, it's the descent of the main protagonist that terrifies the most. A humble and decent man spiralling out of control, done down by the system, he finds darkness within him that he surely didn't know he had.Some sequences here are excellent and well staged by director James Wan, and he shows considerable skill with his fluid camera. But these things tend to get over looked in a film of this type. Elsewhere, although we are asked to swallow the impossible for one too many occasions, and the cops are stupid beyond belief, the film does find a couple of narrative tricks to also keep it out of formulaic tedium. Kevin Bacon deserves better than this for sure, but he's great in the dual role and as revenge thrillers go, in case I haven't violently rammed home the point yet, this really hits the mark. Kind of like a kick in the privates really. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The family man and senior vice-president of the insurance company Starship Capital Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) lives a comfortable life with his wife Helen (Kelly Preston) and his sons Brendan (Stuart Lafferty) and Lucas (Jordan Garrett). While driving back home with his son Brendan after a game of hockey, Nick stops his car in a gas station in a dangerous neighborhood and he witnesses his son being murdered by the punk Joe Darley (Matt O'Leary) in the convenience store. When the prosecutor tells the grieving Nick that Joe would get a maximum of three years in prison, Nick tells the judge in court that he has not recognized Joe as the killer of his son. In the night, Nick goes to Joe's place and stabs him to death. When Joe's brother Billy (Garrett Hedlund) is informed about the death of Joe, he summons his gang in a war against Nick with tragic consequences.Revenge is a theme that produces good movies, and "Death Sentence" is no exception, with a strong dramatic appeal of the price of admission of a youngster in a gang of criminals. The plot is engaging and the reaction of Nick that has a breakdown is absolutely acceptable due to the flawed justice system, without laws to convict a criminal that destroys a family. In my country, for example, there is neither death nor life sentences even for hideous crimes and a criminal can be sentenced to a maximum of thirty years imprisoned. The war between Nick and Billy's gang in the last twenty minutes is exaggerated, but gives a good conclusion to the story, but never balances the equation. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sentença de Morte" ("Death Sentence")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not even gonna waste much time writing a comment, but I will tell you that this movie was a waste of time in every regard. Even for people who enjoy gore movies Death Sentence fails terribly. I just bought this P.O.S DVD for 15 Bucks, and i swear to god if i happen to see Kevin Bacon on the street I will beat that money out of him....so please don't watch the movie, just rate it "1"......this is his girlfriend speaking: when i started laughing after, lets say, 10 Min's of the movie i was silenced by a very grim looking face. but that changed rapidly. usually i'm no fan of gore, but now i would need some, as i am pretty aggressive after seeing this B.S. some things i need to say: this guy, Hume, is a loser. such a loser, i want to beat him up myself (and i'm sure although i'm only 5'2'' I wouldn't have any trouble with it). he still looked terrified when killing the 4th bastard gang member. what is wrong with him? and he seriously had to read the manual before using the guns he bought. also, what was wrong with the police officer "you know what"? not only that she doesn't care when the killer of a innocent boy gets free, no, she also gets extremely aggressive towards the father of the son,because he dares to think of revenge. then, how come that Kevin bacon manages to fall over each and every possible obstacle he can find when being chased by the gang in the parking house and STILL they are not catching up. not even the black dude. god, i could go on for ages. but most annoying is the rating of this movie. were you guys all drunk? or just really really easy to satisfy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gee! What Could Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be the exception to the flow of "thumbs up" fans of this K. Bacon movie. This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes. First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation. Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes "Jason Bourne." Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and "they" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away. Where are the back-up? Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair. This is only a smidgen of several "beyond belief" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me. Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways. What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film. Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Sentence for giving up 2 hours of your life for this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even know where to begin. Whether I start with the clowns who rated this movie so well or the slop that I just forced myself to sit through. I have to be honest, one of the reasons I even rented this movie was because of the mass amount of people on here telling me to ignore the bad reviews and focus on what great movie it is. I've decided to address the problems I had with the movie as follows: 1. Poor Acting? The acting was so pathetic I cringed in embarrassment through 90% of the scenes. Kevin Bacon had very mediocre moments as an actor. He did a lot of really obvious acting that an amateur could learn fairly quickly. I'm not really gonna nit pick Bacon's acting because there is so much worse with this film. Such as... John Goodman playing a crime boss, but doing this weird accent and overacting and throwing his lines away because it was obvious he hadn't made any real choices as an actor. You have a group of gang members who looked like the backstreet boys with stupid obviously fake tattoos covering their body and shouting out cheesy lines in attempts to look angry, but failing miserably. I don't think there was but one honest moment in this entire movie and that was when the 12 year old kid cries after his brother dies. Beyond this, the acting looked like some sort of bad acting experiment.2.Plot? So the Plot is that this guy has his son murdered and the justice system will probably only keep his son's murderer in jai for a few years before being released. So Bacon decides to lie in court, allowing his son's murderer to go free, and kill the murderer after he's released. Okay so the idea isn't that bad in theory. It's one of the reasons I watched the movie. However, Bacon's choice to go after this guy is made within 2 seconds. There's no build up, sadness, anything. He just decides he's going to kill him. The rest of the movie is Bacon running around getting into lame fights with pathetic gang members who don't even look or act tough; or letting this black cop lady put on one of the worst acting jobs ever and covering up Bacon's murders for absolutely no reason. The movie never gives a reason either, it's the movie's way of covering up how unrealistic it is that Kevin Bacon is murdering people and no one seems to care except the gang members who are running after him with pistols in hand totally ignored by any form of police. Furthermore, the movie opens up all kinds of mini plots and never resolves any of them. There is so much filler in this movie, probably because they didn't have a story. Some of the unresolved filler included: Kevin Bacon's career which they build up to such a point with people continually asking if he's okay, Kevin Bacon's new found love for his emotionally ignored 2nd child, The secret agenda of the black cop who was covering up murders for Bacon, et cetra. It's kind or sad because I actually enjoyed the first ten minutes of the movie. To make the idea worse, there is no redeeming qualities in this movie. The movie doesn't award the good guys or the bad guys. We end up hating Bacon, for being such a vindictive punk (literally abandoning his son in the end to go on a suicide mission against the Backstreetboy gang and either resulting in Bacon's death or life incarceration, ambiguously left at the end).3. It's sad that this movie was given positive reviews by anybody. It shows you how out of touch people are when they watch a movie that (1) has no truthful moments, (2) is horribly acted, (3) is plot less, (4)Is totally unrealistic, (5) is sad for no reason other than to be sad- trust me the director didn't make any point with this movie. It was just blatant, poorly done violence, (6) there are no redeeming qualities of this movie....and YET, people find a way to praise it. Bottom line is that people spend too much time on the internet and they have no concept about truth. If you're the typical human now a days go watch the movie, you'll love it. If you have any intelligence or sense or truth and reality this movie isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film as punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I know of. It came up on TV last night and me and my girlfriend sat through in dumbfounded amazement. We actually put off the Kusturica we were going to see, so trasfixed and entertained were we. The count of inept filmmaking: - drab, ugly aesthetic in the name of 'stark realism', yet applied to - the most cartoonish fictional universe since the Death Wish sequels. Laughable cutouts of 'street punks' make up the disposable fodder of utter, contemptuous evil. They strike poses of meanness, and exclusively populate seedy areas lit like a set-piece from a glossy horror movie.- crushingly cheap symbolism. The setting for the final, furious vengeance is across 'Stygian street'. Crosses abound, in all the wrong places. A protagonist who, as usual in these revenge films, becomes what he despised - we see him drive the muscle car, the new haircut that makes him look like one of them. In the penultimate scene, his opponent actually tells him 'you're one of us'! How condescending to any audience that paid even the smallest attention. - now and then, a snappy montage or song in the soundtrack will obviously punctuate the emotional momentum. Further retreat from the flimsy facsimile of 'realism' into the shallowness of music video.Null and void stuff, purporting some important insight into the human condition. Watch, instead, Dead Man's Shoes with Paddy Considine if you're in the mood for this kind of thing; it's not great but at least it's by the hand of an actual filmmaker.</fullReview>

Right from the start your heart will sink. This kind of movie might have passed in the 80s but now it's just comical. I mean you see your son getting violently attacked and you decide to mess with the fleeing assailant before tending to your dying son.......and from there onwards there's not one plot development that's credible or character that you wouldn't mind seeing getting killed of at any stage. This movie has crammed so many played-out over-used clichés in terms of script, dialogue, "acting" and storyline that you'll want to post your own review on here just to bring the ridiculously high rating average down where it deserves to be.If you want to see a decent revenge flick.......Watch - The brave one with Jodie Foster.

		<fullReview>Death Sentence is a truly awful picture. I decided to watch it because I had never met a revenge thriller I didn't like -- until Death Sentence came along. The film has literary pretensions, which because of its clunky writing and sheer preposterousness it could not deliver. I wanted to like it, I really did, but there's nothing there to like. Trust me on this.Despite the presence of the talented Kevin Bacon, who did about all he could with what he was given, the movie is a bore. Even the many bloody action sequences are tedious because of their silliness. If nothing else, Death Sentence disabused me of the notion that I would find something to like in any revenge thriller.

		<fullReview>Once some movie director/mogul finds a successful movie, it seems as if every studio piles on to copy the plot. Revenge movies, of course, appeal to the moron class of movie watchers. In fact, is there a larger genre than "revenge"? Kevin Bacon over-acts this one, not because he is a poor actor, but because the director wanted him to emote. The entire premise is absurd. Son gets killed by a crew of about six creeps who are apparently trying to rob a ghetto gas station/junk food store. If we were looking to score big-time, would we pick such a place? All the Doritos you can carry! Naturally, the bad guys had to have threatening facial tattoos and talk viciously to the point of slavering. DO NOT pay to watch this trash piece. You can watch it for "free" on a couple sites on the net. It was so tiresome and predictable that I turned it off before Bacon did the Bronson thing on all the scumbags. Boring and insipid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie not realizing that unfortunately I have seen it before. However, I still watched on.From the start this movie just insulted my intelligence. Starts off with a happy family bonding, etc. Then horror hits them and their eldest son is killed in an "initiation". After that its your usual vengeance movie. A normal everyday father manages to take revenge and kill 6 or so gang members with a certain amount of ease it must be said. All the while the cops just sit idly by and let it all happen and all he gets is a slap on the wrist.It was painful to watch Detective Wallis and the solicitor talk to the Nick Hume with no remorse literally a few hours after his whole family have been executed. To me, this makes the film seem really fake and poorly written.Finally the scene where Nick is crying in the shower and his wife comes to comfort him. I can't understand why the background music used for that is also used a few scenes later for when the gang are walking down the street. Honestly confused me to why that was done.Awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visceral revenge thriller...that doesn't live in reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2007's Death Sentence is an interesting movie, in premise. You have a guy, Nick Humes, who is living the American Dream. He has a high paying, just job, a loving, hot wife, and two sons. Then, after a night out with he eldest son, things start to get taken way from him in horrific, somewhat overdone, fashion. This, of course, leads to a change in the main character and we see him become what he so very much despises. I like the premise and it can be found in a lot of stories from the Punisher, to the Count of Monte Cristo, to Batman. However, while I like the idea of a just man becoming dehumanized by an act of violence and his subsequent search for vengeance, this movie flounders. It's flaps around like a fish out of water, because it just makes no sense.For the first thirty minutes, the movie is indeed gripping. We see Nick's eldest son get his throat cut by gang members. We see the effect that this has on the Hume family. So far, the movie has promise. Then it all starts to come unglued when Nick refuses to positively I.D. the scumbag, as he disagrees with the sentencing. The moment that gang member is fatally stabbed by Humes, this movie unravels...and not in a good way.The thing that sinks this ship is the high body count and how it is handled. Hume kills the person who murdered his son. He should have been the prime suspect, but the police, as represented by Aisha Tyler's character, do nothing. She doesn't ask him one single question, not even when she sees he has a rather large incisive wound on his hand. Detectives ask questions about things like fresh, still bleeding injuries. Then there is the shootout the following day.In a bustling metropolitan area, in broad daylight, in plain view of hundreds of people, the gang who killed Humes son go after him...gun's blazing. Where were the cops? Why couldn't they shoot Hume when he was running down an alleyway? But, really, where were the cops? They didn't show up until after an almost ten minute chase, which culminated in a car falling from a parking structure, ran it's course. Then there'e the next day.One of the gang members shows up at Hume's place of work to tell him that his family was basically going to die. Security got their hands on the guy and asked what Hume's wanted them to do. Instead of having them hold the dude until the police could pick him up, the idiot has security let him go. Thankfully, he has the foresight to call Aisha Tyler's character, whose character was written horribly, to have a squad car placed on front of his house. He could have told his wife and surviving son to get the hell out of dodge and visit relatives out of state, but he didn't. This leads to the mother load of all gripes.Hume's wife was killed and his surviving son was put in a coma by this nigh invincible gang. Before this happened, the two police officers guarding the house were slain. Where I come from, if two cops are killed, one of them having a slit throat, while on duty, that unleashes Hell. From this point on the movie should have been over, because the blue wall would have found that gang and extracted several pounds of flesh before calling in that they resisted arrest and putting them down. Alas, that didn't happen and the police seemed to care as little about their own as they apparently did the Humes. But, the absurdity doesn't end here.After a stay in the hospital, while under police guard, where Nick has a heart to heart with his son, who was still comatose, he escapes by simply climbing out the window--never mind the fact that he's still wearing that open back hospital gown. Somehow, he makes it home without shoes or clothing, despite his injuries. What really sells how poorly this is written though is that there wasn't a squad car waiting there for him. I mean, where else was he going to go? The police basically sat back and let this all play out. This kind of hacked me off, because it immediately reduced this movie to something like a dark episode of MacGuyver or the A-Team. The resulting shootout, in an abandoned sanitarium, was predictably paced and gruesome. The ending to the movie was flat out stupid. And, somewhere in all of this is John Goodman.Death Sentence isn't worth the 106 minutes of your life that it will take to watch it. It's almost like the creative team set out to script a movie full of characters that make the absolute most dumbass decisions they ever could. Because of this, the film should be extremely aggravating to anyone with a brain. Even if you don't have a brain and eat paste in your spare time, watch the Brave One instead. At least that film took place on planet Earth and not the Bizarro World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To James Wan, Director "Death Sentence" project.From, Jay Johnson, VP of development, 20th century Fox Dear James, Hey, like your take on the Death Sentence Script, I enjoyed the book and I think it will make a fine film, just a few little notes.The first act is great.However... could the gang members NOT fire their guns in broad daylight. The brilliant chase scene could still be the same, including briefcase bashing and car alarms.When the cops get their throats slit in the car... the gang goes inside and maybe Kevin Bacon and his wife and kid AREN'T THERE... interesting, huh? They just made it out.The gang could burn their house down. This is good cinema.Killing the wife is ridiculous, because in an execution style killing, as you have staged in the script, the gang would have finished the job... without a doubt. Having KB and the son survive but the wife not, isn't plausible.The hero buying guns, fine.Hero reads gun manuals. fine.The cops know it's the gang after KB... yet they do nothing? Have the cops round up the gang members, but then they can't book them, they let them go after 24 hours (this is the law) Really hitting home how the system is screwed up. This would also give our hero and family time to hide.Gang leader killing his dad has got to go, it's just stupid.But when our hero goes to kill them all, how about... He's NOT brilliant with the guns, sort of klutzy, you know, real. You get into that Die Hard thing where he's falling down, getting hurt, the shotgun recoil kicks him onto his ***. This would make the character more endearing to the audience and we are all rooting for him, get it? These changes won't effect the budget or schedule much (except for the house burning, I'll pull some strings, I think it's good stuff, you know, the guy is nothing now, they are basically refugees.) I think these changes bring it back to the real world and out of the video game reality.Have a good shoot! Jj P.S.

		<shortDescription>ah so close, this was ALMOST interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was almost an interesting movie, it had my attention for a good majority of the time until it eventually lost momentum and headed into the home stretch with no goal or purpose.Strangely, it's AFTER his family is killed that this movie became boring. How is that? Up until then it was somewhat interesting, borderline exciting, because of the tension of not knowing what the enemies would do next and how Kevin Bacon would protect his family. In general, anytime someone is being stalked in a movie it's always fun for me to watch.Up until this point of the movie, everything had been relatively not horrible. But once his family was executed (which I loved by the way, I loved seeing that overacting, annoying wife get shot), and Kevin Bacon goes into 'revenge mode,' it becomes a predictable, stupid, mindless, video game gunfight, with choreographed scene after scene. It was just anticlimactic and it didn't mean anything. And it didn't help that we never really cared about the characters either.Moronic things in this movie: **When the one son is temporarily missing, and Kevin Bacon goes and finds him at the gas station where his other son was killed. Why did they use the biggest cliché in movie history by having that son say "would it have been better if *I had been the one that died?" Um, how about no. Who ever implied that?? And then he says something about how Kevin Bacon always preferred the other golden boy over him. Where was it EVER implied ANYWHERE in this entire movie that this kind of underlying jealousy/tension was ever being harbored? What a cheap way to try to add depth to a character. Fail.**The scene where Kevin Bacon wakes up in the hospital after being shot, with the detective lady there. Why is she sitting there preaching to this bed-ridden, critically injured person? Bitching and warning him about "what he's gotten himself into." No idiot, THAT was the conversation that should've taken place back at his home when she initially visited him after his call (and it did). All of THIS is the result of preventive action taken that they both agreed to. In other words, in this isolated incident, which led to Kevin Bacon being hospitalized and his family shot, he did nothing wrong. All of this occurred as a result of the bad guys unrealistically murdering the cops outside and coming into his home. What exactly is she so mad about? What exactly was he to do? Did he deviate in any way from the plan? How can he help it if his house is broken into? She's sitting there bitching to him as if he had gone insane and did something completely irrational, when in fact all he did was get shot.**A few scenes after that, the part where Kevin Bacon is in the hospital room with his dying son, and he asks the detective lady for a few moments of privacy. WHY THE HELL did she shake her head and roll her eyes, as if to say "you've gotta be kidding me," then leave in disgust?**Too many slow motion montages with loud, overbearing, pretentious music.**I hate that moment in movies where "the hero is preparing for war," and you have these montage shots of the hero that inevitably shows him buying/preparing his weapons, and strapping up (well I hate it in this movie). These shots are usually accompanied by a surprised merchant, surprised at the audacity of the hero to actually be buying all this stuff. At this point the merchant will usually question the hero about his choice of arms, to which the hero will reply back in a very cool way about how he's going to need all this stuff for what he's about to embark on.**Why does every hero in a revenge scenario have to be so COOL and CALCULATING. With these sarcastic one-liners, monotone expression of a scowling face, if monotone could be used to describe something visually. Shouldn't they be a tad bit nervous? Or full of adrenaline? Shouldn't you portray this white-collar businessman who's about to launch into a full fledged murderous rampage as being slightly uneasy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap Exploitative Unrealistic Trash, Death Wish much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so riddled with clichés and worn out memes, as well as plain unrealistic nonsense that it is hard to keep up Of course, there are clear links between this and the classic 1974 Death Wish, But that was a masterpiece compared to this disposal flick. It had an element of realism too, where Joe Average gets a gun and turns the tables on unsuspecting street criminals in NYC and wins the public's admiration for his vigilantism in making the streets safe again. It had a good 70s everyman appeal since the protagonist didn't do anything physical that an ordinary office worker couldn't do. While this scheisskino had the protagonist doing Neo of the Matrix level stunts This starts off with some nonsense about the perfect yuppie over achiever and his family of hockey playing sons, fine wife, nice house etc etc Then the urban myth about how if you flash some car at night because they don't have their headlights on, that is some gang who will then go and try to kill you. They catch one of the killers of his jock robot son, but the DA only wants to give him a few years. So Rambo deliberately flubs his court testimony in order to get the killer off for later revenge. Then followed one utterly ridiculous absurd cliché action scene after another; where Mr Mild Mannered VP goes medieval on these bulked up thugs, w/o taking the slightest precautions. One example was his first revenge killing where he parked his car in front of his intended victim's house and wore his business suit. That made it easy for the gang to figure out who the killer was.One mindless foot chase scene on a busy city street where the gang is shooting wildly at him all over the place, yet no cops show up. He manages to get one on the roof of the parking garage, After flubbing numerous chances to do in the killer in stupid slasher movie style where he doesn't take the chance to finish his assailant off but gives the killer one chance after another to go after him again. Finally he puts the car in reverse while they are fighting in the front seat, you saw this coming, and as the car is going off the roof he manages to bail out just in time through the smashed out windshield. Nothing that absurd happened in Death Wish, at least the first couple ones until it became a cartoon Rambo series. This one was so over the top, then it tries to make up for it with this revenge will make you just as bad meme it through in at the end to make crap seem profound. In the end, it is just another stupid Kevin Bacon movie, on par with his TV show, "The Following"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this movie expecting a mindless, bloody, action flick. Although there was definitely lots of blood, I was surprised to find out that the movie had lots of heart and a decent message to go along with it's brutal action scenes. It's sort of like a Steven Segal revenge movie...only it's actually really good. Kevin Bacon was excellent and James Wan's direction was very good. The action scenes were well choreographed and included some angles i had never seen before. WARNING: This movie does contain lots of extremely graphic and gory violence and it shouldn't be viewed by anyone who doesn't have a hard stomach. Overall, and very good move. 9/10/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately missed this movie when it was released and now I have just finally viewed it. So where do I begin with why I liked it? Well, I'll get the easy stuff out of the way first. The violence was very well done! There! Now moving on.The casting: Kevin Bacon never disappoints me. From Friday the 13th to Hollow Man, he is always the man. I believed his transformation from a happy go lucky family man with a great paying job to a man bent on revenge. John Goodman had IMO his best role since The Big Lebowski. It's amazing to see the man from Roseanne and who played the live action version of Fred Flintstone in this kind of role and pull it off well. The lead bad guy was very creepy and definitely not the type of guy I would mess with. (oh and speaking of not messing with, this movie proves why I never flash anyone with their headlights off, never my problem so why make it?)The directing: Another man who never disappoints me is James Wan. The man created the best psychological thriller of my generation with Saw and presented a nice creepy flick with Dead Silence, and now presents a balls to the wall revenge film. The camera angles and the set pieces had my attention the whole time and nice little nods to his previous films as well. Wan, what the heck is your next film, man? I wanna see it now! :DThe music: Charlie Clouser has always been one of my favorite movie composers and this movie proves why. My favorite I think was when Bacon climbed out of the hospital window and was walking in the rain in slow mo. Very effective. And did I hear a little bit of the Saw score during the final shoot out scene?Like any other Kevin Bacon film and James Wan film, Death Sentence delivered</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan (Saw) brings the ultra-violence to this gritty story of a suburban father (Kevin Bacon) who discovers the consequences of revenge after his son is murdered. The perpetrators of this senseless killing are a multi-ethnic (and highly visible) gang of drug dealers and cutthroats led by the psychotic Billy Darley (Garrett Hedlund); when the case is thrown out on a technicality, Bacon takes a page from Charles Bronson's book (no surprise, as this is based on author Brian Garfield's 1975 follow-up to Death Wish) and pursues a vigilante course to avenge his boy. Things do not go according to Bacon's plan, which cues a series of frantic and well-executed action set pieces, most notably a parking structure chase that unfolds in a nearly unbroken take. Death Sentence breaks no new ground in the action-thriller department, and its characters and dialog are nearly indistinguishable from any violent crime movie of the last few decades (in its weakest moments, it resembles grind house fare like The Exterminator); however, Bacon is excellent (as always) as the mild-mannered architect who discovers his inner killer the hard way, and Wan's knack for screen mayhem and unsettling atmosphere are well used here. The DVD includes both the theatrical version and an unrated cut (which offers 10 additional minutes), as well as two making-of features that originally aired on the Fox Movie Channel, and several websites that focus on director Wan, his cast, and the film's elaborate stunts and fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good revenge drama/thriller/action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 2008 on a DVD. I enjoyed it. The movie was very well made. Kevin Bacon gav an excellent performance as a father seeking revenge. The movie never slows down or gets boring. John Goodman also appears in a nice cameo role. Fans of Death Wish, The Brave One, Harry Brown, The Punisher, Law abiding citizen shud definitely check this out. I was most impressed by the camera work in the chase scenes. I was rooting for the lead character from the word go and Bacon did not let me down. Death sentence was a great thrill ride from the emotional opening credits to the chilling conclusion. At times it was brutal, gory n depressing. The music by Charlie Clouser (Saw series, The collection, Resident evil extinction) was very effective at establishing the proper mood. It has some hard hitting action, fantastic foot chase, some amazing gun fights n some unique death scenes. The soundtrack is very depressing and moody and helps set the tone of the film. Its directed by James Wan (Saw, Dead silence, Insidous, Conjuring, Fast n furious 7). Nice cinematography by John R. Leonetti (Conjuring, Insidious). It's based on the book (sequel to the original Deathwish) written by Brian Garfield, the author of Death wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>needs Death Wish from the start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Investment consultant Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) has the perfect life with wife Helen (Kelly Preston), and sons Lucas and Brendan. Brendan is killed during a gas station robbery and Nick identifies Joe Darley as the killer. The DA has only Nick's testimony and wants to do a deal. Nick decides to recant so Joe can walk away. Joe was being initiated into his older brother Billy (Garrett Hedlund)'s gang. Nick follows the gang back to their place and later kills Joe. Detective Wallis (Aisha Tyler) is investigating the cases. Bones Darley (John Goodman) is not happy with his son Billy's thuggish behavior.I would have more respect for this movie if it goes full Death Wish right from the start. Nick should do some research and start shooting this gang one by one. Instead, he's shocked that they come after him and his family when Joe gets killed. The action is almost comical at times. Neither Nick nor Billy are acting rationally. For a long time, Nick doesn't even have a gun and he doesn't move his family out of their house. Billy is also a really horrible shot or a cheapskate about saving bullets. Bones doesn't make much sense either although his philosophy is strangely compelling. It's also strange that Nick has to buy his guns illegally. There are generally a lot of logic questions in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death Sentence" features a really good piece of dialogue, which I'd seen written on a website (I'm at a loss for citation) before ever having heard of this movie. Anyhoo, it's John Goodman, selling black market guns to royally-wronged Kevin Bacon:"You've got the bastard of bastards. A .357, for guaranteed head removal. That's- that's a sweetie. You got your standard-size, super-size. That's a f-ckin' hungry man right there. And you got the king of mayhem. Half cannon, sword of justice. Take this f-cker to the Holy Land, start your own crusade. Any one of these is bound to make you feel better about what's bothering you."Seriously, imagine John Goodman saying those words. Hell, I'd buy guns from that guy!Sadly the movie itself is just a "Death Wish" clone with an identity crisis. Is Kevin Bacon a modern Charles Bronson, or Travis Bickle? The movie wants him to be both, and that confusion is why the revenge angle never bears fruit. Just when you think he's attained a clear head after all he's suffered , he flips the switch into utter badass (complete with unexplained fighting moves, honed marksmanship and a steely resolve. Okay, that's still not a deal-breaker. And with a movie like this, you need the police to be useless, so the hero/wronged has an excuse to go full-on vigilante. Totally fine. But where's the police when the big bad gang kills their own? Hollywood always teaches us that a cop-killer is as cardinal-sin as it gets. Anyway, Bacon goes mental and the bad guys start paying dearly, but there's never much fun to be had here. Aside from one stand-out foot chase, it's mostly bad camera-work and manic editing.Blech.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>revenge is a dish best served with Bacon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been told over time through industry professionals, sometimes in classes I've taken, quotes from movie stars and writers and directors and so on, that if you have a good script and a mediocre director you can still have a decent film, but if the script is terrible it doesn't matter how great the director is but the project won't be able to fly. I still am not sure if James Wan is a great director - he really has a mixed record for me now that I've seen most of his films (in brief, Saw sucks, Conjuring 1 &amp; 2 are terrific, and Furious 7 is... Furious 7! it has some extreme/dumb things and yet is brainless fun). But he does pull out a lot more directorially out of a script that is at times convincing and dramatic, and other times is hackneyed revenge/sometimes cop drama.There's one "virtuoso" scene as critics like to call it - which is euphemism for 'impressive' - where Kevin Bacon is being chased by the thugs, first on the street during day time (they don't give a f*** so much they open fire in broad daylight with a lot of people on the street), and then give chase through alleys, inside a kitchen, and leading out to a parking lot. Though at first it's cut fairly conventionally, the way Wan is shooting this is inspired (he used a 'rickshaw' type of device so the camera could lead in front of the actors at a faster speed, plus on golf carts), but when it gets into the parking lot Wan decides to go full Chanwook Park and do it in one shot. And it's done with extreme creativity (both extreme and creative) as Bacon and the other actors are running, actually running, and going through little patches of space to go one level to another until our (anti)hero gets to the top level where his car is at.That last aspect of how he happened to be where his car is exactly at is convenient story-wise (that it's the parking lot where he works at, he just happened to get back there while running in a frenzy), nevertheless Wan has a strong visual idea and executes it with his crew wonderfully. And throughout much (though not all) of Death Sentence, he is doing his best to make a (to say it generously) hit or miss screenplay fly as something harrowing and intense. The movie gives us a good look at a family - the dialog between this somewhat typical 'happy' family, brothers in-fight a bit, one son gets in trouble at school (where mom happens to be Dean) - and then the bad thing happens, where one of the sons is killed in a "gang initiation" thing that looks like a gas station robbery, and the killer is let go without much fanfare.The details of how this young thug is practically let go by the court for, uh, "reasons" is a little too tidy and convenient (the gas station happened to be the "only one in America" without surveillance), and maybe that's what I keep coming back to as a problem with the movie: convenience, things that the movie kind of lets go so the story can keep going forward. Other things like that is how the cop character (Detective Wallis, played by Aisha Tyler replacing a "50-ish white guy", which is cool!) doesn't do more when Nick Hume starts to take matters into his own hands, first going after the released killer in the middle of the night, and then when, later on (spoilers) two cops are killed while the main batch of criminals go through them to get into Nick's house in the middle of the night to settle scores. Like, I know you're angry at Nick for making this situation worse and worse by starting s*** with criminals, but now two cops are DEAD, you have more important things to worry about now! So there's logic inconsistencies. Why recommend it? For me, the gritty approach to the camera-work and the acting from the criminal characters (and John Goodman in a small but pivotal role!) connected and felt strong. I can criticize certain parts of the style, like the choice of music (sometimes it's alright, other times it feels like it was picked by an uninspired/lazy music supervisor with some of these songs), but Wan mostly got how to make this intense by going for 'real' and yet it's still a cinematic approach to the 'real', if that makes sense, like it has a logical approach to how characters move through rooms and buildings and work with guns.The other aspect is Bacon. He really, really brings it and if you like him generally this is him going full blown fiery/emotional force. But there's a progression to it - he is playing a 'normal' guy, fairly white collar, suburban middle class, and when Nick does this first violent act he's genuinely shocked, in tears, shaking. It's not something that looks and feels like a movie character that brushes things off, and his vulnerability brings us closer to his experience as he digs himself deeper into vigilante/revenge drama (even down to how he does a 'Taxi Driver' shaving-head bit, which is much messier and all the better for it). All the while, this actor brings it and finds the moments where nuance can play into it. He and Wan and a few other things elevate a hackneyed script, which is the exception to the general principle of 'script script script'. In this sake, I dug it. Usually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought Death Wish needed more clichés or stereotypes, then this film is for you. If you thought it needed more depth to the script, a more considered contemplation of the morality and effectiveness of Revenge, then you might be disappointed. There are some very good parts to this movie. The action scenes (some of them) are just excellent. But the intervening scenes never really suspend disbelief, or engage the viewer adequately. They are merely a vehicle to get you to the next set piece. These build, fugue-like, in violence as the movie progresses - which is a nice touch.It's a decent movie for a Friday night when you get home late from the pub. Pull open another beer, open up your kebab, and let the wave of undemanding cinematography wash over your drunken bones.</fullReview>

Never ever hesitate to watch it. Sometimes, it will touch your emotion.

If you hate stable movies and want a movie to thrill you, you can surely choose this. It will teach you that how often you try to get out of trouble it might find you in an unexpected situation and how important to be able to risk everything for our family.

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this, ignore the bad reviews from the Bronson fan-boys and watch it for yourself. This is one of the best revenge movies out there. Death Sentence makes a "Punisher" out of an average guy. This isn't Death Wish. This isn't some tough guy vigilante with incredible luck that mops the floor with the baddies. MINOR SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTThis is scrawny Kevin Bacon, a mediocre office worker that most Americans can relate to, who watches his son get brutally murdered, identifies the killer, and then is failed by the system. He then decides to stand up against a gang of punks to avenge his son, because nobody else will.He's alone in what he does and the viewer feels that, the helplessness, pain, and anger of a grieving father, whose firstborn son was taken from him, through Kevin Bacon's character. Kevin Bacon smashes it. The pace is wonderful. It jumps right in with the death of his son. We aren't bored while the writer sets up the big events. It's a really solid script and the directing is top notch. The soundtrack is very fitting to the mood. The chase scene is fantastic.There is a couple corny lines I could have done without, a lot of blood, which is good or bad, depending. But more realistic action, as the film is from the perspective of a REAL person in a real BAD situation. I'm a sucker for a more REAL and raw movie that I can actually FEEL, so I really enjoyed this film and would definitely watch again.I give it a generous, but more fair 9/10 (could be more like a strong 7 pushing 8) and hope it makes up for the unfair reviews. I hope this experience doesn't frighten James Wan out of the drama/thriller genres. I'd like to see more films like this from him. He does them well.</fullReview>

The exterminator doesn't exist as far as you're concerned, and Ms 45 means zip, then this will be a fresh experience for you. Everyone else though will be ticking off all the boxes as this glides goes along. Plot wise it's about a archetypal middle class family man who seeks revenge on a ruthless gang of archetypal street thugs after a deadly attack on the man's archetypal teenage son. And that's about it. There's a fair degree of violence, but almost all revenge movies are, by their very nature, violent so there's not really a great deal here to be drawn in by. It does have Kevin Bacon and he's as watchable as ever, also John Goodman shows up in a small role which really could have been played by anyone, but it's still a plus point having him on board. As a time passing B-movie this is entertaining enough for a look, but deep or important this ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, actually I do. It's because enough of the viewing public are so easily amused by low credibility action masquerading as something slick. Bereaved Dad takes vigilante action, sounded compelling enough - and it starred Kevin Bacon of The Woodsman and Mystic River depth. So, well worth a try, I thought, and for a while it seemed to be just that. However, the early threat to give us deep human drama descends inexorably into a chaotic melange of credibility-holes (people have listed plenty in the boards, see especially '100 Things I Learned' by effigyc), the non-thrill of the chase, and above all an identity crisis that makes me unsure whether to suggest electric shock therapy for director James Wan, or to start his career afresh with a High School course in film-making. By 3 quarters through, he seemed to have acquired ambitions to be a Winner (as in 'Death Wish' Winner) for the 21st century, but needs to look up 'humour' in a good dictionary. He also seemed to be attempting meaningful legal and sociological critique until about half way, before being forced to admit with a shrug that he did not understand law or society, and that a couple of bagfuls of guns would do instead. The final act seemed more sure of itself: black comedy, with the message that the vigilante is just like the criminal. I could be mistaken, though: it might be an NRI sales pitch aimed at middle class American Dads everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely entertaining if unbelievable revenge film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence is a violent revenge thriller starring Kevin Bacon as a man who loses his son to a violent criminal and seeks revenge. I must admit this film passed me by but I like Kevin Bacon and I like revenge films so I did expect to like it. The set up is nice and concise which is ideal if you are looking for some easy entertainment. I immediately identified with Bacon as the dad who knows the law will not give him the justice his sons murder deserves. The acting is good throughout. Kevin Bacon is a safe pair of hands and excellent as the everyman struggling with his grief. Kelly Preston and Jordan Garrett are also good as his wife and surviving son. John Goodman also appears in a nice cameo role and the bad guys are suitably bad.You do need to suspend your belief for most of the scenes and you could pick any number of holes in the plot but this is true of many thrillers and not a major spoiler for me. It does however contain some really tense scenes including a brilliantly executed chase. I liked the fact it wasn't overly predictable and had good elements of drama to go with the violence. The climax of the film is bloody and over the top but very satisfying. In summary Death Sentence is a ludicrous but hugely entertaining thrill ride and way more enjoyable than it should have been. For those that like revenge films this is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much of a complete action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's story feels very much loose with all the less logical points and plot holes. There is one too many of those that makes this action falls short of any action standard. The earlier buildup, up to the point of the initial conflict is done pretty good. Having Nicholas' jumping into a limited action that may be thought as purely protective instincts. But the later action sequences feels off without any prior explanation about the crucial details gets in the picture. For example, how did Nicholas come to possess an old army combat knife while was himself only a businessman? Also how come a mere businessman knows how to check a shotgun by aiming on it, yet instead didn't know how to handle a handgun, and yet still bought those handguns anyway? The acting is overall a lacking performance. As usual Kevin Bacon doesn't really perform well on the drama side. Kelly Preston and John Goodman are really undermined here by not having enough in frame portion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Death Sentence" starts out as though it has something to say about violence, but then degenerates into a derivative and mindless revenge movie.Kevin Bacon always brings an edge to any movie he is in, but I'm afraid this one was beyond even his powers to save it. And when I say the film is derivative, they should have listed the various sources in the credits; "Death Wish", "Straw Dogs" and "Taxi Driver" top the list.When a vicious gang kills his son during a robbery at a gas station, Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) decides that a little DIY justice is in order, especially after he feels the legal system has failed him. Events eventually sees Nick battling the gang like an avenging monster.There are inadvertently amusing sequences in the film such as when Nick tries to hide the fact that he is having vicious encounters with the gang from his wife. In a new twist on the old lipstick on the collar routine, he instead comes home with traces of brain tissue and arterial spray on his.The police are conspicuously absent throughout, despite the mayhem surrounding Nick. Instead of SWAT teams, the police are represented by policewoman, Detective Wallis (Aisha Tyler), in a nicely tailored skirt and blouse.Logic goes out the window completely when the gang have the chance to kill Nick. Instead of emptying a clip into his head, the gang's leader, Billy (Garrett Hedlund), is satisfied that Nick is dead after he goes down with one shot in the chest without even so much as an involuntary twitch.Nick survives and obtains an arsenal of weapons from Billy's father played by John Goodman in a typical over-the-top performance ? he even does a sales pitch like the gun dealer in "Taxi Driver"; a spiel that is now de rigueur for all gun dealers in movies.Also referencing "Taxi Driver", Nick gains awesome power by shaving his head ? la Travis Bickle, and handles his weapons with the skill of an instructor at a special forces training camp ? despite earlier repugnance and clumsiness.Nick's attack on the gang's headquarters rivals D-Day for intensity. Throughout, the film attempts to make a statement about revenge, but revels too much in the carnage ? it wants it both ways. There is also an attempt to create drama within Nick's family following the tragedies that befall them, but this also feels like an add-on.Maybe the script gave him little room to manoeuvre, but "Death Sentence" is a misfire by director James Wan who would go on to make the genuinely spooky, "The Conjuring". But even there he seemed to borrow a lot from earlier movies; it just works a lot better.In the end, I don't think the level of violence in "Death Sentence" will have a detrimental affect on anyone; the whole thing is about as realistic as a cartoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So wrong in so many ways....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Death Sentence' is a film about 20 years past its sell by date - sure, there are a whole generation of film goers who have never seen the classic 'revenge' thrillers and may find some of this new ground - but there is nothing here anyone who is legitimately old enough to make the viewing rating won't have seen before. The film is based around an 'average' happy all - American middle class family thrown into disarray after a wrong place wrong time attack by a gang of criminals, an act which sends the patriarch off on a revenge killing spree.So apart from regurgitating the MTV play-book of camera techniques, and the stock characterizations of sporty son, sensitive son, yummy mummy, black female cop, (because all African American would be too controversial - white skinhead gang with loads of non gang style tribal tattoos and token African American associates, inexplicably super fit bulletproof and sas trained white collar dad... All that makes this film is the action sequences, which are bloody and slick, but surely the impetus that is supposed to empathise the viewer with Bacon's father figure is his grief as a result of the violence done unto him. So hey, let's celebrate it and make it look cool to blow someone's legs off...... And then it is just cliché after plot hole after cliché.... I wish I was a movie bad guy so I could have some amazing huge inner city real estate replete with neon flickering striplights, Banksy graffiti and concealed mood lit stained glass windows, oh, and an altar..... Save your money and a couple of hours of your life and watch Taxi Driver again instead...... at least Travis Bickle can cut his own hair properly.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly revenge movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon again struggles to find a script that really suits him and this is one although I think he is amongst the best character actors. In this one he, as Nick Hume, sees his son become a victim of a gang armed robbery at a service station robbery. Being a normal business executive and family man he initially relies on the Police force and the judicial system to bring the perpetrators to justice. Not to o my amazement the justice system actually fails to bring the outcomes Hume seeks and instead focuses the attention of the gang on his family in circumstances that are a little far fetched. Hume decides to take matters into his own hands despite the hindrance of a Detective Jessica Wallis. Very predictably Hume sets out for total revenge but the cost of doing so is a little bit expensive. The moral of the film is that it is far better to let a murderous American gang kill your family without revenge as they may kill your family..........mmmmmm...... that sounds a bit silly but so is the film. I give it three stars for some good action and Bacon's hammed up but beefy performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Taxi Driver's Death Wish Sentence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you didn't know from the outset what Death Sentence was about, you would, if you are a seasoned movie watcher, know within twenty seconds of the opening credits that at least one member of insurance salesman Nick Hume's (Kevin Bacon) family is soon to meet their maker. They're just too damn happy, you see. That's not the only thing that is predictable about this vigilante flick from Saw director James Wan but, thankfully, it doesn't really get any worse than this.Kevin Bacon believably runs the gamut of emotions as unassuming Nick Hume, a mild-mannered everyman whose teenage son is killed in a gang initiation test. The police nab one of the gang ? although only because he is run over by a passing motorist; the police in this flick are so slow it's a wonder the streets aren't awash with middle-aged execs running around taking the law into their own hands ? but, when he learns that the most the hood is likely to get is 3-to-5, Nick retracts his testimony so that he can exact a little justice of his own.Of course, executing a gang member isn't a particularly wise move to make, something Nick should have realised as his day job is all about risk assessment, but logic isn't one of this movie's strong points. What it is good at, though, is the action set pieces, including a street chase and a hair-raising encounter on the top floor of a multi-storey car park ? although it has to be said that the sequence in which Nick fights off the gang as they invade his home veers dangerously close to Jackie Chan territory.Somewhere along the way, the film loses the plot as badly as its lead character does, and we are left with increasingly ludicrous incidents, culminating in our deadly insurance salesman ? who discovers to his good fortune that he is quite a crack-shot and a formidable street fighter ? taking out an entire gang of street punks. Of course it's all wish fulfilment, aimed squarely at all us honest Joes who have ever experienced that nasty thrill of fear when we find ourselves in the vicinity of some tattooed thug to whom the normal standards of behaviour don't seem to apply. Who amongst us hasn't imagined ourselves teaching such an oaf a lesson he won't forget? Well, Kevin Bacon does it for us here so we don't have to, and the film immediately earns itself a priceless amount of viewer goodwill. In the last few minutes, the makers try to dress it up as a cautionary tale; you know the kind of thing ? you become the thing you despise when you adopt their rules and methods. Chief bad guy Garrett Hedlund even tells Nick as much in a conclusion to the carnage that is admirably subdued. And just to ram the message home, Nick gets himself a Travis Bickle cut before going on the warpath.Although Bacon gives a good performance, he's always just Kevin Bacon giving a good performance and never 100 per cent believable as some anonymous everyman; it's the aforementioned Hedlund and John Goodman who bag the meatier roles (and the best lines, in Goodman's case).Bottom line: this film will entertainment you even if, like me, you can't stop yourself from thinking how far-fetched and stupid it all is as you watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start but loses its way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Kevin Bacon and was looking forward to watching this film after seeing him last in 'The Woodsman'.I enjoyed the start of this film. Mild-mannered family man's life is destroyed by vicious gang. At the start it's easy to follow the emotionally-charged logic of seeking revenge on those who wronged him and empathise with him. The scene in the park was particularly gripping. However, It seems to be a film with a split personality because from then on it descends into a revenge mission/computer game with no explanation of how Bacon's character suddenly acquires weapons and fighting skills.... Maybe he is as schizophrenic as the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Bacon is out for vengeance after his son is murdered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the thriller, "Death Sentence", Kevin Bacon loses his son to a murder that was committed only so that the killer could make his bones in a gang of young hoods. Bacon can't get justice through the system, so he himself knifes the young man to death.The boy's gang responds by going after him and his family. There is a neat chase scene through a parking garage. Bacon's revenge mission manages to get his wife shot to death and almost loses his other son in a home invasion. Bacon responds by arming himself to the teeth and invading the gang's headquarters and drug-producing factory. There is some nice cinematography in this film every so often. At other times, the direction lacks verve.The story itself is completely dumb. Bacon's character is completely unbelievable. He has no more sense than to kill the accused man shortly after his release from custody. He has no sense in inviting retaliation. The role of the police detective is a farce. Bacon's behavior time and again is ludicrous. He rushes home to lock the windows and doors when a child could break the glass windows and frames. Removing his family to a hideaway never occurred to him. He cries for help when there is none around rather than making a phone call. He doesn't know the first thing about guns, but he becomes a marksman in minutes, while miraculously avoiding shots directed at him. Two of the gang members are brothers, and their father is John Goodman. His character is unbelievable. He sells the guns to Bacon, knowing what he's up to. Bacon, by the way, shovels a huge amount of cash out to a bartender simply to find where someone is. Later in the story, Goodman's son kills him with hardly working up a sweat. There is nothing about this story that is not dumb. At least in "Death Wish", some attempt was made by Charles Bronson to stay away from police and stay out of the spotlight. He didn't call them in as Bacon does here. And when he does, the police woman is about as passive as they come in actually doing anything. Oh, yes. We also have several policemen who are there to protect Bacon's family who get their throats slit.Bacon is a fine actor. He brings the picture alive by his alternate fear of the gang, desire for revenge, and his determination in attacking their lair.As such action-thrillers go, this one is below par or at best average. It provides bubble-headed entertainment. Hollywood action movies of the last few years are seldom logical. They seldom introduce meaningful themes. They provide an array of strange and grotesque characters doing illogical things. I almost always feel that they are empty vehicles for conveying violence, crashes, fights, shooting, chases and sometimes sex. This movie conveys a man who turns into a psychopath who matches the main one he seeks to kill. That's its strong point because Bacon is good at it.</fullReview>

Bacon is underrated his acting just makes the film, and as the leading role you just want to give him a hug and help him avenge his family. Garrett is the leading protagonist as the gang leader, his acting was fantastic, leading his pack of delinquents, forcing Bacon from turning from a kind, loving family man to a hard core killing machine, as bullets fly, a blood splattering film will surely get off your seat, wanting Bacon to just murder each villain with his cold bloody hands. This film is fantastic and the reviews give it no justice at all. solid 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance by Kevin Bacon - Totally believable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the second time today. It did not disappoint. I don't know why this movie was not widely acclaimed when it was released, because it delivers great performances within a limited plot. You really can't look away from Kevin Bacon's character, he is totally believable in this role. It is every homebody's nightmare, that someone they love dearly will be the victim of some scumbag criminal's whim. In the end, all that matters is love...."oh, and one more thing...I need to buy some guns." If you love suspense, and Kevin Bacon, you will love this movie. Great stunt work, strong supporting cast. The only flaw I found was in the characterization of the police woman assigned to the case. She was much too pretty, too soft for the part. John Goodman, a great surprise in his role, also delivers a strong performance as one of the "bad guys". There is a lot of violence here, still this movie has merit in its genre. Kevin Bacon does look a bit too ghastly at the end, however he has survived a one man war against a gang. I'd watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and, yet, fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Protect what's yours!" It is very rare now that a film smaller than your average Hollywood suspense thriller can so perfectly pack a punch and hit the target dead centre, especially when so many exploitation films, b-movies, television dramas and independent dramas have gone down that path so many times before.'Death Sentence' is a film that not only puts a fresh spin on an otherwise seemingly straightforward path but dares to go where no modern film will. Directed by James Wan (SAW), you'd be forgiven for thinking that this will just be another gruesome tale of cold-blooded revenge. No, it is very gruesome, but it is not solely about revenge and is not such a fantastical tale that takes liberties with reality.Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is the head of a life insurance business who has worked hard to provide his family with a good life and clearly tends to count his blessings. So when one night his son is brutally attacked before his eyes in what turns out to be a gang member initiation and doesn't survive his injuries, Nick and his family are torn to pieces with grief.When the boy charged with the murder of his eldest son walks away a free man, Hume's decision, the grieving father follows him home, resulting in the death of the new gang member. As Hume struggles to cope with the guilt of what he has done, the gang looking for the man responsible come straight for him, starting a relentless chase and resulting in more bloodshed, upping the ante further and literally burdening Hume and his family with a death sentence.This gem of a violent suspense thriller boasts not only high class action scenes, full-on tension and genuine edge of your seat moments, but some of the finest character acting devoted to the vigilante thriller sub-genre as a nerve-racking battle of wits between protagonist and antagonist, a drama that questions the rights and wrongs of 'eye for an eye' justice and a subtext that proves neither side right or wrong after all is said and done.Kevin Bacon and Garrett Hedlund are a perfect mismatch as the grieving father turned scared witless fighter versus the gun-toting stone-cold skinhead gang leader. John Goodman also makes a nasty turn as a guns and drugs dealer, which has to be seen to be believed. But Bacon is the champion here as there is no other role that springs to mind where ever action and facial expression catches the feeling of a man becoming twisted by the dark secrets he takes home to his family every night.What really caught my full attention though was that every moment I thought the film would not dare to go any further down the road to dangerous extremes, it does and it catches you off guard. James Wan puts his 'SAW' experience to great use but his influence as a dramatic director is proved here and also his control over a rather complex tale is firm to say the least. It seems that instead of losing control as the film goes into darker territory, he rather lets it off the leash like a rabid dog and lets it do what a rabid dog naturally does.Fans of 'Death Wish', 'The Brave One', 'Harry Brown' and 'The Punisher' will love this one but newcomers to the vigilante revenge thriller will be hard pressed to find another as effective. All I recommend is that fans of films like 'Max Payne' throw away their copies of said film and buy this instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie with some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some parts of this movie disappointed me and were unrealistic. The policeman and law enforcements were terrible, first of all they didn't even make an attempt to protect the Hume family and bring the gang to justice. How do two cops get killed so easily when they are on duty to protect a house and family? Maybe they were too busy stuffing their faces with donuts, i don't know. But also the family shouldn't of even been at their house when they KNOW the gang is coming to kill them. Even though those parts frustrated me, you have to look past that and realize that this was a pretty good movie. There were parts of this movie i did enjoy like the parking garage scene. This is also one of the sadder movies i've seen recently. Wan did a good job balancing it with very low and sad parts and with intense action scenes, despite he messed up on some big parts. Kevin Bacon did a phenomenal job and held this movie together, i highly recommend this movie to people who can appreciate solid movies and look past minor flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I should not have enjoyed this as much as I did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I follow my usual standards for action thrillers, I should not have enjoyed 'Death Sentence' as much as I did. I like action films with a purpose, that have great characters and great motivation. 'Death Sentence' has none of that, it is a thinly veiled remake of the Charles Bronson classic 'Death Wish', but without that movie's freshness. Somehow despite it all, darn it, I enjoyed myself.Like 'Death Wish', here is a movie that turns a sweet-natured guy into a violent killer out for revenge. That guy is Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) a family man with two sons, Lucas (Jordan Garrett) and Brenden (Stuart Lafferty) and wife Helen (Kelly Preston). While driving home with son Brenden, he stops in a gas station only to find that the place is being held up. The robbers shoot the clerk and then kill Brenden with a machete before fleeing the scene. The kid who committed the murder is arrested and a trial date is set.Nick, stricken with grief, is told that his son's death was part of a gang initiation. Worse is that a legal loophole will only get the kid 3 to 5 years. That's not good enough for Nick, so he recants his eyewitness testimony and the kid goes free. Later, Nick finds the kid and attacks him in an alleyway where he stabs him to death. The problem is that this particular kid is part of a vicious street gang that is now looking for whomever killed their brother.What happens next is pretty expected. Nick becomes a one-man vigilante force, attacking members of the gang one by one while they go gunning for him. The gang is led by a tattooed tough guy named Billy Darley (Garrett Hedlund) who wants revenge for his little brother's death. Meanwhile Nick tries to evade detection by a police investigator (Aisha Tyler) who doesn't ask why he has a bandaged hand, a bruised head or a cut lip. Maybe he's just clumsy.What works in this film is the performance by Kevin Bacon which is probably better than the movie deserves. There is something in his eyes, in the wake of his son's death, that seems fired up about getting his revenge. There is also something about the killing itself that seems more realistic than I had expected. When Nick kills the kid who murdered his son, his reaction is pure fear, the realization that he has just taken another life. That's refreshing when you consider that most killings like that in the movies end with the hero standing stone-faced over the body and tossing out a one-liner before stalking away.I also liked the action scenes, which are quite thrilling, especially a scene in a parking garage where Nick is chased by the gang and corners one of their numbers on the roof and traps him in a car that he he then pushes off the roof. That scene had a great deal of tension and suspense even though you couldn't believe it for a second. Most of the movie is like that, actually.'Death Sentence' was directed by James Wan, who made the original Saw. This movie, like that one, wallows in its unpleasantness and its puddles of blood. It seems strange to say, but I think this one is actually bloodier than Saw. The difference is that here he has a better story to tell and he has a good performance by Kevin Bacon to work with. He maintains that good story and good suspense for a while, until the third act when the film crosses over into an area very close to Taxi Driver. Still there is enough of the movie that I liked to recommend it maybe as a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of James Wan for years. Though I didn't enjoy his "Dead Silence (2007)," I'm a fan of the entire "Saw" series, and I know many prefer Wan's original to the many sequels that followed. I saw Wan as talented and having potential, and so I decided to rent "Death Sentence." I already knew what it was about, but I gave it a try anyways. And I'm glad I did. The film, instead of going as cliché as previous vendetta films (like "The Punisher"), it made it feel real. You saw the progression of a family man into a killer, without thinking "whatever." Each death was shocking, each action scene suspenseful. The performances stand out, especially Kevin Bacon as the grieving father and John Goodman as a dirty gun dealer. The directing makes you worry, surprises you, makes you feel for these people. I could tell the musical score was by Charlie Clouser, who has composed for all the "Saw" films and even Wan's "Dead Silence," and yet it was much more tranquil than those films. The entire film was both Wan's and Clouser's most mature film to date, showing real craftsmanship within the film and showing depth. Calm in the chaos. Ultimately, it's worth the ride, even if you may feel like this film's story (a family man goes for revenge) has been done too many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am only giving this movie a 9 to boost its rating, but i would give it an 8.9 I was expecting a pile of heaping crap going into this since it is directed by the Saw pervert James Wan. I am also reviewing this after watching Taxi Driver (but i saw this film before that one). Well, where to begin. Kevin Bacon has now proved to me that he is one of the greatest actors over the past twenty years. Almost every movie he is in is great, and thats not just because of a good story, but his acting adds to whatever movie he is in, and helps the story unfold. Okay, I have never seen Death Wish so i will not compare te two like others have done. I will simply praise James Wan for making a film better than one of the films it is ripping off, Taxi Driver. Taxi Driver is a slow,long, drawn out process showing what one mans definition of justice is, and so is this one. This one,however, has scenes in it that you will be remembering months and months after watching it. I already forgot about Taxi Driver and i saw it last night. Anyway, if James Wan is crazy enough to read this, then please make more movies like this and not like Saw, because your name now deserves to be talked about whenever someone talks about great movies. Thanks Jimmy, thank you</fullReview>

Since I paid to see other violent movies such as No Country for Old Men and Gone Baby Gone which both bored me compared and I totally wasted money on Public Enemies - all of which got better reviews than this, I will never pay attention to reviewers again.

		<fullReview>Director James Wan (the guy behind modern horror 'Saw' and 'Dead Silence') harks back to the old school 70/80s with his trashy, b-grade-like urban vigilante revenge thriller 'Death Sentence'. Think of 'Death Wish'? well funny I write that, as the novel this film is adapted from, happens to be a direct sequel to that book. Yep novelist/writer Brian Garfield stormed up the idea of 'Death Wish' and 'Death Sentence', which both were interpreted to film. Either though I thought Michael Winner did better job conveying it's brutally gritty, but honest examination into a spiral of self-loath and depravity to fulfill an empty void. Wan's latter effort simply wants to impulsively entertain, and he sure does with this traditionally no-nonsense exercise. Still it doesn't stop it pulling out some gut-hitting emotional punches, but its disjointed context isn't as thought-provoking with it aiming itself at some over-used conventions and over-the-top traits. No fuss. The first half tries to build upon the harrowing incident and conflicting character dramas as a domino effect occurs of the matter just seeming to get worse in a rather realistic manner, but it ends on somewhat an easy option of going gung-ho. It boils down to a lot of scorning anger. I found that it was Kevin Bacon alone that carries the film, even though Wan's compact and adrenaline fueled handling crafted out some stylish frames and instinctively suspenseful set-pieces. But in the end your hoping he would break out something quite raw, but it's quite a slick parade. Bacon (who's exceptionally good) holds it together with his deteriorating character trying to come to grips, in no other way than seeking his own justice. However this would come at a chaotic price, where soon he risks losing more and learns what he's truly capable of in a truly bloody confrontation. Something he never thought he'll revert to. Kelly Preston gives a moving performance as his wife. Garrett Hedlund, Matt O'Leary and Edi Gathegi made for a suitable bunch of cold-hearted thugs. A burly John Goodman appears in a minor performance. The luminous score adds to the blood-pumping tone and the camera-work is tautly executed. Not perfect, but stimulating and fast-paced pulp.</fullReview>

Its the old story of revenge and the director really gets you believing Kevin's character. I did have it in my head that this would be the same old story with the predictable outcomes - whereas part of this is true, the story is told in a more believable way, to a degree. Kevin, does not suddenly turn into a Jean Claude Van Dam or Steven Seigal hero overnight and the comedy is added when he consistently drops his weapons whilst reading the instructions for use and could not correctly shave the back of his head (clearly as he couldn't see!) In the circumstances, its all believable and I think I would find myself doing exactly as Kevin has done here.Anyway. Overall, this film is a definite one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The avenger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This action-packed action thriller is a retake on the original novel "Death Wish", which already had about five remakes. Brian Garfield's book takes place in Chicago. Here, for reasons unknown, the action is placed in, and around Columbia, South Carolina. As directed by James Wan, it offers an almost nonstop action pace for fans of the genre, who will love it, no doubt, judging by the comments to this forum.Nick Hume, an executive for a large company is at a point of his life where he can consider himself a lucky man. He has a nice family, is at a position of importance in the firm where he works, and a beautiful home in an affluent part of town. He adores his two teen aged sons, but he is specially involved with Brendan, the oldest, who shows a great future as a hockey player.Tragedy strikes as Nick and Brendan are driving home after a night game. They are running low on gas. The nearest station is in a bad part of town. Brendan goes to get a cold drink, while his father is filling up. Suddenly, a skin head gang breaks into the convenience store where the young man is buying his soda, armed to the teeth. The motive is a gang initiation for a young member, who has to prove himself, and he chooses to do a horrible thing to Brendan Hume.Filled with grief and guilt, Nick decides to take matters into his own hand. First, he goes for the one he knows was responsible for happened to Brendan, but little does he know his action will trigger an open war with the gang, something that he will regret, specially when they turn against the Humes' own right to live in peace.Kevin Bacon is the main reason for watching "Death Sentence". He makes a tremendous contribution, like in most of the movies he appears in. Mr. Bacon is like a chameleon in his approach to bringing to life his character. As Nick, he is a man whose main purpose in life is the avenging what has been done to him and his family by a bunch of criminals. Garrett Hedlund is the head of the tattooed gang leader. John Goodman has a small role as the drug and arms dealer; he is also the father of two of the criminals that were instrumental in robbing Nick of his peace and well being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start, then a downward spiral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie started I was really excited! I thought, "Wow, this is going to be a sweet movie." It had me on the edge of my seat. Then it just got depressing. Kevin Bacon ended up completely screwing over his family after his son was murdered. He got way out of hand. It is entertaining but I hated the ending. The first half is really entertaining, I really enjoyed it, then it went sour. Kevin Bacon (I forget his character name) takes it too far and taking revenge ultimately makes things worse. If you watch the movie I am sure you will be entertained. I just did not like the second half of the movie. I think after seeing the movie you will know exactly what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The standard of the vigilante movies was undoubtedly set by the brilliant movie Death Wish.In Death Sentence,director James Wan tried to do a 2007 version of that movie but I think he did not completely get it.Death Sentence is an entertaining action film but its biggest problem is that it tells the same story of a lot of vigilante movies : a normal guy who,after a loss,becomes on a vigilante without any mercy.The film has the same structure of all this kind of films.I respect the intention Wan had of making a version of Death Wish for this century but I think that,for achieving that point,he should have taken the film a bit further.Wan gets redeemed after the false move Dead Silence was but he is still far away from his excellent debut in Saw.Although I liked Death Sentence,I expected a bit more from Wan.But still,this movie has many positive elements which made me have a good time.The action sequences are well filmed (my favourite is the one in the parking lot).The violence is surprisingly realistic and I really appreciated that.Kevin Bacon brings a very competent performance because he makes credible the transformation from a normal guy to a vigilante.Death Sentence is a competent movie and I had a good time watching it.But,on the other hand,we have seen the story it tells too many times and the movie does not result very memorable.I can recommend this film but you should not expect nothing really special from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action movie that isn't false advertisement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the action genre, but I can't really say there are many action movies that are truly action-packed. Action movies come in two verities: Lifetime TV dramas with things blowing up every now and then, and stale, generic, plot less movies with lots of terrorists and some cliché, animated piece of cardboard to mow them down. Death Sentence isn't either. It actually has action, and the action isn't pathetic.If I honestly had to point out a movie with the absolute best gory gunfights, this would have to be it. The simple reason for that is Death Sentence doesn't pretend to be an action movie like Casino Royale, and it isn't as lame and generic as Die Hard. The last 30 minutes are nothing but guns and blood and beautiful cinematography. The other 50 are actually emotional, with plenty of action scenes scattered throughout. I never once felt like I was watching a Lifetime TV drama, but at the same time the plot is FAR superior and less cliché than you'd think. There is no social commentary to weigh things down, though the last shot of the movie could be one if you look at it right. This is true balls-to-the-wall entertainment, and the rest of your pretentious, cliché, critically acclaimed wannabes like No Country for Old Men can go to hell.What else is there for me to say? This is the best action movie I've seen this decade.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weird, started out good, got worse throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this movie for several reasons. I saw this movie preview on another DVD so I sought it out. The concept is great. I definitely sympathized with the main character and was empathetic towards the family. At the beginning of the movie I felt this way. However, as the movie progressed I really found it hard to relate to the main character and his transformation throughout. I just couldn't believe that his anger could have been that strong. I don't know. Whenever he escaped the hospital is when I got annoyed. Why didn't the cops go after him? He murdered people. Why weren't the cops looking for Billy? He did murder two police officers! Like I said the concept was great, but it seemed like they didn't know what to do with it as the movie went on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man loses his son in a careless gang initiation. Sets off on a revenge rampage, and gets more than what he bargains for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie had great potential in the beginning. You could feel the warmth. Brendan (Hume) was the golden boy that wins you over. He isn't cocky, but has the quiet confidence that comes with having great parents. I could sense the irony when they were making the "death" cracks. It was overkill. Maybe it just wasn't edited properly? And several of the scenes could have been altered. The villain, Billy Darley (love the name) was so one dimensional, there was so much that could have been done with the character and the actor (Hedlund) def. has the chops to sink his teeth into it. Bacon wasn't at his best, it seemed like he was in a haze while acting. I don't know, compare this performance to the one in Mystic River. But then again it wasn't nearly the same quality material. He can be manically scary, I mean that's what he's best at!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought Death Sentence because it looked to me like a genuine, well-made thriller and I've been a fan of Kevin Bacon ever since Tremors, which was one of my favorite films when I was a kid. Unfortunately, it very soon devolved into a boring, by-the-numbers revenge thriller, throwing away Bacon's talent. John Goodman is also a genuine talent that is genuinely wasted here.Bacon stars as Nick Hume, an unremarkable man but a good husband and father, good at his work and good with his family, until a tragedy costs the life of his oldest son, just as he was aspiring to the professional hockey world. One night at a gas station the boy is a the victim of a gang initiation, in which a young gangster kills him to gain entry into the gang. The attack is totally unprovoked, of course, unless you count a moment just earlier when the gangsters were street racing side-by-side and Nick flashes his brights at them to remind them to turn their lights on. I seem to remember seeing a movie where a killer would drive with his lights off and then kill the people that flashed their brights at him. Can't remember what it was, though.Anyway, Hume gets a sleazy, lazy lawyer to take the case against the kid who killed his son. The guy tells him that the most they can hope for is to make a deal where the kid will go to prison for a couple years, so Nick is understandably horrified. This mental giant of an attorney mentioned as one of their difficulties that the murder weapon "magically" disappeared. Maybe he's not used to taking murder cases where the killer doesn't leave the murder weapon, a complete set of fingerprints, and maybe a driver's license or credit card or at least a utility bill for some contact information. Magically. This, by the way, is where the movie first starts to go horribly wrong. When the gangster killed Hume's son, the other gangsters sped off without him, and he ran into the street cursing them, at which point a car slammed into him with enough speed to shatter both legs, to say nothing of the certain spinal injury, broken ribs, organ damage and fractured skull. He didn't get knocked over, that car PLOWED into him.Nevertheless, it doesn't occur to any lawyers later to connect the dots about the fact that Hume saw the murder with his own eyes and then saw the murderer get slammed into by a car. He still had to pick the kid out of a lineup!! Then later, the police occasionally come to Hume, begging him not to start a war and please stop what he's doing now ? all the while fully aware that he had murdered one of them because he was not satisfied with the conviction that he would have gotten. At one point, he asks the police for help, and he gets, "God help you." NICE.Clearly, there's not a scrap of thought put into the script, but we can still hope for a fun ride. Sadly, we don't get that either. I was bothered to see John Goodman in such a stupid and pointless role, Bacon is clearly wasting his time, but he's such a good actor that most of the time it's as if he's struggling to squeeze himself into a movie that's too small for him. But the real problem is the gangsters. It's hard to make this kind of thriller when the antagonists are such clownish caricatures. The gang members are mostly stuntmen who are apparently trying out acting for a while, and it is clear why they don't act. After Hume kills the new kid, Joe, there is a laughable scene at a bar where they all tearfully drink to his memory, talking about how much they loved him and how he was a brother to them. It's hard to watch a lot of guys who are not actors struggling to act like hardened gangsters struggling to act emotional. Soon there's a chase scene where the gang is chasing Hume through a parking garage. He runs up one level after another, setting off car alarms all along the way. Why the car alarms, you may wonder? I don't know, maybe he knows these aren't the smartest guys in the world and he doesn't want them to get lost. Maybe he just doesn't have a can of paint with him to paint arrows on the ground, so car alarms are the best way to make sure they can keep track of him. The end of the film devolves into stereotypical gunfights and bloodshed, with an unexpected turn at the end of Hume and the head gangster both with multiple gunshot wounds but no bullets sitting next to each other on a bench. Pretty interesting confrontation, I hadn't seen that before. It's too bad it had to come after an hour and a half of garbage!Death Sentence is a good effort, it just doesn't work. Bacon's heart is in the right place but he isn't given anything interesting to do, Goodman's character is pointless entirely so it's a shame that he also has to dumb himself down for it, and James Wan is directing the movie for no other reason than because he directed Saw and the almost strikingly similar Dead Silence. It's too bad. It could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The perfect family: mum, dad and two sons. Father and eldest son are en-route, traveling home from an ice hockey game when they make a stop at a gas station. All goes wrong: a group of delinquents run in, apparently wanting to rob the station. The son dies, leaving the family in ruins. Not able to get enough satisfaction from the court-case the father decides to take the law into his own hands.All in all an often seen scenario. Many more films use it and for some of them it works out well enough. For this one it doesn't and the reason for that is that the father on the vengeance changes from an office clerk into a killer a bit too easily. While the beginning is realistic enough it becomes highly unbelievable rather quick and the finishing is just -too- far out of reality to be worth any more than a quick rental at the DVD shop.While most of the other characters in the film stay true enough that one character falls out of place too much and gradually brings the whole of the film down. If you're looking for some shooting and some collateral damage then this one might work for you. If you're looking for a vengeance killer that doesn't run up for a position in a hired killer squad then this film isn't for you.5 out of 10 crooks shot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was to be great if finished after its 1st half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is very nice and has a point of view if it was finished after half of the movie . The other half is just crap and none sense that made the movie like any of the thousand revenge stories , but without any logic behind turning a VP who has no idea about gangsters into a professional one in one night ! Kevin Bacon's performance was great as usual. I see also the detective's character sort of unrealistic. I can't understand as well how Kevin was able to detect the black guy coming from his back to shot him , as he acted as he was completely seeing him. There are several points done in amateur way in the movie , a pity that it was to get a 10 if they story was just trimmed to the realistic side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Nick Hume's (Bacon) son is killed during a gang initiation, he sets out to get revenge.This is a well paced thriller. I was most impressed by the camera work in the chase scenes on foot when Hume is running for his life from the gang with guns blazing. These scenes were effortless and smooth as can be, and no nervous or shaky camera.I thought, in the beginning, this would be like the Death Wish movies, but it's not executed (sorry) in the Death Wish manner. There is a lot of violence, gore, and brutality, and this is what happens when Hume decides to protect his family at all costs and goes up against a gang almost with no armor. Well, no armor until the last straw was laid on him.The acting, dialogue, and overall cinematography were excellent, and it was nice to see John Goodman again. He is always good.Violence: No; Sex:No; Nudity:No; Language: Some, not too much</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Sentence starring Kevin Bacon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, I am not too fond of Kevin Bacon. His most recent movies haven't much appealed to me, but Death Sentence was pretty good. Kept me interested which is hard lately. I admit a few very dumb decisions were made to produce some of the bad outcomes of the movie. But I can overlook that for a decent movie.Overall, I feel Kevin Bacons acting made is easier to believe the whole story and to understand the difficulty of the task at hand. He comes off rather weak and unaccustomed to violence and defense, more like a good majority of modern day men with a business sense and such. If you switched Bacon with say Vin Diesel or The Rock you'd totally expect the movie to have ended an hour sooner. Laughs! LOL.8 out of 10. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pimitive justice within civilised society!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan in directing the film, has portrayed the contradiction of justice and fairness in civilised society perfectly in the manner he transforms Kevin Bacon from the perfect civilised successful statistically correct family man to a ruthless blood thirsty primitive hunter who will not rest until he balances the scales of primitive justice by spilling the blood of those who in a senseless killing took the life of his son. The film starts with the perfect family setting and Bacon is portrayed as the successful family father figure within a modern civilised society. But the perfect setting instantly crumbles away when his son is brutally and senselessly killed in a gang robbery. Amidst the sorrow and grief the transformation of Bacon begins as he realises that his perfect civilised society is not as perfect as he initially thought. Reality sets in the court room when he realises that the legal system cannot satisfy his need for justice for the death of his son. Suddenly the primitive seed planted deep within his soul starts to receive the nourishment that it needs from the aggrieved father's need for revenge and it grows rapidly and transforms Bacon into a killer who sets out on a killing spree. This of course has repercussions and the weak inept civilised justice system can't help him. This leads to further deaths and tragedy in Bacon's perfect family life and culminates to the final showdown where we see the final transformation of Bacon into the ruthless killing crusader who will stop at nothing until he satisfies his primitive need for revenge. This is Bacon at his best portraying the contradictory emotions and torment perfectly leaving the viewer with the same torment right to the bitter end; the sweet taste of revenge on the one hand and the sense of guilt on the other...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely write about any movie and I watch movies all the time. But this one is different. Don't go in there with any thoughts, get a good audio and this one will blow you out indeed. I am a kind of writer, so about the plot it could have been better, but nowadays if you make a sophisticated plot, it won't be a big success most of the people are not going to understand it. So plot is 6 but Kevin Backon, this devil atmosphere, the edge....For acting I give it 10. So just relax, let your feelings go out, cuz we see everyday when they ask us how are you feeling fine, but we are not and as a matter of fact we need such movies to let our internal anger free. So guess don't get sucked in the plot just enjoy this work because it is one of the highest levels. Enjoy...hahahha</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Revenge Sentence!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about revenge movies that if made right you always feel like asking what would you do if put in the same situation and mostly the answer will be what else will I do apart from taking revenge. Kevin Bacon playing the loving husband and father see his life getting upside down when his elder son is killed for no reason. He takes matter into his own hands to balance the equation and chaos starts. The strong points of movie are sure footed direction of otherwise horror specialist James Wan and utterly believably moving performance of Kevin Bacon. Kevin makes you feel his pain and anger convincingly. All other supporting actors play their part nicely. Action sequences are shot beautifully. Don't miss it, if you feel like watching a good convincing revenge action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly to my own dismay I have seen this movie more than once. Upon discovering that this movie has a 6.8 rating, you could say I was a bit shocked. Now, I am a sucker for action, crime dramas so I couldn't help but watch this movie; but keep in mind all the while that I am not a Kevin Bacon fan in the slightest. I tried my hardest to watch this movie free of prejudice, but after finishing it, I can't help but say that this is a true abomination of a crime drama in my eyes. Factors such as poor acting, poor plot direction, and absolutely no logic to this story drove me to give this movie a 3/10. I never found myself entertained during the movie, there were no plot twists that left me at the edge of my seat. In the direction that the plot of this movie travels it was all fairly predictable, son dies, man seeks retribution for actions of bad guys, kills bad guys-FIN. So yeah, one could say it was a bit lame for someone who has a fairly legitimate taste for crime dramas. In continuation, I was pushed even further from this movie by how far- fetched this movie is. I mean come on, the vigilante movie scene was satisfied with The Death Wish Trilogy. No Kevin Bacon, you are not Charles Bronson. How this movie netted $9.5 million I know nothing of. Save your eyes the pain of watching this movie.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie. 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore all negative reviews. For all those who put a negative review i would LOVE to see you make a movie even a tiny bit better than this one. Truth is, you can't. Death sentence was a fantastic movie in my opinion. Kevin Bacon, John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund played masterful parts in this movie. Billy Darley and Bones were probably two of the creepiest characters in this film. Mixed with the emotional aspect and heart wrenching songs, such as Deo Dona Nobis Pacem, make a great impact to the heart. If you didn't tear up in this movie or get close to tearing up, you're heartless. Gore and action were great and provided a awesome adrenaline rush. Other reviews stated how fake the "dodging of bullets" was. It's not the fact that Bacon couldn't get hit, it's the fact that Billy Darley and his gang were a little offhand with their aim.Other than that, fantastic movie and i give it 10/10. I watched it last night with my family and they loved it. I will watch this movie over and over again. I loved it!</fullReview>

Overall a movie which goes between drama, action and a classic revenge thriller! I loved every bit of this and I wasn't disappointed with the ending at all.

Yes, there are far fetched moments but who cares. When one wants revenge not much will stop one, so maybe it is not that far fetched after all! Revenge give you wings, that should be the slogan for this movie. Rent it if you missed out, go for BLU RAY for better action and gore and enjoy the tense 2 hours you are about to spend!

This movie is so unrealistic it makes movies like matrix and harry potter look more credible.Good points goes to Kevin Bacon's acting and some good action scenes, but that doesn't help this mess of a movie either, maybe the director should stick to horror genres and stay away from serious movies like this, this film didn't know if it wanted to be a drama, action film or a parody... it ripped off taxi driver!!! maybe the director was high when making this piece of trash of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See, I'm a fan of vigilante films and I went to see it with no prejudice. And how pleased I was!The overall visual side, ambiance were done brilliantly. I enjoyed the harsh lighting and washed out tones which in my mind, matched the rotten situation we had in this film.Second of all - the storyline. Although it's generally a cliché (Hey, Max Payne, Death Wish, the Punisher... list goes on), it did bring in a few small, but important twists. We're mean't to root for the good guy, or at least the lesser of two evils. And I love how you can't actually tell, which side is more evil. After all, being raised on streets in a survive-or-die way doesn't leave you unscathed.I'm hearing a lot of praises about Kevin Bacon's performance, but in my opinion, he did the best he could with a bit of a 2-dimensional character. What I really liked was the powerful performance of Garrett Hedlund. I'm used to his more subtle, milder screen characters like in Four Brothers or Friday Night Lights, but his performance in Death Sentence blew me away, put a fist in my face and set my feet on fire. He actually manages to portray Billy Darly's character in a way that it leaves you wonder whether you should hate him or feel sorry for him. One side a badass gang leader, from other side a caring and protective brother and from the third side a wimp who runs from his daddy like a beaten dog really leaves you wonder: "What has happened to him? Why?". And so a generic villain turns into somewhat of an antihero, yet still remains as vile, brutal as ever. Proof? He shot a kid in the face and made his little brother cut another kid's throat with a machete. A machete! John Goodman's character was more like a plot device, but it served his purpose well and in the most entertaining way. I swear I even loved the saliva splatter. He had a small role but delivered it with such power. Please do yell at me with your double chin all wobbly and spit splattering across my shirt! I will be enjoying it! Whereas other minor characters in the movie fell a it flat, I have to give it to Kelly Preston - her character was likable, sincere and her silent suffering got to me maybe even more than Nick Hume's suffering.In general, this isn't a "masterpiece" but if you're looking for violence, some interesting character development and a nice overall look, have a go at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Goodman's best monologue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering what character would John Goodman play in this type of movie -I mean, he was a cop co-starring with Denzel Washington once...-, secretly hoping that he would be some sort of thug..., then, he makes the first appearance as the one and only bad...s who will straight up that Billy character. After the family gets killed, I wasn't really expecting to see John Goodman's character again, so when Nick Hume ends up buying guns from him, I ended up speechless after he (Bones) acknowledges that Billy had it coming, and lets Nick go "his way". This without mentioning the way he introduced the .357 Magnum and the .45 was simply "splendid". By the way, does anyone know which gun is the last one?? The "sword of justice"? I will appreciate big time the tip.This sequence makes the whole movie worth watching. Kudos to Mr. Goodman!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from the reviews, this is one of those "love it or hate it" films. Like Death Wish, Death Sentence is a movie about a traumatised good guy opening a can of pure, unadulterated revenge on the scum of society.Kevin Bacon--apparently a businessman of some kind--takes on the gang which killed his son in a series of back-and-forth eye-for-an-eye killings culminating in a spectacular firefight involving black market guns and gorgeous muscle cars.Some characters are left underdeveloped. For instance, the killer could have been more than unidimensional; instead we're treated to a smiling, winking, completely irredeemable bad guy.Like Death Wish, Death Sentence makes you question what YOU would do if you felt the justice system no longer worked, and such is its appeal. Kevin Bacon delivers a very good performance as a man slowly becoming the very thing he wishes to destroy. The rest of the cast is forgettable; the muscle cars featured in the film had more personality. Not that it's really the fault of the actors. The characters were merely cardboard cutouts: loving wife; brotherly-loving brothers; tough gang members with muscle cars, tats and piercings; generic cop; etc. etc.Kevin Bacon and his character save the movie, making it a truly memorable addition to the Death Wish vein of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will sentence this movie, GREAT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence is the crime, action-thriller movie which use the name from the sequel of "Death Wish", the famous vigilante novel and film. (starred by the late Charles Bronson) However, Death Sentence mostly based on Death Wish, instead of the actually Death Sentence novel which was used the name for the movie.I am very proud of Kevin Bacon in this movie. He usually receive the main villain role in many movies. (For well-known example, Sleepers, Hollow Man, Wild Things) However, he received the protagonist in this movie. Why I am very proud of him? Because he could highly get on the role. The perfect businessman with the perfect family, but one night at the gas station changed his life forever. After one of his sons was killed by a gang due to the newest member of them was forced to kill as initiation ritual. When he decided to kill his son's murderer because he thought that the justice could not bring them for penalty. The gangster decided to break down him, followed and later beat his family. As a result, the poignant guy who loss the perfect family was loose the control and he had to judge all of the bastards by his own.The cast were very good. Bacon get through his role with his best acting. He could show everyone that he is not only great as the villain role, but the protagonist. Garrett Hedlund also get through his role too as the main villain. He could play his character, Billy Darley as well as Bacon in the villain role. The ruthless and no mercy gangster's leader who decided to send the "death sentence" for the man's family who killed his henchmen that he loved like his brother. I think he looked cold-blood and very nasty.For the plot, it could be discussed that Death Sentence is possibly the remake of Death Wish, even the name was chosen from the sequel of Death Wish's novel. I accepted that at the moment I typing this comment, I had never seen Death Wish I before. (I could had seen only a little part of Death Wish III) Even if Death Sentence had the similar plot to Death Wish but it wasn't the same at all. Everything which was shown in the movie was reasonable and ongoing. I loved that very much! Nevertheless, there is some issue which I had a little disappointment with it. The climax scene of the movie. I think that some people could be unhappy with it because the fast-paced and uncleared ending in the movie was hard acceptable. I didn't know what James Yan thinking with this scene. But I thought that the pervasive violence and language was excessive, so the end was very easy.For my conclusion, I like Death Sentenec because the great cast, great plot, acceptably fast-paced continuous and some great action scene like the cat and mouse situation which ended at the multi-stories parking lot and the shooting in Billy's "Office". Everything looked comfortable and could be one of the great action-thriller movie. Even if Death Sentence had some doubtful issue to discuss but for the overall, I like this movie very very much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, but Decent Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read many other reviews, but I'm sure the title "Death Wish" has been mentioned more than once. It's a fair comparison. This is a "vigilante" style thriller, but Kevin Bacon's character is a little more reluctant than Bronson's Paul Kersey.Early on, this one really looked like it was heading down the "Death Wish" road...and I was right. It even ended up going down that same road near the end. It was only in the middle where this film takes a detour...one into heavy traffic, slowing the film down and adding a heavy dose of illogicality.For about the first hour, I was really excited by "Death Sentence." Especially a thrilling street chase ending up in suspenseful duel atop a parking garage. The bad guys are BAD. Bacon is a very sympathetic figure. Things look like they're going down a familiar, yet fairly entertaining road. It was at this point that the film seems to lose its way. It gets a little more into psychological drama and it just doesn't work. Instead, it gives you time to ponder a lot of the things that haven't really added up to this point.The most glaring is the role of the police. This is probably the last city in the country where I'd want to live. These police are utterly clueless. After Bacon takes revenge on his first "victim," there's no way in the world he wouldn't have been the prime suspect and probably the first interview. But the police never question him about it until several days later and even then, it's half-assed.The leading cop is the always annoying Aisha Tyler. Annoying because she always plays the same type of role. Supposedly tough, ultimately stupid and always bleeding-heart. She doesn't disappoint in turning in that performance once again. This time more unbelievable and here's why...with a SPOILER ALERT attached.***SPOILER START***The gang has openly threatened to come after Bacon and his family. Tyler doesn't seem to care about catching them, despite the fact they're running a drug operation and linked to a black market gun ring as well. She only threatens Bacon to "Stop it...now!" Yeah, sounds like a real cop to me. Then, instead of setting up a possible ambush when the thugs come to attack, you know, maybe to actually catch the criminals, she leaves one patrol car outside with two cops to watch the house.You know what's coming next. The cops are killed and the thugs ambush Bacon and his family. When he wakes up in the hospital, Tyler treats him as public enemy number one, while the thugs are free to go about their business. Come on now! TWO COPS WERE KILLED by the gang! In reality, practically the entire force would be looking for these guys...and believe me, they're not hard to find. In "Death Sentence," the cops don't even blink an eye.Then, it gets worse. Bacon escapes from the hospital and returns to his home. That's right. The first place you'd think the cops would look. Instead, he has time to sleep it off, trace a phone number, stop in the bank to withdraw a bunch of cash, buy some black market guns, find out where the gang hangs out...then RETURN HOME AGAIN to fiddle around with his newly purchased arsenal! All this without even a sniff of the police. In fact, you don't even see the cops again until the very end after all is said and done.***SPOILER DONE***Thankfully, by this point the movie gets back into gear with the Bacon vs. the Gang showdown. When the movie concentrates on the action and the vigilante angle, it works, which is why I give it a six. It's only when it takes time to breathe that it falls flat. If you like action, there's probably enough here to satisfy. If you like blood and gore, there's more than enough to satisfy. If you like logic...look elsewhere. If you're looking for a really good vigilante film...rent "Death Wish."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining harsh revenge story with a strong lead performance by Bacon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is living the good life as a loving father to his two teenage sons Lucas (Jordon Garrett) &amp; Brendan (Stuart Lafferty) and a loving husband as well to his wife Helen (Kelly Preston). When his oldest son Brendan was killed in a senseless crime in a gas station by a group of thugs. Nick attacked his son's killer (Matt O'Leary) and nearly escaping from Nick after he got hit by a car on the street. When Nick's son died in a hospital, he wants his son's killer to be sent to prison for life but there's no proof of the crime... since the murder weapon disappear and there was no surveillance camera at the gas station. Since the murderer will only get prison time for three to five years. Nick is very disturbed by the law's decision, he decides to take law in his own hands. When he attacks his son's killer and murdering him as well in a bad part of town. When the leader of the group named Billy (Garrett Hedlund) finds out by his gang that his brother was murdered. He and his gang decides to get personal revenge to kill Nick and his family.Directed by James Wan (Dead Silence, Saw) made an entertaining, mean-spirited thriller that has some truly suspenseful sequences and a few strong moments of violence. Bacon gives one of his best performances in the feature as the mild-executive worker, who decides to take the law in his hands without thinking the consequences. Director Wan proves that he could make any type of features than horror movies. "Death Sentence" is actually an sequel to "Death Wish 2". Which it's based on a novel by Brian Garfield. Although the character names have been changed and this movie takes place in North Carolina instead of Chicago. Also director Wan manages to have a few in-jokes of his previous work.DVD includes both versions of the movie, which is the original theatrical version and unrated version (Which is six minutes longer than the R-Rated cut and the conclusion is slightly changed). DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an making of a featurette (Which this feature shows how they made the best sequence of the movie, which involves "The Parking Garage" chase), an enjoyable long interview with actor:Bacon and ten webisodes. The only thing is missing in this DVD is an audio commentary by the director. Which he was very entertaining in the commentary track of "Saw", both R-Rated and Unrated."Death Sentence" was a box office disappointment, when it was released in the end of August (Which this movie was release the same day as "Rob Zombie's Halloween"). Most of the critics truly hated this movie too but "Death Sentence" is one of those features than the audiences will enjoy it more than anybody else. The film was a hit, when it was released on DVD. Wan's third film is certainly underrated and i would like to see what movie... he will directed next. Aisha Tyler appears in a decent supporting role as a Detective and John Goodman steals every scene as a sleazy gun/drug dealer. Leigh Whannell (Best known for playing Adam in "Saw") appears in a bit-part as one of Billy's thugs. Despite some unintentionally silly moments in a few scenes, "Death Sentence" is a razor-sharp thriller and it will probably found an loyal cult following of its own. Don't miss it. Super 35.

		<fullReview>Before saw this movie I kept thinking it would be another "shoot em up" disguised with a lousy story of revenge.I couldn't be more wrong, this movie may seem a bit generic at first but as the story progresses it simply develops into something very different. The argument and pace of the story development makes you feel like you never know whats gonna happen next, that combined with the big emotional and psychological part of the movie makes the movie interesting to watch right till the end.Secondly the cast does a great job in making the characters feel real and human, Kevin Bacon has one of his the best performances, and so does Jordan Garret, he is Lucas Hume in the movie.The action sequences are great, although a bit exaggerated in my opinion, Nick Hume simply has luck to many times during the movie, aside from that the action sequences are awesome. As a side note these action sequences are very violent which makes the movie feel even more genuine and real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Movie With Cool Style, And Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. The movie nearly made me want to cry at times, it is pretty moving. The first half of the movie is very emotional and intense. The third act of the movie is very a very straight forward revenge deal, which last kind of short, it lasts for at least 25 minutes or so, when Kevin Bacon goes on his quest for revenge. One thing I want to mention, is that I did not see the movie in the theater, I saw the movie on the Unrated DVD. And I can already tell that the Unrated version makes it a much better movie, I read about what the difference was between the Unrated version and Theatrical version. Its too bad that they cut out some really good scenes from the Theatrical version. This movie is really a throwback to revenge movies that were made in the 70's, and it kind of has that early 90's touch to it also which is cool. The movie is very violent, it is bloody and brutal, with some gore also. There's a part where a guy gets his leg shot off, and also a part where someone gets his fingers shot off, pretty greusome. There are a few brutal fights. People get shot in the head, blood spurting, bloody gunshot wounds. And the action itself is pretty cool and intense too. It really shows what a shotgun can do, you can see through a wall that a shotgun has shot at. That chase scene is pretty cool, when it shows the camera following Kevin Bacon through the parking garage, and the car drop, the movie had some good stunts. That shootout at the end is very good, it is very pleasing to see those ruthless degenerates get blown away after what they did to the main character. Its a very good guy and bad guy movie which you don't see to often these days. I like all that stuff when it shows the gang hanging out in their bar with the music playing, and it was cool seeing Kevin Bacon beat information out of people to find the people that he wants to kill. And i really liked the music in the movie too, which made the movie even more powerful, I do see why people think it is like a music video, but it worked well. I love the rock music in the movie by that band called the Black Angels. And I like that little emotional Hebrew music too, very powerful. And the movie also has a lot of swearing and F words, a lot of yelling. Some really good acting by the bad guys, John Goodman, Kevin Bacon. They really drew me into the movie. The music, the acting, the look and feel of the movie give me the chills. This movie seems like it is about life, and consequences, and it is strongly about family. And how the death of a family member can ruin family lives, and it turned out very moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? First of all, I was truly disturbed after watching "Death Sentence". Not only we have a great screenplay, which makes one dive into the movie, and a terrific sound-play, which enhances the movies best scenes in a great way, the movie also contains great acting, an awesome Kevin Bacon, who I truly enjoyed watching in this one (in contrast to his Hollow Man adventures, which I found terrible). The story really is kept to reality (well, at least in the beginning) and one can feel with the actors. Why I don't give it 10 out of 10? I did not like the end! That's it. But enjoy and be sure you read enough about it, before watching it. I think, it's one of the harshest movies, that I've ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the same make of Taxi Driver, this film is violent, brutal and engrossing. In this film you follow an everyman that step by step turns into a hardened vigilante after the death of his son. There are many surprising moments that make you care for the characters and everyone does a very good job with believable emotion and dialogue. As the movie rolls into an explosive ending, you really are rooting for the main character with every bullet fired. This film may not appeal to everyone, as it tries to be a dramatic action film, and will lose those looking only for a shoot 'em up, or a deeply intelligent story, however it does do a fine job of walking the high wire between each category and should be watched by anyone who appreciates a story with their gun play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't give action or drama-type of films a high rating, however this movie was far more enjoyable than i had imagined. From the beginning until the end it really had some good scenes that captivated the audience. This movie in my opinion, had the viewers tie in their personal emotion and challenged them to critically think what they would do if a crime was horribly committed upon their family. The obvious choice would be for revenge. Although this movie did have some violence, it had a good balanced mixture of drama and suspense. It was really captivating.I am not the biggest Kevin Bacon fan, but he really came through in his performance here. He played his role excellent and helped make this movie better than what i expected. Overall, a big thumbs way up for me!</fullReview>

Kevin bacon plays a great role, he is and always was a fantastic actor. i think the scene where Nicolas Hume and billy lie together on the bench is what you would call an ,,ok i give up you win, shoot me, do what you will, 'cause i'm beat, i can't take it anymore'' scene. it was marvelous...the soundtrack was also amazing...it kinda'reminded me of fight club...everything...even the fact that Kevin got shot in the end in the neck...and he didn't die, not right on the spot anyway...he did what he had to do and after he heard that his son was doing better and managed to move his fingers, he died in peace watching the tape where he and his family were all together laughing...the song ,,alright'' by pilot speed was extraordinary and resembles the idea captured by placebo in the song ,,where is my mind''...i'd really give it a ten...great acting, great actors, scenes, script, lines like : ,,u ready?'' in the end when billy had to die...very to the point...by the way i never thought of john Goodman as a bad guy...however he fitted perfectly in the skin of a weapon dealer...IF YOU DIDN'T SEE IT, SEE IT...JUST LIKE THAT...i liked it more than Goodfelllas really, or even CASINO...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After he finds that justice system does little for him, Nick Hume(Kevin Bacon) goes out to destroy gang members that murdered his son. When he decides to take the matter into his own hands, he enters a world that he may not have been prepared to deal with, but that he nonetheless will see through.The story does somewhat follow what the 70's brought us in Death Wish. Since Brian Garfield wrote Death Wish and the novel of this movie, it should be no surprise.Kevin Bacon is an underrated actor. Just watching his face go through 30 different configurations of emotions in a span of 10 minutes is a slice of his pliability. His transformation from family man to scum hunter is not to be missed. Even if it can't happen here in our ho-hum life, Bacon has the tendency to make things not suck, and makes it almost completely believable.The action scenes are on the ball. The chase scene through alleyways and parking garages were intense, with perfect camera movement. Much of the action has a method to it that allows you to see effectively and clearly what's going, regardless of the amount of chaos. You are never lost as to who went where. Even the winding, twisting pathways of a broken down building will never confuse you as to where the good guy and bad guys are. This proves to me that Director Wan and team had an eye for this kind of stuff, with the audience in mind.Don't miss John Goodman playing something along the lines of his acting from The Big Lebowski. As an owner of a hardware shop with criminal activity, his actions in the film should leave you wondering a bit about how people like him do the things they do. In many ways, he's the opposite of the main character, and yet, in one pivotal moment in the film, he and Nick will exchange something far beyond bullets. Hell, I even liked Garrett Hedlund, who played the leader of the gang.Let's face it. Not everyone likes old-fashioned revenge movies, but it certainly doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Go on over to one of the worst movie sites on the net, Rotten Tomatoes, and you will see that most critics hated this movie. Naturally, I felt that if the critics hated a movie with Kevin Bacon in it, directed by James Wan, and had a Death Wish feel about it, then it MUST be a good movie for me. Critics forget that audiences love the themes of good vs bad, good goes after bad, bad gets it in the end. Revenge movies like this don't need good acting to get in the way of an enjoyable action film, but it just so happens that Death Sentence delivers it well enough.Rent the DVD. The unrated version gives more to the characters and storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, the best action thriller in a while!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KEVIN BACON stars as NICK HUME, a mild mannered executive with a wonderful family life that is one night shattered, when his oldest boy is killed during a robbery at a gas station. Determined to get revenge on the thugs who did it, Nick takes out the gang one by one, but when the gang figures out who's putting their friends away, they attack his family, leaving his wife dead, his son hospitalized &amp; Nick with loads of injuries, now Nick is mad, really mad! &amp; determined to more than ever to put the remaining punks out of the way, even if it means his own death. DEATH SENTENCE is a dark violent vigilante picture that bears a striking resemblance to the CHARLES BRONSON vehicle DEATH WISH, there's so much here that makes one remember that 1974 film very well, it's cold depiction of murder &amp; the two lead characters are almost mirror images of each other, friendly business men turned vigilantes following the death of one of their loved ones. That out of the way, DEATH SENTENCE proves there may still be life after all in the usually dull action genre. The film is very well written &amp; acted, not to mention directed brilliantly by JAMES WAN who continues to impress this critic with his obviously gifted directing talent &amp; DEATH SENTENCE may be his best one yet! The characters are well written, the family lovable, the criminals extra hateful &amp; the film has plenty of action to keep action fans happy. KEVIN BACON was an excellent choice to play Nick &amp; is really believable in his role. Despite some silly situations, the film is highly recommended to action fans &amp; so much better than what passes for action entertainment these days &amp; deserved to do better at the box office than what it did. Lots of suspense too, that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. See it!**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly one of the most depressing and gripping drama's I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, vengeance done right.When I initially saw the trailer for this film I was waiting for the word's "Max Payne" to flash across the screen when it was finished, but after watching this cinematic experience I was mistaken. I thought I would be seeing the cookie cutter "Spouse watches spouse/child die, then goes on quest for revenge as a bad mother f*****". I was so wrong that I should punch myself in the face for even thinking that.When I saw that it was directed by the man who brought us the extremely overrated "Saw", I was honestly just expecting a boring story of revenge. But, alas, another folly of my mind. This movie wowed me in every way that a movie it's genre can. It brought an amazing performance from Kevin Bacon as an average Joe who goes through an absolutely horrifying event. With a lot of revenge movies, you never really get to relate or feel what the hero is feeling, you just kind of watch and smile as revenge is exacted. Bacon's acting brought forward the thought that he was really the father of that boy, and that he really saw him killed. He really didn't know how to react to that situation, but when he discover's that the justice system is ruling in favor of the killer, he realizes that he has to take action. The only way a real father could.The acting from every member of the cast was done very well. All the actors pulled off the character they portrayed very well. The family was very close, very loving. The police were realistic and apprehensive when the death of the gang members started happening. The gangsters were cruel, heartless, and foulmouthed as most urban youth are today. The leader Billy(played marvelously by Garrett Hedlund) was a coldblooded, but at the same time heartbroken antagonist after Bacon kills his brother Joey. The retribution at this point had to be exacted from both sides.The soundtrack for this film was very emotional and very atmospheric always matching up with the situation at hand. The emotional, sad parts had very subtle, yet depressing tones to the music. The chases and action were accompanied by a very fast paced intense tone. The use of the song "Alright" by Pilot Speed was an amazing choice to end the film.One of the film's best accomplishments in my opinion had to go to the camera work. Wan knew what he was doing when he filmed every scene of this movie. From the 5 minute chase scene filmed with one extended shot, to the gun fights near the finale, everything was done superbly. When you get so into the film you never really notice how complicated some camera shot's can truly be. Not since Children Of Men, have I watched a chase scene so marvelously edited and filmed.Now onto what everyone would expect from the man who directed Saw, the violence. I would not call it over the top by any means. The perfect word for it is brutal. Unflinchingly brutal. You feel every cut, every bullet. At times, you look and say "That's probably what would happen if you did that". From the head shot on the couch, to the lower leg removal, and the elbow shot, all were done with fantastic physical accuracy.My absolute favorite part of this movie was the final confrontation between Bacon and Hedlund in the asylum's chapel. He(Hedlund) tells Bacon how he had turned him into a monster, that "You look like one of us". Now when I watched this film, I was with two other guys who were telling Bacon to blow his brains out and "shoot out his knees", but I absolutely loved how Wan ended the movie. It was incredibly subtle and down to earth. You don't get to see Billy die, you just see them sit next to each other and then it shows Bacon walking down the stairs of the mental hospital. Then to him sitting inside his house to watch the video of him with his family.Director's need to seriously take a hint from movie's like this. Death Sentence might not have been the blockbuster that it should have been, but it is just as amazing, gripping, and tragic as any film you are likely to have seen in 2007. 10 out of 10. Hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you are looking for a movie which has plenty of violence mixed with a bit of gore then look no further. i'm told the novel on which this movie is based is the sequel to the classic revenge thriller death wish released in the 70's &amp; starring Charles Bronson. if like me, you enjoyed that movie then you will love this. kevin bacon stars &amp; is outstanding as always &amp; is always better when he is playing a psycho!!. the rest of the cast support very well with john Goodman doing an unfamiliar turn as the bad guys' dad &amp; very good he is too! also garret hedlund who plays billy is very powerful as the movies main nutcase. all of the other bad guys could have been taken from real gangs as they are so nasty. anyway this is a good Friday night film to see with your girl or your mates and the soundtrack is haunting especially the song at the end scene. the subject matter is quite harrowing but it is very satisfying watching a mild mannered man transform into the vigilante we would all like to become after the events put before him in this movie. all in all a top film directed by one of Hollywood's most promising new directors James wan who is not afraid to push the gore &amp; explicit violence to the limit.

		<shortDescription>A heart-thumping sentence with a gritty realistic full stop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence sees Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) as a normal father in a family of four living a peaceful life until he witnesses the death of his son at the hands of an underground drug dealing gang. It takes the audience through the normal procedure of a revenge film, but instead of ending with a hero on the horizon silhouetted by a cliché sunset, it gives the viewers a pinch of reality.The action was maybe not the best, and at some points a little unbelievable considering Hume was no more than an ordinary businessman, but it is all for the sake of making the movie actually enjoyable. After all, if it was 100% real, Hume would probably have been killed 20 minutes into the film.However, what struck me most apart from the gritty action and the well structured progression of the movie, was the subtle hints that life is not all glory, the equation does not always balance out, and a man who kills a killer is no more than the killer himself.Kevin Bacon is perfect for his role, with his less-than-Diesel (A Man Apart) stature and his less-than-Jane (The Punisher) coolness. This imperfection in the hero lies not only in his appearance but in his fate.The process in which he seeks revenge is clouded by guilt, doubt and hesitation, and although James Wan does put in a couple of eye-to-camera scenes to depict a changed man, the journey there is a hard one. The outcome of Hume's actions are also very gritty and realistic. Going on the belief that he has lost everything, it is believable that Hume can give everything in the climax. The ending however, when Hume discovers his son is in fact alive, only goes to show that what he did was not a clear cut morally correct choice, and for that he loses out in raising his son, and damages his son's future significantly.This movie not only contains thrilling action sequences, but also pleasantly surprises the viewers by ending a somewhat-clichéd yet heart-thumping sentence with a gritty realistic full stopI recommend this film to all those who watch action film after action film and are tired of the glorified Hollywood endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What relieve it is to finally see a great movie after all the crap that came in the form of movies this year. This movie about a quiet, reserved and happy family man whose family is torn apart by the murder of his oldest son, has a breathtaking pace. It is not at any time boring. There are more quiet scenes that deal with loss of the son therefore with the grief of the family members that are left behind. I personally think that these scenes are very convincing and could bring those with a soft spot to tears even. I loved Kevin Bacon in this picture and I would say that the development of his character from a family man to revenge seeking monster is very convincing. As I do not live in the states I can not comment on how realistic certain situations are concerning police work in particular as stated in other comments and by my feeling I would say that there a some scenes that could not go down like this in real life. That why I could not give a ten for this one.One a more personal note I would like to say that I loved the way the self-justice is carried out in this piece although I am not at all a pro violence kind of guy. But damned it felt good seeing justice brought onto these people. And after all it is cinema isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was an excellent, thought provoking, gripping story of revenge and fearlessness in the light of protecting a mans family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of the movie could mean many things, for example the father giving his sons killer the death sentence. Death Sentence also refers to the price the father pays for exacting revenge.What stands out about this movie is the fine line between an ordinary upstanding citizen and a person who goes over the edge to commit something as horrendous as murder. It is almost impossible to feel sorry for Brandons murderer but ethically what Hume did was wrong. The difficulty would therefore be reconciling that incident in our mind and trying to find what would be the right way to handle something like the senseless murder of a child.The justice system was obviously going to fail Hume so what does he do as a father whose role is to protect his child?The movie was brilliant as it evoked an emotional response while grappling with ethical and moral convictions. Worth every cent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge Rarely Comes Without Yet Another Reaction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very appealing because it's a revenge tale directed by James Wan, who brought us the undeniably mortifying and redefiningly intense horror film Saw. I had looked at Wan as a brilliant new talent, because with Saw, he nailed every step when it came to mood and atmosphere in the streaming marriage of cinematography and music, where most directors never pinpoint that precise tone in a horror film. When I saw Death Sentence, I found that not only is Wan cerebrally remarkable at scaring us but he's just the same at making us feel angry and vengeful. However, I also learned that he has a whole lot of maturing to do.His villains are so impressively terrible. They are introduced with an ominous scariness as they fly down an urban neighborhood road at high speed without their headlights on, and the feeling that comes with it is definitely suited later as we become filled with hate at these pure monsters. The hero is so sympathetic and sensitive, with a deeply realized performance from Kevin Bacon, who perceptively portrays his character's metamorphosis as more of a drawing out of his hidden inner character. For the first forty-five minutes, we are riveted by the film's handling of the story. The early scenes of vindictive gratification are so unbelievably fulfilling and satisfying that it becomes your own vindictive fantasy. However, it simply runs completely out of steam, or more correctly, it wipes all of the remaining steam out of the way and lays down the same old, eroding, overused bricks of story for the last act of the film.Drama becomes a completely insensitively portrayed thing of time management to build toward the obligatory climactic showdown where the avenging character classically alters his appearance that sheds the masquerade of his former self. Things happen amongst the good guy and the cops (that don't ever really seem to catch up with these villains when really with the high profile they keep it would be quite easy) and amongst the bad guys, and on both ends, these things are stupid, because they are simply working from cell memory of other movies of its kind.In the end, Death Sentence, a film that, like many misfires, could've been so much better had it not contrived itself for the sake of the tried and true path, is designed for the same preteens and older kids that something like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning was designed for. It's designed for the expected pay-off and really nothing else. If only it hadn't blue-balled me with those thrilling earlier scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bacon's Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is sort of a comeback for Kevin Bacon. He has an interesting career, as an actor who makes eclectic choices and is not known for showing up in crowd pleasers. He manages to score in both areas time with a movie where can flex his acting muscles and does a fantastic job, showing his usual range. His avenging father goes through the usual physical demands, with Bacon showing that a man in his forties can excel in this type of work. Bacon also displays amazing emotional range, from despair to absolute wrath, and that is pretty impressive.The film is exciting and much better than most people can expect. Its director, fully capable of showing a domestic scene, switching into frantic action scenes, and never losing track of a decent storyline. Bacon, Preston, and the rest of the supporting cast all do decent work in a story that takes us through some hellish moments.The main ideas behind the film is how random violence is, how tragic some of the actions caused by people who have lost their ability to be human impact the rest of us. The most interesting aspect of the film release is probably its timing as it competes with another story of violence and retribution.The director of the "Saw" films proves the story's main point and shows he can put together a fairly entertaining tale, one that is not known for its subtlety but for its good story, its fine execution, and its ability to teach its audience a thing or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Turf War Between Morality, Sentiment, and Vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether James Wan deserves credit or condemnation at this point: I liked his direct-to-video renegade, "Saw," even though it kick-started one of the most regrettable cinematic trends in recent memory. With "Death Sentence," the director is on the once-fertile ground sown by the likes of "Dirty Harry" and "Death Wish" back in the 1970s?to his credit, this vigilante flick (given a strong backbone by Kevin Bacon) hearkens back to that era with unflinching reverence while juxtaposing a family's dissolve in the process.That's not to say "Death Sentence" isn't problematic in ways that afflicted the '70s templates?and in ways uniquely its own. Nick Hume (Bacon), a successful corporate exec with the idyllic suburban life?loving wife Helen (Kelly Preston), hockey-star son Brendan (Stuart Lafferty), and his younger brother Lucas (Jordan Garrett)?is shattered when Brendan becomes the victim of a gang initiation. When he is informed his killer will only get a few years tops for the vile deed, Nick decides to let the creep go in order to enact the type of eye-for-an-eye vengeance that suits the crime. And it really is a testament to Bacon's talents that Nick does not falter as a character, despite the abundant contradictions and inconsistencies in the script.The original "Death Wish" was a slickly-produced yet shallow film?after the opening minutes (just enough time to establish the wholesomeness of Paul Kersey and his family), the rape/murder perpetrated by savage thugs is designed to carry and justify a 90-minute killing spree. The movie was just slick enough to carry a low-level visceral thrill, even if the side-effects of vigilantism were ignored (or, in some cases, glorified). Bronson's Paul Kersey became such an icon of cold stoicism that the series survived four sequels that became increasingly exaggerated caricatures of themselves."Death Sentence," however, spends more time with the family and how the American Dream is affected in the face of a random, seemingly unbelievable tragedy. Bacon brings a very personal angle to his role, and there are several excellent scenes of his pale, emaciated body breaking into a cold sweat behind his desk at work that feel...well, real. Even when he descends into a cartoon version of his former self in the film's final half, being thrust into situations more and more unbelievable, the tarnished, guilty shadow of the happy-go-lucky Everyman remains.But therein lies the problem. The more "Death Sentence" descends into desaturated, graphic-novel thrills (complete with over-the-top CG bloodbursts), the more the setups feel like a betrayal of what came before: when the gang stages a brutal home invasion, slaying Helen and mortally wounding Lucas, it comes off as an action sequence concluded with a twangy, sentimental song. The subsequent moments of tenderness Nick shares with Lucas and gun dealer Bones (John Goodman in a scene-stealing cameo) are well-intentioned, but come off as out-of-place, since the film has already submerged its dramatic intentions with increasingly implausible action. I kept thinking of "Ransom," where Mel Gibson was sent on a contrived scavenger hunt by the extortionist holding his son hostage; that film also suffered from the tug-of-war between implausible scenarios and the raw presentation of human anguish as it tripped toward a happy ending that rang false.Despite the hard-to-ignore discrepancy between drama and over-the-top action, "Death Sentence" shows Wan capably directing his action and actors. Early on, there is a brilliant sequence where Nick is pursued through alleyways, a restaurant kitchen, and finally to the upper levels of a parking garage, a mix of dolly shots and hand-held work that puts us so well "in the moment" that I felt as winded as Hume looked by the conclusion. The opening murder is filmed with the visceral, hand-held urgency of an embedded reporter in a war zone, and indeed feels like the horrifying, helpless ambush it is. And the closing chase?with Hume decked out in his dead son's jacket and sporting a "gang" haircut?is a grimy, almost pitch-dark adrenaline rush. Wan's use of modest costume design (even on the gang members), few "modern" touches (the use of cell phones), and a color palate so desaturated that this is nearly a "black and white" film (with MANY uses of red, unironically), almost pulls the viewer back to the days of squalid '70s cinema."Death Sentence" does often feel like a slicker, somewhat more righteous cousin to the low-down, grungy, morally bipolar likes of "The Exterminator" and "Vigilante." Needless to say, it works best when it tries to invoke the morally ambiguous tone of its forebears?but unfortunately, "Death Sentence" leaves us anticipating the amped-up action scenes, if only to sufficiently distract us from its overwrought attempts to pile drama onto a scenario that leaves the bounds of allowable realism. Yet despite all this, Bacon will keep you watching, even as the film comes to a contrived ending that would not work were he not in the scene.5.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, Disturbing and Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is in the vein of Death Wish. A father, Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) becomes outraged at the death of his son to a local gang. He is driven to vigilante justice which has an increasingly violent affect on him and his family. This movie has a slow pace and it gives the viewer time to soak in the emotions and the horror of the violence. In that sense it is very disturbing and creates a sense of hopelessness. The violence escalates bringing unexpected events and very graphic and horrifying visuals. Because of the very real mood to the movie, the violence can be very disturbing. The only hope conveyed in the movie is through passages of music which occasionally become a focus.Except for an occasional unlikely and implausible bit of dialog here and there, the movie is very cohesive. In many ways it is a throwback to the way movies were made in the 70's. Kevin Bacon does an excellent job. John Goodman has a very strong and impressive role as a bad guy. It spotlights a side you don't see in most of his other films.This movie is a solid 7 on a scale of 1-10. If you don't get bored with a slow pacing or if you like excessive and graphic violence, then it easily could earn a higher rating.This movie is suited for viewing either in the theater or at home. If you are a fan of Kevin Bacon or very violent movies, then the DVD is worth buying. If not, hold out and just rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a book by the author of the original "Death Wish" novel, eh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I remember reading that sequel. In it, Paul Kirsey went hunting for a copycat Vigilante in the Windy City. But, just like all four sequels to the legendary Charles Bronson movie-version, this adaptation is completely different in plot.Instead of a transplanted Manhattan architect who served in the Korean War, we have a Columbia, South Carolina insurance agent who has to read instruction manuals supplied by a back-alley gun dealer. Instead of a married daughter who's also an only child, we have one pair of teenage sons. And, instead of two junkie home invaders (an alarming new concept back in 1974!), we have a street gang faking a gas station robbery as a form of "initiation" for their leader's younger brother.Resulting in the death of Nick Hume's older son, Brendan.From that point on, we see Nick's gut-wrenchingly sympathetic moral downfall. At first, everyone in the audience thinks he's crazy for not sending Brendan's killer to prison. After all; five years is better than nothing! Right? But, when we see to what lengths Bill Darley (the psychopathic, drug dealing street gang leader) is willing to go to get revenge for his younger brother's death, at Nick Hume's hands, we quickly realize it would have made no difference.Bill Darley would have been just as crazy in his harassment of the Hume family, in order to keep his younger brother from spending even five _seconds_ in prison.The big showdown between Nick and the Darley gang is somewhat predictable, yet still exciting. And, the plot twist involving the identity of the gun dealer (played by John Goodman) is brilliantly unexpected! The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a perfect ten, however, is the unrealistic lack of proper action by the cops when Nick sneaks out of the hospital.NOBODY notices and reports a man in bandages and a hospital gown walking toward a picturesque suburb in the rain? The lead detective places NO ONE on guard at the Hume house, following Nick's escape? NO APB is issued for his car's license plate? His bank accounts are NOT frozen, to prevent him from buying guns?But, admittedly, that's all nitpicking. I still enjoyed this movie, as it literally kept me at the edge of my seat. And, you can't ask more from a revenge-thriller than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hell of a thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vengeance is served cold in this volatile thriller from the director that brought us Saw.Death Sentence is the Story of everyday family-man Nick Hume. He has a loving wife Helen, two active sons Brandon and Lucas, and a well paying executive job. Life seems to be treating Nick well, until one night while on the back from a victorious hockey game, Nick and Brandon stop at a broken-down gas station in the middle of a bad neighborhood. While Brandon goes in to get something to drink, a group of wild thugs dash in and shoot the clerk and then execute Brandon in cold blood. After the crazed criminals leave, Nick rushes to his son's aid, only to find out it's too late. With his son six feet under, Nick's next move is to put one of the thugs left behind at the scene behind bars for the rest of his life, but to Nick's great misfortune, the punk would only get six months, due to the fact there were no witnesses. With this, Nick decides to take justice into his own hands and make sure that the misfits responsible would pay in blood for the death of his son.Death sentence was a great thrill ride from the emotional opening credits to the chilling conclusion. This is a flawed movie, however, but that's only a small aspect of the film. Alright let's talk about the good, which is a lot: Great performances by Garrett Hedlund, John Goodman(even though he has a very small part), and of course as always, Kevin Bacon. The cinematography in the gritty action sequences was absolutely brilliant and done with great skill. The violence was extreme... extremely great! Lots of blood and gore for any violence junkie who looking for a fix, but then again if your the kind of moviegoer who's squeamish about things like that, then you better avoid Death Sentence.There are only two things wrong with this movie: Some of the performances by the other actors/actresses were a bit melodramatic and sometimes unbelievable, and the writing wasn't good at some points; things that would make you think: that would never happen in real life". But that's okay, because movies like this one always have flaws likes these. Death Sentence is for sheer entertainment purposes only, it's not a piece of art.In the end this was a hell of a thriller. Definitely one worth seeing if you're into dark, violent, revenge thrillers. I know I'm going to get this one on DVD.My recommendations: Man on Fire, Out For Justice, Death Wish, Payback, Four Brothers, The Punisher, The Crow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film resonated with me. If you have ever known the pain of losing someone you love, the beginning of this movie will cause you to relive that pain. The movie is about post-traumatic stress syndrome, and the depth of retaliation possible from someone who has nothing left to lose. To those that complain that there are gaps in credibility in this movie, I must recommend the "suspension of disbelief" which should accompany you to the theater. I don't go to watch the crime spot on the news, I go to feel and be entertained. John Goodman was excellent in his role as a low-life drug and arms dealer. His character added a touch of humor to an otherwise "edge of your seat" action movie. If you have a weak stomach I would consider skipping this movie. The "R" rating is for violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't perfect but I think most people would like it. I think what sets this apart from other movies of a similar nature are a few things, mostly to do with the character. 1st, this is the first movie I've ever seen Kevin Bacon in that I felt he really met his full potential as an actor. He and the director worked together wonderfully to create a character that didn't feel wooden or generic and the focus of the movie is on him. There's only two or three scenes in the movie that aren't shown from the main character's viewpoint. 2nd, his character is human and while he thinks quickly on his feet sometimes, he makes some bad decisions based on his emotions that lead to things...getting out of hand (don't want to spoil things). But as his character says, you don't know how you'll react to a situation until it happens. 3rd, the movie is far more realistic than most 'revenge' stories. As much as I like most movies of this nature it was nice to see one where there are real consequences to his choices. 4th, the action in the movie was very visceral and gritty, not flashy or pretty like far too many movies. Overall the acting was excellent (not just Kevin Bacon but everyone) and the script writing was just as good. The music was very effective at establishing the proper mood. As for the director, I'm coming to enjoy his movies more and more. I think he likes telling an interesting story. If he was out there for the money he'd be directing all the Saw sequels instead of just producing them. This movie didn't get very good publicity and I think the cover art was poorly done (I'd seen the cover in the video store and it inspired zero interest in me, luckily I saw a preview and gave it a shot). Overall I'd like to see more people watching this movie. This is the first movie I've ever gone to the effort of commenting on in the hopes of encouraging people to give it a shot. It's a shame the production company didn't put more of an effort into marketing it.</fullReview>

Some people enjoy either *surreal movie* like James bond or *realistic movie* . But a movie most of the time can't deliver both , without failing somewhere.That where death sentence tried .But it's was the most plausible try i have seen thus far.The police part and our hero skill being the *surreal part* .But if tomorrow your family was killed .You have that feeling that if you went completely mad.That could pretty much be like this and you would feel like our hero.LIke .

Bacon performed here and i could really feel his anger and disgust.Yet at the same wondering what the hell you're doing.The Police in this movie serve no purpose whatsoever.Personnaly i would had cut them from the movie and focus a little more on other aspect.It's could be him , trying to find help or our hero training his marksmanship or whatever.He had no planning whatsoever .If you can withstand a movie trying to be both at the same time . While sacrificing some of the other.This movie might be for you.But if you're going to hint every surreal aspect (thing that could possibly not happens in life , like a complete and useless police , than no this movie won't be for you.The end was pretty clever.I loved it . This movie without the police would have been much much much better.John Goodman had a really small role.Although i enjoyed each small scene he was in.</fullReview>

The violence was superb 10/10 and the plot is great and it is well just a good movie. It did get a bit sad when Billy I think his name is shot Nick's wife and kid. I think one part was funny when Nick fired the shotgun at the man and he crashed out the window then shot the other guy and blew off his leg. Perfect movie, perfect violence and a perfect storyline. This movie deserves a good 10/10. I was going to get Sweeney Todd but when it was sold out I got this instead. 10/10 This movie deserves</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good thriller, great performance from Kevin Bacon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence is the typical vengeance movie where a person loses a love one and does everything he can to take revenge. This movie is a thriller that doesn't bring new things but that fulfills its purpose of entertaining with lots of action, drama and suspense. The story its about Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a mild-mannered executive with a perfect life, until one gruesome night he witnesses something that changes him forever and eventually comes to the disturbing conclusion that no length is too great when protecting his family, is kinda predictable but also interesting. The cast is particularly good, Kevin Bacon delivers a powerful performance, John Goodman with another excellent acting job, Kelly Preston has a good supporting role and Garrett Hedlund was wonderful as Billy Darley. In conclusion, this movie teach us that vengeance never brings something good to people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller-coaster ride of violence without an end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fixed in my cinema chair watching the movie in thrill and excitement waiting for a pause in the violence which didn't come. Simply excellent craftsmanship of the director. Where most movies try to accommodate the broader audience and 'choose' to mellow down the violence and put in a love story, in the process messing up the movie, this masterpiece doesn't. If you hate movies where the actual story is morphed by the (all-time killer) man-woman love element or morally drenched speeches (like Pearl Harbor) you'll love this!! Moreover, aside from being totally kick-ass visually this movie serves the intellect much better than those dull movies. I would distill the moral underline of the movie (like in Death wish) as asking the philosophical questions: what is justice? who is responsible for justice (the people or the state)? and what is the answer to violence? I could only describe this masterpiece as raw avant-garde creativity with a kick, WELL DONE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason i gave it a 9 out of 10 was because of some of the unrealistic parts about the movie, but even they can be overlooked due to the absolute top notch acting. Kevin Bacon brought us every emotion up and down the scale...effortlessly and Kelly Preston did a great job at conveying, what i think most wives would feel.comfort and understanding at one of the lowest points in your spouses life. Garrett Hedlund that played Billy, is frighteningly scary good at playing the bad ass-ed punk. It scares one to even think about people like that in our world, and the fact that we do makes his performance all the more creepy. It has been sooo long since i saw a movie with such great acting...everyone should see this, if only to see how a movie should be acted. Well Done!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of those people who's naive enough to believe if you tell the police you are killing people, they arrest you. Apparently not, as long as the ones you are killing are criminals, police don't arrest you for confessing.This movie is horrible anyway... it's only good for video games fans who like it ultra-violent and nonsensical. It's a melodrama without any character development, a paper thin storyline serving as an excuse to show a lot of bloodshed for thrill-seeking acne-ridden teenagers.Did I mention it was also morally twisted. We'd all be out killing each others off until no one is left standing if we'd follow the patterns of the main character. The whole pretext for this relentless killing is also non-existent, the short courthouse part of this melodrama is absolutely unconvincing and false. There is no way the lawyer could come to those conclusions, knowing the facts at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon did it again in this movie by showing his superb talent and versatility playing the role of Nick Hume a professional business man who turns vigilante after his sons murder. Bacon shows once more how he can completely take on the role and match it to a perfect T. The action and storyline in this movie is exquisite and very rarely does a movie like this comes along. Kevin Bacon is in my opinion one of the finest actors in the business he can go from playing a mentally retarded man (Digging to China) to the perfect bad guy (Joe Hickey in trapped) from kind of the Nutty Val from tremors to now Nick Hume. This man is a living legend and I rank him higher than Nickolson and Shwartzanegger and they are 2 of my favorites but nobody can change characters as well as Bacon and Dustin Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Charlie Bronson when you need him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's genre of movies that most movie goers just can't get enough of and that's vigilante movies. These can range from classics like "Death Wish" or to big budget ones like "The Punisher"; but I think viewers love watching heroes transform into villains, crossing the line between good and bad or judgment and revenge. Unfortunately, this film has hard time capturing this aspect."Death Sentence" is just one of those movies with a straight forward plot. Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) falls victim to watching his son being murdered in a gang initiation. After realizing the legal system would fail him, he took matters into his own hands as he hunts downs and kills his son's assailant. This incites and war between him, the gang with the rest of his family caught in the middle.The main problem was the poor transformation of Bacon's character. It just wasn't there and I had a hard time taking him seriously. Bacon has played evil/bad characters before (i.e., "Sleepers") so it was more the writing than the acting. Bacon seemed frantic, out of control, inexperienced and just plain sloppy. Near the end of the movie, Hume had to read instruction manuals on how to load a double-barreled shotgun and a .45 caliber pistol while fumbling with his bullets, then 10 minutes later he was setting down gang members like dominos and reloading his weapon with amazing grace.Also, the implausibility factor was out of control. The gang initiation killing took place at gas station in the most run down part of town (with no working CCTV cameras of course), as Hume stopped for gas immediately as his "low fuel" light comes on and after being nearly run off the road by two suspicious muscle cars. He could of easily drove another 10-15 miles to another well-lit and feasible gas station. That's probably nit-picking, but it doesn't stop you from scratching your head and thinking "What is this guy doing?" And of course, the local police were again taking a blind eye to the recent spike in violence. After Hume kills his son's assailant, the local detective doesn't even bother to question him even after she notices Hume with a bandaged hand. Not to mention that before Hume goes on his final killing spree, he escapes the hospital in a gown, goes back home and empties his back account. Were the police on strike that day? As mentioned before, it seems Hume never seems to know what he's doing or how to take care of himself until he needs to do so, prompting some pretty decent action sequences. Most of the scenes are well scripted and choreographed that actually pretty tense, which leads me to believe that was the true purpose of the film: to move along and get to the killing quickly as possible."Death Sentence" was somewhat disappointing within its genre, and probably more disappointing to the average movie goer. It just sped along too quick, failed on making Bacon a believable vigilante and the implausibilities and plot holes were too much of a distraction. I'd wait for it to show up at your local Wal-Mart's bargain bin before venturing out to this see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak mechanical revenge thriller almost becomes something great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon's son is killed by a gang during a robbery. Vowing Revenge he hunts down and kills the person responsible. Unfortunately for him the gang decides to declare war and ups the ante by going after his family. Good but not great revenge thriller is a bit of a disappointment in that it really could have been better had things not been so bleak and mechanical. Based upon-really in name only-the sequel to the novel of Death Wish.this film feels like a weak attempt at updating the original. Watching the film I was amazed at how such a well made thriller could be so utterly devoid of life. To be certain the pieces work, the chase by the gang through the parking garage is extremely well staged, however the bits never really connect to any of the others in anyway other than as a connect the dots sort of way. A goes to B then on to C and so forth. Its a shame since the intensity of the performances give some sense of what it might be like to be in the situations depicted. Of course its doubtful that a police detective would be either willing to go along or stupid enough not to catch on to what The Kevin Bacon character was up to. Probably an hour in I was wondering why I was bothering to remain watching since I was not being drawn into the film and was watching it just for the violence. Wait for cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my goodness, I had to see it at a Monday's preview. It was really terrible. The last 15 minutes are not that bad. But all the rest of this movie is cheap kitsch. It fulfills all the clichés a really bad movie has to. At first, there is a glad family, without any fears or threats. Then a really bad guy kills the first son. (Its all filmed with sad piano or pop music. It reminds at Titanic or Pearl Harbor). Then the poor and struck down father starts to kill the bad guys. But they strike back. He even loses his wife. (Thats where I started to cry) Now the director tried to make a cool movie out of it. He gave him a few guns and let all the bad guys die. These scenes looked not bad.. they were even funny and had even style. But that doesn't compensate for the rest. And when the end comes, there is the father watching family videos and the a police officer, who nearly understands his revenge. And the dialogs... Great. Great.. 2 words to sum up: Chlich?, Kitsch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree do not listen to critics! This movie was amazingly well made, and so much more than just a "revenge" movie. It should really resonant with anyone living in a major city (like Philly, where I live) who is familiar with the cities ongoing and unrelenting violence. It wasn't unnecessarily violent like so many others are, and it didn't downplay either the murders committed by the gang or the revenge killings by the father. Its brutally realistic, and there are no simply answers. None of the characters are completely right or wrong, it enters a gray area that should make the audience think about the violence that plagues our US cities. It also makes the audience wonder what they would do if someone they loved had been murdered in such a fashion, how far can we be pushed? This movie is also very well cast Kevin Bacon is great as Hume and Garrett Hedlund is so good at being "bad-guy" Billy Darley, its nice to see him play something other than the pretty boy hero and that he is evolving as an actor which hopefully Hollywood will recognize. Hopefully people will decide to make up their own minds and actually see this movie instead of listening to some pretentious guy with a pen who most likely has now idea what it's like on America's city streets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is a mild mannered executive who works for an insurance firm. He has a wife and two sons, one of whom is grown up and has dreams of becoming a professional ice hockey player. But those dreams are shattered one night when an armed gang storm a gas station and kill him. When the one responsible goes free, Nick goes to confront him- and ends up killing him. Justice has been served in his eyes- but the gang won't take one of their own being killed lying down, and in his moment's haste, Nick has now placed himself and his family in serious danger.The most well-known film James Wan had directed prior to this was the grisly horror Saw. But rather than a gory slasher film, here he has a juicier, stronger plot to sink his teeth into, with a great narrative flow to it that keeps you hooked right to the end.One of the strongest things going for Death Sentence is Kevin Bacon's superb performance in the lead role, perfectly convincing as a man sheltered from violence and feelings of vengefulness all his life who is now trapped in a situation where he desperately struggles to manage these feelings with that of the respectable persona he's managed up till now, as well as beautifully conveying his struggle to deal with the consequences of his actions afterwards.The film manages a generally raw, intense feel through-out, with plenty of unflinchingly brutal, blood drenched violence and some hard hitting action, including a fantastic on foot chase sequence that begins on a city street, goes through some back alleys, a kitchen, into a parking lot and then onto the roof, which ends with a seat edge action sequence involving a car going over a roof.With all the flimsy 12A stuff being churned out nowadays, it's great to know that action films like Death Sentence are still around. If anything lets it down, it's the ending, which is a bit iffy and unconvincing considering everything else that's happened. But that shouldn't take away from this being a great film that's well worth seeing and a great reflection on people's attitudes at the moment towards the law failing them. ****</fullReview>

He makes such amazing films and makes you want sit at the edge of your seat. Saw 1 was the best because we didn't know what to expect and a lot of people say the first movie is always the best.Overall i'd recommend this film to anyone who likes Kevin bacon and Saw 1,2,3,4.

		<fullReview>Nick Hume has a great life. A secure job with great benefits, two wonderful boys and a beautiful woman for a wife, life can't get any better. Things can only get worse.After picking up his eldest Brenden from practise, they stop at a gas station; here Nick's life is about to be changed forever as his son is gunned down with little remorse by a vicious gang led by a feared gang banger named Billy Darley. Nick finds the justice system a joke when the killer is only expected to serve four or five years. Nick now must take the law into his own hands and bring his dead son justice.This film touches a issue that is currently raging on the streets of Britian, violent killings of innocent people who have never come across crime in their lives. The movie explores the devastation that death of son causes to the parents, the pain it causes to the brother; I felt the pain of the Humes'; its raw....Kevin Bacon does a brilliant job in portraying the confused and enraged father on the warpath, Kelly Preston tries her best as the mother grieving; while the shining star is Garret Hedlund who was in Four Brothers ironically in Four Brothers, his characters mother is gunned down in a store, made to look like a robbery. He plays his character with pure vile and little remorse, there's also a brilliant performance from John Goodman as the gun manufacturer, Bones.The shootout scenes are satisfying as the 'means justify the end'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now 1st of all, I love all different movies but as a revenge film this movie is awesome.Lets start with acting, its got brilliant acting, especially bacon. U really feel the hatred he feels for the gangs The story is unoriginal however its done brilliantly, the punisher comes into mind but what death sentence wins for mainly is REALISM, and because bacon is a normal man, it makes you feel that this kinda thing could happen to you. The law fails him and the movie does an excellent job in boiling your rage for the system and gang members.very well filmed, AKA the chase in the car park was all done in one shot, IMO its one of the most intense moments I've ever seen.The violence is pretty high and brutal which is another thing I love. Violence hounds will be happy There are several plot holes but the director had to bend the rules a little to make the movie work, there is nothing to major though. Its very fast paced but had enough story in it without it getting boring.This film kept me gripped from the very start and if a movie can do that, it's worthy enough and should get the respect it deserves.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring Home the Bacon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amalgamation between the styles of the creator of the original "Saw" (forget about all the lousy sequels) and the writings of Brian Garfield (whose graphic novel will always remain controversial no matter what era we live in) could only result in pure cinematic dynamite, and so it was almost impossible for "Death Sentence" not to live up to my high expectations. This is a downright fantastic rush of sheer adrenalin, probably too gratuitously violent for about 90% of movie going audiences, but a sheer smörg?sbord to those who like their action-thrillers as hard as they come. No one, certainly not those involved in the production, expects this movie to win any major awards, but it delivers exactly what it promises: antipathetic characters, loathsome revenge morals, huge shotguns &amp; powerful handguns, gut-wrenching bullet wounds, blown off limbs, testosterone-laden showdowns and literally barrels full of blood and guts. Kevin Bacon gives one of his best performances (and definitely his scariest) ever as Nick Hume, an office clerk whose family means everything to him, and then particularly the promising sport future of his oldest son. On their way home from a game, Brandon gets sadistically killed by the youngest member of a street gang as some sort of initiation rite. The sudden loss of his beloved son and the lack of hope for justice drive Nick insane with fury and he sets out to punish the murderer himself. This subsequently triggers a horrific cat-and-mouse game between him and the rest of the gang that'll only result in more acts of retaliation, bloodshed and dramatic losses. The subject matter obviously isn't too mentally challenging, but it's a hugely disturbing and devastating movie. Kevin Bacon's transformation from family guy into sardonic vigilante skinhead is unsettling like few things I've ever seen before and the actual acts of retribution are vile and relentless beyond comparison. Bacon receives excellent support from the almost naturally menacing looking gang members, including Garrett Hedlund, Edi Gathegi and Hector Ruiz. There's also a delicious supportive role for John Goodman as a filthy and despicable weapon dealer. James Wan's direction is practically flawless, proving all the more his talents aren't restricted to grotesque horror ("Saw", "Dead Silence") exclusively. The grisly soundtrack, bleak and monotonous photography and abrupt ending also all contribute in making "Death Sentence" one of the most confronting sleeper-hits of 2007.</fullReview>

The fact that I also like previous work by Kevin Beacon was also a huge factor in my decision to pay to see this movie at the theater.I was not expecting to be emotionally moved in this movie to the point of being in tears. Never in a film have I seen such a profound realistic display of taking the protagonist to the limit. Our hero played by the talented Kevin Bacon undergoes a series of misfortunes that even lead to the death of his entire family. This film explored the existence of human nature and the lengths of which a father is willing to undergo to protect his family. I strongly recommend for everybody that likes a good realistic action movie to watch this film. This film brilliantly transcends all film genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bacon really takes out the trash in this piece of garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon and John Goodman give disappointing performances in this film that has more holes in it than the characters do by the closing credits. Continuity mistakes and leaps of faith expectations from the crowd aside, this film is a let down to say the least.The film starts off strong, enticing us into emotional attachment to the characters by creating a narrative through home videos. The camera work that follows allows the audience to stay sutured to those emotions by having the cameras move like camcorders and leaving the colors washed out. This feeling of reality soon falls apart as an actuary (Bacon) becomes a new age Punisher and begins to take out the trash that killed his son.The dialog is over the top and completely unbelievable. The speeches and emotion portrayed rip you from the story and plant you squarely in your seat. The world of reality is shattered and you find yourself laughing at and questioning every decision the characters make. Cops that tell victims to do everything the gangs tell then to do and watching a man die with multiple bullet wounds instead of administering fist aid and calling for help.The last thing I must warn you all of is the reference to a fantastic film. There are multiple references to "Taxi Driver". This is not the new "Taxi Driver"! Even though the lead character buys every gun put in front of him and dramatically cuts his hair the film is still not good. The scenes are forced and ridicules. I'll let you decide what you think of then. This movie is worth seeing if for no other reason to see how fantastic films can not be bought with well know actors and ripped off scenes, they must be born of an original idea and acted honestly.</fullReview>

The father (Bacon) decides to take the law into his own hands and go after the gang members.When I arrived home, I was shocked to find such bad reviews on this film! I think it is very underrated and definitely worth a viewing. I was not a fan of Wan's Dead Silence what so ever but this is his redeeming film.I say ignore the negative reviews and check it out. There is an incredible amount of emotion in this film and I thought the acting was great by everyone. Bacons transformation from father to murderer is subtle, but then again, wasn't Travis Bickle's as well? I am not ashamed to make that comparison either, I respect the film, the characterization and hope that people will go see it for what it is. Forget the haters, this is a highly entertaining film worthy of your 10 bucks.</fullReview>

The courtroom scene was a ridiculous follow-up to the crime, the protagonist's actions half-witted at best, and the actions, or inactions, of the inept police laughable! The dialog was so silly as to be unbelievable, exemplified but certainly not limited to the hospital scene. One can only imagine that neither actors Bacon nor Goodman actually read the script before signing contracts to perform in this debacle! A waste of time for all involved, particularly the viewers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>worst movie I have ever seen. Besides the violence , which I expected, the acting was terrible unless you REALLY like Kevin Bacon one man shows. Geez...I watch a lot of movies and this one really stunk! What was the purpose of the police detective? Did she ever do anything expect give looks to people? Her looks weren't even all that great. This movie is shallow and poorly acted. The plot is OK but no one will ever convince me that gangs are like the guys in this movie. Even their tattoos looked fake.I am a John Goodman fan and I did like the scenes that showed him a menacing light. His "office" was strange and beautiful at the same time and I was truly repulsed by his character but his small part does not make up for the rest of the silly movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe in spoiling a movie but believe me I'm not spoiling anything- Think of this more as a health warning A DVD you have never heard of suddenly appearing on the shelf is never a good sign, however a couple of beers and it might be a laugh, and it was, well sort of.To start with you should already know when you pick up one of theses revenge/ vigilante type films that you will of seen it all before, but with a pretty decent cast and a worryingly high score on the IMDb you may think "why not"? Well I will tell why not-From the beginning with the home movie of the ever so happy and wholesome family we know we are in for a real treat. Highlights include-Character development-None at all really. Calling the oldest son the golden child then looking surprised when the youngest gets a complex. John Goodman selling Bacon a small arsenal to kill his son then telling him" I will kill you if you ask me where he is". Truly bizarre. The gang straight out a Green Day video complete with scary tattoos. Pa getting shot by Junior who wants to borrow his car. Learning how to shoot a gun with an instruction manual, turning our hero into a navy seal in no time at all. The stupidity of the police force along with your typical slimy lawyer. The ripping off of Taxi driver for the final scenes complete with shaved head and massive revolver. Note Kevin Bacon even gets shot in the neck just like Travis Bickle.The list of crimes against cinema goes on-,The truly unexciting fight on the car park roof. The bad guys managing to kill everyone but Bacon and when he is is finally at their mercy they seem to think a bullet to the ribs is the best thing for him and then assume his dead.I thought a few beers would help, they didn't. Try a keg instead or a full lobotomy. I will give this 1 star, mainly because I am unable to award none but also it is thought provoking in regards to how truly bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind these kind of movies when made by the likes of Rodriguez or Tarantino. They have the decency to inject some comic relief on one or more levels, so we can forgive them for being over the top, full of gratuitous violence and lacking any sense. Unfortunately, this director seems to take himself and his movie serious. It all starts out promising enough, apart from the sentimental soundtrack that accompanies the sad scenes, but soon the whole plot falls apart. Look at the forum if you need a list of all the stupid ideas in this movie (as someone else mentioned, you do not learn how to shoot a gun by pointing it at the stuff in your shed and looking mean, but that is just one of about a thousand blunders).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it simply : Death Sentence = bad movie.Over the top and unbelievable , particularly the final scenes , and a lousy attempt at portraying how tragic and frightening todays culture can be.Now I have no objection to big budget , over the top movies , as long as they don't try and tag along some sob story to try and get the emotions of the audience running and maybe cause a few tears to be shed.I really enjoyed Die Hard 4 , it was ridiculously over the top at times , but it was completely shameless about it : you got what you paid for.Death Sentence , however is meant to be a modern harrowing insight into suburbia , but it loses any credibility with its absurd action scenes , and the emotional moments in the movie are both laughable and extremely cringe-worthy.Myslef and 3 friends went to the cinema with the intention of seeing Superbad , but there were no preview showings , so we went to this muck instead , and after the movie we all agreed that the movie we had seen was indeed "super bad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Bacon unleashes almighty Hell in "Death Sentence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a 5:10 showing of "Death Sentence". Let me tell you, the last half hour I had nothing but a big smile on my face, it was one of the coolest, entertaining revenge flicks I've seen in a long time. The strong points of the film is that Bacon gives a good performance a great portion through the film, there are times, although, where he seems to come off to overreact, but its very mild. He does play the role of a troubled father gone deranged very well. It shows in a lot of the little things he does, as he progresses more and more into his depression, anxiety and angst, he becomes more paler, his eyes become more tired, and he becomes more fidgety. John Goodman also gives a good stand-out performance, although it times it seems his role in the film was questionable. The camera direction is very good, certain camera angles, it has similarity to Wan's previous films, but you can tell his film-making skills have improved over the years, I was very impressed with a well-done panning shot in a parking garage. The story told is actually very interesting for a simple revenge story, that kept me interested in how it unfolds all the way though. The last thirty minuets of the film were wild and crazy, Kevin Bacons character, Nick Hume, has gone from a happy-go-lucky executive, to a deranged revenge-driven killer. You can see it in his face towards the end of the film, how his face has been completely battered, his hair has been messily shaved, and he constantly takes Advil to calm his nerves.The Bad. The bad parts of the film don't affect it so much the good, but it is quite annoying. As was stated before, Goodmans role in the film didn't seem big enough to even be in the film at all, he just felt there for eye candy if anything, more should have been done with the character. Another thing is the use of some of the music in the film. Music used in the more dramatic parts of the film, such as when the Hume family's first son is lost and the family begins to adjust without it, seems very overblown, and more unnecessary than touching. It would probably have been better without music at all, although at some parts, the music was completely appropriate with Charlie Clouser's wonderful score. Another part is that it felt as if the gang members characters were not very well developed, and more could be done with them before they get killed off. To top it all off, there wasn't enough done with the end at all, it doesn't finish off any questions you have, it feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual ending, leaving you feel unsatisfied with unanswered questions.In all, I would recommend Death Sentence for anyone that can ignore its small flaws, and enjoy it for what it is instead of examining it too much, because for me, it was an absolute bad ass experience. 8/10</fullReview>

"If you started a war, God help you." give me a break!!! i don't believe i have ever felt more like i wasted $8 after seeing a movie. if anyone reads this and enjoys good movies, and is expecting something good, DO NOT SEE THIS PILE OF GARBAGE!!! perhaps the worst part is that it tried to be serious, like taxi driver and failed beyond miserably. take my advice and do not see this. i suppose this spells the end of kevin bacon as anything more than a supporting role in good movies.</fullReview>

The revenge plot is pretty basic but Kevin Bacon's acting and the direction by Wan make this an unforgettable, gut wrenching story of loss and redemption. The film contains some intense fight scenes and surprisingly the action sequences are fresh and there are some unique death scenes. The soundtrack is very depressing and moody and helps set the tone of the film. Death Sentence had awesome action, great acting by the cast, and a grizzly, rough-edge feel. I liked it a lot and recommend to anyone who likes good action/thrillers. A must see for Bacon fans. I was blown away!</fullReview>

I would love to see Kevin Bacon in more action films like this.And the main thing that really drove me into this film was the music, the music by Charlie Clouser truly captivates you and comes threw the camera and gets your attention and makes you feel "Nick Hume's" pain and you want him to succeed in what he is doing and that is revenge big revenge.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the first 15 minutes of this movie gave me that uh-oh feeling of: I just paid money for this. Seemed pretty cheesy and too sweet and cliché as we are introduced to the family. Acting wasn't too hot by Bacon either as Kelly Preston upstages him in every scene. Kind of knowing what was coming allowed me to bear through it.When it got going though, the movie started rolling pretty good. Lots of no holds barred fights with blood and bone, gunshot blasts and vicious stabbings. Great scene in the underground garage that was the highlight of the film. Hard to believe undernourished Bacon could portray a man on the warpath well, but he dished it out pretty good. I was actually kind of shocked in some of the scenes with the pure nastiness, but it is a vigilante movie.This movie borrows a lot of material from other sources: Dirty Harry, Max Payne, Death Wish and some scenes straight out of Taxi Driver. But it worked. If you are into ultra violent flicks with weak plot line, little emotion and brain splattering gore, then this is your end of the summer Christmas gift. Pretty good for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge and other forms of Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DEATH SENTENCE is a tough movie to watch, not because it is a poorly made film, but because of the degree of violence that, once started, is mayhem on a roller coaster ride. Though based on a novel by Brian Garfield, the script by Ian Jeffers is a patchwork quilt - the holes show whenever the police arrive on the scene. James Wan, of the 'Saw' movies fame, directs with a keen eye for breathless action sequences and almost intolerable suspense timing that makes the film fly through the 111 minutes of the Unrated version.During the opening credits we are introduced to the perfect family via home movies and domestic scenes: Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is the devoted father, Helen (Kelly Preston) his bright and loving wife, Brendan (Stuart Lafferty) is the golden boy son with all the soccer laurels, and Lucas (Jordan Garrett) the younger 'also ran' son. The glitch in this family's happiness happens one night when, out of gas while driving home from a soccer game, Nick stops at a gas station and while Brendan is in the convenience store a gang comes in and murders the store owner and Brendan: the reason for the killing is not robbery but an initiation rite into a gang accomplished by young Joe Darley (Matt O'Leary) and the demand of his older brother Billy (Garrett Hedlund, in a very out of character role from his usual 'Troy', 'Friday Night Lights', 'Eragon', 'Georgia Rule' persona). Nick witnesses the killing and when the lawyers and police work with him in the aftermath to 'arrange a deal' instead of a murder trial, Nick decides to take matters in hi s own hands.The Darley brothers are part of a ruthless gang sponsored by their own father Bones Darley (John Goodman, in a very dark and well-realized role). Nick stalks Joe Darley and murders him, and once the deed (that happens to begin a gang war against Nick) is done the terror begins. The gang is out to kill not only Nick but Nick's family also. How this pursued and pursuers game works out furnishes the remainder of the film. It is the old eye for an eye story that ends in tragedy for everyone concerned.When the film is dealing with the 'family' and the 'gang' the dialog sparkles, but when the police, headed by Detective Wallis (Aisha Tyler), become involved the aid from the police becomes as ludicrous as the dialog placed in their mouths. Kevin Bacon gives a bravura performance as the gentle father driven to murderous madness and Garrett Hedlund matches him as the ruthless and terrifying gang leader Billy. There are enough sidebars about father/son relationships on both sides of the plot line to make the movie have a message. But in the end it is the wildly frantic camera action and directorial decisions by Wan that make this a horrifying and arresting film. Not for the queasy viewer. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it!One of the best films i've seen this year.It had everything you could want.It had drama,suspense,action,thrills and more.It was a fun and tense movie to watch.After the Hume family is introduced there is a tragic,senseless killing and the action starts and is non stop.It is typical of what is happening too often these days,where the criminal justice system is failing the victims of crime and favors the criminal who has all the rights.The movie was also emotional and moving and each family member grieved in their own way. It is the kind of movie where you strongly root for the father who is about to avenge his favorite son and initiates his own version of justice against a gang of skinhead looking thugs but with a colored member who grew up with the 2 Darley brothers.And even though some parts were over the top and not always believable,it keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement.You fully understand this grieving father's wrath and what drove him to the edge.I wonder though(had it been real)if the father would have reacted so strongly if it were his youngest son who was killed instead of golden boy! Towards the end it got surprising and sad but I guess a necessary thing considering the war the father started.And then the story takes a very unexpected twist at the end but,but a satisfying way to end it.The whole movie was very well acted by everyone especially Kevin Bacon who did a lot of his own stunts.I think it was one of his best performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two thirds good, last third bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vigilante thrillers have been a long-term staple of cinema since Michael Winner's violent 1974 classic DEATH WISH set the template for what has come since. DEATH SENTENCE is another variant on long-established themes that runs through the ? dare I say it? ? clichés with slick efficiency. One of the biggest draws for me was the presence of Kevin Bacon, an under-appreciated actor who I've always enjoyed watching in whatever he does. I wasn't disappointed with his performance here as a normal family man who undergoes a metamorphosis into a ruthless killer; Bacon is an actor who always exudes believability and has a natural edginess that makes him perfect for roles like the one here.The film starts off on strong ground, leading us through to some scenes of unbelievable harshness and loss, and the pivotal turns from Bacon and a strong Kelly Preston as his wife keep us watching. Director James Wan is best known for directing the first SAW film, and this is a movie with much of the same darkness ? although, thankfully, the outrageous torture and violence is kept in short supply here; in essence this is no more violent a film than a typical Steven Seagal movie like OUT FOR JUSTICE from the '90s.The camera-work is strong and the supporting cast fine ? John Goodman's here in an extended cameo and about as far away from his 'cuddly big guy' persona as you can imagine; and Garrett Hedlund is an intensely hateful villain, yet he manages to be more than just a comic book caricature. There are some GREAT action scenes here, including a middle-of-the-film foot chase that takes place in streets, buildings and finally a parking lot. This is a fantastic moment of cinema and one of the best chases I've ever watched, and I'm going to make sure I sit through it again even if I don't watch the whole movie a second time.This leads me neatly into the film's biggest failing ? the last third. After an important plot twist, the film suddenly changes and loses scope. The substance evaporates in favour of dark style and the inevitable shoot-em-up climax ensues where the last vestiges of reality are done away with in favour of predictable, clichéd and inane over-the-top killing. Even worse, almost all of the stylistic touches are nicked from the climax of Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER. Inevitably this ends up being inferior and just reminds us of that film's classic nature. The flawed nature of the last part of the movie means that this is an adequate vigilante outing.</fullReview>

He had a sustainable career, and so did his wife Helen Hume, played by Kelly Preston. He had two sons who were scholars and athletes. He could not ask for any more.But in a tragic accident, Hume's oldest son was brutally murdered by a gang. Hume tried to stop the gang members and was not successful, but he was able to identify the murderer. But if he were to testify against the murderer in court, even if convicted, he would not have received life in prison. So Hume decides to not testify, the charges were dropped, and Hume took matters into his own hands. Hume murders his son's murderer. Little did he know that action would create a ripple effect that would escalate to the gang to now attempt to kill the rest of his family.It was intense watching Hume evolve from his good self into an evil criminal that would do what it would take to protect his family from the gang that was now after him. Every person has a dark side, and Hume expressed his incredibly loud.</fullReview>

Goodman's performance was amusing, as a gangster that smells like Arby's and talks with a bite of horsey sauce. Cliché' and uncompelling, but thoroughly fun to watch with his limited screen time. Bacon supplies great moments of drama that unfortunately coincide with spotty directing and screen writing spottier than a jaguar with leprosy who habitually leaves ink pens in its pockets.

		<fullReview>Death Sentence (2007): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Kevin Bacon, Garrett Hedlund, Kelly Preston, John Goodman, Aisha Tyler: Corrupt thriller about revenge and our justice system. A family is destroyed when the oldest son is murdered during a gas station robbery. Kevin Bacon plays the father whom takes matters into his own hands when the system fails. This results in a gang war. Directed by James Wan with promise but reduced to formula cat and mouse chase where revenge seems to be applauded. Bacon wrestles with the fact that he killed someone, and his actions bare further consequences until he is left wounded and wondering whether it was worth it. Garrett Hedlund plays the gang leader whose brother was in court for the murder of Bacon's son but upon release he is killed thus enacting the gang leader's rage. Hedlund will arrive at consequences but viewers must ponder the morality of it. Kelly Preston plays Bacon's wife in a role that is too standard. John Goodman appears briefly as a gun salesman. The role is small but Goodman steals the moment with knowledge of being involved in similar lifestyles. Aisha Tyler plays a female detective who is more in tune as to what is going on than the anti-hero realizes. Revenge and justice muddled in a screenplay that has been reworked the same year with The Brave One, but this version proves more compelling if not equally wayward. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon stars in this bloody and in-your-face pulp revenge saga that is sort of a 21st century version of "Death Wish". In fact, it's based on a novel by Brian Garfield that was a follow-up to his original "Death Wish" book. Bacon is your typical Happy Family Man with a very successful executive type job who believes in balance in the universe. So when despicable criminal scum murder his golden boy hockey star teenage son Brendan (Stuart Lafferty), Mr. Happy Family Man becomes obsessed with righting this wrong. Well, he does track down the actual killer of his son (Matt O'Leary) and send him to Hell, but that's not the end of the story. For as one can imagine, the punks' fellow gang members are furious and vow retribution in return. Eventually, our protagonist is forced to realize that he's set in motion an untenable series of events. When it comes to this aspect, "Death Sentence" is pretty good for showing us that vigilantism can have serious consequences and isn't necessarily a good thing. On the other hand, all of this is pretty standard stuff, as adapted by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers and directed by James Wan of "Saw" fame. Sure, in a visceral way it's reasonably gripping, and it does have its moments, such as an intense foot chase / action sequence, and it's not without its interesting parts, such as our main character and villain confronting each other at the end and the villain remarking on how much our "hero" has ended up like the people he's been gunning down. He even takes to shaving his hair off, a symbolic gesture, to be sure. The unrated version also has an effective sequence where the bad guys are determined to give a fallen comrade a decent send-off. And there's a believable enough sub plot detailing the anguish the younger brother feels upon the death of his sibling, the feeling that he always had to deal with being the less favoured of the offspring. Wans' kinetic filmmaking is a plus, ensuring that this never gets boring. But by the end this has entered into a pretty predictable pattern. The acting is at the least convincing, from Bacon and Kelly Preston as the parents, Garrett Hedlund as the principal thug, Aisha Tyler as the detective on the case, and John Goodman in an amusing turn as a neighbourhood kingpin who orders Hedlund and company around. Overall, this is not bad but audiences probably aren't going to remember it years from now unlike that long ago Charles Bronson vehicle. Six out of 10.</fullReview>

At first letting the law take its course in getting justice in Brendan's murder Nick is shocked that the best he can get in sentencing his murderer who he tangled with at the murder scene Little Joe Darley, Matt O'Leary, is a scant three years behind bars with the possibility of an early release for good behavior! Sick and disgusted Nick refuses to identify Little Joe allowing his release. But what Nick has in mind is to take justice into his own hands and administrate it Charles Bronson or Death Wish style!Unbelievably violent and gut crunching vigilante flick even now a days with so little to shock the audience in what's going on the big screen. The movie has Nick Hume's go from a Charles Bronson to a "Dirty Harry" Calahan and finally to a deranged and whacked out, with his head shaved, Travis Bickle from the film "Taxi Driver" on his unrelenting and murderous rampage to end all movie rampages. As he does his thing, killing his son's murderers, and does it with blood guts and bone spattering efficiency! It's almost as if Nick's possessed by a higher power Nick seems, despite his frail frame, almost indestructible as he knocks off the gang members lead by Little Joe's big brother Billy, Garrett Hedlund, who are in some cases twice as big and far better armed then he is as easily as shooting fish in a barrel or swatting flies with a fly swatter. That despite taking at least a half dozen slugs in his chest and body in battling them! The film goes so over the top in Nick's search &amp; destroy operation against the Darley Gang that it's hard to separate the two in who's either the good or, in the case of the Darley Gang, bad guys in the movie. ***SPOILERS*** Gunned down but coming back to life Nick all bandaged up ends up escaping from the hospital emergency ward where he's been admitted and arms himself to the teeth with the help of the Darley Boys criminal dad, who'll sell guns to anyone if the price is right, Bones played by an almost unrecognizable John Goodman and head out to the gang's clubhouse to finish the job that they in fact started! And what a bloody good job Nick did! So good of a job that Billy Darley as he's about to kick off, from being blasted by Nick, admiringly tells him: "Look what I did I made you one of us".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Death Wish" updated for new generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "Death Wish" update doesn't seem concerned with telling us why these gangsters kill an innocent man's son. It's all about the guy getting revenge when the court doesn't bother giving the killer a sentence he truly deserves. Not that this matters, if you like these kinds of movies. But getting inside the minds of the bad guys would have helped. To say the homicide detective doesn't help, at least in my opinion, is an understatement. She doesn't do a thing to help him, except talk to him. But I guess this shouldn't be surprising, since she isn't particularly sympathetic. After Nick's family is gone, the movie really takes off.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty, before watching this film, I was expecting another B-grade "man goes to prison after being wrongly accused of family slaying" etc. film. However, the film was a refreshingly different and more gritty movie that dealt with more than what "The Brave One" or "Death Race" explored.The close character development of Hume plays centre stage to an otherwise typical shoot 'em up esquire creation. Irony, twisted reality and emotional pain of losing his family is accurately and realistically portrayed.A quote I'd like to point out which really helped me round up the film and made the difference between a 1 star movie and a 3.5 star movie was this: "You look like one of us." This, coupled with the darkly humorous end left me pleasantly satisfied.Fast paced action, guns &amp; gore, gangs, a crazy man in a leather jacket. What could go wrong? 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first third of this movie was filled with suspense and a couple of impressive action scenes, followed by emotional turmoil as the ramifications of events unfold.Kevin Bacon (an underrated actor due to a poor choice of roles in the past) plays a convincing character but the plot starts to drag and it all becomes a bit too cheesy and 'Hollywood' in the middle third, although there is an excellent bit of filming where the camera pans continuously around a multi-storey car park, following various characters for about 5 minutes.The final third does pick up, with more action scenes and a faster pace but by that point I'd lost any respect for the film and found myself picking holes in the plot.The best way to watch this movie is with your finger on the skip button of your remote. Fortunately, there are plenty of other vigilante films (Harry Brown &amp; Gran Torino are awesome!) that are far more worthy of your attention than this one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow start, although it gets better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I was expecting a dark, sombre film about some tortured character seeking revenge. I was disappointed to see a happy perfect American family being struck by the murder of one of their sons. Now, let me specify.The death of this amazing hockey player American teenager at the hands of a gang member while his father watches didn't make me feel anything. I didn't feel any sadness or anger as, perhaps, the director expected you to do after seeing this flawless family being destroyed. I can't say why exactly this didn't shock me in any way. Maybe it wasn't well built (you saw it coming), or it could be that I don't feel too much sympathy for such a stereotypical family. I do not know if the film presents us with this nice family for us to see the change Bacon goes throughout the film, to try to make us understand that anything can happen even if you believe you have the perfect life or what, but it doesn't work. Who knows, it might if you actually are part of one of those families.The father (Bacon) finds more shocking that his son was killed as part of an initiatory ritual for a gang than because of a robbery, and this fact seems to affect somehow his desire to seek revenge by himself. Honestly, I don't find the gang issue particularly horrific. Other more "civilized" people have this kind of initiatory stuff for human boys as well when the father and the son go out to the forest to kill an animal for the same pathetic macho way of thinking.This movie probably got one of the worst musical moments I've heard in a soundtrack. They try to make you feel sad, pity or whatever at times by using this EXTREMELY cheesy music. Believe me, it doesn't fit. Don't get me wrong, you get nice rock for the action, which suits perfectly. However, as I say, the cheesy music is completely out of place (except for the final scene with the father and the "gang lord", perhaps).So, when I was thinking "oh man, what is this...", the film starts to offer more complex action sequences that keep building it after FINALLY reaching that level I was expecting in the beginning: the dark, sombre tortured character seeking revenge. With a bit of gore included. Only for that, the film is worth watching.The bottom line: you won't find here the deep psychological perspective of Taxi Driver (you will find some similarities in one of the shooting scenes though), the romanticism of The Crow or even not much of a feeling of the guy actually looking for complete, hateful, absolute revenge (except towards the end). This is simply about how humans let themselves be guided by emotions and end up badly. Taking a few "evil" guys with them in the way.The cheesy stuff could have been skipped for a better experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie was released, I really wanted to watch it, but couldn't I have this habit even if a movie is way good and people can't resist to watch it, I always watch movie with good print. And it took me three years to watch it. Cause it got slipped from my mind to watch this awesome grievance of a father. While watching it, I felt the father's emotion for what he has when his son got killed. And the urge to take the revenge is purely natural. Even if I were in his shoes, I would have done the same thing as he did in "death sentence". He was inexperienced to guns, bullets and he really showed that in the shoot out sequences. He was worried and yet he got to retaliate. I would highly recommend everyone who wish to watch some dark action, crime movie, this is the one to make a choice. 7/10 from me. Good. I will look forward for this genre more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can never figure it out but there is something about Kevin Bacon that always draws me to watch his movies. And I always expect it to be at least decent. The logic hasn't failed me so far - it may not always be a masterpiece, but he really adds tension and live meat to the proceedings.Kevin Bacon plays Nick Hume, a VP at a risk assessment company and a happy father of two sons, the oldest of which is an aspiring professional hockey player, while the younger is more of a momma's boy. This all changes when a gas station stop turns into a bloody initiation for a young gang member with the elder son his victim.Nick Hume unsatisfied with the proceedings of law decides to hand out his own death sentence and disposes of the killer. This vendetta starts a circle of violence between Hume and the gang and the lingering question remains - will the score ever equal up? The first half of the movie is a real emotional and thrilling roller-coaster, where tension builds with tragedy hanging in plain view just a small step behind all the revenge. At one point I really expected the movie to go in a very adventurous direction in resolving the issue - can you ever even up the score when it comes to murder? But suddenly instead of the profound the script takes a turn towards Dirty Harry - Kevin Bacon coolly squinches his eyes, looks straight at the camera and makes a real action movie exit from the scene.From then on we drop the logic and the pretence of actually being a movie with something to say. And the carnage begins with the mild VP going postal and the police are naturally nowhere in sight.Some great action sequences from Mr Wang and definitely a thrilling journey. Just not altogether satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) has just witnessed his oldest son die in a convenience store during a gang initiation. When it becomes apparent that his killer will do less time than a habitual marijuana user, the typically conservative and loving father takes matters into his own hands, which means inadvertently sparking an intense gang war that may cost him his family as well as his humanity. How far will you go for revenge?"Death Sentence" is all about a middle class father's struggle in a gang war and the lengths he will go to just to protect himself and his family. The film, at times, attempts to stick some sort of social commentary in the midst of all the gunplay and gratuitous violence. Aisha Tyler's character will mention something about gang wars and how "In a war, everybody thinks they are right," though it's all for naught. "Death Sentence" is at its best when it lets go of logic and morals and sticks to the action, and believe me, you'll get your fill of bullet-wounds and car crashes with this one. It's also got a slew of seedy and nasty characters, the cherry-on-top being a very unhealthy looking but very intense John Goodman as a sweaty gun salesman.While Kevin Bacon turns in a convincing performance as a grieving father who implements his own brand of justice, the script isn't too complimentary to his character, and despite the attempts at humanizing him, in the end, he turns into another action hero on a mission, heavy-metal fueled montage and all. Thankfully, director James Wan ("Saw," "Dead Silence") seems to know a thing or two about action and suspense, so while the story may be a bit on the stale side, you'll be constantly on the edge of your seat with the insane action sequences, stunts and logic defying lapses of reason. It's a good movie for those seeking a juicy revenge plot served up with a glut of eye candy. If you go into "Death Sentence" expecting a little, you'll likely come out with a lot, since there's really nothing more than meets the eye with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about vengeance that turns silly in the end. Kevin Bacon plays Nick Hume, a regular family man. One night he stops at a gas station in a bad neighborhood and some guys kill his son as part of a gang ignitation. One of the attackers is hit by a car so he is caught by the police. After learning the guy will only get several years in prison, Nick decides not to identify him in a line up. That night he gets revenge and knifes the guy himself. This starts a gang war. Now is when it starts to get silly. The gang have a gun battle trying to shoot Nick on a busy street during the day and the police never show up. Instead of running into one of the crowded buildings, Nick runs throw alleys, not knowing if he will run into a dead end. He gets away, but another gang member dies and they get Nick's briefcase, so they know where he lives. They deliver a threat to Nick at work. Instead of getting his family on the next flight out of town, he stays in his house with a baseball bat, not even a gun. That makes little sense. So, the gang comes shoots his family. He and his other son live.Next part is when Nick turns Rambo. He buys all these guns, shaves his head and dresses like a banger. This time he really means revenge and there is quite a bit of violence. This part is just over the top. It's like Kevin Bacon turns into Sly Stallone, Bruce Willis, Arnold Swattsneger, etc.... The movie goes from drama to ridiculous action film. It should have stayed more realistic.FINAL VERDICT: If you like action films, then you'll probably like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Wan is a talented visual director, but he's not that talented in directing actors or creating characters. That's fine as long as he surrounds himself with talented actors like Kevin Bacon (who, admittedly, is one of my favorite actors). Bacon has the ability to take just about nothing and turn it into something watchable, something interesting, and I doubt that he has to be supported by any director.But when we come to the rest of the characters, Wan quickly runs into trouble. The actors playing the villains are way too over the top, turning into stereotyped clichés. They bend over backwards trying to be cool, hard-ass gang bangers, but they just look like the nerds in drama class who have watched coked out Tony Montana's final standoff in Scarface a couple of times too many. It's shouting and throwing glasses around whilst trying to maintain an oh-so vicious look on their faces. The end result is that they look like total cartoons, removing the element of dread or danger which might have been present.I don't know if it's the actors fault (I honestly can't remember seeing them in anything else, although I've seen numerous films in which they apparently performed) or if one is to blame the director who didn't give the actors the right guidance or support, or simply miscast the parts (especially the one playing the main villain is horrendous) Other than that, I kind of liked this movie. The story was engaging, Bacon was excellent as always, and Wan delivered some cool shots (the long tracking shot in the parking structure is a frickin' masterpiece).I wonder if this is the beginning of a new vigilante trend, as it was released within a very short time frame of Jodie Foster's The Brave One, which I also liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda like SAW but without the interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off slow, getting to know the family that is going to be killed in order to give their deaths meaning. The problem is they seem largely 2D and not entirely likable. The film then gets to the first action of killing a family member and it doesn't really strike home. Hume (our hero) then proceeds to go through a poorly written and awkwardly stuttering sort of breakdown as he deals with a justice system that won't avenge his son's murder. This is capped by his renouncing his own testimony in court in order to take vengeance. The fundamental problem here is the problem that plagues the movie. We spend a lot of time trying to develop a psyche that doesn't work right.Hume decides to forsake the entire justice system and become a stalking vengeance killer and that shift is badly written, thusly acted and really poorly conceived in the directors mind. had the justice system failed and the gang come after Hume and his family for doing the right thing we might be able to accept Hume becoming a man possessed. We needed a catalyst for what amounts to a psychotic break. What we get is a series of places where Hume alternates between cold blooded killer and fearful citizen. He is able to kill one man for vengeance, and one man in self defense but somehow he doesn't have the courage to stand against what is going to be an all out war until the bad guys come and take away everything he had.Only in the declining action do we see his break and willingness to go slaughter gangsters. The problem is he's a insurance guy... he doesn't shoot guns but somehow became a damn good shot in ten minutes of reading the manual. Where the director could have paced out this curve of learning to kill better and better over an hour and a half of movie, he only had about 25 minutes to get all the bad guys shot. Had Wan decided to go with a film that was more in the vein of SAW or more like the Death Sentence posters he could have had a hit on his hands along the lines of a Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez style film.Also his son survives, you see it coming as he has his final breakdown over his comatose boy, a finger twitch which in the closing end up being that his son will now grow up without a father because his father sought revenge rather than family. It was a stale epiphany, really rather a kick in the nuts after we are supposed to be rooting for Hume and was just a poor decision.Visally the film was very well done, the score was a little awkward at times, almost more like Wan decided to put in music he liked rather than hiring someone to score the film appropriately. It could have been better if Wan and the writer had decided to make a movie that was more about the death sentence and less about the perils of revenge.</fullReview>

But in this movie, with every action scene, a dramatic scene that plays the same exact ballad each time must follow. Kevin Bacon plays bad ass well, but after any kind of action, he must then take a few minutes to stare off then cry but not before the over-dramatic ballad kicks in. Best actor here was Garret Hedlund, who played the brother after Bacon's character. The camera-work was great during the action scenes, but didn't work for me everywhere else.Best thing about this movie was the parking garage scene which was incredibly well filmed. So overall, only the action worked here, everything else was just bad...bad acting, dialogue, etc. Rent it and prepare to do a little fast forwarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ACTUAL sequel to Charles Bronson's 1974 *Death Wish*, the movie *Death Sentence* (written by same author, Brian Garfield, in 1975) does deviate from the novel (blame screenwriter Ian Jeffers and director James Wan), yet delivers a solid thematic punch often subsumed by this politically-gutless American society. By that I mean, in 2007 no one is willing to say out loud that revenge is sweet, or that revenge should be exacted at all ? even though righteous vengeance is a staple of our animalistic species.*Death Sentence* says it out loud. Back in '74, when Bronson (as Paul Kersey) took justice into his tough-guy hands, America was reeling from rising crime rates in major cities, so his vigilantism was applauded by audiences. The *Death Wish* sequels progressively became unwatchable ? not because of escalating violence or morality conundrums - but because (like the *Planet of the Apes* series) their production budgets nosedived with each sequel. But vigilantism is back. And being given the production value it deserves. Since *Death Wish* and the *Dirty Harry* series, most movie media has shied away from people exacting their due recompense with no hypocritical "societal values" muddying the mix. Now, not only is there Jodie Foster's vigilante vehicle, *The Brave One* (Sep 2007), there is also a mentally-retarded Amerikan president vengefully killing innocents in a country wholly disconnected to the faction who attacked America on September 11, 2001. Talk about confused Amerikan morality. Starring that guy who is, at most, six degrees from anyone, Kevin Bacon (as Nick Hume), *Death Sentence* pounds us so insistently with treacly cliché in its first act that it almost (ahem) shoots itself in the foot. (Idyllic family life, every major event like first bike rides, first steps, first base hit, videotaped professionally of course; bad part of town, rain-soaked funeral, cop who doesn't follow procedure... There's a even a picture of both brothers on the bedside table in the brothers' bedroom - that was unnecessary icing on an overbaked cake: maybe in the *parent's* bedroom, but what teen brother would have a picture of him and his teen brother on his bedside table?! They call that incest in some parts of Ohio?) Hume's Normal Rockwell is shattered when his eldest jock son is slayed in a senseless gang initiation in that aforementioned "bad part of town."Then it's Suburban Dads Gone Wild. And a very satisfying avenger The Bacon makes, seeking and destroying his son's killers in a compelling, "realistic" performance, aided by Kelly Preston as his wife, Aisha Tyler as a very non-prying detective, Garrett Hedlund as the head street thug and John Goodman in a role which will surprise you, if not make you laugh out loud ("LOL"?) at its impertinent miscasting. If this movie teaches us anything about dealing with thugs, it's that you act quickly, you act forcefully and you act decisively. After his first almost passively-violent (yet still satisfyingly vengeful) encounter with the actual thug who killed his son, Hume finds he is forced to take charge of his vigilante destiny when the gang comes after him for *their* revenge. (It's moments like these that we see what hot MILFs like Kelly Preston saw in their man way back when. Too bad marriage had to kill that spark.) The film is well-made, well-directed, with a look like iron filings were accidentally spilled over the filmstock. There are some weird coincidences gussied up to look like "twists" and a tiring chase scene that ends with a well-executed car-falling-off-roof stunt, which looks every bit as good as the trailer intimates. When Bacon shaves his head and arms himself with an arsenal that would make Rambo say, "Dude, dial it down to a seven!" we know this ain't Paul Kersey's Chicago anymore ? this is *Death Wish* for a generation weaned on HALO 3 and *Dancing With The Stars.* (If *Dancing With The Stars* doesn't make you wanna go out and shoot people, you're already too numb to care?)Movie Maniacs, visit poffysmoviemania(dot)com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expected something original, something different, do not see this film. It has all the cliché that you can remember and ask for. The father weak but crazy, the perfect family, the strong contender, the use of heavy drug...I thing that you would guess the others one.Kevin Bacon and the other do their best but this is not enough. When you have to fight with a plot whose main problem is the lack of surprise, you're in big trouble.The film is like a big Frankenstein. It has part of American Psycho, Cape Fear, El Mariachi, and of course, Darkman one of the great movies about revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From The Author Of "Death Wish"...You Know What To Expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the seventies Charles Bronson appeared in a movie for which he would always be associated. "Death Wish", an adaption of the novel of the same name by Brian Garfield, tells the story of a normal man who takes the law into his own blood-stained hands when his wife is murdered and his daughter is brutally raped. Over thirty years later, "Death Sentence" is released also based on a novel by Brian Garfield. The basic themes are the same - an ordinary man seeks revenge against those who murdered his son - but there is one major difference and that difference is Kevin Bacon.Whilst Charles Bronson was a good actor, he pales in comparison to Mr Bacon. Bacon's Nick Hume is the heart of "Death Sentence" and Bacon helps to establish him as an ordinary man pushed to his very limits. When we first meet him, he is a proud father and loving husband whose family is the very centre of his world. It is within the first act of the movie that things go very wrong for Nick after an encounter with a street gang headed by the sadistic Billy (a great performance here by Garrett Hedlund). When the law looks like it won't give him the justice he urgently needs, Nick makes a decision which will cost him his soul and perhaps even more than that.If you're expecting a solid action movie in the style of the latest Steven Segal flick, then you're going to be disappointed for most of "Death Sentence". The majority of the movie is taken up with Nick dealing with his grief and then subsequently dealing with his own actions. That's not to say that there aren't some great action sequences however (one particular chase sequence between Nick and the gang is extremely tense). The movie takes a hard look at how violence corrupts those who use it and how events can escalate beyond all control.Some may have trouble with the final bullet-strewn act of the movie but, for me, it was the logical progression of the story (despite being somewhat unrealistic). This is, after all, a revenge story more than anything else and - if you keep that in mind - you'll be more than happy with how things play out.I enjoyed this movie a lot. The performances were all excellent (including a great cameo by John Goodman - who knew that the guy could be so sleazy?), the violence is suitably graphic (heads explode, legs get blown off etc) and the story kept my attention throughout. In fact, the only complaint I can think of is that Charlie Clouser's soundtrack occasionally resembles his "Saw" theme too much but the use of Pilot Speed's "Alright" in two vital scenes is well used. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wan Executes a Great Move with Death Sentence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This may contain light spoilers so be cautioned.***Certatinly a throw back to the early 80's vigilante type movies, but with a much more modern flavoring. I thought, going in, that the violence would be worse than "SAW" and its sequels, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not all that bad. In fact, the violence seemed very realistic and nothing was held back like it was back in the days of Bronson's vigilante justice. I thought the utilization of a knife to kill the son was unique, since with a gun it does not seem as brutal and personal as a more "manual" killing by hand. Also, I enjoyed when Kevin shaved his head near the end, as it really pumped me up for the big showdown, fit well with the music, and was a similar throwback to "Taxi Driver."I believe it is worth renting and I will probably even buy it. My only complaint was that the gang did not seem so realistic. Most gangs are either almost all Hispanic, all Black, or all White (even though White gangs are more racially directed (ie: "American History X"), or bikers), but this gang had one Black guy, and a bunch of "Thug-like" White guys. I heard another viewer say the same thing, and things like that DO NOT make a movie unenjoyable, but they take a piece of the realism away from a movie that had few flaws in the realistic sense.All in all, this movie was very good, but not great.I knew it was not supposed to be a deep story, but rather an action flick going in, but we were rewarded with a few deeper moments than I expected. If some graphic violence does not bother you and you like action and revenge combined with better acting than what WWE films have been giving to us, then check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Wish with a Taxi Driver Undertone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an solid action flick with beautiful direction.The skinny of the plot is as follows: - Awesome opening of old home videos of the Humes, establishing their tight knit family unit.-Kevin bacon's relationships with each of his family members.- After his son's hockey game, Kevin Bacon and him pull into a gas station to get gas. Two supped up Musclecars pull into the station and out come many masked men. Killing Kevin's son.- After hearing that the man responsible for his son's death (Matt O'Leary) will get out of jail, Kevin Bacon decides that he can't be sure if that he was the man responsible.- Kevin Bacon drives home and looks for a weapon to murder the O'Leary character dead. He follows Matt O'Leary's character, and kills him.- Eventually Garrett Hedlund (O'Leary's brother) discovers that Kevin killed his little brother. And a back and fourth revenge game is played.- It all gets to the point where there is a climatic showdown, and nobody really wins.The script is a little thin because of the cheesy dialog. With the script aside though, it really is well done. The actors do perform their parts well. Kevin Bacon plays another creepy character, I noticed he plays a weird man in a lot of his films, but his part is very convincing as a loving family man gone borderline psychopath. You really understand his want to avenge his son's death.Garrett Hedlund is the other solid performer in this film, he isn't as cliché or one dimensional as his counterparts. His revenge is just as deserved as Kevin Bacon's character's is.The camera-work is great, the parking structure scene was shot very well, in an extremely solid long shot. I'm thinking some digital editing was done and some cuts were spliced together, because i'm not sure how else they accomplished such a long shot.If the script was tighter and not as cliché this could have been a super movie, not just a good movie.Rent it, or go see it. Your money won't be wasted 7.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taxi Driver On A Death Wish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death Sentence" is a get-you-mad-and-seek-some-payback kind of movie. It is an angry film that works... well, works for the first half anyway. It is during the second half that this tightly-wound, affecting film begins to unravel into a pile of "gimme a break!" Personally, I believe this to be Kevin Bacon's best work to date. Normally he comes off an arrogant, pretty boy who can't shake free of his "Footloose" days. This time, however, his performance possesses a passion and believability that is new, yet comfortable for him. He definitely carries the film like a leading star should.Nick Hume (Bacon) is the loving father of two sons and husband to an adoring wife (Kelly Preston). One night on the way home from his oldest son's hockey game, the two stop off for gas. While he is outside filling the tank, his son goes for some goodies and, as Hume watches, is murdered as part of a gang initiation. Hume falsifies his testimony in court allowing the murderer to go free, and deals unto the gang member his own "death sentence". This provokes vicious and violent retaliation against Hume and his remaining family, which is effectively tense and borders on the disturbing.Where the film loses its foothold is during the second half where any sense of realism is sacrificed for those film goers with shorter attention spans. The gang members seemingly control the city, a city that apparently only employs a handful of police officers. Bacon goes from suit-and-tie, business guy to Rambo who shares Stallone's immunity to lead. Basically, the film just stops making sense.It's a fun ride, though, and really gets your blood boiling at times. I found myself reaching for my bat and just waiting for Bacon's signal to help him inflict some damage on the evil doers. Of a similar theme, Bacon achieves what "Death Wish's" Charles Bronson never could for me... a sympathetic character, and I think that speaks volumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, you can look at this movie one of two ways. Either go in looking for a thought provoking thriller and be disappointed, or have a few brews, have some friends over and laugh your behinds off at the hackneyed plot line/characters and the amazing "suspension of disbelief" the plot demands. At first, I figured Kevin Bacon is in it, so there might be something to look for in this movie - IMHO, he usually involves himself in some very good movies with some very interesting ideas (Murder in the First, The Woodsman, etc.) Fairly soon, you realize this was just one of those "need to make some $$" movies, and it's actually hilarious how see through the plot line is and the amazing levels of disbelief that is required to move from one scene to the next. John Goodman is great in this, too, (once you've thrown reality out the door). I still have to give this a really poor rating, though, since it's incumbent on the viewer to recognize the farce in front of him/her - but it's a great straight man to make fun of.</fullReview>

Kevin plays the lead, and I don't know why they made his character somebody you just wanna bitch slap.A gang comes running after him, and he's on a busy street and decides to run into an alley -- not knowing where he's going, slipping and flopping around. Okay, that is so overdone in movies, geez. Then he runs into a parking lot, and goes around and around up to the top floor...setting off alarms the entire way, as he heads to the roof!!! Oh my god. I kept saying, "Why don't you f*ckin' hide, you f*ckin' dumb8ss!" Seriously, in a real life situation, why draw attention to yourself? There's an entire gang shooting and chasing after him...he was so far ahead...they wouldn't have known which way he was going - stuuuuuupid.Then he gets a stupid package and finds out for certain the gang's going to kill the rest of his family. OMG! This stupid8ss decides he's going to stay home. He knows the gang is after him, they know where he lives, and he feels okay staying home with his family with one patrol car outside. ARE YOU f(_)CKING kidding me? If you know people are going to kill you and your family, and know where you live... you don't spend another hour there!!!! Then you've got the incredibly annoying police detective. She's completely useless. You have no idea why she's even in the movie. Ugh.ARGH! Anyway, all these little stupid things that made zero sense just aggravated the hell out of me. I hate stupid movies with stupid characters.THe actors acted well, just the plot was incredibly dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Death Sentence for anyone who liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence was originally written by Brian Garfield the original author of the Charles Bronson 1974 classic 'Death Wish', it was said that he didn't like the sequels to the Bronson classic, and I can't blame him as the Death Wish series got worse with every film, but I can't imagine he would have been happy with this over the top, gratuitous crap that James Wan gives us in what I believe is one of the worst films of 2007.This is a real lesson that you can have a good story (Garfield's novel, not to be confused with the screenplay which is horrible), and a great lead in Kevin Bacon but it all comes down to whose behind the camera. James Wan seems to think that good film making involves one unbelievable scene after another that get almost ludicrous at times. One chase scene lasts so long during a crowded down town area, followed by a parking garage that you would think there are no police in the entire city, as one man is being haplessly chased by a pack of thugs with weapons drawn and firing. There is another scene in where a main character is killed and you swear it's a dream sequence, because it's so ridiculous, and it's NOT!!! I realized nearly three quarters of the way through this film that I don't even care who lives or dies anymore because it's so obvious that the filmmaker doesn't care either. Just text book bad movie making, but what can we expect from the guy who gave us torture porn crap like the 'Saw' series?What Wan, or anyone who liked this movie doesn't realize is the revenge plot/drama is something that appeals to most people. This is because when good people are horribly wronged it's so tempting to want to take justice into your own hands, and so easy to root for those who do as a movie goer. However, in this movie there is no drama at all, no real attempt at showing the protagonist as a torn individual battling right vs. wrong, or furthermore no attempt at giving the audience an opportunity to identify/sympathize with this guy because it all just feels so bogus. For anyone who wants to see better revenge dramas or movies of the like I implore them to watch the original 'Death Wish', or John Singleton's 'Four Brothers,' or Neil Jordan's 'The Brave One' here you will see real directing compared to Wan's juvenile trash.</fullReview>

I guess if some of these things happened to me, I would become a bad guy too. Kevin Bacon was bad in The River Wild and maybe even Mystic River, but he became really hardcore in Death Sentence. It was just so hard for me to believe his character role. Maybe if it was an actor like Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme or Sylvester Stallone, I would have said hell yes, but Kevin Bacon, no way. I think that the gang got exactly what was coming to them and more. The gang should not have been able to just walk away, especially after what they did to his family.

		<fullReview>I love revenge films,some of my friends did warn me about this one, but I gave it a try anyways. So, yes if you like mindless action movie, this might be for you, but I believe that,even a mindless movie needs a bit of attention to details so that it doesn't fall off. Death sentence started good, James Wan built the sentimental story around the family well, but then, once the problems started and the " revenge " action begun, it felt that he forgot about the family story. The movie became " Kevin Bacon Vs the thugs " forget the family. If the gang find you at your work,and actually shooting at you on the street won't you tell your family to stay away from home ? but No, so guess what happen next ?? this is just one example of the many holes in the movie. Bravo for the actors on their performance, but if you want to watch a recent revenge movie watch Neil Jordan's The Brave One instead.</fullReview>

That solves the problem. Nobody is mad at him anymore. He was just a frustrated father, who went to confront his son's killer, and was attacked.It was all self-defense, and everything went crazy from there. The kid had the knife, he (Bacon) took it and threw it away. Game over, he's a good guy again. He didn't start the violence in his wife's eyes, or the PD's. It's not like he's above lying either, he just killed a man. At that point, a little white lie isn't going to hurt anyone.The movie could go on, and I could be happy that he wasn't an idiot that couldn't think his way out of a small problem. Then he could go ballistic and kill everyone without the threat of imprisonment looming over his shoulder and the PD would be loving his ass instead of judging him.</fullReview>

When Kevin Bacon comes out of the hospital (with the music) he has this great look on his face, I just couldn't stop laughing. Also the acting wasn't to great. The moment when Kevin yells when his son got killed is bad acting.I saw Taxi Driver (with Robert De niro) and that is just everything Death sentence was meant to be.

		<fullReview>I first wanted to see this film when it first came out but never got to. Finally got it on DVD rental and what a let down...The film just seems so contrived and formulaic right from the start. From the impossibly happy smiling family, good job, successful bright kids, doting mother, (that you just know is going to be the subject of the violence to come) to the manic gang run by the smarter and just that bit cooler leader the clichés come thick and fast.The first murder scene could not have been more staged if they tried while Kevin Bacon's bizarre reaction to his son having his throat cut from ear to ear, just beggars belief (standing in an empty petrol station shouting for help).The revenge and counter-revenge acts are predictable with all the gore one would expect from the director of (the brilliant) Saw. The police are portrayed as probably the most stupid inept bunch of yokels since Police Academy while John Goodman is sadly under used in a sort of Big Lebowski II role.I suppose overall the film was watchable (once) but nothing more than that. Given that the book on which it is based is a follow up to Death Wish, I suppose the resulting film is not too surprising. However, it has all been done before and contains little lift it above the mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad its almost good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both my wife and myself were originally very interested in this movie when we saw a trailer for it last year. My awareness of it stopped at that point until I saw the DVD in a store and wondered at how much of a bad sign that was.Most of the film felt like a music video and everything seemed simplified down to that level. For instance, the 'bad buys' live in an abandoned church beside Stygian drive which seemed like a ham-fisted attempt at foreshadowing the point that by the time our mild mannered button pusher (he does a good Jackie Chan impersonation when he's angry, though I'll get to that in a minute) arrives there, he'll have had to journey into his own hell.Why an abandoned church? No idea, but its moody and gnarly and a good excuse to summon up as much of Fincher's lighting mojo as possible and maybe distract as much as possible from the ridiculous plot?Anyway, its the central conceit about how much a person can change when under pressure that really makes this one stink. There is not character progression, one minute he's hooo, humming to himself in front of a spreadsheet at work, the next minute he's suddenly found the balls and the physical pedigree to ape combat with a dozen gun toting lowlifes with more panache than Jackie Chan.Along the way we're introduced to the notion though an 80's montage style collection of home video's that show what a great dad he is, how much he loves his wife and kids, how much they love him back etc.When things go wrong and its clear the character that has been described to us so far, will do anything he can to protect the rest of his family, he decides to recklessly do everything he can to put them and himself in as much danger as possible.It's clear from the trailer that this is a story about a mild mannered house hubby pushed to far and driven to make himself into enough of a monster that he can gain revenge on the monsters than ruined his life.The hope was that there would be some kind of entertaining explanation of WHY or HOW he would do this. Likewise you would hope for some well thought out consequences of this action that relate to the real world issues involved in becoming a gun toting vigilante. These are the reasons we pay for a movie, we like the premise, we want to have it expanded upon in an entertaining way.There is no expansion, the trailer is it, the story never goes beyond the elevator pitch and the ride to the finish line feels like its best enjoyed in a clown car, that's lost in the desert hoping something will turn up... like a plot for instance.If you go into this film looking for a laugh, like you would watch Final Destination 3 ( knowing that all chance or fright is past and all that remains is cackling with glee at how ridiculously long-winded and non related to reality the next death will be), then great, this is a guaranteed hit, but if you are looking for a good film, the type of thing you might more routinely be looking for when an actor of Bacon's caliber is involved, take a wide berth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick Directing In An Other-Wise Average Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his son is murdered in front of his eyes at a gas station, Nick Hume, knowing the murderer will get out on the streets a few years later decides to take the law into his own hands. He soon finds himself on the run from the gang and desperately trying to protect his family.This plot might sound familiar and that's because it's been done numerous times before with Bronson and coincidentally, the same year as The Brave One. Kevin Bacon plays the father who loses his son to a random crime and while sometimes his performance is lackluster, other times he seems to hit the right notes. His struggle with the death of his son, the horrors of killing another man and the fear for his family's safety takes a tole on a character and Bacon manages to pull it off in the end. This man goes from having the best life, to having next to nothing.The film seems to flow in two different directions, thrilling and depressing. It's always hard to walk a fine line between two genres and here it works, for the most part. We never really get a chance to connect with the kid who dies at the beginning. The film opens with a montage of the kids life through a camera, then we see that he is a star athlete for Hockey and then he dies. If the film took another scene or two extra to set some kind of connection between this character, then the audience would be able to feel for Nick more. As a result, we never get the chance to feel what Nick is feeling. We know he lost his son and it is sad, but we are watching it and not feeling it. It's important for the viewer to feel this connection because that determines whether or not his actions are justified in the audiences eyes. Is one life for another justified? Nick makes the mistake of thinking so.After he kills the one who killed his son (these are not spoilers because this is exactly what the film is about) his fellow gang members find out who did it and strike fear into his eyes. They attempt to kill Nick in broad day light, but it's unsuccessful, which then leads to a thrilling chase scenes, executed very well. While we may not think what Nick did was right, we do not want anymore sorrow it hit him or his family, we root for him to make it out alive.The film does what I thought it would never do, it throws a curve ball. I was shocked and I applaud the filmmakers for doing so. It makes the events seem more realistic, not everything goes this characters way, there are bumps in the road and he's make that bumps bigger and badder. This event is so striking that Nick goes into a terminator mode, by shaving his head and loading up on a lot of guns. This is where the film takes a weird turn.After having some trouble learning how to use the guns, Nick is off to end this war once and for all. Again, with a shaved head (actually a poor one, still some hair on the back side) he for some reason becomes a killing machine, wielding a shot gun, hand guns and Dirty Harry's favourite magnum. It's a stretch to believe this suit can do all this damage. Then again, one of the themes of the film is that you can do pretty much anything if the occasion calls for it.While parts of the script are laughable, the direction is very well done. Young filmmaker James Wan, of Saw fame, creates thrilling chase sequences and nice camera movements. It makes up for some shoddy area in the script and the depressing scenes from prior. There is one sequence though that I couldn't help but laugh at, when Bacon walks away from a car unscratched, after having it plow through a van ripping it in half.John Goodman has a small role and he seems to be enjoying himself here. Which is nice to see because everything else is....you guessed it, depressing. I have yet to see The Brave One, so there is no comparison here. I hear good things about Foster's performance and that film seemed to push this one out of the lime light. It's not that this film is bad, it just needs some work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why oh why have so many movies of late started well only to fall fantastically flat halfway through?!? There are so many good things about this movie - and if it had stayed true to its promise of being a Revenge Flick - it could have been one of the best movies I'd seen in a while. **** Slight spoiler***But right in the middle it just gets stupid - actually if you just stop the movie at about 1:07 and skip to about 1:24, you'll do good.Many others have already talked about how stupid it is to think the gang members are going to slay a couple of cops and still be hanging out a few days later. Cop killers usually wind-up dead or close to it. And get your frickin' wife and kid out of the house - send them to stay with Grandma or whatever - just too unbelievable. Oh - and who in the Hell would wait THAT long to get a damn gun - you can walk in to any Wal-mart and walk out with a shotgun - I mean, come the f**k on!?!I'm not saying don't watch it, just don't think that nice ride you're on for most of the movie isn't going to derail into an unnecessary emo train wreck just when you're ready for the turbo drive to kick in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without giving away any plot spoilers, I was impressed with this film. But then again, anything with Bacon in it is at least moderately good. He always chooses something with a storyline, if nothing else. And in it, Bacon is Bacon: having shed the villain role for this one, he is the main suffering protagonist instead, and highly watchable right through to the end.The film made me feel emotional and my gut churn in places - and my companion said that he thought it just got better and better.It was thought provoking and the characters are more than the one dimensional stock ones that we are growing accustomed to in some films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was full of entertainment. I don't know if it made it to the big screen in Ireland but if it didn't it should have. The whole idea of the film was great, a man on a mission of revenge.Even though i have seen films fairly similar to this one, like one done about 5 years ago starring the unlikely Jean Claude van damme, yes i know his films are rubbish, apart for the one I'm on about but i cant remember its name, but anyhow Death Sentence is truly one of the films that you get into and kind of put yourself in his position and imagine what it would be like to have to go through what he goes through in it... don't think i would have gone to the extremes like him.All in all, the film was realistic in the sense that some people might take the law into their own hands and go nuts, but maybe not to the extremes that he goes into.Just wanna give credit to the director for keeping me us in suspense for the duration...keep it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I have given this five for one reason. I don't know how to rate this so I have split straight down the middle. Firstly I was not disappointed in the film. The story line, although not original was certainly good enough to keep me interested. The action scenes were good as well with enough guts and gore if you like that sort of thing, but not too much that isn't appropriate. So what is wrong with the film then. Well, the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Kevin Bacon should not have done this film. That is not to say he wasn't any good, just that the role was not him. And consistency was not there. Not consistency within the film, but the films consistency with real life. I was left thinking that would never happen on a few occasions, or why did he do that, thats ridiculous? But saying that I watched it all, and will no doubt watch it again at some point when there is something less interesting on. All in all, a slightly enjoyable yet forgettable hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but not brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the general story of this film almost totally unbelievable. Having said that, it wasn't unwatchable &amp; had more than a few saving graces.After a few minutes, it becomes apparent that this isn't going to be a courtroom drama. I think it could've served better by posing the question of the right or wrongfulness of the death sentence. Instead, it asks 'how far will you go to protect your family?'. I'm not a fan of action films but persevered &amp; I'm glad I did. The scripting &amp; direction of the gang members was laughable, as was most of the premise of the whole. What saved this film, for me, was the comic strip effect. I think the way the characters were portrayed gave a sort of 'Sin City' feel, albeit without the clever graphics. If it had taken itself any more seriously, it would have been a complete waste of time. John Goodman is suitably sinister &amp; almost stole the show.If this movie had starred Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal, I would have avoided it, but Kevin Bacon does his best to make an unbelievable plot work &amp; piqued my interest enough to see the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but definitely could've been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of vigilante films, so naturally I was drawn to 'Death Sentence'. Kevin Bacon is a hit or miss actor, although he's been on a tear as of late; particularly in The Woodsman and Mystic River. His performance in 'Death Sentence' is one of the bright points of the film, but lack of a cohesive plot keeps it from truly being special.Bacon plays his character pretty well, balancing the fine line between "I was born to do this" and "what the hell am I thinking?" dilemma and showcasing it very well. I felt that he really hit home with his performance. The plot, however, leaves you scratching your head in some areas. The most glaring one to me was this: after Nick Hume (Bacon) starts on his vigilante crusade, killing the person who murdered his son; it was as if his character thought that everything was going to magically disappear and everyone would forget everything, bad guys especially. Of course, it doesn't, and the gang responsible goes after him (it took NOTHING for them to figure out who killed their member), and tries to kill him in broad daylight. Hume escapes this attempt, killing ANOTHER member of the gang. Yet, he goes home that night and reports to work the next morning like nothing happened! It only makes PERFECT sense at this point to get what family you have left and take them someplace. There's no, 'honey get the kid and stay at your mothers' here. I found that to be total trash; for the lead character to be so illogical it was unbelievable. There are a lot more plot holes throughout the film, which is pretty typical of Wan.Its a decent movie that will entertain you for 1.25 hours or so. If one can look pass the glaring plot holes (VERY hard feat to do) I have no doubt that you'll find it entertaining and fun-loving.6/10P.S. I'm curious as to how Foster's film deals with the vigilante issue. Charles Bronoson's 'Death Wish' is still King at number one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense and gripping movie (plot details and spoilers mentioned)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DEATH SENTENCE is based on a novel by Brian Garfield. He also wrote the novel that DEATH WISH was based on. There are a lot of similarities between both movies (I haven't read the books so I don't know if the movies deviate from the books), but DEATH SENTENCE is by far a better movie.Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), is a happily married man whose life is devastated, when his older son is killed in an attack on a gas station. When Hume discovers that the killer is only going to get a short spell behind bars, he goes after the man himself little realizing the effect this will bring on his remaining family....James Wan, who directed the SAW and DEAD SILENCE (both movies I enjoyed), handles the material well. The action is well handled, but crucially however, he also gives Hume and his family time in the movie to show how the violence affects both him, as he gets sucked in further, and his family as his actions spiral out of control. He also stages on of my favourite scenes of the year so far, a foot chase through the streets ending in a chase in a multi-level car park totally grips with a tension packed climax to the scene. Wan is becoming an upcoming director to watch out for.The real success of this movie is Kevin Bacon. A criminally under-rated actor he dominates the movie. The supporting cast lead by Kelly Preston as his wife do their best but are in Bacon's shadow. He looks comfortable when the action erupts, but his grief over his sons' death gives him some good material to work with, and for an actor of his caliber he doesn't disappoint.The success of this movie over the recent THE BRAVE ONE, which has similar themes, is that when the violence begins, Hume doesn't find killing easy. He finds it harder to do than he thought, though as the movie progresses and the violence escalates, he has to resort to more desperate measures to protect his family. Only at the movie climax, after Hume is convinced he's lost everything, does the movie get a little out of control as he faces up the gang in their hide-out. But even here it's saved in a climatic face to face scene between Hume, and the gang leader as we see how their choices have led to this end. And one of the clever things is how Hume has to become as brutal or worse than those he's facing to take them on. The line "look what we made you" sticks with you after the movie as you do truly see how the effects of violence. And unlike other movies, it doesn't give you a happy ending... just a real and proper one. It deserves credit for that.This is one of the best movies I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite enormous plot holes and implausibility Death Sentence somehow really impresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me confess right out of the gate that I am a huge Charles Bronson fan and therefore loved every Death Wish film that he could crank out. However the truth is I didn't even know Death Sentence was a loose remake or retelling of Death Wish, I just thought they shared similar plots and styles. When I think about Death Sentence it does strike me how many gaping plot holes there were and scenes with just ridiculous stunts and points and yet I loved almost every minute of it. I mean had they overcome those plot holes this would have been a huge 10/10 for me. The amazing part was this film really did have a lot of emotion and deep messages and it literally almost had me in tears at different points and despite it's deep sentimental message is this dark, horrible, brutally violent story about a man consumed with vengeance. Very young and yet very talented writer and director James Wan brings his gritty style and yet great storytelling ability to the film. Despite creating one of the greatest horror series of the new millennium (Saw) Wan seems to have an issue with try to create a sense of realism which helps make the film more believable. Kevin Bacon's character has no prior experience with fighting or weapons or guns and yet can take on this entire street hardened gang and come out on top. It's just little things like that, that can wear thin on your reality meter.Kevin Bacon is devoted father and husband Nick Hume. Now I've read some reviews that say Bacon's performance is way overblown and in some aspects I do agree but at the same time maybe we're just not used to seeing this much emotion out of Bacon. And how can anyone judge an overreacted from someone who loses his family? I think Bacon is strong enough on screen to really draw you into his character and really feel the emotions that he is feeling with just maybe a few scenes that are overdone. Kelly Preston plays a small but important role as Bacon's wife Helen. A lot of her scenes come from her grief of losing a son and she is very good at playing the motherly role. Stuart Lafferty is also good in a small role as the star son of their family who is murdered during a robbery gone bad. Jordan Garrett is terrific as their younger son trying to deal with the loss of his brother. He does a really amazing job. Garrett Hedlund is appropriately slimy as the young punk that murders Bacon's son. John Goodman (who I love and is terrific in this cameo) and Aisha Tyler both have important if not slightly small roles in the film and do pretty well.The truth is the spotlight is on Bacon and I think he does a great job of handling that. The role is an intense roller coaster with plenty of emotions and morally ambiguous moments. Death Sentence really never attempts to question whether or not what he is doing is right...they leave that up to more serious films like The Brave One (see my review) but instead Death Sentence's main character is going to kill and destroy and get his vengeance no matter what and by the time he arms himself, shaves his head and dons the dark jacket it has turned into a blood splattered vengeance flick the likes I haven't seen in years. It's no holds barred and just really intense and fun to watch. Death Sentence may not have done well but it is one of the better films I saw in the last little while and if you're looking for a decent action flick with good performances and a good strong story than Death Sentence will not let you down. I think it's very underrated and I thought it was excellent. 8.5/10</fullReview>

Graphic 21st century update of "DEATH WISH" ? Ian Jeffers' screenplay is based on Brian Garfield's novel (he also wrote WISH) ? about a family torn apart when their idyllic life comes to a crashing halt as their eldest son is murdered in a gang-land initiation which sends the father (Bacon acquitting himself nicely) into a downward spiral of vengeance which has its ultimate price to pay. Filmmaker James Wan handles the carnage with aplomb but some of the choices for conveying emotional turmoil is heavy handed (i.e. ethereal chorus) but gets the job done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving and Resonating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Death Sentence begins with what the audience can assume are the Hume's home videos-- they begin with the boys, Brendan and Lucas, at young ages and slowly progress until their recent years. As you watch, you can see that Brendan is in many more of the videos and is the "Golden Boy"; a top athlete, and a real dad's son whereas Lucas seems more sensitive and closer with his mom. The movie really begins when Nicholas Hume (Bacon) hits a gas station in a rough part of town. His son is murdered, leaving Nicholas in a place he's never been. Honestly, the movie did a great job portraying the strong bond between father and son, and the grief shared by the family was played out incredibly well, giving the heartstrings a real tug (the last movie I was holding back tears at was Braveheart). When Hume learns a life sentence isn't plausible for the character, due to limited evidence and witnesses, Hume decides to take matters into his own hands. A parent out for revenge, he manages to get on the bad side of a dangerous gang. A very bad side. As the gang pursues him, Hume works hard to save himself which only makes the "war" even worse. When his family is threatened, Hume realizes that he's created something that may be too big to swallow. However, Hume is determined and decides he won't stop until he's dead-- him, or the gang. The gore is bearable for those with a weak stomach, though those who went to the movie hoping for nonstop action and shoot-outs will be disappointed because the movie also takes time to develop and portray the emotions all the characters are feeling, from the bad guys to the good guys. The movie does an excellent job with the transformation of Hume as he goes from the mild-mannered family guy to a vengeful murderer. I found it a good balance-- good character development and portrayal, a good plot that isn't lost due to constant shooting scenes, emotionally involving, and a good portion of violence. It's also a movie that will stick with you even after the credits are done rolling. As I said though, this movie isn't focused on either far end of the stick-- don't go expecting pure action, and don't go expecting something filled with pure dialog and drama.</fullReview>

The acting was OK, the gore was great, the plot was okay, the story was decent. Kevin Bacon would not have been my first choice but he pulled it off. The cinematography was especially notable and it had a kind of "Saw" , gritty feel to it. I hope the DVD version contains some of the obviously edited material, such as the ending. I was sorry to see the film did not do well financially, overshadowed in the opening week by Halloween, which was also excellent, then knocked out of the top 10 this weekend altogether, I guess this edition will not spawn any sequels of Bacon's character now going to Chicago, LA or wherever. That's too bad because the plot line has potential. But I don't think these films cost all that much to make so who knows?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective revenge thriller. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing the previews to the 2007 thriller-drama, Death Sentence, my first impression was that this was the updated, male version of the Sally Field movie, 'Eye for an Eye' in which an average suburban woman avenges her teenage daughter's murderer. Here, Kevin Bacon plays the seemingly happy-go-lucky husband and father of two. One night, while driving home, his eldest son becomes the victim of a gang initiation. Because the District Attorney has little concrete evidence for a strong case against the killer, who is promised to serve at least a three to five year term, the grieving father decides to take matters into his own hands. Yet, his actions set off a gang war from which he now must defend both himself and his family.This movie is much more effective than the standard revenge thriller as it promises plenty of action and even, in Bacon's transformation from white collar risk-management analyst and happy suburbanite to something of a fast-thinking, quick-shooting gritty gangster, it sustains an air of "cool" which goes well beyond movies like 'Eye for an Eye,' 'Man on Fire' or 'In the Bedroom' (though the latter is arguably outside of this action-packed genre) in terms of sustaining interest as he tracks down his adversaries, culminating of course in the ultimate showdown. The film maintains its steady pacing and delivers to audiences not just the elements of drama, but enough juicy action sequences (and a cherry chase scene) throughout the film to the point that the atmosphere of the finale stands in stark contrast to the opening of the film. Moreover, it presents a story that doesn't press black and white morality, but instead, leaves for plenty of gray area. Bacon is neither the clean hero and even the gangsters are sometimes glorified. It also helps that the cast give terrific performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Sentence is a revenge film, I think everyone knows that, or if not.. Has a kind of inclination that it is. First off, the reviews which were written about this film are simply brutal and too be honest, with some of the cynicism, I actually thought some critics were merely going off what other critics have wrote about this film and then thinking, '' ah what's the point, who needs to see a movie anyway to really get the notion..'' The film sees Kevin Bacon basically having a perfect family life and really good relations with his sons and his wife. The film opens with archive footage of the family (Home video's basically.) this easily settles you in with the atmosphere of the perfect family, it is the disruption which unsettles the film and makes you feel quite empty inside, as if you're the father, who's just watched your own son being murdered.Some strong roles throughout the film, Kevin Bacon attaching himself passionately it seems and showing a really strong performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Transformation of a Vulnerable Psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking into this movie, knowing full well the director's already notorious, easy to spot traits that range from the extreme contrast of the picture to the seemingly bottomless pit of violence that pushes the envelope right out the window. We are shown a family, more importantly, a man who is living nonetheless than the American dream: a solid desk job, a nice home in a safe neighborhood, and a loving family that includes a caring wife and two sons who each walk a path of their own. Unlike Wan, a scene of serenity is introduced instead of jumping right into the blood, which, when it is snatched away into the darkness, makes the transition of the movie all the more devastating. You wonder while watching, as stated in the film, "If that were to happen to my family, I don't know what i would do." And what this film does is explore one of the seemingly endless possibilities that may arise from the mind of a shattered man, who, after supplying a home, food and funds for his family's comfort, is stripped of a loved one for reasons that deserve no justification. You aren't however so quick to follow Nick's (Bacon) efforts to take justice into his own soon to be bloody hands, you are merely there to observe sanity and control be stripped away, leaving a man who, in the end, within his own world, has nothing left to lose, so he's going to take as many people with him as he can, to where all he has left, are his home movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action movies need not be realistic. True to this unstated axiom, multitude films are made just to boost in us that coveted adrenaline rush. Gravity defying, Physics law mocking, sense denying, the action sequences are there just to give us that vicarious feeling of possessing superhuman prowess and dispensing ruthless vengeance --- Nothing wrong in that. Problem arises when an action movie pretends to be closer to reality and at the same time be senseless, logicless. That is precisely the issue with 'Death Sentence'. Initially, the movie shows the life of a happy-go-rich average American family till tragedy strikes it and then suddenly it transforms into a murderous conniving vengeance story - reality thrown out of the frame. Result - after wasting a good one and half hour (the last part I just fast forwarded) the movie lands in the bottom of my list.As the tagline of the movie says, Protect what's yours.......time.....stay away.

		<fullReview>One of the most stupid movies I have ever wasted time watching. How they ever got Kevin Bacon in this reeker I'll never know. Full of clichés, situations that defy the most remote sense of reality, and utter, abject nonsense. As usual in this type of film, the cops are powerless, and stupid - not only do they overlook Bacon's obvious commission of the first gang member's murder, they advise him to do whatever the gang-leader tells him. Even the dead cops that were supposed to guard the house didn't spur the dopey detective into action. Most of the movie has Bacon running around over-acting and wondering what to do. And why would the gang need his briefcase to find out where he lived? Wouldn't the trial have made that data public knowledge? Just look in the newspaper. Ditto with their surprise at discovering he wasn't dead after they shot him, wouldn't that have been something they would have verified?Even the filming is annoying - short, jerky segments, seemingly shot with an old 8mm Kodak. A silly, infantile film with an ending that evokes more laughs than suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm convinced that the only reason that a lot of fine players took roles in this film is that it gave them a chance to overact outrageously, something you normally get to do in some gruesome slasher flick and not be noticed. Although I have to say that Death Sentence gets pretty gruesome and I can't find much redeeming social content in it.Kevin Bacon and son Stuart Lafferty take a wrong turn after a hockey game and wind up on the wrong side of town and in the clutches of a skinhead gang. Lafferty winds up killed and the boy arrested for the crime, Matt O'Leary is later killed by Bacon who goes after him. Now Bacon's family the Humes are this upper middle class yuppie family and really aren't ready for the blood feud it brings down on them. Especially from Garrett Hedlund the older brother and head of the skinhead gang. He's learned his family trade and values from papa John Goodman, a man with a hand in all kinds of illegality. In a movie like Death Sentence accent is on the first word, a whole lot of people die in this thing before its over. Let's just say the Darleys are a lot better equipped to deal in blood, but Kevin Bacon is a fast learner.Not that he's getting much help from the police. Two uniform cops sent to guard his family get killed by the skinheads so the words of Detective Aisha Tyler are kind of hollow.A lot of overacting, plenty of blood, guts, and guns characterize Death Sentence. If that's what you like in film, go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now granted this is a revenge movie, so there are going to be things that are sitting outside the realm of reality. And this movie is no exception. But the lack of realism is not the main problem with this film. The entire set up is stupid. Mr. Hume (Bacon) decides to stop at the seedy little gas station, about two seconds after being accosted on the road by some speeding thugs. Any normal person would have driven down the road a bit for a better opportunity. It was not like he was going to run out of gas at that very second since the "low fuel" light just came on. He could have easily gone 15-20 miles down the road with no problem. No suburbanite in their right minds would have stopped there.Bacon is OK, as usual he delivers a solid performance. The rest of the cast however is not very strong. Without exception they all seem rehearsed and forced and none of the lines or character development seem real. For this I can only blame the director since every actor cannot stink.The police are portrayed as bumbling idiots. The entire story about how it was Hume's word again the killer's is idiotic. The person who hit the killer with his car would have certainly been able to put the killer at the store and if the CSI team could not find ONE drop of blood on the killer they were not very good. Then the two cops watching the Hume's house were killed, having their throats slit while they say in the car. First off this is silly, no cops sit there laughing with their windows open when they are protecting a family from killers.Then the killers are apparently so poor at....um....killing..... that they leave the Hume family for dead after 3 shoddy shots. And why stay at the house at all? Why not leave the state altogether? Who sits there and waits for the killers to come and kill them? The fact that Bacon becomes a super killer himself, while not entirely plausible is not that hard to buy. The fact that he goes to the gang members father to buy guns is too much.... Is this man the only illegal gun dealer in the city? I don't think so. And as a pistol owner myself who goes to the range regularly I can tell you that most people, shooting for the first time can't hit anything from more than a few feet. It takes a good 100 rounds of shooting until you get a good accurate feel for the gun where you can hit anything with regularity. They could have made the entire story more plausible if they either showed Bacon taking some practice shots, or even if they had said he was once in the military or anything like that.The plot of the movie is thin too, but again for this type of movie it is not a big deal. The movies moves at a good pace, there is not a lot of lag time but you still finding yourself seeking the end. Killing the wife and 2nd kid was enough to send Bacon on a killing spree but did they really need that? The death of his older son alone was enough to send Hume on a vigilante hunt. So the mere threat alone should have been enough. It seemed the killing of his wife was only for shock value and nothing more....All in all it was a paltry attempt at a revenge film. As My Chemical Romance said "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge" and seeing as how this movie has a very good overall score I guess that stands even if the movie is not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the movie that finally convinced me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that there are shills for the studios writing reviews on IMDb. When other reviewers have mentioned it, I simply chalked it up to "conspiracy theory" mentality. I can no longer do so. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to "Death Sentence" getting a 6.9 rating.I mostly blame the writers. This is one lazily-written movie, borrowing plot points and dialogue from a wide variety of revenge thrillers. In fact, I'm not sure that I can identify one original aspect of this movie.To say that the plot is unbelievable simply doesn't do it justice. Perhaps the most irritating aspect is the detachment and lack of concern on the part of the police. They don't seem very concerned when the star-athlete, white-bread teenager dies during a vicious initiation murder. (Yeah, happening all the time, isn't it?) They don't seem that interested when the murderer gets murdered in turn, even though they know very well who did it. They don't get excited when six or seven gang members stage a ten-minute shootout in the streets and in a nearby parking garage. They don't even get excited when two cops get their throats cut while sitting in a patrol car outside the victim's home. By "excited" I mean, of course, actually doing anything constructive.Very frustrating movie done very poorly. The icing on the cake is the CGI blood in the shoot-out scenes. For this I blame gamers and fans of "300".Not worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so up to this point director James Wan has at least not made any garbage. That cannot be said about other said up and comers (cough...Eli Roth...cough) To this point both Saw and Dead Silence were at least at their simplest marginally entertaining, your mileage may very but for me I like this guy and hope that he stays clear of becoming to mainstream or adding unnecessary humor in his films(cough...Roth...cough) man I got a nasty cold. Anyway now he is trying his hat in the revenge flick business with his new offering Death Sentence.Death Sentence tells the tale of Nick Hume who one day while bring his son back from a Hockey game watches in terror as his son is slashed to death in a gas station check out line. Upon his attempt to stop the would be killer he manages to "subdue" him for arrest. Upon advice from the attorney to accept a sentence of 3-5 years Hume decides to throw the case out the window and opts for his own brand of justice. Hume's act of vengeance results in a spiral down effect that slowly begins to effect him and the remainder of his family as the young man is part of a gang and his sons death a mere initiation right. Now with an entire gang that has stalked and killed another of his family he only has one other choice total annihilation of all involved..I really liked the set up of this film and the overall violent content. We get shotgun blasts to chest with full on bloody holes being administered, fingers shot off, head shots and in one awesome kill scene a leg being blown away then another chest shot. A nice array of the red stuff occurs which is all good but the problem lies with the pacing of the action. There are near 30 minute sequences without any violence then we are hit with some violence here and there then no action but then it is followed up with a 20 minute free for all ending that is handled very well for the most part. Look for John Goodman as a gunrunner as his scenes are rather amusing.This is really designed for only one fan and one fan only...the revenge flick fan. If you go into this thinking it is going to have super realistic situations and scenarios then go watch a drama or something as you are more than likely going to point out its flaws and not enjoy it for what it is. Saying that though I will say that it is not perfect but definitely has its moments. If you are hard up for a cool revenge flick and have some time for a matinée this is an ideal film to see. It definitely is not at the top of the revenge flick list but it does a nice job with doing what it sets out to do.In the end a better than average revenge flick, worthy of a Matinée viewing at least, for some maybe full price especially those who enjoy violence, just be prepared for some lulls.Score 6/10: Above Average. If a few more scenes of violence were added or some of the movie edited down some this would have made for an even better experience, still it does deliver for the most part and a rather fun view....Wan continues to make that above average film keep up the work my friend!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Bacon doesn't dance foot loose in this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon does not dance 'Foot Loose' in this film. Kevin Bacon's film career has gone full circle. 'Foot Loose' a teenage rebel in a small town who starts a dance is far different to Death Sentence. A retro 70's film which mixes 'Death Wish' with 'Taxi Driver'. A excellently executed film which explains the cycle of violence. The court room scene is a tribute to Death Wish with the failure of the system; the gun fight scene with the fingers, nick injury, and Kevin sitting on the couch is a homage to 'Taxi Driver'. If one has seen 'Taxi' driver they will notice the similarities. No Kevin did not break out into a dance in the middle of the gun fight. 'Foot Loose' was a way different film, and Death Sentence has much deeper message. The 'Bible' speaks about violence begets more violence, which the film demonstrates. The Chinies' two grave theory hit with a vengeance for the protagonist, his family and the cops. I noticed the Netch theory ending of one becoming a monster when they go out hunting monsters. The protagonist transformation is the thesis of 'Death Sentence' analogy of violence and revenge. 8 out of 10. What a evil world we do live in. I hope God does not judge us to harshly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I gave this movie a rating of "1" is that no "zero" was available. "Death Sentence" may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's on the shortlist. The direction and cinematography are horrid, the plot, characterizations and writing are tired, predictable and derivative (of the screenwriter's OWN WORK, inexcusably) and the considerable talents of Kevin Bacon and Kelly Preston are --- from the opening scene through the closing scene --- wholly wasted on this mindless drivel. If you are a fan of either of those actors (as I am), you should avoid this mess, because it will leave a sour taste in your mouth for them and cause you to wonder about things like integrity. Even if you're not a fan of anyone involved in the movie, you should avoid it because it will try your patience (each scene is less plausible than the one it follows) and waste your life. It'll also cause eye fatigue . . . from excess rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentence Yourself to Death First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to conclude that Death Sentence is the stupidest movie I have seen in some time. Each and every scene is flawed. In the beginning, Kevin Bacon's son has his throat slashed. He leaves his son there to bleed out so he can tackle a masked assailant (who has a machete and has proved a willingness to kill at random). He then screams for help instead of using a phone to call 911. Hopefully the clerk who has just been pumped with a shotgun at short range will help. The killer is hit by a car at high speed, only to walk into a lineup days later. The beat goes on: Bacon cuts his hand killing the killer, but the detective doesn't even ask him about the cut the very day after the body is found. Somehow, the timid father kills another gang member, and when they threaten his family, he calls them as fast as he can, as anyone would. Not to tell them to get out of the house, of course but to stay in it! The thought process goes something like this: They have our address, so let's stay here tonight so they can kill us in our own home. Then after they kill my wife and nearly kill my other son, I can escape from the hospital to become The Punisher. I have to shave my head of course, and then buy some guns. I'll buy them from the father of the boy I killed and the one I'm going to kill. When he finds out, he'll let me continue on my way. After all, he's only going to be killed by his own son in the next scene for no reason whatsoever. That'll leave me to kill 10 gangsters, while ONLY being shot in the neck and kidney. With these minor wounds, I can go home. I don't need medical attention as much as I need to watch some home movies, so I'll get the VCR going. Good times I'd say.This movie is pure garbage. If I could give it a negative integer, say -8 out of 10, I would feel a little more satisfied. All I have said says nothing of the acting, which is atrocious. Nobody does a good job. Bacon is contrived, Preston reinvents overacting, and the rest are all as bad or worse. Even John Goodman cannot save this movie. I would rather be sentenced to death than to have to watch this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing mess AND delightfully trashy fun, all at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that James Wan, director of the original (and best) Saw movie, was to be directing Kevin Bacon in a vigilante movie, I was very excited. For a fan of gritty revenge dramas, this seemed like a dream come true: Bacon is an impressive actor capable of turning his hand to almost any genre, and Wan had already proved that he wasn't afraid to try and push the limits. Could this film be a modern day classic of the genre: a grim, realistic, and excessively violent shocker designed to appeal to our basic raw emotions?Well, no, actually. Death Sentence turns out to be an over-sentimental, poorly scripted, and plot-hole ridden mess. But it's a mess that I quite enjoyed, albeit for reasons most likely never intended by its makers.Bacon plays Nick Hume, loving husband and father of two boys, whose life is turned upside-down when his eldest son is murdered in front of his eyes by a gang-member. The criminal is arrested, but when it becomes evident to Nick that the US legal system is going to fail him, he takes the law into his own hands, and dispenses his own brand of justice: a knife in the chest for the street thug. In becoming a vigilante, however, he puts the rest of his family in danger and must ultimately travel much further down the path of vengeance than he originally envisaged.As events go from bad to worse for the protagonist, realism goes out of the window, characters become cartoonish stereotypes, logic takes a back seat, and Death Sentence becomes enjoyable only for its sheer audacity. I doubt very much if this was what Wan had in mind: from the earnest performances, numerous mawkish moments, and sober handling of even the most unbelievable scenes, I think he wanted us to genuinely feel Hume's pain, understand his difficult decisions, and relish his revenge. It doesn't work, and, as a tragedy, the film is a huge failure.Not to worry, though, because when viewed as an exploitative thrill-ride, it is far more successful. Exciting and often rather (unintentionally) amusing, Death Sentence is definitely a much better experience when taken less seriously: Hume's lame attempts at hiding his guilt (and bandaged hand) are hilarious; his incredible leap to safety from certain death in a falling car is nothing short of miraculous; making the decision NOT to send his family to a safe location is shout-at-the-screen frustratingly stupid; and Bacon's remarkable transformation from mild-mannered dad to indestructible one-man killing machine is a joy to behold for fan's of trashy cinema.I give Death Sentence 5.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 6 for IMDb), because, despite it really being a bad film, it made me smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen the commercial to this film, then you should already know that's exactly what you're getting. Nothing but violence and long chase scenes. Kevin Bacon is a very good actor, but anybody could've played his role in this one. He had very few lines in almost every scene and his character was dull and uninteresting. In effort to not have any character development, we start the movie with 4 to 5 minutes of family home movies that will have you squirming by the first 30 seconds.Onto the plot...if you can call it that. Nick Hume's (Bacon) oldest son gets killed in a liquor store. When Nick goes out and kills one of the villains, the whole gang comes after him. That and a 10 minute chase scene through alleyways, a bunch of scenes of Bacon sitting quietly in his house, car or office and pointless chitter chatter make up the movie. One good thing about the film, however was John Goodman as a dirty, profane arms dealer. But Goodman obviously couldn't carry the film alone considering he maybe had 10 minutes screen time tops.All in all, this was a very dissatisfying film that left me wanting more (more plot, dialog...no more graphic violence!) My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 104 mins. R for violence and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Generally speaking, I love the revenge/vigilante justice genre. Specifically speaking, this one is just garbage. It has no soul ... just tons of gun play and fireworks. When the genre is at its best, the viewer is sucked in to rationalizing the vigilante actions of the tormented protagonist. In "Death Sentence", we are robbed of the emotional breakdown ... plus we only get one moment of "snap"! Brought to us by director James Wan (the infinitely better "Saw") and novelist Brian Garfield (the infinitely better "Death Wish" series) and screenplay by Ian Jeffers (who should be prevented from touching a keyboard for infinity and beyond); "Death Sentence" is a poorly written, rarely believable train wreck. This genre only works when reality plays a role.On the plus side, Kevin Bacon (of whom I am not much of a fan) is tremendous and does his best to play it with raw emotion. What a shame he wastes such a performance on a poorly written script. Also strong is Garrett Hedlund (also very good in "Friday Night Lights") as the gang leader who starts this mess by encouraging a rookie to become a man by killing Bacon's golden child son. A real hoot, John Goodman seems to have a blast playing a bad guy and back alley gun dealer. Those are the thickest lenses I have ever seen on a pair of glasses! On the negative, everything else. In particular Aisha Tyler, in the stereotypical detective role, is brutally awful as an actress and it is amplified here by some of the worst writing one will ever experience on screen. I assume she rebuffed Ian Jeffers advances and he decided to seek revenge by giving her Hollywood's worst lines.If you are desperate for gunplay, blood and violence and don't feel the need for a decent story or realistic dialogue, then this is your movie.</fullReview>

Indeed, Kevin Bacon did act like a action hero, but not as a broken hero. Too superficial, not enough character plot, not enough of these things great actors are trying such a lot, but do fail so many times.

		<shortDescription>A film for the avid thriller/revenge fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I chose to see Death Sentence, the latest thriller from director/writer of the Saw series James Wan, I thought I knew exactly what I was going to get and welcomed the thought that maybe, just maybe, I would be surprised. Having rarely dipped my feet in the thriller pool, except on special occasions, I was hoping to perhaps become a fully-fledged swimmer in this genre. But alas, I am still wearing my armbands for, as always, life is full of disappointments and Death Sentence, for me, was one of them. If you're a fan of predictable thrillers and characters that you don't care about, then go see this film ? another to add to the pile of mediocre. Based on the Brian Garfield novel of the same name, it tells the story of Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a businessman who likes nothing more than going home each day to his loving wife (Kelly Preston) and two sons. When his eldest son, the most adored of the two, is brutally attacked and killed in a random act of violence at a dodgy petrol station, Nick snaps and takes justice into his own hands, causing the rest of his family to go down in flames with him. While watching the lead up to the attack, the teasing car chase in which the gang supposedly choose their victim followed by Nick's car running low on petrol, all I could think was "For God's sake don't stop at the petrol station!". I'm pretty sure that if I had just been ruffled by a gang in cars, I would carry on driving till I thought I was well past them. I know that for this genre to work, certain actions, whether stupid or accidental, have to be performed, but I still find it extremely frustrating when the whole film's events hang on one idiotic moment like this.From the beginning credits to the end, I saw no originality. All the usual themes and scenes were there ? the scream of anguish from the mother in the hospital as the son is pronounced dead, the hard faced reaction of the father as he becomes a vengeful killer, the gun chase in which the 'hero' mysteriously avoids being hit. Even on paper, I feel this film is lacking; whether it be the characters are not developed enough for us to really feel attached to them, or just the predictable plot ? why would you watch a film when you know what's going to happen and it doesn't interest you at all? The one good thing about this film is the issue of violence and gang culture that it deals with and perhaps the moral message that "everybody thinks they're right in a war". We all know, surely, that violence is wrong and doesn't solve anything, just like our mother's taught us. Yet look at how much violence occurs in our society today. We are more aware of this than ever, especially due to the number of teenagers that have been killed recently in the UK due to gang culture. However, I wouldn't suggest reacting to this situation the way Nick Hume does for, as we all know, violence gets you nowhere. The film's tagline, 'Protect what's yours', although may sound noble and right, only leads to death and destruction for poor Nick Hume, which makes you think about the better way to do this.Death Sentence, I feel is for the avid thriller fan, the kind of person who knows what to expect and is happy about that. The slow pace unfortunately bored me and I found that I was twiddling my thumbs at some points, waiting for the film to end. I've read reports of Brian Garfield, the author of the novel, refusing at first to sell the rights to this story, and I wish that he had stayed firm with that decision. For any fans of this film, I do apologise if my opinion offends, but we all have our different views and surely that's something we should embrace so as not to become ordinary and end up on the average pile with this film.

		<shortDescription>STUPID DumbA** Movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon as a tough guy? Come on! Anyone could beat his scrawny butt. Both myself and my girlfriend burst out laughing when after a couple of hours of reading the "User manuals" for his newly purchased guns he is able to go out and slaughter a gang of armed street-hardened thugs who have been shooting guns for most of their lives.The whole premise is laughable. I like how he decides to shave his head and "finds" a leather jacket out of nowhere.I guess there is a lesson to this movie: Any slack-jawed yokel with a gun can go out and be a tough guy, not necessarily courageous, more likely ignorant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I like Wan's directing, I like Bacon, Preston, Goodman however this film is a MESS. It has so many cliché's from films and expressions we've seen before and even though I believe Wan to be an interesting director, he so fumbled the creative ball on this one it was hard to keep me from walking out, and I see about 75 films a year and walked out of maybe 4 ever. The pace was slow, the acting not convincing (no part due the actors though I believe), the screenplay, for the talent involved, was surprisingly boring and unimaginative. There was simply no chemistry from start to finish from this film. I believe it 'could' have, however that's were a better director could have pulled it through but sadly not here. Too bad too, I enjoy this type of film and the people involved. Trust me, wait for dollar day at the DVD store if you must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever notice how all these anti-theft ads you see on TV always feature a Caucasian male as the criminal? Even though the majority of all crime is committed by minorities, they're never the ones you see breaking into homes on these politically correct ads.This is the same mind-set responsible for this Saturday Night Live version of Charles Bronson's classic "Death Wish" back in l973. You've got a gang made up of well-groomed, sharply dressed gang members who look like weekend mobsters while working at dead-end jobs through the week. Oh, yeah, they're all white--with the exception of one black who is portrayed as the more gentle and compassionate of the gang members.Next, you've got businessman Kevin Bacon whose family is wiped out by this particular gang. Bacon then suddenly becomes a killing machine. He shaves his head (always a good thing to do if you're gonna murder a big gang). Then, he suddenly becomes an expert at firearms and makes The Terminator look like a sissy.Nothing makes any sense in this hilariously botched job. This is a politically correct version of how death looks--turn the bad guys into that favorite punching bag of feminists and liberals--The White Male--and make the poor father/husband into yet another parody of the Caucasian man. All that's SO l970s.</fullReview>

The only one I like in this movie is John Goodman. Because he is John Goodman. I can't help myself here I just like him even in such a mindless movie."Death Sentence" could have been "fun", at least a tiny bit, if it wouldn't take itself so bloody serious. This makes it quite laughable and frustrating. Come on, people - even straight forward movies can be done way better than this. Either with some irony to compensate those extremely overdone clichés or with some real good plot with an surprising or disturbing or strange ending. Entertain me, shock me, surprise me with something new. This scenario has been used ad nauseam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the F**k was this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I don't even know where to start with this one. The plot starts off good. Prodigal son of a successful businessman is killed in a heinous gang initiation, so daddy starts offing the culprits to avenge the death. Sounds good right? Well I thought so to until I sat through this piece of trash. I thought the first 45 minutes were good and then this multi-car pileup got out of control. Here is my summary of what was wrong with this movie. Where is this movie set in? The son mentions at one point in time about going into the city for something and they do this. So then he gets murdered and the same cops who investigate this murder also are protecting the family at their home. Common sense tells us that police jurisdiction ends at the "city" line. However the same cops are involved the entire movie whether they are at the hospital when Kevin Bacon's family is wiped out, or when he gets in a crazy chase that culminates in a gang member getting driven off a parking deck in a car. Then we get to the matter of the cops not really caring that Kevin Bacon is murdering people or that the gang is stalking Bacon. The ending of this piece of trash gets pretty funny really and it is not meant to! Actually I am wasting my time sitting here writing this as this movie is a total joke. Who would have thought that a movie with Bacon and John Goodman would be so awful. Bacon did his usual good job and Goodman was a waste in his role and they were the only reason I gave this a chance. Please, trust me this movie is a waste of time and I am shocked that anyone can say with a straight face that this movie was even watchable. This movie proves that even great actors have bills to pay too and sometimes have to work to get by. Please stay away from this at all costs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taxi Driver homage, Death Wish for the Noughties, Faust bonds with Mephistopheles, and so on and so forth. Others have rightly noted and critiqued this movie's slightly confused and empty engagement with its revenge predecessors, which I won't repeat. So here's what struck me.This is not actually a film about revenge. It's a film about Family. And it's also a film about a film about Family. The centrality of the home movies to the action, with which the movie opens and closes parallels the use of, amongst other references, Taxi Driver motifs. We are presented with the juxtaposition of the home movie version of family life with the bickering, untidy and emotionally impoverished reality of Bread Winner, Home Maker, Golden Boy and Younger Son, each a satellite revolving around the central empty concept of Family. And this is in turn juxtaposed with the Other Family, the gang, racially mixed, bonded through choice, inventing its own rituals and relationships, where blood ties are not the inane ones of parenthood but ones forged in violence. Parents and siblings in the Other Family are inverted versions of those in the Family: who serves whose needs are reversed to expose the contingent norms of Family which hold individuals in fixed relationship to one another, unable to develop or rise in the hierarchy.This movie, for me, is a savage parody on the nature of family. As a revenge movie it offers nothing new and I can't help but see that as deliberate. Energy, self-determination and individuality are all positioned on the side of the Other Family, while the Family are a monochrome form of bondage to an empty ideal. Whether the film actually celebrates this is debatable, because it falters too often in its delivery. There is a potential classic fighting to get out here, but it has been smothered by its wallowing in the adoration of the hardware.But Goodman is superb. The failure of courage of this movie is exemplified by the fact that father-on-father conflict/connection is misplaced, in a film where mothers are utterly irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Sentence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things set me for the movie ? first, Kevin Bacon and second the director of original Saw.The story is about a middle age Senior Manager Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), who is living happily with his wife and two sons. One night his elder son is killed by a gang of hooligans whose leader Billy Darley (Garrett Hedlund) wants to initiate his younger Joe (Matt O'Leary) brother in killing anyone at random. Nick realizes that the legal case is going to take too long, so he does not testify in the court as a sole eye-witness, insteads decides to take the law in his hand and kills Joe. The result is Billy and his gang verdict Death Sentence to Nick and his family, and shoots all of them. But Nick and his younger son survives, and in last 15 minutes of the movie Nick personifies himself as a punk himself ? by cutting off his hair, dressing like them and with guns in his armor kills of all the gang members in a bloody gun battle.This is a usual story of revenge. The Producer Ashok Amritraj normally comes up with this type of similar B-grade movies that do okay business at the box office. The Director James Wan tries hard to bring emotions, family values and vulnerable fear in the protagonist but is not able to rise above a mundane script or screenplay. The movie in looks is very much similar to how Saw looked. Only saving grace of the movie is Kevin Bacon who tries to bring lots of commitment and life into the character of Nick. But except that he is not able to rise above the yawning narrative.The movie is paced between dragging family emotional scenes or high paced actions. But I found the movie missing in its soul. Brave Heart had a similar revenge story line, yet it was a better movie by many standards.Director James Wan is a young director and needs more nurturing and self awareness in learning fast to get away from being type-casted.(Stars 4.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Godawful. Wow. Total Suckage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It only made 5.2 million and landed seventh out of ten. There is not one redeeming quality about this useless film. This perverse jaunt into unreality. I swear, if I was a cop I'd be mighty upset. The film purports that Nick Hume must act alone because our system of justice is just so bad. Though it may not be the best, it doesn't come anywhere near what this bad, bad film dictates.Kevin Bacon is known for taking on odd roles but he has never, ever been caught 'acting' until now. He is the worse thing about this movie. John Goodman didn't belong here either. Where were Jeff Fahey or Richard Greko during casting, those are the type of b-grade actors who usually dole out hepped-up performances for this kind of blood-for-sport movies.The main problem is the confusion of its adolescence director. If he doesn't understand the tone and mood of the piece, we can't help him. Flip-flopping between a 'Pulp-Fiction' style and a gritty, realistic character study made my head hurt. Wan never settles on one vision. Instead his own confusion damns the movie from the first frame. It is my opinion that Saw was a flash in the pan, ultimately James Wan will be too. Dead Silence was also mishandled. As a horror fan who has been watching films longer than Wan ahas been alive, I detested the ham-fisted handling of Saw. And again Cary Elwes, a benign actor at best, suffers the same fate as Bacon, an unholy bit of overacting. Hmmm. I blame director James Wan.Addendum 9/10: In its second week it made a stunning drop from 7th place to 12th with only 7 million in its coffers. The fantasy Stardust made more in its fifth week, than this in its second with less theaters. This is a clear indication Wan is Waning.Addendum 9/17: In it's third week a staggering drop to number 27 basically says it all for a grand total of 9.1 mil. Even if the film itself cost only 30 mil, investors must be paid back to the tune of 45 mil, plus marketing/advert costs, usually amount to half the cost, around 15 mil. So as it stands, 60 mil needs to be recouped. This is a classic Flop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the poster for Death Sentence I knew I had to give this film a shot. And I'm not regretting it, though I am kinda happy I didn't pay to see it.The story is a pretty simple one, very similar to Death Wish...as you may have heard. Anyways, after having one of his sons murdered Daddio Bacon has turned into a vengeful angel of death. A see-saw battle of revenge takes place, which was nice to see, but unfortunately I didn't care for ANY characters to really feel the emotional impact it was supposed to give. For 1/3 of the film I was really into it, the other 2/3 not so much. Truthfully I was kinda bored. The action was average to below until the ending, which was a nice graphic surprise. But still, having a good ending is nice, but can't save a movie...well not for this bloke.I suppose Death Sentence is recommendable to people of action/revenge tales but overall it's kind of an average affair. The acting was alright, with Goodman giving the best performance. I actually didn't even know he was in it, so that was a nice surprise. Everyone else was average at best, and some were just plain weak: Travolta Fan #1. James Wan still has that music video feel that didn't really help this out too well. I was hoping for something grittier, but only really felt it at the end, when the violence became more graphic. Nevertheless Death Sentence is a revenge flick, and revenge flicks are awesome. I'd recommend Dead Man's Shoes and any film from the Park revenge trilogy over this. Like I said, the movie wasn't consistent enough and dragged in spots, but when it was good, it was good. So Yay for revenge!</fullReview>

She would be directly responsible for the officers death and the family.. not Kevin Bacon. You don't make a joke to a patient the first minute he wakes up and after all his family has been murdered. You will hardly find a whole building abandoned so all the gangs can go a "cook" their staff and so on and on.. and on... How come this movie end up getting a 7 score!!!!??? MY GOD!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a movie buff, and this was easily one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The concept of the plot isn't bad - in fact, it was decent. However, the acting, particularly by what the movie portrayed to be a "gang", was abominable. The person or people who came up with the elements of the "gang" in this movie need to be fired and publicly ridiculed. A 3-year-old could see how fake, phony and unrealistic not only the "acting" was by the "gang" members but the elements surrounding it - the types of members (skinheads and black guys together in the same gang) and the things they said were probably the two that stuck out the most, but there were countless more. Senior citizens who are out of touch with how gangs are these days could see how pathetically unrealistic this was. How could the director and producers not see this? They should be fired and never allowed to partake in a movie again for allowing this to happen in a blockbuster film. The unconscionably bad acting and significant inaccuracies and ignorance on modern-day society makes this movie one of the worst of the century. Tons of questions need to be answered - Who chose these "actors" for the "gang"? Who coached them? What genius came up with the concept and elements of this particular "gang"? Why did the director allow this atrocity to go on and then release it publicly as a blockbuster film? I can go on and on. It's unbelievable though that a Hollywood film could be so inaccurately pathetic.</fullReview>

Asking the audience to buy that this white collar executive turns (successful) vigilante is just too much to ask. Especially when played by Kevin Bacon, who is a very good actor; just tragically miscast. If the character had had some sort of police or military background, maybe. And that's a big maybe. In reality the first bad guy he went after would have turned him into a sad statistic. This movie was a waste of talent and beneath all those involved.</fullReview>

His acted clumsiness when running away from the gang is on a par with Harrison Ford's in 'Frantic", and the rest of his performance is an absolute disgrace to the acting profession. The film itself has holes in the plot which are big enough to throw Bacon's ego through them. Many so called 'dark and realistic scenes' are full of slowly turning fan blades and totally illogical background lighting. On the whole, the quality of this movie is so bad, it's beyond belief.

		<fullReview>Nick Hume is a mild mannered executive who lives a quiet suburban life outside of work. Nice house, nice wife, two sons, it's all there. Then one tragic evening his older son is brutally killed and after the police fail to do very much Nick starts to carry out justice himself.The premise is here is relatively interesting, but the story does it hardly any justice. What could have been an examination of different psychologies in different people turns into a simple bloody revenge flick. For what it serves up, Death Sentence does it pretty well. There is a gritty atmosphere and as far as violence goes there are no sucker punches or cheap shots. However, by the end the film becomes so similar to "Taxi Driver" that you get the sense that the filmmakers didn't really finish the film. They just put together a story that sets up revenge, but they only took it so far by themselves and then they just borrowed from "Taxi Driver." The shaved head, the Magnum hand cannon, body parts getting blown off, it's all here, in gut-wrenching detail.It's a pity that James Wan, director of "Saw", seemingly chose to abandon the psychological elements of story and just throw in the visceral amplified many times. The pounding music, bloody fights and shootings, and gritty look make for an exciting movie to watch (though some scenes nearly become an unnecessary assault on the senses), but nothing really stays with you after you finish. Nothing stays with you because the hero shot it all to hell in the last act. Literally.However, a highlight that deserves mention are a few great steadicam shots that last for a long time and really go everywhere - in an out of buildings and even down the sides of them - and what's more is that there is not the slightest hint of computer effects. A chase sequence that starts outside Hume's office and end in a multi-story parking lot is breakneck (literally, as well) and very tense."Death Sentence" overall isn't bad, but could have easily been better. And could have easily been convincing. --- 6/10Rated R for strong violence, brutality, and profanity. Ages 16+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a few reviews be negative or mediocre and say "it's been done before", but I'm sure these are the same people that give films like Superbad a 10 and say things like "OmG fuNnIeSt MoViE eVeR!". Well guys, a comedy about some underachieving Caucasian guys with bad haircuts trying to get laid has "been done before", to death, in fact. I can't even think about a comedy in the last several years that doesn't have this factor at the central core of it, except sometimes the protagonists are not Caucasians or they happen to be fictional athletes or celebrities yet still pursuing women provides a huge part (if not the only part) of the story. So it's funny how much hypocrisy can thrive on IMDb.This movie is nothing new or shiny. Yes, it's "just another" revenge flick. But hey, they are fewer and far between in these so-called "sensitive times" of force-fed diversity, political correctness, and overall pussyfooting through life. It's a mean and insensitive film and it was a pleasure to watch. I ever read some subtle hints at class warfare in this. I will say that the shameless plug for Saw (you'll know it when you see it) was pretty silly, but Hollywood is as shameless as they come, after all. Sit back and enjoy. You won't leave the theater smarter, but a lot more satisfied that watching another boy-chases-girl happy ending comedy with cheap sex and bodily functions jokes that are a dime a dozen these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like revenge flicks. Typical cookie-cutter plots: Lawbiding family man with perfect kids or wife has members or a member of his clan killed earlier on by sleazeballs, gets no justice in court or help from stupid police, then goes on a bloody rampage and offs the perps by the end of the film.Death Sentence follows formula pretty well and is predictable all the way. Chase scenes, shootouts, the Gang Who Can't Shoot Straight, the dumb cops, the narrow escapes, it all works somewhat in DS, thanks to an earnest try by Kev Bacon, who is in usual top form. The script is mediocre, but directing is crisp and performances are fair to good, except for the surviving son, who mopes around the whole movie and does nothing but become another victim.Alas, I wish I could be kinder to this movie, which has pace and action in spades but lacks logic to the ultimate degree, i.e.: 1. A white-collar guy who has no experience with weapons becomes Jason Bourne almost overnight and outduels, outfights and outguns and dozen or so badasses who have been knee-deep in street warfare since they were sucking lollipops.2. The chase and shoot-em-up scene in the skyscraper draws no police for several minutes and, a la Die Hard, the bullets just keep missing and missing while Bacon not only outruns his younger and in-better-shape pursuers but manages to beat the crap out of one, toss him off the roof in a car and come away unscathed.3. The policewoman has about as much empathy for Bacon as Donald Trump has for a losing contestant on The Apprentice. After Bacon's wife and 2nd son are shot and he winds up in the hospital, instead of apologizing profusely for the failure of police protection, the lady with the badge berates our hero for prolonging "the war." Duh.4. In the final shootout scene, Bacon's arsenal blows off heads and legs and makes mincemeat of his targets while their weaponry amounts to pea shooters. Shot in the neck and other places, Bacon manages to make it back home somehow and sit on his sofa where the cops finally catch up. Is any medical aid rendered? No, another philosopher tidbit from the unsympathetic cop, and a fadeout ending to a schmaltzy vid of family reunited.There's a lot more to quibble about but why ruin a movie that, with a little more attention to detail and realism, might have earned an 8 or a 9 from me. Instead, a 4 is generous, and I'm thus rating it solely because of the Baconator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CSI it ain't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan, who is best known as part of the crew that brought us the Saw series, tries an revenge/action flick this time out in the spirit of the Death Wish series from a couple decades ago. This makes sense, however, since Death Sentence is based on a novel by Brian Garfield, who also wrote Death Wish (got any new ideas, Brian?) and not much has changed since Charles Bronson set out to make the urban jungle safe for decent folk with a sock full of quarters in the original Death Wish. The story is emotionally manipulative and all of the characters are one dimensional. Credibility is badly strained here by the keystone cops who seem helpless to solve crimes that Homer Simpson could figure out. Okay, maybe not Homer, but Lisa could do it in a second! Suffice to say, that these are not CSI-proof crime scenes we are talking about, here. The acting is adequate, but the dialog and story just don't work. Luckily, there is plenty of action and enough righteous self-indignation opportunities to keep your mind off all of that boring plot and detail stuff.Kevin Bacon is Nick Hume, a stable, loving (perfect and boring - haven't I see this guy in about 3,000 movies before?) family man, whose oldest, and favorite son, Brendan (Lafferty) is senselessly murdered and the broken down justice system is unable to do more than put his worthless killer away for a few years. This isn't good enough for Hume, who sets out for a little eye-for-an-eye justice, but in doing so, brings danger to himself and the rest of his little family. Hedlund plays the requisite leader of a gang of non-thinking street toughs, while John Goodman's acid tongued hard ass, 'Bones', is the only interesting character in the whole movie.It's not great, but then again neither were most of the Death Wish movies (though number one was better than this). Wan keeps the action up, but you will need to turn your brain down to enjoy this one, which has some kind of muddled message about violence not being the answer. If you are looking for a really enjoyable film for Friday night viewing, this one isn't the answer either. Let's hope that Jodie Foster and director Neil Jordan have a better answer when their revenge/action effort comes out in a couple weeks.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com</fullReview>

A friend and I visited our local cinema to see this film on the basis that it had a fair number of IMDb votes and almost all of which were high on the scale.I would honestly say the first 20 minutes of the film were gripping, The sound was used very effectively and the story was very convincing.Following that however the acting became poor at best, The story got steadily worse and personally I felt this was an incredibly cheap knock-off of some of my favourite Titles.One being: The Punisher (For obvious reasons) Max Payne (Film Noir style and the cover/poster)Overall this film did not impress and a lot of points it was so far fetched the film was laughable. Throughout the film I felt like saying...Just buy some guns!Overall 3/10, Two for the first 20 minutes and one for the last ten. Waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Death Sentence Would Be Preferable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, the worst a - list action film i have ever seen in my entire life. The "story" involves kevin bacon playing a mild mannered executive (yeah, original idea), whose son gets brutally murdered by a gang of hoodlums outside a gas station (also very original). Rather than letting the guy who kills his son go to jail, he decides to wreak revenge in a manner only a mild mannered executive who has never used a gun before in his life possibly could. So far, so death wish, so crap. To call this a rip off of death wish is an insult to films like death wish 2. Not only does this film rip off a dozen other films in this vein (taxi driver, the exterminator, every charles bronson film ever), it also does it in such a lazy, cynical and tedious way that you find yourself sincerely hoping director james wan ends his days in a particularly nasty car crash. Harsh ? You ain't watched it yet, son. This film is a terrible waste of talents such as Bacon, Kelly preston and John Goodman (who almost rescues the film, but fails). It also confirms that James Wan is the worst mainstream director currently working in Hollywood. There is no unintentional humour to even lift things up. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually enjoy films about righteous revenge, but this one was so silly that I walked out before it was over.Clearly, the Director of this abortion could not decide who Kevin Bacon's character really was - a hyper-civilized wimp or an action hero along the lines of Charles Bronson. One minute, he is running away through alleyways in a terrified panic. The next minute, he is launching a reckless and totally improbable attack, with nothing but his white-collar fists, on a armed thug. For an executive, he seems to be a man with virtually no practical intelligence. He acts without thinking, without preparation, without weaponry, without realistic prospects of success. Everyone in the theater knows that such an idiot would only get himself killed - but the film has him blunder from one ludicrous success to another, by sheer chance, as if to demonstrate that the tattooed thugs are actually paper tigers.Kevin Bacon is not comfortable in the role and seems as confused about his character as the viewer. There were several scenes where over-acting made viewers laugh out loud. I might have laughed myself, but by then was already on my way out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly bad film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not have high expectations of this film (it was showing at the right time), but I went in with an open mind.The beginning was rather trite, but I think worked to quickly get the audience invested in the liking the family. Once the son is murdered in the gas station, the plot holes get bigger and the acting worse.We are expected to believe the DA is willing to deal down to 3-4 years for a double homicide (gas station attendant dies, too) in the process of an armed robbery. We are also expected to believe the father has no experience with firearms, yet masters them in his shed by reading the manuals. After he escapes from the hospital, the police did not think to look for him at home. The list goes on and on.I don't think Kevin Bacon pulled off a convincing performance. Kelly Preston's acting is strained, but I think she did well in the hospital scene. The gang members were Hollywood stereotypes, shaved head, tattoos (no prison tats, nice tats). I don't blame them as much as I blame the director. I did enjoy John Goodman's role.All in all, a waste of $20 and 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching this movie was a death sentence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly cannot believe (as of the time I'm writing this) 42% of the voters gave this movie a 10. I have so little respect for the voting users of IMDb. This movie starts out w/ an "our life as a family, recorded on Dad's camcorder" video montage which is wholly unbelievable and it only gets worse from there. That montage truly represents the (lack of) range the actors portraying this family have. The fact that the film then relies at least twice on scenes from those montages later in the movie only underscores what a horrible production this is. There is no believable acting in this film. There is not one scene in which I accept what's put in front of me. The director's reliance on constantly-moving camera shots, following the lead as he's being chased / chasing from one implausible scene to the next highlights an inability on the part of the director to take a thoroughly flawed script and translate it into anything worth the cellulite on which it's printed. Besides horrible acting, the movie also suffered from characters less than paper thin. We learn the 1 son plays hockey and the other, younger one paints. And there's a little bit of sibling rivalry. Other than that, it's just a family. The cop is a cop and the bad guys are bad guys. Even John Goodman - who's a decent actor - clearly did this for the paycheck. Clearly this was my fault ? I went in expecting anything more than a brainless shoot-'em-up. I actually thought Kevin might bring along something akin to an acting ability. I was sadly mistaken and wish I had those 2 hours of my life back. What a waste this movie was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popeye vs. Bluto 2007 or look out for the messenger!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a modern version of Popeye vs. Bluto, you know, the cartoon characters who are always fighting, with Popeye getting the worst of it until he eats his spinach and then he's indestructible. Well, in this movie Kevin Bacon is the Popeye character and the other actor, who plays the bad guy, is the the Bluto character. This movie is so absurd, simplistic and two-dimensional that it makes Spongebob Squarepants seem like Hamlet. The violence is not only gratuitous, it occurs in situations that would attract so much public attention that it would probably make national news. A gang going berserk in the middle of the day in the middle of large city? That would definitely attract attention. However, this movie seems to suggest that pandemonium can occur without anybody, including the police, taking any notice. A businessman is publicly threatened by a criminal posing as a messenger? That would definitely prompt an immediate and thorough investigation, not only by the police but by the company itself. As for John Goodman, his presence as some kind of underground gun toting pseudo gangster, pseudo gun runner, pseudo estranged father is one of the most flagrant examples of muddled miscasting in recent memory, and that's saying a lot for an industry where miscasting is practically the norm. Hollywood, please ... PLEASE ... get real, come back to earth, make movies with actual stories, with good acting and with artistic quality. It has been done, it CAN be done, and hopefully it will be done. If not, then there's always Popeye the Sailor and his pal Bluto.The movie has its compelling moments, but ultimately it's just another distorted, contorted Hollywood revenge flick, with nonstop gratuitous violence and a thin storyline that defies credulity. The movie asks the audience to believe that a gunfight in broad daylight in the middle of the street in the business district of a large city will not attract the immediate attention of the police and that an illicit gun dealer operating in a large American city can do business without avoiding detection. The movie starts out well, and sets up a story with the potential for further development. But Hollywood being Hollywood, with its incessant drive to increase profits at the expense of artistic quality, the story gets more and more caught up in gratuitous violence with a predictable climax, thus becoming another potboiler. Kevon Bacon is a fine actor and here he gives a powerful performance as a businessman who is the victim of random violence and who lashes out in response, but the movie suggests that law enforcement authorities and our laws are inadequate to deter violence. Now one can say "it's only a movie," but that being the case, it should at least be a good movie with a substantive story. If one is interested in depictions of violence, just watch any documentary about World War Two, or about any other war, and then compare that with this movie, and then decide if violence is the answer to our social problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring back Bronson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a remake of DEATH WISH, do not look here. DEATH SENTENCE was written by the same author and it also is a vengeance plot. The story is more akin to the first DEATH WISH sequel in which Charles Bronson takes on a street gang after they kill his old friend. In DEATH SENTENCE, Kevin Bacon is a middle-class suburbanite who takes on a very large and very violent Chicano gang. There are a couple of decent action sequences, including a wild chase through a decrepit downtown. And the film flirts with NC-17 territory, thanks to sadistic violence that further distances it from DEATH WISH, which essentially was a Western in modern garb. Bacon tries hard, but I don't think he'll want to add this one to his resume. John Goodman plays an illegal arms dealer, and he has the good sense to camp it up in this extremely grim and dark movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, movies with violence make no sense. This one made sense in the effect that a mild mannered businessman completely loses his bearings all in the name of protecting ones family. How realistic is this of happening? Not very. But on rare occasion, people are driven to complete madness. And this film explorers the depths of those disturbing consequences.Kevin Bacon goes out one night with his son and talk about his future. But when they need to get some gas, things go wrong. A gang, initiating one of their members, goes in and murders the clerk and Bacon's son. So in consequence, Bacon decides to go after them after not getting the man to get a long sentence.Instead a violent struggle begins. Bacon v. gang. Both of their heads begin taking out each other's family. Til eventually, Bacon loses all but one son. But the gang is gone and so is Bacon.It certainly was an interesting action/thriller. I liked how the characters, while not greatly developed, were given striking personalities that reflected on this revenge minded mission and why it was happening.Could this happen in real life? Perhaps in some wild extreme circumstance. But it was entertaining and done quite well. "B+"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started very good, but as it continued, the illogical situations made the movie unbearable, as the "level of illogicability" continued to rise: 1- Nick goes to to a gas station in the middle of the scariest place ever, and he doesn't care about the ghost cars that where bothering him. Anyone would load the gas nervously + get the hell outa there as soon as possible. Level: 30%. 2- Nick goes to kill the killer with his coat, so anyone who sees him would recognize him, as it actually happens. Level 40%. 3- Nick never seem to care that the gang would guilt him as the murderer of the "kid". Level: 50% 4- Det. Jessica Wallis seems to be against Nick all the time and not helping at all. Level 50%. 5- How can Nick accept that kind of police protection for his family. The killers could wait years before they strike. They should have moved to Canada of something, or farther away, thats the only logical protection. At least until all the gang members where caught. Even then, they should moved far away inside the US. Level 70%. 6- Nick's shot wound clearly has a chance of not being lethal. The gang's leader should've known this and made sure he was death (by shooting him again several times). Of course, this would have meant the end of the movie as it shouldn't, so this situation shouldn't happen at all. This is when the movie began to disgust me. Level 100%. 7- Somehow I could accept that highly illogical situation, but soon after that I heard this dialog: "could you turn that thing off", "what, the monitor or your hearth..." (as a funny comment). I mean, the poor guy's wife was murdered!!! And he and he's son were miraculously saved from death, and the nurse made him a joke!!! GIVE ME A BREAK!!! Level 100%. 8- OK, that part was gone. Let just see what's next. The cop!!! Yelling at him again! A man who's family was just murdered and he and he's son were saved miraculously! Telling him off with no mercy! I just pressed STOP and went directly here to take out my anger.

		<shortDescription>Wasted potential due to poor script and weak direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS A frustrating and unrewarding film that tries to portray itself as gritty and true to life, but is so full of unrealistic dialogue and scenarios as to make the whole experience meaningless. I have a question - is America really like this? Do the Police really tell the family of a cold-blooded murder victim to do whatever the murderers ask, even when they know the rest of the family are threatened with murder by the same people? When they know that the remaining family members are also threatened with murder by the same gang and they know that the gang know where they live, they are happy to let the family remain in their home with just a patrol car stationed outside? The main character, badly injured, can escape from a hospital room where the police are stationed directly outside, dressed only in a hospital gown and make his way back home without incident, the police apparently clueless as to where he might be headed? The police know who the murderers are but are unable to locate them despite issuing an APB for them? Yet the father of the murdered family has no problem whatsoever in finding where they hang out? There are so many other examples of this lazy script and lazy direction; I cannot be bothered to list them all.If America is really like this, and I cannot in all honesty believe that it is, then anyone choosing to live there must be certifiable. Instead, this is more likely just another B movie churned out by Hollywood to appeal to those who are stimulated by what they see with their eyes rather than by what might cause them to reflect. If you choose to watch this movie, leave any vestige of credulity you might possess at the door and desire only to have your baser emotions pandered to. Weak plot, wooden acting and with similar relevance and gravitas as a cheap pornographic movie - you wouldn't want to watch it twice.</fullReview>

Hume deals out vengeance as if he was bullet-proof...it is like all-out war. DEATH SENTENCE is gruesome with graphic disturbing images. Bacon is very good in this role.

		<fullReview>Death Sentence had a lot of promising qualities that just didn't come together to form what should have been a great movie. The story was there, as was the action and tone, but the plot is so full of holes, not even Kevin Bacon could avoid falling down into the abyss. The so-called realism that might have been portrayed in this film gets shot out the window with the obvious logic errors that occur in nearly every scene. The idiocy surrounding the plot was almost too much for me to bear, but I somehow managed to make it through to the end of the movie.The only saving grace to this movie is in the action scenes, and even those who stand a good deal of improvement. The development of Bacon's character, as well all of the others, was shaky at best, and did less than the bare minimum in order to keep the story moving along.Fast forward to all the fun scenes with action, death and destruction, and then turn this movie off, because that's all you're going to get out of this one. 3.0/10 for this disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Sentence (2007) *** (out of 4) Typical revenge film has Kevin Bacon seeking vengeance on the man who murdered his son but after killing him the dad finds the rest of the gang coming after him. This is based on the book, which was the original sequel to Death Wish. Apparently Brian Garfield wasn't happy with the film's sequels so he wrote the novel for which this film is taken from. As far as the film goes, it's pretty typical of the genre as we get our hero and a bunch of jerks who we're happy to see him knock off. This genre is one of my favorites but I really don't think you can screw up this type of film. You make the bad guys some of the biggest scum bags ever and then just sit back and watch them get brutally murdered. This film is far from flawless and it's all over the place but it still remains solid entertainment and suits the genre just fine. I'm not sure how much has been changed from the book but the first 90-minutes are pretty straight forward and look at the revenge story in a serious manor. This is where the film works best and it manages to be pretty good drama but then the film goes totally overboard in the final act as we get the onslaught of violence, gore and gun battles. Director Wan is best known for Saw and he brings that films graphic violence to this one so gore hounds will certainly be happy with that. I personally thought Bacon gave a terrific performance and his character certainly goes through a lot of changes throughout the film. I thought Bacon nailed each one of them and I found his emotional scenes to be quite touching and heartfelt. When he finally shaves his head and goes out for revenge I could buy him as this sort of guy. The bad guys are all stereotypes and the supporting players really don't add too much. Both Kelly Preston and John Goodman are fairly weak but they do add some slight entertainment value. Aisha Tyler is pretty bland as the Detective in charge of the case. I think the film would have worked better had it decided if it wanted to be a serious drama or a cheap exploitation flick but it does work on both levels so if you're a fan of Death Wish then you should eat this up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture the perfect all American family. Dad has an office job and brings home the bacon (pun intended). Mom stays at home and is the perfect housewife. The elder brother is a jock who plans to go to Canada to study and play professional hockey. The younger brother has a very pleasant personality but is jealous of his all-star sibling. Yep, life sure is grand. They could have come straight out of a oatmeal commercial. But now imagine all that perfection gone in an instant, as Dad and his athlete son are caught in a hold-up at a garage late one night. All the lad wanted was a soda and BAM.. he's dead. And they didn't even give him his change. All this because of an initiation ceremony for a new gang member. Fortunately, the assailant was hit by a car while retreating and was arrested, but because of lack of evidence and the fact that the father was the only witness, the kid is looking at a minor stretch of 3-5 years tops on a plea bargain. Dad won't stand for this farce, and refuses to testify.. so the thug is acquitted as a result. However, Dad has got a little plan up his sleeve, and follows the murder to his hideout after the release. He wants to seek retribution in his own way after the courts have failed him. However, as he is soon to discover, what he thinks is a simple act of revenge can quickly turn into a big stack of dominoes that just keep on tumbling, and he can never go back..As soon as I finished watching this film, I found out it was from the director of Saw. Well, that isn't obvious at all, is it? You have bloody shoot-outs, disembodied body parts blown all over the place, a massive death toll and gore galore. So no trend set there, then. Unfortunately, you also have to tolerate more plot holes than you'd find in a Stilton factory, some ludicrous, stereotyped yobs who are so dumb you wonder how they know how to breathe and a family man's transformation into a killing machine that is about as convincing as Gordon Brown's leadership of the Labour Party. I do believe if a man lost his academically gifted son to a worthless piece of street scum who later got off scot free, that he'd want to kill the git, really I do. What I DON'T believe is that ten minutes after waking from a coma (after maudlin words with his only surviving child), a man would be able to sneak out of the hospital, go back to his police cordoned-off home to change his clothes and shave off all his hair, before taking in on himself to collect an arsenal of guns so vast even Arnie in his heyday would be envious, and blowing away a whole house full of punks.At least this leads to one of the movies many diverting action scenes, where computer assisted special effects add to the drama as people are shoot up real good left, right and centre. We get exciting fights in a garage, a restaurant, an abandoned warehouse and all the usual staples of the genre. These are by far the best moments, and indeed the only reason to see the film. The drama is flaccid and the actors don't help, with Kevin Bacon as low key as can be in the early stages before going WAY over the top in the climatic fight. Whichever actress got the role of his wife has the most thankless role of the year, all she does is cry and complain to her hubby about 'how he's changed'. None of the gang members are anything more than window dressing, so for all intents and purposes it's easier to blend them together into a hubris of sneering evil. My nomination for worst performance though, has GOT to be John Goodman in a cameo as a gun dealer who also happens to be the father of the leader of the group of reprobates (Phew, lot of OF's there). He is so bad in what meagre scenes he has that you wonder how the hell is this the same guy who was so hilarious in The Big Lebowski and Brother Where Art Thou. No matter, at least he gets what's coming to him before the end (hint, hint).My final conclusion is that the director should stick to horror, and leave the serious stuff to people who can handle that kind of material. Death Sentence is more than watchable when the debris of human remains is being scattered everywhere, but far less so when tries to tackle the heavy issues of child neglect and gang violence amongst others. In fact, it's somewhat laughable. 5/10. Speaking of 5's, can't wait for Saw V..</fullReview>

Action was good, I didn't know EXACTLY where the plot was going, Kevin Bacon was pretty good, and it was filmed in Columbia, SC :) The Bad: GLARING PLOT HOLES AND COMPLETE LACK OF COMMON SENSE. I won't go into detail, but several times it seems the filmmakers should have had a legal consult during the production. No trials ever go like that. No cops ever act like that, blaming the ensuing gang war on the victim. Nobody doesn't go to the cops IMMEDIATELY after being shot at with intent to kill.In summary, catch it on cable or spend four bucks to rent it if you're in the mood for a dark movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEATH SENTENCE is a nice revenge flick from the makers of SAW. It moves at a nice pace, has well defined good guys and bad guys and has its fair share of moral questioning and over the top violence. Kevin Bacon stars as a normal, upper middle class guy with a nice job and a nice family with 2 teenage boys. One fatal day, the older teenage boy gets murdered by a gang who is apparently trying to rob a convenience store. This sinks the family into depression and Nick Hume (Bacon) is even more depressed. When it comes time to identify the killer and bring him to justice, he decides he's not sure that the guy who's on trial is the actual killer (a scene earlier, he clearly sees his son's killer's face). In reality, Nick wants to take justice into his own hands and ends up killing the young gang member who murdered his son. This detonates a war between the rest of the gang and Nick Hume.Though this is an entertaining revenge genre movie, as with most movies of this type, a lot of incongruent action is at large. For instance, there's a very realistic shoot out between gang members and Nick Hume, just when he's coming out of work. The movie never tells which U.S. city the action is taking place; maybe it's L.A. (the movie was shot in South Carolina). Anyway, the point is that there are NO cops in sight. I mean, a large shoot out involving many people, cars, in broad daylight, would demand a law officer right away. Not in this city, I suppose. Cops appear way later after the fact and their involvement in the movie is limited at best. I guess police is slow in the U.S. The only prominent law enforcement office in the movie is Detective Wallis. After She (Wallis) suspects that Hume has killed his son's murderer, it seems she's more worried about Hume's next step than about the gang that's trying to kill Hume and his family! That quite didn't click with me. If you're an officer, your duty would be to get the gang who killed the innocent boy in the first place.Another scene that just didn't click is when Nick gets a call from the gang leader, threatening his family. Instead of moving his family out of the house and put them safe in some nameless hotel, he decides to turn his home into a bunker and await the gang to attack, in one of the most inconceivable strategic moves ever seen in a movie. Eventually, even with police protection outside his house, Nick's family and himself are gunned down. His wife dies, he's left a wreck and his son is dangling between between life and death in intensive care. Detective Wallis warns and advises Nick to end the war or she will bring him to justice. Justice??? She should be saying something like, "we'll get those dirt bags, Nick, but you need to lay off and let the police take care of this". Nothing that even closely resembling this line is EVER uttered in the film. Again, Detective Wallis is more worried about the harm that Nick can do than the mayhem that the gang can unleash upon what's left of Nick's family.Nick manages to escape the hospital, retrieves large sums of money from his bank account and sets out to destroy everyone involved in the killing of his family. The movie turns into a modern day DEATHWISH, with Nick becoming a modern day Charles Bronson.The ending is right out of TAXI DRIVER: from the blown fingers of one of the gang members, to Nick's pseudo-Mohawk hair style, to Nick's neck wound and falling into a sofa. This scene is obviously a tribute of sorts and for those who recognized it, it was a blast.DEATH SENTENCE was entertaining enough to warrant even a sequel; a few flaws here and there but satisfying nonetheless. Gory enough for the horror crowd, dramatic and moral-questioning for the regular crowd, DEATH SENTENCE will please both with a vengeful glee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just swinging a camera around is NOT directing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It blows me away that people can think Wan did even a passable job with this film. Half the time in the action sequences you have no idea what's happening since it's so laden with non-stop cutting.Of course it doesn't help that the script is basically crap, as well. It's too bad, too, because the scenes in the first third of the movie have some genuinely good acting in them. But the villains are zero dimensional, and as others have pointed out sooooo far over the top (yeah, gang members will kill cops at the drop of a hat, just slit their throats in a squad car, no prob), that all credibility is destroyed. might have worked for a superhero movie which this is NOT.I like revenge flicks as much as anyone else, but where's the interplay between the good and bad guys? Have the good guy think up some really ingenious way to screw with the bad guy or get him to inadvertently turn himself in. Have the bad guy do something diabolical to the good guy's family. Instead we have "I kill one of your guys, you kill one of my guys" for about an hour or so. B-O-R-I-N-G!!!! I have a hard time believing Bacon signed on for what this film became. And the "I made you like us" moralizing is so stale and stupid it just adds to the overall level of disgust the movie leaves you with. It's unbelievable this actually played in theaters and didn't just go straight to video. It's that kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is Nothing New Under the Gun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess someone reckoned it was time to resuscitate the "Death Wish" movies that began in 1974, but the similarly title "Death Sentence" had to be updated, and for good reason. This is not the late 60s or early 70s when urban crime rates were triple what they'd been just a few years earlier. The dangers of urban life were very real. Statistics don't begin to tell the story. In the neighborhood I lived in, adjacent to the University of Pennsylvania, every Mom and Pop store, every shop, had been held up at least once, with the owners "looking down the barrel of a shotgun," as one tough old lady put it. The deli owner kept a loaded gun under the counter. The liquor store would periodically acquire one or two bullet holes through its plate glass window. I knew girls who had been raped twice on campus. I was burglarized three times. Every building was decorated with graffiti.Now THAT is a crime wave that Charles Bronson could fight. The muggers and vandals and robbers were anonymous. The threat lay over the city air like an acrid odor. But the young men responsible for that disorganization were baby boomers in their prime. They're now in their 50s and 60s, so things have quieted down.Donc, the writers must now make the story personal. The son of an executive, Kevin Bacon, is killed in a gas station robbery by one of those integrated gangs one so seldom finds in real life. Pursuing a lead he sniffs out, Bacon confronts one of the gang, who is accidentally killed. Seeking revenge, the half dozen other goons (all Goth skinheads dressed in black and sporting tattoos of barbed wire on their faces) make several attempts on Bacon's life and finally wound him, kill his wife and shoot their other son.Bacon stumbles out of the hospital and buys four guns from an illegal dealer. There is a final shoot out between Bacon and the gang in an abandoned hospital or something. Guess who is the lone survivor.Kevin Bacon is a far more versatile actor than Charles Bronson was but it doesn't make any difference here. I couldn't identify all the ripoffs that made up this thing of shreds and patches. In addition to "Death Wish", there's "Dirty Harry," of course. Bacon buys a huge, stone-heavy magnum. "Guaranteed head remover," comments the dealer. The climax is almost, but not quite, a shot-for-shot remake of "Taxi Driver". Bacon is even wounded in the neck from behind. The gun-buying episode is ripped off from the same source -- Bacon fondles the guns and practices with them like Robert DeNiro -- but without the style or the wit. Implausibilities abound. The white-collar executive deliberately attacks and takes out an armed and brawny skinhead, beating the crap out of him and finally killing him. One of the gang marches into Bacon's office and thrusts a package into his hands, snarling, "This is to let you know that you won't die alone." Bacon stares at the rudely wrapped box for a moment, then sets it on his desk and proceeds to open it. Would you do that? It's a brutal movie and its ugliness is enhanced by the photography, which uses techniques I don't have the vocabulary to describe. All the images are tinted, mostly a ghoulish green, like a garter snake's belly. Some are blood red. The images are sharply defined so that we can easily make out every whisker stippling a man's chin, every bead of sweat during tense moments. A wide angle lends is used for some close ups, turning the face into that of a malign dolphin.Gun freaks should love it, and so should kids of about, oh, say fourteen, plagued by high testosterone levels. Maybe there are a lot of them around because the user rating is pretty high. If there is a market demand, we should prepare ourselves for "Death Sentence II" and all the rest of the crap that degrades our screens these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bronson didn't have to shave his head to be a bad ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corporate man Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) is slowly drawn into the world of revenge after a gang kills his oldest son and then - after Nick kills one of their own - his wife and other son. I was actually surprised to hear some positive reviews surface for this on horror message boards. I guess they must be sucking up to helmer James (SAW) Wan, because this was a truly terrible vigilante flick. Based on the sequel novel to Brian Garfield's DEATH WISH, this actually plays like a remake of the Bronson flick. Actually, it has more in common with DEATH WISH II (which wasn't based on Garfield's DEATH SENTENCE) as the villains and violence are more over-the-top and cartoon-y. The end has Bacon becoming a bad ass by shaving his head and going on a shooting rampage. Wan isn't even trying to cover up the TAXI DRIVER "influence" by this point as he even has Bacon get shot in the neck and take a seat at the finale. John Goodman is given a thankless role as a crime boss type who seems to run everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this was a let-down...I see many good comments in here about this movie and I really don't understand why.Let me explain: I saw this movie as one hopes to see any movie: I didn't know anything about it beforehand. I didn't know the story, could not have been impressed by any of the actors in it, wasn't informed about the director, producers, director of photography or anything like that.First impressions, right? Well....This movie did not have a single original idea in it. From beginning to end. I do not necessarily subscribe to the revenge-genre, but there have been great movies, brilliant even, in this field.I saw this in a theatre packed with people, and usually I get very annoyed when people make noises through a movie, but in this case I had to agree with their reactions. This flick got more laughs than an American Pie installment.*Spoiler* Especially the scene where the main character sits by the bed of his youngest son and stands up and gets "angry". Ooooh, geez, now the bad guys are gonna get it for sure...Rip-off. Every single scene. And every time someone else has done a better job. This looked like the production team originally went for the rights to Punisher, and where denied.*Spoiler* The only real pleasure to watch was John Goodman, portraying a small time arms dealer who sold the main character the worst possible weapons for a killing spree; And holding a Desert Eagle, saying stuff like: "With this, you can go to the Holy Land and start your own personal crusade." Or something along those lines. Too bad he has but a few lines in the movie.*Spoiler* This movie could have been interesting. It could have been about a middle-class father who loses his oldest son to a mob initiation. This could be a movie about how a normal man gets pushed so far that he will take drastic measures to get some kind of redemption or retribution, this could have been a story about how the younger son feels left out or even joins his father in getting 'justice'. Or it could have been just a good revenge story with all the trimmings. But alas.Do yourself a favor, watch Death Wish again. Watch the Dirty Harry movies again. Watch El Mariachi or Desperado, watch Sin City or 300. Watch True Romance, American History X, Lethal Weapon 2, a few James Bond installments, watch the original Punisher with Dolph Lundgren, anything but this.And if you don't believe a word I say, which is only fair, watch the movies above but most of all Dogville and Falling Down. Especially because of the last scene of Death Sentence. You'll see that it's all been done before and much much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially decent revenge flick sunk by the idiots at the helm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Wan brings a bag of movie references and his signature inability to marry appropriate music to pictures in "Death Sentence", a nasty but sloppy entry in the vigilante genre. An obvious, heavy-handed montage of family home movies plays over the opening credits. We learn that Kevin Bacon has a family he loves very much; they laugh together and goof off when someone is pointing a video camera at them. We know that Bacon will lose his family and go Charles Bronson on the bad guys. Which he does. In bloody fashion. Why couldn't Wan get the script's lazy logic right before proceeding with the mayhem? Because he was too green to see the script's multiple hairline fractures. The biggest fracture of all is Bacon managing to limp home from hospital to commit further mayhem while the police fail to catch up with him. On the plus side, there are some decent action scenes and the bad gays are as bad as bad guys get. Wan lacks the talent to make us care for his characters, which explains why he uses hyper-emotional music that sounds totally gratuitous in a movie possessing no real human feelings except anger. Anger was what I felt when this movie ended. Mostly anger at the idiotic director and writer for having no quality control. "Death Wish" and "Rolling Thunder" are far superior examples of this genre because they touch more than our bloodlust and don't end up feeling so artificial and cynical.</fullReview>

Or the fact that he gets shot in the shoulder in the house, and when he shaves his head, he has a huge scar in the middle of his head? really? when were you shot in the head? Or how about the fact that the worthless detective knows what he has done, and yet he stills gets to run around town. How easy was it for him to leave the hospital? Then there is the fact that he morphs into Rambo after reading a few gun manuals! or the fact that Goodman's character knows that Bacon is about to kill his son, but is OK with it and lets him walk out with a bag full of guns??

		<fullReview>Is Kevin bacon back? That really depends on what you think of this film.The last good film I remember him in was The Woodsman. I love Charles Bronson, but he did not display the range of emotion that Bacon did in this remake of the Brian Garfield novel.Bacon was not a bloodthirsty killer, but was brought into it kicking and screaming. First, the system failed him by declaring that his son's life was only worth 3-5. Then, after almost an accident in dispatching his son's killer, the rest of the gang goes after him and his family, forcing his hand.You have to really stretch you imagination here as he can barely load a gun and becomes a ruthless killer. Fortunately the meth-dealing skinheads were lousy shots or it would have ended early.No one is going to root for the skinheads, and the blood flows freely as they meet their maker. And, yes, the door is wide open for Death Sentence II; that is, if Congress does not pass a law against sequels after the glut of them this summer.I really missed Aisha Tyler after she left Ghost Whisperer. Although I thought the show was pure bunk, it did have good stories, and her. She left; then I left, as it just wasn't the same. She was great here and I hope to see more of her.John Goodman? What can I say about him. He was perfect for his role and really added to my enjoyment of the film.I know this was not high art. It was about vicarious thrills and enjoying the noise. It delivered on all counts. The only negative I can see was the casting of some teen heartthrobs in major roles. Teens cannot see the movie, so why add them? They could have cast better.James Wan hit this one out of the park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Bacon shows off his darker side in Death Sentence. Directed by James Wan, the story centers on Nick Hume, an ordinary man whose life is turned inside out after a visit to what is apparently the worst gas station in town. Nick witnesses the murder of his son, but makes a bad decision when he refuses to testify. After the murderer goes free, Nick makes another bad decision when he decides to handle things his own way. After incurring the wrath of angry gang members, Nick's family is put in danger, and he will do anything to protect them.Kevin Bacon gives a sometimes laughable performance in this overly depressing bloodfest. Maybe this is my fault though, because every time I saw Bacon, i thought, "ha, the guy from footloose is killing people". Aisha Tyler also gives a stiff performance as the worst police officer ever. Actually, all the police in this movie were portrayed as useless and quite unnecessary. Death Sentence often rides on the wheels of implausibility, as Nick turns into a near superhero in his quest for revenge. As I sat in the theater with my friend, we couldn't help but laugh as Hume drives a car straight through a van, and comes out unscathed.This movie wasn't all that bad though, as James Wan's directorial style kept me at the edge of my seat with suspense. Through the entirety of a well shot chase scene, my heart was racing as though I was the one being chased. John Goodman gives a demented and somewhat comical performance that oddly reminded me of his role in the Big Lebowski. Unfortunately, Goodman's little screen time couldn't make up for the often boring dialogue and melodramatic acting from the rest of the cast. All in all, Death Sentence is not a terrible movie and is by no means unwatchable. But given the choice, I would wait for this one to hit the shelves at Blockbuster. Still, Kevin Bacon looks badass with a shaved head.</fullReview>

It where Billy, the character, and Billy's Dad have an encountering and Billy ends up shooting his dad. There's a bunch of graffiti in the background. There's a shot with the two of them in the same frame. Look between them and you can see BILLY! YAY! I personally, really liked this movie. It just seems like everybody is making a movie about a family man who hasn't been in touch with his family lately, and then someone dies, and the family man wants revenge. But.. I personally liked it. I'm a HUGE fan of James and Kevin Bacon, and they both did an awesome job. Garrett Hedlund.. oh my god. What happened to Friday Night Lights? Haha... it was a great movie.

The movie was bad and I would not recommend watching it at all.The Movie started out well and it just lost its plot to being unrealistic. I know in movies you can stretch reality and that's fine, but when a movie is completely ridiculous and unbelievable it becomes no fun to watch. I like Kevin Bacon as a actor and I don't think the movie was written well enough for him to be involved. The way the story develops is hurried and it shows. Don't waste the time to watch this movie, it will leave you disappointed and wishing you had heeded my advice.</fullReview>

Kevin Bacon has done a good job no doubt about that, his heavy breathing on the car is a very good expression. On the acting part everyone is fair enough. Direction is OK. Screenplay is not so good and kinda stereotyped. One thing that ought to be accentuated here is the cinematography, all through the movie you'll find a great work in that field, Its culmination can be seen in the parking lot. A lot of toil has been undertaken in order to show such a good sequence.All in all a nice movie but kinda dramatic in the end.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six Degrees of Violent Separation From Kevin Bacon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bacon is a mild-mannered vice-president of a sub-prime loan operation, with two boys and Kelly Preston for a wife.After a hockey game, he and his son stop for gas in a bad neighborhood. Two carloads full of violent, shaved metal heads descend on the gas station. One of them cuts the throat of Bacon's son with a machete. Bacon and his family are devastated by the murder.In the last stages of the trial of the one murderer, learning that the others are only going to do a couple of years, Bacon gets angry and decides not to testify against the murderer of his son. Oh, Oh, we've been here before. In moments, we're in Bacon's garage looking for suitable weapons: A machete, a knife, a scythe..,Bacon tails the kid who macheted his son to death, to his Cabrini Green-like, rundown apartment. Almost accidentally, he kills him.The cops know instantly that Bacon did it and so do the pals, who are mostly the Darley Brothers. In a plot turn that is hard to believe, the cops decide to just referee the war that ensues between Bacon and the Darleys, rather than arrest Bacon for murder. Aisha Tyler, a cool black woman cop, tries to warn Bacon the Darleys are animals. The Aisha character is beyond belief.. She never loses her cool, while Bacon is losing his constantly. I haven't seen her kind of cool since Peggy Lipton left Mod Squad.The Darleys come after Bacon leading to a long chase sequence in a six layer parking ramp. Bacon manages to kill another one of the chasers by dumping a car with one of these grunge killers six stories, to his death. The Darleys are angry now. They go after Bacon's wife and remaining son. Aisha leaves a cop outside to watch the place. The Darleys cut the cops throat and manage to shoot Bacon and his entire family.Bacon is alive and really angry now. He learns his wife is dead, his son hanging on by a thread.A word here about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre cinematography of the film. The hangouts of the Darleys, Bacon's garage, the gang's hideouts, the gas station, all look like a cross between the settings in Saw and the depraved Texas Chainsaw settings of the 2004 and 2006 remakes. The idea is to convey the same aura as todays hardcore horror films.Bacon is now in his grungy garage again, transforming himself into the Travis Bickel figure from Taxi Driver. He puts on his kids jeans and black leather jacket, shaves his head bald. Ironically, he goes to a gun dealer. who turns out to be the father of the Darleys (John Goodman). Goodman, aware that it is his kids Bacon is after, sort of wishes him well. A lot of family values in this film.Now we're in the showdown. Bacon steals one of the gang's own cars and rams into one of the Darleys parked in front of their abandoned church hideout, killing him. The oldest brother of the Darleys is the one most bent on revenge. he arrives at the gang's lair, runs into his father, offs him with a 9 millimeter in a minor dispute, then goes looking for Bacon, who has a double-barreled shotgun, and three semi-automatic pistols at the ready. Gradually, Bacon has killed the entire gang except for the oldest Darley brother. The two men wound one another repeatedly and Darley runs out of Ammo in a massive gunfight in the church tabernacle. The two men sit exhausted next to one another, in a church pew. Except Bacon has one more pistol in the pocket of his leather jacket. He reaches for the 357 magnum, turns to Darley and says "Ready!" Noting Bacon's Bickel-like Get Up, Darley says "you're just like us now!" Bacon offs him and the credits roll.Somewhere in Death Wish Heaven, the late Charles Bronson is rolling his eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to hell?Death Sentence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unrelenting and uncompromising. That is all you need to know about James Wan's new film Death Sentence. This is a tale of revenge and retribution for the death of a man's son at the hands of a gang initiation. Taking the law into his own hands, Nick Hume, a father lost in the world, starts a war that he is not ready for. You can't even out an equation when a person's life is on the other side; the guilt of killing is just too much to bear when scaled by the feeling of vengeance. A person's emotions can be the sole cause of his unraveling, but when you add in the homicidal tendencies of kids, whose love for each other is too great when you think of their blatant disregard for life, external circumstances can help you hit bottom even faster. What you see in the trailer is only the surface of what Wan delivers on screen. The body count is high and the characters that are expendable are not the ones you would expect in standard Hollywoodfare. Whether you credit the novel's author Brian Garfield for his willingness to be as dark as life truly is or Wan for the courage to stay away from the sunny side of things as most producers would require a director to do in order to turn a profit, Death Sentence is a fantastic gem of a film. The pedal is on the floor for its entire duration, surprises abound, the carnage is uncensored, and the story is taut and intelligent, something that you might not expect with all the rest.Wan is definitely proving to me that Saw was no one hit wonder. No matter what your opinion of parts 2 and 3, the original literally started a trend in horror with its brand of torture porn. Everything you expected from a genre film was turned up to full blast, and, despite some hammy acting, really came out and kicked butt. This film is not his follow up, however, that one was the film Dead Silence, his first entry of the year. I have not caught it yet, but the immense enjoyment I had with his third piece has definitely increased my interest in doing so. One thing is for sure, he knows what he wants to put on film and he does so quickly. The Saw movies are known for their quick turnaround, and the fact that he completed two full- length features just this year proves his efficiency. This movie is not shot straight forward either, Wan leaves his mark throughout with some nice touches of flare. Between some cool angles, our antihero walking out of work with the camera framed at an angle so that his office building is fully shown horizontally, sequences merging multiple viewpoints like the cat and mouse game towards the end, along with his careful framing inside the very hole his lead shoots out in the wall, to, what I believe was, a single long take following our lead and his enemies as they go floor by floor of a parking garage. I can't remember a break in the action from when we enter to when we get to the top, whether that's my eyes being sharp or my being totally on the edge of my seat and oblivious to the finer points of film technique, I don't know. Either way it was an impressive moment.Yes, the acting is pretty good here as well?let's not give all the credit to Wan. Kevin Bacon proves once again that he can branch out and do almost anything asked of him. Unfortunately he rarely gets that opportunity. The emotions are there and his transformation is completely believable during the course of the story. We are treated with a montage of family videos during the opening credits in order to get acquainted with our cast. Because of this, we start off knowing the love that holds these people together. That bond is what makes what happens later plausible and so heartbreaking. Bacon never misses a step throughout the full metamorphosis. Everyone else is good in their respective roles, but none really stick out as special. That is actually a compliment, because they are basically pawns in the game between our leads and by staying that way they help us focus on what is important rather than take our attention away from the prize. Worthy of notice, though, are Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman. Hedlund is a welcome surprise as the psychopathic maniac who leads the vendetta against Bacon. He usually plays the big boy with a soft spot, (Friday Night Lights and Four Brothers), but here he goes full-boar into the dark side, and succeeds. As for Goodman, he shows that he can still steal a scene with his patented quirky bit parts. The sleaze he exudes is palpable and this could be his best role since Arachnophobia.Everything succeeds for the most part. The action scenes fire on all cylinders, as you truly don't know what is going to happen. Anyone can die and no one is above the law as far as revenge goes. I really enjoyed my time in this hell on earth patch of cityscape, right down to even the soundtrack. Anytime you can have a killer score adding tension and mood, (with a little Saw theme thrown in at numerous times), mixed with Pilate, you got something going. It's good to see one of my favorite Canadian bands getting some love, and in a very integral way. To conclude, though, I must again praise Wan for giving us one of the best final confrontations I have seen in a long time; two men, one gun, one question, and a single tear as the answer. To have an adrenaline rush end on such a perfect note is a rare thing and something not to be soon forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, Horrible and Cheap Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not imagine that anyone can give this film a positive review. This film is a terribly produce film. Film has two parts. At its first part, you will feel that it is a nicely done Hollywood film with a message. You won't regret till the second part. In the middle of the film you feel that the film ends because all 3 family members were shot death with weapons which creates a whole as big as a tier in a wall. Yet our hero and his son survives in a miracle. Then the cheap comedy starts.Second part of the movie is possibly sponsored by the weapon industry as our hero, an ordinary man who never seen a weapon in his life, buys few weapons and with a small instruction booklet he learn how to use these in few hours. They show the booklet few times which is stating "it is easy to use" message and remains in front of camera for few seconds. I guess half of the movie producer couldn't finance this anymore and found weapon industry to fund this. The hero suddenly uses these weapons like a pro, well in fact even better than a pro as he kills all remaining professional killers. I could not take it anymore after the scene where his enemy and himself start shooting each other and later sit next to each other on a church stool and start chatting instead of dying.However anyone watched an Indian movie will recognize the style. I later found that indeed the film is produced by an Indian producer. If you like Indian movies, this is a great option yet if you pay for a Hollywood movie, do not bother to go and waste your time. It is stupid, terrible, time wasting and beyond comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had relatively high hopes for Death Sentence, firstly because I like Kevin Bacon and secondly, because I thought the first Saw movie was actually quite intelligent.If anything I thought it would be a no brainer slice of harsh entertainment, but nothing could have prepared me for the last 60 minutes. It was like the scriptwriters took a skip to the local Cliché-Mart and went to town. While the first half is quite promising, with very competent acting from Bacon and some gut wrenchingly tense scenes that do drain the emotion bin, the second half is like a completely different movie. It was as though the director got bored with being serious about his project and just slapped together a cringe worthy hybrid of Taxi Driver and that obnoxious gangland torture game, Manhunt. All the questions that arise about responsibility for one's actions, and what it means to kill are completely ignored. Instead we are left to sit back and laugh as a shaved headed, leather jacket wearing Bacon stomps through the rain, jowls a quiver, blasting bullet wounds the size of Texas through an army of nameless, gangster goons. Topped with the unbelievable incompetence of the local police, the Parmesan sprinkled exchanges between father and son, the Grey's Anatomy style mood music that simpers during the emotional bits, and dialog that is composed mostly upon variations of the word 'f*ck', you have probably the most ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious revenge film ever. A waste of Kevin Bacon's talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first review i have ever written and in all honesty the only reason i am writing this one is so hopefully other people wont waste their time or money watching this movie.There is too much bad to go on about so I will just say this, if you pay to watch this movie in any shape or form, don't say i didn't warn you.Also, after reading a bunch of the "excellent" reviews this movie has received on this site I have to question the integrity of the rating system. There are obviously some people who are incentivized to come onto these sites and help with the ratings as there is no way this many people could seriously be giving this movie a rating of above 4. Not my opinion, just fact.</fullReview>
