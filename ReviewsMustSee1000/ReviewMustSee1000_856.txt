		<fullReview>A brilliant young scientist creates life from the dead but lives to regret it when his creation goes on the rampage.Though inevitably dated and primitive by modern standards, Frankenstein remains a tremendously impressive film and a tribute to its still somewhat under-rated director, the eccentric Englishman James Whale.Where so many early talkies were static and wordy, Frankenstein skips unnecessary dialogue and exposition and drives through its plot at a speed that seems almost indecent nowadays. Compared to overblown remakes like Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, Whale's work now seems like a masterpiece of brevity and minimalism. His constantly moving camera, incisive editing and dramatic use of close-ups are a mile ahead of anything far more prestigious directors were doing at the time. Expressionist photography and eccentric set designs lend atmosphere, menace and help augment some rather ripe performances; a foretaste of the paths Whale would tread in the sequel Bride of Frankenstein four years later.And then of course there's Karloff. With comparatively few scenes and no dialogue he nonetheless manages to create a complex, intimidating, yet sympathetic creature - one of the great mimes in talking cinema and thanks in no small degree to the freedom given to him under Jack Pierce's iconic make-up.A historic piece of cinema, and one that still stands the test of time as both art and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whale's First Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having been kicked out of school for his controversial work, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has been experimenting with the scientific forces behind the creation and perpetuation of life in his private laboratory. With the aid of his assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein finally tries his coup de grace--piecing together human parts to create a "new" life. When his experiments do not go exactly as planned, Frankenstein and his fellow villagers are endangered. Like a few other classics, director James Whale's 1931 masterpiece, Frankenstein, is one of those films that deserves to have every frame analyzed. Unlike most, Frankenstein is one of those classics that actually has had almost every frame analyzed. Countless theses and dissertations have been written about the film and its subtexts, so I can't imagine that I'd add anything novel along those lines in the space provided here. Instead, I'll take a brief look at some of the more straightforward aspects of Frankenstein that, in my view, contribute to its masterpiece status. The opening of the film has a very hefty dose of atmosphere, which continues more or less throughout its length. Although it was obviously filmed in a studio--the sky is a painted backdrop complete with wrinkles, this fact actually adds to the atmosphere of the film, even lending a slight surrealism. There is no score to speak of aside from the music playing during the titles, but the sounds that occur are just as effective, such as the ringing bell during the opening. There are also a lot of subtle visuals, and some merely subtly effective, such as the grim reaper at end of a long panning shot in the beginning of the film. The seriousness and realism of the grave-digging scene, complete with Henry Frankenstein throwing dirt at the grim reaper, is beautiful foreshadowing. As in the rest of the film, there is nothing jokey about this situation. Watch how effectively the actors convey a sense of toiling and franticness, how they convey the "weight" of the coffin. This is a curious fact about the film overall. Although the material is relatively melodramatic, and occasionally extremely so (especially in the case of Henry Frankenstein), the performances always come across as serious and realistic rather than campy (with the possible exception of a single snarling "growl" from the monster when he encounters Elizabeth, Frankenstein's bride-to-be). Contrast this to how Tod Browning's Dracula plays in the present day. In that film, Lugosi--although I love his performance--does come across as occasionally campy, especially in the close-ups of his "hypnotically staring" eyes. Even the one character that is meant to give some light comic relief, that of Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), is comic only in that the character is a bit sarcastic, with a dry sense of humor. As such, Kerr portrays the Baron seriously, also.The production and set design, as in the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), adds volumes to the atmosphere and beauty of the film. The interior of the "watchtower", where Frankenstein's private laboratory is located, is reminiscent of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and they both contrast and cohere wonderfully with the more symmetrical, right-angled lab equipment constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden.Because there is no score, the actors have no help in amping up the emotions in their performances. Despite this, rarely has either Boris Karloff's monster or Colin Clive's mad doctor been matched. Whale helps with some ingenious shots and sequences, such as the "progressive close-ups" when we first see the monster. He also gives us a number of "stage-like" devices that work remarkably well, such as the pans through cutaways in the set that in the film's world do not really exist. Interestingly, Whale has still had the cutaways decorated as if they are extant in the film's world. Although they may seem dated now, Whale's technique of fading to black between scenes also amplifies the sense of "literary chapters" in the story, and gives an effective, ambiguous sense of time passage between the scenes.Whale also achieves some wonderful, more understated scenes of horror in the film, often set up by contrasts. For example the severe contrast of the villager walking into the wedding party with his daughter, and the surreal bucolic adventure of the villagers working their way through the countryside to find the monster. Many younger viewers might have a difficult time watching Frankenstein if they are not used to black &amp; white, slower paced, understated films with a different approach to acting. These classics are an acquired taste for younger generations, but of course it's a taste worth acquiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's original FRANKENSTEIN is a short but memorable horror classic that has influenced so many other fright flicks, it should be considered the Godfather of Horror Movies. This was the first of Universal Studios' moody screen adaptations of literary Gothic horror (the other being Dracula). Put all thoughts regarding Mary Shelly's novel aside and see this original work of art, with Boris Karloff bringing the ultimate monster to life.The sets are a pure spin off of German Expressionism. The good Doctor Frankenstein's castle is twisted and distorted and seems to be not of this world. He is played by Colin Clive in a delightfully freakish performance. And, of course, the well-proportioned Fritz is there to help. Notice the signposts of evil in the opening grave robbing scenes. It is a prop-master's dream and the black and white photography displays a theatrical sense of spookiness. "It's Alive!" will live forever as one of the cinema's most familiar lines and the picture begins to sparkle as Karloff is brought to life. The influence of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is evident during the dazzling scene of the Monster's birth.Boris Karloff is and always will be the prototypical Monster. The closeups of his face are truly frightening after all these years. He is walking death, however, Karloff gives him a hint of sadness, of a creature who was not meant to be. The flower-toss scene with the little girl was so controversial at the time of the film's release, it was cut from many versions. The new, restored print available on video has it.I know FRANKENSTEIN has been spoofed many times and is wide-open to criticism regarding its dated look. Mel Brooks went so far as to use the actual props from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory in his hilarious send-up, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Be sure to keep an open mind and watch it in the dark. Boris Karloff and James Whale have created a monstrously fun film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT ONE OF THE GREATEST?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: **** out of ****Dark, cloudy nights. Thunder and lightning. Colin Clive's Frankenstein shouts: "It's Alive!", and Boris Karloff lurches forth in Jack Pierce's greatest monster makeup of all time....What more can be said about this classic?It's one of the first (and greatest) horror movies of all time and required viewing. Karloff's sympathetic monster can evoke fear as well as break our hearts. This film made him a huge star after years of working as an unknown in tons of features.James Whale is a masterful director, though there are less "light moments" in FRANKENSTEIN than some of his later horror films. Interestingly enough, the lack of a music score in this movie actually works in its favor.Tight, brisk, and oozing with the stuff nightmares are made of, this grandaddy of all monster films needs no further selling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Monster In A Magnificent DVD Release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have seen better prints of the film, this DVD issue of Universal Studio's famous FRANKENSTEIN is a magnificent package that is sure to delight any fan of classic horror. The film itself has been restored for content, and the Skal-hosted documentary--which traces the story from Mary Shelly's famous novel through its numerous film incarnations--is a delight, including numerous interviews with various historians, critics, and Karloff's daughter. The bonus audio track by Rudy Behlmer is also quite interesting, as are the various biographies and notes, and although the short film BOO is a spurious mix of footage from NOSFERATU, Dracula, THE CAT AND THE CANARY, and FRANKENSTEIN, it is an enjoyable little throw-away. All in all, it doesn't get much better than this.As for the film itself, the production of FRANKENSTEIN was prompted by the incredible success of the earlier Dracula--but where Dracula is a rather problematic and significantly dated film, FRANKENSTEIN was and remains one of the most original horror films to ever emerge from Hollywood. Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale, who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War I--and who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.Whale was extremely, extremely fortunate in his cast. Colin Clive was a difficult actor, but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance; Mae Clarke is a memorable Elizabeth; and Dwight Frye, so memorable in Dracula, tops himself as Fritz. But all eyes here are on Boris Karloff as the monster. Karloff had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, and although he appeared in quite a few films before FRANKENSTEIN he never really registered with the public. But in this role, acting under heavy make-up, weighed down by lead weights in his shoes and struts around his legs, and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word "monster." This is a suffering being, dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world, goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster. Even some seventy-plus years later, it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part.Karloff would play the monster again in two later films, one of them directed by Whale, but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right, this is the original combination of talents and the original vision. Truly a national treasure, to be enjoyed over and over again. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Universal monster classic movie I ever saw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To clear the air on certain misconceptions that may arise from what I say here, I've read the book. I've liked the book. I realize that the movie truly has nothing in common with it aside from the fact that an artificial man is brought to life in both. But none of the above took away from my enjoyment of James Whale's rightly considered classic film. The tacked on introduction scene and the obligatory happy ending are indeed laughable when one thinks of what is horrific in this day and age, but I was hooked from the surreal credit sequence on. To me, the real ending of this film will always be at the burning windmill, an ending of an all-too-believable tragedy.Colin Clive is a little bit overblown as Herr Frankenstein, but he does a capable enough job with the title role (something that is usually tacked onto the monster instead). Edward Van Sloan, a favorite of mine from the Universal stock company, does quite well himself as Frankenstein's old teacher, Dr. Waldmann. As for Karloff...*exhale in admiration* what can I say? I first knew him as the narrator and voice of the Grinch in Dr Seus' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" (I didn't find this out until years later, but find out I did). "Frankenstein" marked the first time that I'd ever seen him on the screen for real. From the stiff walk to the eternally mournful face, he made the misunderstood monster his for the ages (it is also telling that, in spite of this, Karloff went on to a long, illustrious, if underappreciated, career). Two other facts that stick in my mind about this movie: the creation sequence and the naming of two of it's characters. The heavy-industrial machinery used to create the monster was inspired by the silent Fritz Lang classic, "Metropolis" (indeed, many films, from the original "The Mummy" and "Bride of Frankenstein" to "Dark City" and "The Matrix" owe a debt to this excellent science fantasy), specifically the grafting of Maria's image onto the android. This machinery, I am told, would later go on to a return engagement in Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein". Fact #2: anyone who has read the novel will know that the first name of Frankenstein is Victor and his best friend's Henry. Apparently the play (or perhaps the screenplay writers; I've no way of knowing) switched these two around to where we know have HENRY Frankenstein and VICTOR his best friend.The only thing that has "sucked" about "Frankenstein" is its imitators vainly trying to make lightning strike twice (pun intended). But don't bet the house on any ever coming close. A hundred years from now, this brilliant alternate work will still stand as truly classic as the book that helped to inspire it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Universal monster classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched James Whale's "Frankenstein" last night I tried to look it through the unaware eyes of an innocent 1931 audience. Unfortunately I failed. No matter how I try, this film still has absolutely nothing horrifying in it. Nevertheless when I watched the great DVD documentary I finally understood why moviegoers of the early 30's found "Frankenstein" frightening. No one had actually ever seen anything like it before in the motion picture. What we think is funny scared the crap out of people who saw it when it was originally released. It's just so bloody hard to realize it nowadays when we've pretty much seen it all when it comes to movie violence and horror. Knowing how corny and funny this film looks that ridiculous pre-credits warning is absolutely hilarious.Once again, the fact that the film does not make us shiver doesn't make it a bad movie. It allows the modern audience to enjoy the film in another way. Colin Clive is terrific as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. When he shouts hysterically "It's alive! It's alive!" we are witnessing one of the greatest moments of horror film history ever. Boris Karloff is phenomenal as the creature. Although he may not be scary he's performance is stylish and touching and his make-up is soooooo cool. Supporting roles are good too, Edward Van Sloan and especially Dwight Frye (Van Helsing and Renfield from the 1931 adaptation of "Dracula") are brilliant. "Frankenstein" has to be the ultimate monster classic of the Universal studios. When we think about the concept of "classic movie monster", the image of Boris Karloff's creature of Frankenstein is the image 95% of us has first. It is the most recognized and beloved monster of them all.</fullReview>

It's the nearest thing you'll ever experience of whats its actually like to get in a time machine. Just switch off the lights and you can even imagine yourself being a 1930's cinema goer.

		<shortDescription>A film just as tragically misunderstood as it's monster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While certainly leagues ahead of Browning's "Dracula", Whale's Frankenstein still creaks aplenty, and in comparison to it's two sequels it looks primitive indeed, and yet....of all the Universal horrors, this is the most compelling and timeless.I find it ironic how, in discussions of the Frankenstein legend, this film is often considered as just a footnote only worth discussing for the influence it had on physical depictions of the monster, and dismissed in favor of Branagh's "adaption" or Fisher's excellent "Curse of Frankenstein". The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree, and if you care to read, I'll explain why.I will admit, firsthand, that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes, however I feel that the changes, despite their minimal size, are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version, He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his "F--- the rich" subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot, but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has, with the exception of "Frankenstein: The True Story" and Fisher's "Frankenstein must be Destroyed". One big complaint, is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster; pure tripe in my opinion.If anything; Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a "criminal brain" by Fritz, but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason, and he isn't. First, "abnormal brain of the typical criminal" could mean anything given the period's beliefs, perhaps the man in question was mentally ill, or had killed in self-defense, or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason, he does for flimsy reasons, but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz, reacts angrily, is taunted, then attacks. Frankenstein, unwilling to take responsibility, has the creature locked away to be "disciplined" by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then, his murders are in self-defense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecution(likely, but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback), but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points, to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences, and feels no remorse until later, it becomes clear that, monster or not, he's a control-freak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to "make him my companion"(plenty of child-abductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life), then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast, the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl, but accidentally drowns her, and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty, in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah, what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the book(Rolls eyes).Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous, but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from "Of Mice &amp; Men" because he cannot? I also want to point out how, name change and assistant aside, Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer, personality wise, than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy "It's Alive!" line, but in the novel, Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monster-hunting hero(Branagh) or into a 19th century Lex Luthor(Fisher); he's like Shelley's portrayal; basically well-meaning and fully blessed with all any man could want, but secretive, callous, neglectful, and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's, who overacts "It's Alive" style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever, drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version, the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel, so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under "hated" and the comment's under "loved" for Branaghs. 99.9% of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black &amp; white, or who make homophobic comment's about James Whale(who was gay). The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color, or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot, and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it, or did read it but didn't like it, and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect, but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations, it's the best. Simply; it's the greatest Frankenstein movie ever made as of now.~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a flawed but historic hour of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as the Beatles influenced popular music for decades after they came and went, so did "Frankenstein" shape the landscape for cinematic horror. Had this film been an artistic and/or commercial failure, the American Horror Film would have evolved in a totally different direction, had it survived at all.It is remarkable that the conventions established in this early talking film would continue to be utilized by serious filmmakers for over four decades, until "The Exorcist" (1973) changed the rules.However, "Frankenstein" remains a flawed classic, partially because it's characters have, over time, become almost comical (even without the endless satires), partially because of some of the supporting performances (which inspired the endless satires), and partially because of the primitive technology available at Universal Studios in 1931. Even the tiny Hal Roach Studios produced more sophisticated product at the time.But what of the assets? Charles D. Hall's art direction is striking, as are some of Arthur Edeson's photographic compositions. Colin Clive remains compelling as Henry Frankenstein, the intense medical adventurer, although he seems pushed to the brink at times by director James Whale, a smart, imaginative filmmaker who didn't always know when to apply restraint.Then there is Boris Karloff as the monster; Karloff was (and is) underrated as an actor, mainly because he became content to lend himself more as a personality rather than as a performer in numerous films, especially after the mid-1940's. But Karloff, aided by magnificent makeup designed by Jack Pierce, perfectly captured the misery, desperation and loneliness of an artificially fabricated creature in this film, guided by Whale's unexpectedly sensitive direction."Frankenstein" survives as a flawed, but historic -- and necessary -- document that set the course for one of cinema's most enduring genres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh,the many tellings and variations of this classic story.This,without question,is the best presentation of the classic story by Mary Shelley. The film was presented in such a way that makes you feel as though you are watching a stage play rather than a film.A creature is given the complicated thing called life.His large,overpowering human form,coupled with the limited capacity to grow,and learn,turn out to be very deadly indeed.He is,basically,a very large baby,who does not understand the world around him.He wreaks havoc on those who he feels are out to hurt him.I have seen the completed version of this film,complete with the disturbing sequence involving the little girl with the flowers,which was cut out of the film for many years.It is indeed shocking,and once you see it,you will understand why this was done.While you are shocked at this,at the same time you are sympathetic with the creature,knowing that he does not understand what he is doing,and meant no harm.Most movie monsters,particularly of this era,are just evil beings that make us cheer with delight at the sight of their destruction.When it comes to Frankenstein,we are almost sad to see this creature,who did not ask for life to begin with,meet his end.Classic horror,classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baron Henry Frankenstein And The Frankenstein Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whales' version of "Frankenstein" is many times removed from Mary Shelley's novel as most of Hollywood's films are.But this is the version of "Frankenstein" that we all know ...even better than Shelley's classic,but difficult novel. If a person wants a film version that follows Mary Shelley's novel to the letter but is still a classic piece of cinema and is chilling,atmospheric and memorable then one should see the film "Terror Of Frankenstein".Producer Calvin Floyd made it and it is a great version of the novel and a film that is neither boring or suffering from a star's ego to tell his version of the story as was Kenneth Brannagh's film which is not the masterpiece that it and a variety of uninformed other's have claimed it to be.Universal's "Frankenstein"(1931) is an amazing film to see.It is uniquely it's own version of the tale of a medical student who is not a doctor but is a scientist on his own misguided quest to create life from the dead.Colin Clive is Baron Henry Frankenstein who has chosen to break any ties that he had with the medical school where he had attended.In this writer's opinion Colin Clive is Baron Frankenstein and he's ideal as the reasonably mad scientist.Also this writer prefers Frankenstein's first name being changed to Henry for this film and for the entire Universal series.How sad that Clive would only live to the age of 37 and expire in 1937.Boris Karloff is the Frankenstein Monster.James Whale,Boris Karloff and makeup magician Jack Pierce are all responsible for one of the all time greatest movie monsters ever to show his pathetic face on the silver screen!The Universal version of the Frankenstein Monster with Boris Karloff portraying the part made me feel that way back as a child I was seeing Frankenstein's Monster actually alive on film for the first time.It is still a superb sight to see even to this day more than 30 years later! From the very beginning of "Frankenstein"we are shown the black,white and gray images of death as Baron Henry Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz(Dwight Frye) steal bodies from newly buried graves and roadside gallows. Henry Frankenstein takes these corpses to his laboratory which is in the top of an old stone watchtower.Frankenstein tells his former teacher(Edward Van Sloan) that he has ..."found the ray that had first brought life into this world" and in his laboratory's machinery he has harnassed it to bring his creature to life!It is Henry Frankenstein who declares(before he brings his creation to life)that,"That body is not dead.It has never lived."After the creature has been brought to life and has been presumably living in the dungeon of this ancient watchtower that we first see the immortal first images of The Frankenstein Monster.Karloff's monster is gigantic in size with a flat head, a bolt sticking out of either side of his neck,a neanderthal like brow that looms over his 2 eyes which have dark circles under them and eyelids that droop so far over his eyes that he appears to be only half alive.This Monster is a pitiful child who tries to grab for light when it's first cast upon him and is afraid of fire when the sadistic Fritz cruelly tortures him with it. This performance of Boris Karloff proves that he was one of the greatest actors that ever lived along with Spencer Tracy,Gene Hackman,Al Pacino,Edward G. Robinson,Peter Lorre,Charles Laughton,Jack Nicholson,Henry Fonda,James Cagney and James Stewart. Boris Karloff's last great film is the drama"Targets"(1968}.Karloff expired in 1969 at the age of 81.Universal's first 3 Frankenstein films: "Frankenstein"(1931),"Bride Of Frankenstein"(1935) and "Son Of Frankenstein"(1939)are stark wonders to behold...see them when you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Crazy, am I? We'll see whether I'm crazy or not."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revisiting Frankenstein is always a wonderful experience. I watch it today with the same enthusiasm and awe I did nearly 35 years ago. Everything about the film is so perfect. Acting, direction, cinematography, set design, plot, dialogue, special effects, etc. are top notch. And although each of these areas deserves to be discussed in detail (and have in the volumes that have been written on Frankenstein), I'll focus on two areas that really standout to me ? Boris Karloff as the monster and James Whales direction.Is there a more iconic image in horror than Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster? I sincerely doubt it. Even those who wouldn't be caught dead watching a horror film are familiar with that image. Beyond Jack Pierce's make-up, Karloff is amazing in the role. Even with the make-up, Karloff gives the monster life. We are able to see and feel the emotions the monster goes through. There is no better example than the scene with the monster and the little girl. As the monster stumbles out of the woods, there is a cautious look about him as his experiences with humans have thus far been less than satisfactory. But when the little girl accepts him and wants to play with him, the look of caution is transformed into a look of utter happiness. He smiles, he laughs, and he plays. But that emotion is replaced by one of confusion mixed with anger when he accidentally kills the girl. It's all there on Karloff wonderful face. It's this life that Karloff imbibes in the monster that makes Frankenstein a real classic.I've always thought that James Whale's direction was ahead of its time. In an era when directors were using what I call the "plant and shoot" method of filming, Whale made his camera a fluid part of the action. Whale takes the viewer beyond just watching moving images. He uses the camera to take the viewer into the scene. A small example is the way Whale filmed characters moving from one room to the next. The camera moves with the characters. Another example is the tracking shot Whale uses as the father carries his dead child into the town. As I said earlier, it has a fluidity in the way Whale filmed these scenes that makes it seem more natural. Finally, the way Whale introduces the monster is a highlight of the film. The monster backs into the room. As he turns, Whale shows the monster with three quick, ever tighter shots, ending with a close-up of the monster's face. Every Hollywood star of that era could have only wished for an introduction like that.While I have done nothing but praise Frankenstein, I'm not such a fan that I can't spot flaws in the film. The major issue with me has always been the way the scenes of action, horror, and violence are inter-cut with scenes of tranquility and bliss. I realize that was the way things were done in the 30s so people wouldn't, in essence, overload on horror, but it can make the film seem a little disjointed. But it's difficult to hold Whale overly responsible for this custom of the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff's most memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though in 1931 this movie was already a remake, this is an age-old classic. Done in 1931, fully black and white, this amazingly creepy tale still bears the marks of a genuine masterpiece. Having withstood the tests of time, I find this brilliantly directed portrayal just as darkly enchanting as I did 30 years ago. It is hard to believe that it has been over 70 years since this wonderful production was first released, but that not withstanding, it is a hauntingly beautiful, disturbingly tragic work of pure genius which is still just as compelling today as it was when it was made.In my opinion, this is also Karloff's best work. In this desensitized society, I feel honored and humbled to be able to view a movie of this caliber. When it was released, it was the scariest thing to be put on film. Today, there are gore effects, CGI, and a plethora of other mediums with which to shock and amaze us. Soon, the makeup artists of old will be wholly lost to the industry. If for no other reason, we should cherish these classics. Witness the industry when true artisans plied their crafts.The casting of Karloff in this part was the epitome of ideal casting. There was no other actor at that time, who could have contributed to this role, the darkling charm which Karloff demonstrated through this character. Of all the remakes done of this classic, I still favor the original work. The only remake which contains even the smallest degree of the magic of this original was the 1974 Mel Brooks parody, "Young Frankenstein."I love this movie, and even by today's standards, it still rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find more and more that Frankenstein truly is one of my all time favorite movies. I can watch it all the time, because I never get sick of it. It is a classic in the true sense of the word, and has withstood the test of time and remains an extensive influence on all modern horror. The most recent "Frankenstein" was a USA made for TV movie directed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake's Marcus Nispel. Now, there are not many movies that are always being made and remade and remade. The eerie tale of frankenstein has existed since the 1800s when Mary Shelley wrote the class novel. Since that, Frank has been seen on the silver screen many times, including the 1950s "Curse of Frankenstein" with Christopher Lee but most notably James Whale's 1931 version. It is so short, only an hour and ten minutes, but so amazing. There is no music, and the acting is ridiculously over done. I don't know what it is about Frankenstein, but I love it. Colin Clive is amazing as the insane Dr. Frankenstein and Boris Karloff is just ridiculously amazing at lumbering about as the monster. What a kick ass movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy, am I....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After buying the 'Legacy' DVDs for the classic Universal Big Three (Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein monster) I've had a good time going back &amp; revisiting all the old favorites of my childhood. I started with the monster &amp; have to admit I found this first interpretation of Whale's monster story to be a bit lacking. Not bad, but not as great as it's hyped to be, unlike its sequel.The opening setting for the film is certainly impressive, with the tearful mourners and the 'mad' doctor and henchman lurking in the background, waiting to take the freshly buried corpse (He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come). Colin Clive sets the tone for the movie as he tosses a big shovel full of dirt in the face of the statue of Death that's positioned behind him. Clive is really the star in this one &amp; it's his performance that kept me into this one for the most part, particularly the unforgettable sequence as he gives life to the monster in front of the stunned eyes of his soon to be wife Elizabeth, Victor, and his old mentor Dr. Waldman.Any review of FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't be complete without a mention of "Karloff". He gives a good deal of humanity to the monster &amp; I certainly empathized with his plight of being thrust into an alien world, where everyone, including his maker, is all too ready to shun him because of how different he is from the "normal" folks. But Karloff's screen time feels awfully small compared to how much we get of him in the "Bride". There's a feeling that there could've been a lot more for Whale to explore with the monster in the movie, but couldn't due to the limited runtime.To conclude, I'll say 'Frankenstein' is just a "good" movie that certainly is a sufficient starting point for the greatness that would come 4 years later.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Monster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation ? life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even ? horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to ? uh, well, we warned you". -Edward Van Sloan.Although this movie does not shock or thrill, it fascinates. The movie's cast is well worth repeating, Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, ETC. The movie contains obvious hints to German Expressionism, as the production team was inspired by films like Nosferatu, or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The Gothic style fits the setting and the sets work beautifully. This movie would forever solidify Frankenstein in media and launched Boris Karloff into stardom. Although there is no musical score,it still works well without it as the horrifying scenes are much more emphasized than if it had music. All in all, this is a movie everyone should see, if you haven't seen it, go ahead and view this masterpiece. If you have seen it, now is the time for you to watch it again. "However, if you do not care to put your nerves in such a strain, now's your chance to-uh, well, we warned you".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic monster film that is splendid even?or especially?for the "Star Wars" generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Count me as one member of the "Star Wars" generation who as a teenager loved this movie at first sight and has watched it with renewed pleasure a dozen times since. A small but loyal number of movie fans my age and younger feel the same way about "Frankenstein" (and other Universal Horror pictures); but for those struggling to appreciate it I offer a few suggestions.Cast your mind back to 1931 and imagine that you?like the audiences at the time?are seeing the now overfamiliar monster makeup for the first time. You probably haven't read the Mary Shelley novel on which the film is based; and you've never seen one of the stage productions based on the novel. This is a fresh experience for you. You don't know what the monster is going to look like and you don't know what it's going to do.Don't take the film for granted. We live in pedantic times when sci-fi fanboys complain that it's unrealistic for Spider-Man to spin webs from his own physiognomy rather than from metal contraptions as in the comic books; that the actress playing Storm in "X-Men" is the wrong shade of black. In this age of irrelevant concerns, "Frankenstein" can't hope to survive our dull-witted scrutiny; so don't be like the mob. The film's many defects are minor, easily ignored, and sometimes part of the fun. In some ways it is technically crude, but director James Whale and his crew have a sense of artistry and a knack for storytelling that surpass that of most modern filmmakers. Props and hand gestures frequently change between shots, giving the film the weird beauty and stitched-together quality of the monster himself. John Boles and Mae Clarke (as Henry Frankenstein's friend and fiancée respectively) are dull and stiff. Some plot details are implausible: Why doesn't Dr. Frankenstein notice that he's using an inferior brain? Why does the script insist that the brain is a criminal one at all when it's clear that the monster means no one any harm?at least before people attack him? The final scene is irritating. It's an attempt to end on a light-hearted note for those too easily frightened and upset by unpleasantness.Use your imagination. Modern movies have dulled our ability to know a profoundly disturbing tale when we see one, unless buckets of blood and gore are hurled at us. Remember this is the story of a scientist who brings to life a dead body created from pieces of human corpses; it's the story of a creator who betrays his own creature, condemning him to a short life of being hated and reviled. If this story inspires no fear or pity in you, you've lost your ability to feel.Boris Karloff as the Monster is worth a thousand CGI monsters; his pitiful reaction to seeing light for the first time would be unforgettable in a movie one-tenth this good. Colin Clive (as Henry Frankenstein) has a rich, musical voice and an intense concentration that makes his performance as alive as Frankenstein's creation. Weird and wonderful support is provided by Dwight Frye as the hunchbacked assistant and Edward Van Sloan as Frankenstein's former professor.If you believe this film is inferior to more modern movies, I would only half-agree with you: "Bride of Frankenstein," released four years later, is even better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though not as spectacular as one would expect of such a classic, this loose interpretation of Mary Shelley's oft-told tale delivers. The familiar story focuses on Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the reclusive, stereotypical mad scientist obsessed with creating new life from stitched-together corpses. But something goes terribly wrong when the brain he uses turns out to be that of a criminal. The film starts out slow but redeems itself with time, particularly the windmill climax scene that by 1931 standards is nothing short of stellar. In one of filmdom's all-time great performances, Boris Karloff plays the monster as a sort of tragic figure unable to comprehend right from wrong, and the audience is left feeling more sympathetic than frightened by him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy 75th, Frankie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm sure fans of this movie are aware, 2006 marks the 75th anniversary of the release of this timeless classic. I'm not sure of the exact release date (I'm pretty sure it was sometime in November 1931), but it's a testament to the film's quality that it's still held in such high regard seven and a half decades after its initial release. I wasn't born until 1979 and didn't see the movie until 1997, but it still blew me away. I've seen it dozens of times since, and I never get bored with it.What makes this film so good? It's not particularly scary to a modern audience, but it still possesses a charm that belies its age, and while many regard Bride of Frankenstein as superior, you can't have a sequel without the original, can you? The thing about Frankenstein is that, unlike the 1931 Dracula, which is rather static and stagy, both technically and in terms of acting (I'm surprised that Universal were able to reuse so many of the sets in later productions, given that Bela Lugosi, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye all seem intent on not just chewing the scenery, but devouring it), Frankenstein possesses remarkable depth and subtlety.Volumes have been written about Boris Karloff's performance as the monster, and it is truly mesmerising, but credit must also go to the remarkable supporting cast, and foremost among these is Colin Clive (who was actually the star of the film, and not the then-unknown Karloff). Clive gives a superb performance as Henry Frankenstein, illustrating the character's obsessive side without ever losing touch with his essential humanity. Clive was sadly a real-life Jekyll and Hyde (he was an alcoholic) and in Frankenstein he reconciles the two conflicting aspects of the doctor's personality perfectly.Dwight Frye as Frankenstein's assistant Fritz is also excellent, portraying the odd little hunchback with just the right sinister touch. Frye had played another oddity, Renfield, in Dracula, and he once again balances the differing sides of his character well, going from fear of the monster to tormenting him sadistically (which costs him dear eventually).Edward Van Sloan's Doctor Waldman may not be as entertaining as Ernest Thesiger's wonderfully camp Doctor Praetorius in Bride, but he leads the proceedings an air of authority, his rational approach providing a good counterbalance to Frankenstein's madness. John Boles and Mae Clarke as Victor Moritz and Elizabeth are not as showy, and Boles is rather bland (note that the character did not reappear in Bride) but they are fairly likable and inoffensive. Frederick Kerr gives a wonderfully blustering performance as Henry's father and Lionel Belmore is good as the burgomaster (his argument with Kerr is quite amusing), but the real highlight is of course Karloff as the monster.Whereas later Frankenstein monsters had a tendency to be somewhat robotic (which is why Karloff stop playing the character after Son of Frankenstein), Karloff's performance is remarkable for the humanity he invests in the character, something that never disappears under Jack Pierce's iconic makeup job. The important point is that Karloff plays the creature as an innocent, more sinned against than sinning. Although the monster does kill and kidnap, he does so not out of a sense of malice, but rather because he lacks the intelligence to do any better (his brain is after all a criminal one). Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the scene with Marilyn Harris' Little Maria; the way Karloff plays the monster's changing moods, from happy innocent to horrified when he realises the girl does not float like the flowers, is unforgettable.Frankenstein is memorable not only for its acting, but also its technical and visual aspects. The set design is superb, from the spooky tower where Frankenstein conducts his experiments with its Kenneth Strickfaden-designed machines, full of sound and fury, to the burning windmill at the end, but the real credit has to go to director James Whale, who took over a project rejected by Bela Lugosi and featuring a mediocre script and turned it into one of the greatest movies of all time. The original script had the monster as nothing more than a savage beast (which is why Lugosi turned it down), but under Whale it was extensively reworked, with the pathos and humanity that have made it a classic added. Although Frankenstein was not the first Universal horror movie, without it there wouldn't be the term Universal Horror, just a stagy vampire movie starring a rather hammy Hungarian. Because Frankenstein confirmed that audiences had a taste for this type of movie, it opened the floodgates for virtually every other scary movie made since 1931. While this may be a mixed blessing, at least we have this brilliant movie and that makes up for all the dross in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few will disagree that "Bride of Frankenstein" is in so many ways a better picture than the original. But since they both involve the same director and primary cast, I consider them as two parts of the same movie.I have no complaints at all about "Bride". It certainly benefits from a more deeply thought-out script and an adequately bankrolled sense of delight in the macabre. The unarguable "improvements" in the sequel are often, for me, the very things that makes the original so special.The major technical improvements during the short years between the original and sequel have made "Frankenstein" seem perhaps older than it is. The lack of a score and less showy camerawork give it almost a documentary quality, not unlike the famous Hindenberg newsreel footage. "Frankenstein" feels like this is an actual record of exactly how it looked and felt the day Dr. Frankenstein did his evil deed!I'm not saying that "Frankenstein" seems primitive in a bad way--unlike '31's "Dracula" with it's "point the camera at the stage because we can't move the camera" lack of technique. The oldness adds to it's greatness. The graininess of the picture, the shrill sound effects and James Whale's unusual cutting style of deliberate jump-cuts (especially in the scene when the Creature makes his big entrance and, moments later, reaches longingly for the sunlight)contribute to the realness of the story and the film.It gave me nightmares as a kid; only now, I know why.</fullReview>

What Whale is able to create is a compelling vision of his own that inspired filmmakers for many years to come. The visuals are stunning and the performances are first rate for such an early talkie. It ranks second on my list of the top films of 1931 (behind only Chaplin's City Lights). The Academy missed it, instead choosing fit to honor the stiff "epic" Cimarron (which is not as bad as many people say, but isn't all that good either). Frankenstein still holds up after 70 years, it may not be able to shock audiences as it did in 1931, but it remains a memorable piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about Mary Shelly's novel. This is pure Hollywood, at one of its greatest moments! "Frankenstein" is one of those films that speaks not of its original inspiration, but of its director. James Whale has created a cinematic masterpiece, surpassed only by its sequel. It is a shame that Karloff's interpretation and Jack Pierce's make-up have for the past 70 years overshadowed the novel. At the same time, however, both men gave the monster, and the movies, an entirely new personality. Besides, what would we have if all movie makers stuck unwaveringly close to the original source? Nothing very original, I'm sure. If you want the book, read the book. If you want a good scare, or laugh, or cry, see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slaughter of the Innocents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the great Universal horror classics and the legendary monsters who came from them by far the one with the most popular appeal has been Frankenstein. Baron Henry Frankenstein and his creature, the result of him probing into the mysteries of life itself, arouse both horror and sadness at the same time.Colin Clive is the scientist nobleman who's not been as involved as he should be considering he's about to get married to Mae Clarke. She and best friend John Boles are concerned about him, spending days at a time in that laboratory he has in an abandoned old mill. They ought to be concerned, they find him claiming he can create life out a lot of old body parts. He claims also to have discovered the electrical ray that created life itself on this planet.What he creates is played by Boris Karloff in the film that launched his career in the horror genre. With nothing but grunts and spastic movements Karloff captures the essence of new life with the innocence of a newborn and the strength of Atlas.That's the key to the monster's character and why we feel such pity for him. If newborn babies had his power, they'd be as the monster was, striking out at what they don't understand or who does not give them instantly what they want. The monster in fact is a newborn creature and it's when he kills little Marilyn Harris we know he has to be destroyed.Coming over from that other Universal horror classic Dracula are Dwight Frye who plays the hunchback Fritz, Clive's assistant who pays dearly for taunting the monster and Edward Van Sloan who is Clive's professorial mentor. Sadly Van Sloan does not handle the creature quite as well as he does Bela Lugosi.Though Frankenstein and the other Universal horror classics have taken quite a beating from first Abbott&amp;Costello, then the gorier Hammer films recreations and finally from Mel Brooks, Frankenstein still has the power to entertain and to fascinate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monster We Can Feel Sorry For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the "monsters" constructed out of the human imagination, I can't imagine one more sympathetic than Frankenstein's monster. In fact, I have trouble even thinking of him as a monster. Instead, he surely must be Frankenstein's "creature" or Frankenstein's "creation." It's the sympathetic nature of the creature that gives the movie it's greatest power - it's perhaps the only "monster movie" I can think of where I feel sorry for the actual monster (true, one feels sorry for the afflicted people who become werewolves, but not for the actual werewolf.) Think about this poor creature. After his creation by Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) he is, by Frankenstein's own admission, kept isolated and in darkness, and his only regular "companionship" seems to have been from the hunchback Fritz (Dwight Frye) - Frankenstein's assistant who takes great delight in tormenting the creature with torches and whips. Under the circumstances, could the creature have been expected to turn out to be a ballet dancer? This movie is both a social worker's and a psychologist's delight. The social worker will see in the creature a classic depiction of an abused child (for that's what the creature was - as Frankenstein himself put it, he didn't give life back to the dead, this "body" had never lived in its new form; it was, in fact, a child.) For the psychologist there's a study of obsession in Frankenstein (who, it seems to me, gives up on his creature altogether too easily) and Fritz is a wonderful character from the psychological perspective: a man probably tormented and ridiculed and abused all his life, who suddenly - when the opportunity presents itself - becomes the tormenter, abuser and ridiculer. But the creature is always an object of sympathy. When he killed Fritz, I thought "good for him!" When he killed the little girl Maria (Marilyn Harris) it's clearly portrayed as a dreadful accident - he was playing with her, but he was too strong for her. When the windmill breaks out in flames, how can one not empathize with the creature's terror? And yet - in the powerful sympathetic portrayal of the creature also lies the story's greatest weakness. After constructing the body from the parts of dead bodies (and I must confess that I wondered, when Frankenstein lifted the creature's hand - before it was brought to life - and proudly exclaimed "no decay", I wondered "why?" It certainly didn't look like there was a refrigerated morgue in that place to keep the body fresh!) Frankenstein sends Fritz to a local medical school to steal a brain. Great play is made from the fact that the brain Fritz came back with was a criminal's brain - an evil one from a violent man, as Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) described it. We're clearly to think that the evil brain was somehow responsible for the creature turning out this way, but that was inconsistent with everything else portrayed here. Here we find an early example of nature vs. nurture. I never thought that the havoc wreaked by the creature was because of its brain. The creature didn't have an evil nature; it was the way it was because of the way it was nurtured. The whole "evil brain" story underlying the monster's actions seemed to me to weaken the story.Boris Karloff was magnificent as the creature. In a voiceless role (aside from a few growls) he managed to portray a huge range of emotions: confusion, anger, fear, rage, playfulness, excitement, panic-stricken terror just to name a few. Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman offered what I thought was his best performance in the Universal "monster movie" collection - at least of those I've seen. Dr. Waldman seemed more rounded and certainly more emotional than Van Helsing in "Dracula" or Muller in "The Mummy." Clive did a good job of portraying two sides of Frankenstein - the obsessed scientist who wants to play God, and the repentant one who wants nothing more than to turn the clock back, and Mae Clarke was pretty good as his fiancé Elizabeth. The only disappointment in performances was that of Dwight Frye as Fritz. After a brilliant performance as Renfield in "Dracula" I didn't think he really captured this role.Two scenes stay with me from this movie. Maria's death - which clearly the creature didn't mean to happen - and the panicked creature trapped in the burning windmill. (I'd have liked the movie to have ended with that scene, actually.) So - great performances, but the issue of the brain left me a little cold, and detracted from the best and most meaningful issue raised by the story. All in all - 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein (1931) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that made a major star of Boris Karloff remains one of the greatest horror films of all time. What can I say about a movie like this which has already had so many positive things said about it for over 70 years? It's a film that was actually scary to me when I first caught it on television as a child, and while it's not very likely to retain that power for adults, I'd wager that small children would still have nightmares after watching it today, jaded as they are these days.Beginning with Karloff, his performance is impeccable. He gave the Frankenstein Monster a personality and sense of pathos, but could just as capably turn on the nastiness when his creature was persecuted. The cadaverous makeup design by Jack Pierce is one of the most classic and instantly recognized masterpieces ever conceived; often imitated, never duplicated.Colin Clive is perfectly cast as the eccentric and neurotic scientist who stitches together pieces of dead bodies and endows it with life through the means of Kenneth Strickfaden's flashy electrical machinery. IT'S ALIVE...! Director James Whale mostly keeps the proceedings grim and bleak. Thunder, lightning, blackened skies,gloomy castles and graveyards are prevalent, yet occasionally Whale sprinkles his own brand of dark humor throughout the proceedings. He would go on to make BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, a sequel which in many ways outshines its original with heavier emphasis on satire.This is one early horror talkie which actually benefits from having no music soundtrack. One could go through the entire 70 minute running time and never even notice it was missing. Not anything like Mary Shelley's novel, but a Classic in every sense of the word just the same. It set the standard by which all other Frankensteins must be judged. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Frankenstein', like Todd Browning's 'Dracula' released earlier the same year (1931, a landmark year which also saw the release of Fritz Lang's dazzling serial killer thriller 'M'!), is an important movie and should be compulsory viewing for any SF/horror fan, but it isn't a dull movie to be studied, it is a wonderfully entertaining movie to be ENJOYED. Okay, the modern viewer has to try and watch it without jaded and cynical eyes and take it in its historical context to really appreciate it, but that isn't difficult. The acting is often hokey, the special effects, which were astonishing 70+ years ago, may look a little primitive by our standards, and the movie isn't anywhere near as terrifying to us as it was to 1930s movie audiences, but even so, I can't see how anyone can not LOVE this movie! Director James Whale was a lot more sophisticated and original than Todd Browning, and as much as I enjoy 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein' is a much better movie, and the best from this era, not counting its brilliant sequel 'Bride Of Frankenstein' which to mind mind actually surpasses it. Talented character actors Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, both from 'Dracula', reappear in different but similar roles, and Colin Clive is fine as Henry Frankenstein, the prototype mad scientist, but the real star of the show, and the main reason this movie has lived for so many years, is the utterly superb performance by the legendary Boris Karloff as The Monster. I think Karloff is amazing in this and doesn't get the respect he deserves because many dismiss it as "just a horror movie". 'Frankenstein' is one of the most important and influential movies ever made, and is one movie I NEVER tire of no matter how many times I watch it, and James Whale is one of the most underrated directors of all time, looking at his innovative work in this, 'The Invisible Man', and especially 'Bride Of Frankenstein', the greatest sequel in the history of motion pictures. What a movie! What a director!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first and, arguably, the finest of the sound Expressionist classics, FRANKENSTEIN owes as much to its star as to its director: Boris Karloff evokes pathos as the put-upon patchwork pariah, and even Jack Peirce's fantastic, horrifying makeup can't hide the heart that beats within the breast of this undying monster. Colin Clive is likewise great as the driven man whose mad dream becomes a lumbering nightmare. Mention must also be made of Dwight Frye as the childishly cruel Fritz. Horror is, indeed, Universal. Mary Shelley would've been proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The genesis of all monster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that there are several who see this movie and say it "sucks". They are obviously looking at this either to be a faithful representation of Shelley's book or have complaints about the fact that it's black and white or some other disdain about the technical prowess of the movie.In 1931 special effects were still in a very infantile state. Effects artists did not have the "squibs" used today to simulate gunshots. Instead they used sharp shooters who actually shot towards the actors to get the effect needed.Jack Pierce's makeup is a marvel for its time. Even today the full method of the makeup Karloff wore is unknown. This is the monster that people see when they think of the name Frankenstein. All others are mere "melted" faces.But while the makeup is fabulous, it wouldn't have meant anything without the talent of Karloff behind it. This is great acting because of the limitations put upon the character. Karloff could only emote with grunts, facial expressions and body language. Yet he showed the anger, the happiness, the innocence and the tragedy that the Creature needed to show the audience. If you are one of those who saw this picture and did not like it, watch it again and REALLY watch Karloff's performance.I don't see this as a horror movie, although there are horrific elements. Interestingly enough, I don't see horror so much in the Creature as I do in the actions of Fritz, Frankenstein's malformed assistance. Fritz, a troll of a man only finds solace in tormenting the Creature with a torch and pays for his actions with his death.It is supsenseful when the search is on for the Creature, when Henry and company search through the house looking for the creature. Where is it? What does he want? What will he do? The creature's motives are made clear with the terrorization of Elizabeth.And while Elizabeth doesn't die as she does in the book, you can see Karloff's portrayal anger as he looks upon her. You can see that the Creature hates Henry so much he hates the bride of Henry.Indeed, this is a movie that has great pathos, drama, and suspense for those who would look for them. Truly, one of the greatest movies ever made.Thomas Edison made the first Frankenstein movie and there were other silent versions before James Whale's version. But they were forgotten in the masterpiece that was given to use nearly 70 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great ancient movie this is! Few movies this elderly can be considered one of the best ever, even though I am a sucker for old movies. This version of "Frankenstein" is a classic horror monster film and a classic from the 30's. I have to agree when they say that it is one of the most iconic horror films.It is immediately obvious where Tim Burton's short "Frankenweenie" got its inspiration from and that's one of the reasons that make that short so good."Frankenstein" is certainly quite a strong movie. It is thrilling, disturbing and shocking even now, let alone in 1931. It is original and unique. It also has some visual effects that are amazing even now and almost unbelievable for 1931: the absolutely spectacular crash of thunder and the crackling of Frankenstein's electric machines.The dark, nightmarish atmosphere of is remarkable, even more so because it's in black and white. There are very interesting and great quotes. Speaking of quotes, I don't get why the line «In the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!» caused so much controversy for a long time. I think it's a terrific line. The actors are splendid, but I especially enjoy Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff as the monster. The windmill sequence is one of the best in the film and one of those cinema scenes you never forget.Despite its short length of little more than 60 minutes, it's a very complete movie and it tells a lot in a small package. In fact, it tells just about everything that needs to be told in short time, in a relatively fast pace but without overdoing the pace's quickness, which is fine by me.Title in Portugal: 'Frankenstein'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931)There is a problem with a movie like this of what to say that hasn't been said. Well, first of all, it's a total trip to watch it still. It's dated in some ways, for sure, and is low budget and that shows sometimes. But if you get in the spirit of that, and wait to get into the castle when the real sparks fly, it's unbelievable. And then you get to the true pathos of the monster loose in the world, and realize you are worried about his well being.It's hard to imagine anyone but Karloff as the monster (Lugosi would have made the movie very different, and would have perhaps tainted how we see Dracula, as well). But the iconic monster with the bolts on the neck (thanks to Jack Pierce, make-up artist) is worth the ride alone. And then the frightened villagers, the innocent girl, the fire in the castle, on and on. For a movie just over an hour long, a lot happens, and a lot happens with gusto.James Whale is famous mostly for this one film. That's fine with me, even though he has some other terrific ones (Bride of Frankenstein as good as this one in many ways, and The Invisible Man, and check out his version of Waterloo Bridge). This is more than a monster film, but it's a great monster film. Absolutely don't put it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic play, classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably no other film except Gone With The Wind has attracted so much critical and public attention as Frankenstein. And as far as influence is concerned, this movie is the winner. I lost count after 1977, but up to that time there were at least sixty movie spin-offs. How many did GWTW generate? A handful at most. Just about all these movie spin-offs of Frankenstein are direct descendants of the 1823 stage dramatization (in Two Acts) by Richard Brinsley Peake. I looked up Peake's name on IMDb. He has not one single movie credit. Mary Shelley, on the other hand, has over fifty.Peake's adapted his stage play, Presumption or The Fate of Frankenstein, from Mrs Shelley without her knowledge (let alone her collaboration), but ultimately with her full blessing and approval. In fact, she even wrote in her diary: "Lo and behold, I found myself famous. I was much impressed. The play seemed to excite a breathless eagerness in the audience." Peake's play received unanimous praise. After a most successful season at London's Covent Garden, the whole company travelled to New York for a Broadway presentation in 1825. This also proved a triumph, with both critics and general theatregoers heaping particular praise on Thomas Potter Cooke who virtually stole the show with his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal of the silent monster, which Cooke played 400 times before the play finally closed. And for the next fifty years, Cooke coasted on his fame in numerous similar vehicles. Peake's play itself enjoyed countless revivals with some of the most famous actors of the day like Henry Irving playing the monster. Three of the differences between Shelley and Peake are really major: 1. In the novel, the monster not only speaks fluently, but has a most impressive vocabulary and eventually becomes quite verbose. In the play, Peake introduces a silent monster who can do no more than grunt. (Wow! So Thomas Potter Cooke, a well-known villain on the London stage in 1823, accepted a role that had no dialogue, yet played that role with such expertise, such understanding and such sympathy, he achieved instant fame)! 2. Peake gives Frankenstein a loyal, eager but not over-bright assistant named Fritz. In the novel, Frankenstein has no assistant at all. 3. The play, like this movie, features a detailed creation sequence; whereas the novel pays extremely scant attention to the actual creation of the monster. Indeed the whole episode is dismissed in a single vague paragraph! Now here's an interesting point. A friend sent me a photocopy of the theatre program for the 1927 adaptation by Peggy Webling at the Preston Theatre. This program acknowledges that Miss Webling's adaptation was based on both Shelley's 1818 novel and Peake's 1823 stage presentation! Yet, when Universal purchased the Webling play for the movies, somehow the ascription to Richard Brinsley Peake disappeared and has remained so to this very day. Finally, we come to the movie. First off, let me say it holds up remarkably well, particularly in Universal's fine DVD version which renders both Arthur Edeson's wondrous visuals and the movie's superlative sound effects in a manner that really duplicates the stunning impact of the movie's first season way back in 1931. Karloff, of course, is magnificent. His twisted, cruel, vicious portrait of a Monster who is still sympathetic despite it all, can never be dimmed by changes in acting styles or current fashions. (As is well-known, the part was first offered to Bela Lugosi who, having no knowledge of British theatre history, rejected it as soon as he discovered the role carried no dialogue?a mistake that ruined his entire career and sent him quickly to Poverty Row. Karloff, on the other hand, knew of Peake's play, and more importantly he realized the Monster was actually the role of a lifetime. He not only seized it with both hands but, under Whale's gifted tutelage, brought it off superbly).Not to be outdone by the Monster, Whale cleverly cast his friend, Colin Clive, as Frankenstein. I know there are critics who regard Clive's performance as over the top, but I thought he was perfect. Clive rightly plays Frankenstein as a larger-than-life figure who refuses to allow his creation to dominate the action. After all, he is the Creator!Admittedly, John Boles makes a rather staid "best friend" (but after all, it's perfectly in character) and Mae Clarke could have made her heroine a bit more colorful, but the other support players led by Frederick Kerr (who renders some delightful comic relief in his role as the crotchety baron), Dwight Frye (as the hunchbacked little assistant), Marilyn Harris (as Maria, the charming little girl of the lake), Lionel Belmore (the self-important burgomaster) and of course curtain-raiser/doctor Edward Van Sloan are wholly endearing.Fortunately for the movie's present popularity, Whale's directorial technique with its meticulous attention to set dressing and special effects, plus its lavish use of dialogue close-ups interspersed with imaginatively shot and staged action material is now right back in fashion. Arthur Edeson's moodily atmospheric cinematography also enhances tension and terror, as do the heightened sound effects of this early (but definitely not dated) talkie. (One of these days, someone is going to write a book about Arthur Edeson. After all, he photographed four of the most popular movies of all time. The others on that list: All Quiet on the Western Front, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Adaptation, Classic Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing must be said about Frankenstein (1931) before it is watched. This is a terrible adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel "Frankenstein or: A Modern Prometheus". Except for the fact that there was a Frankenstein who created a "monster" from corpses and brought it to life, which then escaped and began terrorizing the countryside, there is almost nothing in common. The "Monster" is not the intelligent and murderous creature from the book, but rather a hulking brute. Victor (Henry, in the movie) does not abandon the creature, he doesn't travel to the North Pole to hunt it down, he doesn't converse with an explorer who finds him and he doesn't die. Victor's Father, bride and everybody else who's connected to him all live, instead of dying as they would have in an accurate rendition.This, simply put, is not Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This is John L. Balderston's Frankenstein, this is James Whale's Frankenstein... this is a different story. This must be understood beforehand, so that no confusion can be made. This is different.That being said, this movie is deservedly a classic, an excellent and brilliant example of early-sound film. The direction is excellent. James Whale knows exactly where and when to point the camera, how to instruct the crew, what everybody needs to be doing. The acting is incredible.Colin Clive's performance is nothing short of perfect. He shows Henry's (Victor's) troubled mind, his romantic and sentimental disposition, and his descent into suffering as the "monster" runs free. He perfectly portray's Frankenstein's complex: he's an over-achiever; he creates a creature that can revolutionize science and medicine, but it is beyond his ability to cope and comes to terms with the abomination, with his "Foul Abortion". To date, this is one of my favorite performances in any film.Boris Karloff gives an equally superior and classic performance as the naive and innocent "monster", a creature who through no fault of his own weaves a path of terror, death and destruction everywhere he goes. Wihtout words, he conveys the creature's every thought, every fear, every emotion, with only grunts and body-language to aid him. In fact, the timing of the film, on the advent of "talkies", is an asset to the feature; just after a time when body-language was quite literally the only way that an actor could speak to his audience.The rest of the acting, while not nearly as incredible as these two leads, was far above average. While some of the parts themselves left something to desire, their performance and execution was utterly flawless. In fact, it was one of the all-around better acted films, as a whole, that I've seen.The sets were quite excellent. While it was always perfectly obvious when there was a back-drop, and equally obvious that this was filmed in its entirety within studio-walls, the sets were quite impressive. The windmill, Frankenstein's tower, the Baron's home... all of them were beautifully designed and created. The special effects, for the day, blew me away, as did the sound-effects. I was utterly surprised how much that they could accomplish with so little to work with (especially compared with today). The make-up on Karloff's "Monster" was marvelous and sickening; just the way that it should be. The costumes were fitting for the characters, and Elizabeth's (Mae Clark's) dress was simply gorgeous.The score (or lack thereof) was extremely minimal. Except for the beginning, I don't believe I heard it again until the end-credits. The sound effects, however, more than made up for that silence in the background. At times, silence was even this movie's greatest strength. It allowed the mob's shouts and the character's dialog. I believe that this is the only time I can say that no score ( basically what they had) was a wiser choice than more score.Overall, this is a classic and must-see film. It's the quintessential horror movie and a masterpiece in its own right. It has stood the tests of time despite not being faithful at all to the book upon which it's based. While the ending is the exact opposite of the book's, this new Frankenstein story is beautifully rendered and executed. This is a must see for anybody who loves horror, classic movies or even movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most seminal horror film of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How different Frankenstein might have been if Universal Pictures had gone ahead with their original plan of casting Bela Lugosi as the monster, Leslie Howard as his creator, and giving the director's chair to Robert Florey. Not that this version would have been bad - it just could not have equalled the achievement of James Whale in bringing this cinematic masterpiece to the screen.After the hugely successful but somewhat talky Dracula, Lugosi was an overnight star and Carl Laemmle Jr, the film's producer, found a quick follow up for him in this film. Out of copyright, he had Florey adapt an unproduced stage play which featured a far cruder and less child-like creature. Lugosi, submitting to a Golem-like makeup and shooting a test reel which featured him striding around the standing sets of Castle Dracula, lost interest in the part. At that stage it was little more than a grunting murderer, and he was probably right to turn it down, a decision which has brought him much criticism. But at that point he could not possibly have known that Whale would take over, and give the film a dark and meaningful spin through his own unique personality.And thus comes the monster we know and love. A child-like creation uncomprehending of the world at large. In a masterful scene Whale introduces us to him, lurching in through a door backwards, slowly turning to face the camera. Thus the world gets it's first sight of the movies' most famous make-up creation. Underneath the grey-green greasepaint so wonderfully developed by Jack Pierce (who had input from Whale) is the man forever synonymous with the role: Boris Karloff.Frankenstein is a wonderful film; the study of what it's like to be a true outsider, something Whale, always open about his homosexuality, understood all too well. Karloff is magnificent in the part of the monster - a genre defining performance, unmatched and unequalled to this day. The Oscar that year should not have gone to Frederick March as Dr. Jekyll...it should have gone to Boris.Colin Clive is also splendid as the nerve-wracked, tortured creator. And Dwight Frye is on hand as Fritz - another outsider who takes his bitterness out on the monster.The most famous scene, of course, is that of the monster accidentally drowning a young girl. Long shortened after a hysterical preview when Universal cut part of it out, it has at last largely been restored. The poor creature, having caused his new friend's death is utterly scared and grief-stricken. Once viewed it's never forgotten.In all this is a stark, powerful and moving horror film;time cannot shatter its genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic monster tale of a scientist who goes mad with the idea of playing God, and regrets it after the fact. Back when this film came out, this was pretty controversial - which is sort of why Edward Van Sloan comes out from behind a curtain at the beginning of the film and warns the audience (although is is mostly just for building the mood).Anyhow, Boris Karloff IS the Frankenstein monster. Other actors that played him were okay, but Boris is the best. Him, along with Bela Lugosi's Dracula, created two of the most iconic horror images of all time.The story is very good, and scary for the time. I recently watch this one back to back with "The Bride of Frankenstein," and I can't decide which one's better. This one is more scary I think, but "Bride" is more in touch with the monster's personal and emotional side.This is a great, classic horror film that still holds up well if you look at it in its historical context. For the serious horror fan, this is a must see. For the fans of "Young Frankenstein," you MUST watch this and "Bride" to truly understand where Mel Brooks was coming from when he made that film.Overall, 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mary Shelley novel has been re-made for movies and television scores of times. This is the definitive version, holding up beautifully after more than 70 years. Boris Karloff, under heavy makeup, is still able to convey emotion through his face and hands, one of the all-time best performances, in horror or otherwise. His childlike creature only kills when he feels threatened: by a tormenting dwarf (Dwight Frye), a doctor (Edward Van Sloan) who's about to dissect him, accidentally a girl (Marilyn Harris) whom he thinks can float, and almost Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who lunges at him with a torch. The direction (James Whale), script, cast, atmosphere, lighting, photography, sets, are exemplary. The lack of a musical score only adds to the eeriness. The electrical equipment was re-used in the sequels. The original script had Dr. Frankenstein dying at the end, but was changed, which would account for the distant shot of him and his fiancée in the last scene (Clive and Mae Clarke were unavailable). That would also explain the John Boles character, a would-be replacement for Clive, to marry Clarke. Karloff appeared in 2 sequels, the first "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) many cite as superior to this one. I disagree, for the creature talks, creating a much lighter (and campier) tone. The third was "The Son of Frankenstein" (1939), and the creature has a supporting role, with Karloff the actor heavier and in a weird wool cloth get-up. But "Son's" musical score was exceptional (and used again). Universal studios, especially during the "Golden Age", from 1923 through 1960, will always be known as the studio of monsters, since most were very well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Movie of All Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is such a classic. Nearly every scene is memorable, and images like the flaming windmill, the father carrying his dead daughter, and the look on Colin Clive's face when he says 'It's Alive, will stick with you for years!Boris Karloff is the glue that holds the film together, with his sympathetic portrayal of the monster. He is a tortured soul, trapped in a grotesque body, and commanded by strange people. When he does do harm to others, it is mostly out of naivete or fear. This is what makes the final scene in the windmill so heart-wrenching. The monster is surrounded by that which fears most. Karloff's expression of child-like terror and helplessness is truly unforgettable. Frankenstein is also a quickly paced movie and clocks at a brisk 71 minutes. The material is explored throughly, and there is nary a dull moment in the film. The characters, if not exceedingly well-developed, are interesting and portrayed realistically. Colin Clive in particular is effective as Dr. Frankenstein.Don't be turned away by this movie's age. It holds up flawlessly with the horror films and is one that should not be missed. Countless sequals and remakes have followed James Whale's original, but this one is still the best by a long shot. 10/10</fullReview>

Yes, it no longer frightens anyone, except perhaps the very young. But this film is the blueprint, the basic skeleton, for how you construct a horror film. It's surface simplicity and very brevity belie just how complex it is. It may surprise you to know this is one of the most discussed films in history. It works on the subconscious the same way many classic fairy tales do. Once seen, whether you like it or not, it is not forgotten. The Karloff monster is one of the world's most recognizable images. Its Gothic stateliness and expressionistic black and white photography continue to be an influence. If you cannot appreciate these things, then you must leave it alone. It's gotten along fine without you for seventy years now. And think about this. . . this film will live for centuries -- you won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome monster classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of the best movies of all time, it's certainly memorable and is just such a pleasure to watch, I always make time to watch this movie. There's just something so special about it, I think this was the first monster movie that gave the monster a soul and one that just very much touched our hearts. But what made Frankenstein so scary was how this poor creature was just left alone and never knew his own strength, leading him to do some horrific things. Frankenstein is a beautifully shot movie and the black and white made it just more scary and imaginative. Boris Karloff is just an amazing actor and pulls in a timeless performance and is still remembered to this day. Frankenstein is a movie that will never be forgotten and will always deliver a good cry, laugh, and scare.Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a scientist who has accomplished so much in his life, but there is one thing on his mind to what his next experiment would be, but he wants to re-animate dead tissue, in English, he wants to see if he could bring people back to life. He creates a creature from a hanged criminal, but he doubles the creature in size, making him incredibly strong. The experiment works, but when the creature escapes, he goes onto the village to meet others. He meets a sweet young girl who plays with him, but when he plays with her back, he doesn't realize his own strength and accidentally kills her. The village goes after the creature and they want to destroy Henry's projects along with the monster.Frankenstein is truly a remarkable horror movie, the first Frankenstein movie, when you watch it, I know because of fancy effects of today's horror movies have taken place in what is true horror, which I believe is how a movie could be so intense. Frankenstein is an intense movie that will definitely have you on the edge of your seat and realize how just an incredible performance can pull in a horrific but also loving monster that'll make you scream and cry at the same time. If you are a true movie fan, you have to see Frankenstein, the ultimate monster movie classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film when you meet it on its own terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite his father's wishes that his son marry, Dr Henry Frankenstein has locked himself away in an old castle to perform some sort of experiment. Going to see him, Elizabeth finds that his grip on sanity has slipped as he has stitched dead bodies together in an attempt to bring it back to life. His attempts prove successful but a simple mistake by his assistant sees his creation a flawed beast with great strength and difficult to control.First of all, to all the people moaning about how this is "not scary" let me just say "get over it". How could this film still have the same effect on audiences today as it did back then? Our effects are much better, much has been seen and the medium has moved on since these early days. In some ways then the film is worth seeing as part of Hollywood history as it is probably one of the most famous of the early monster films and indeed created the iconic image of Frankenstein that the majority of us would think of when picturing the creature (although I'm sure a few will think of De Niro). Of course I have no problem saying that the film is "not scary" because it isn't, but I don't dismiss the film for this because there is still plenty to watch for beyond the historical angle.The plot takes a while to get going and indeed the highlight of the first half is easy the moment of resurrection. However the film gets better as it goes on and the scenes with the Monster trying to come to terms with what it is are generally very good and interesting. Ironically the best performance by miles in the whole film comes from a heavily made-up actor with grunts for dialogue. Karloff is suitably monstrous but yet also tender and weak. It is easy to see him as a creature in a creature feature but he is much more than that. Sadly the rest of the cast don't always work as well. Most of them have their moments but when they have long dialogue scenes they struggle and come over a bit clunky. Clarke is a bit weak, Clive is memorable in his more animated moments while Kerr is amusing as the Baron.Overall then a classic film but not one that can be fairly viewed with modern eyes and still expect it to have the impact it did originally. Despite this there is still much to enjoy and Karloff's iconic turn as the Monster is more than reason enough to see the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because a film is "the original" doesn't always mean that whatever follows automatically is going to be inferior. Regarding this one, I much prefer the 1994 "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," a very underrated adaptation.Most of the times I do agree that the original is better than the re- make, but not aways, and particularly when it comes to horror or science-fiction films. A case in point in this classic, which I re-visited on VHS in the '90s after a long hiatus. When I saw it again, I was surprised that very little of the film had the monster coming to life. Most of it centered around what happened before the culmination of Dr. Frankenstein's work. Afterward, we see the result and then the famous last scenes in which the townspeople went after the monster at night with torches.Although slower than I remembered, I still found the first half of the movie interesting. However, I think the film lacked one essential ingredient for a good "horror movie" - atmosphere. I saw much more of that atmosphere in "The Bride Of Frankenstein," or the Dracula films - old and new, or the Val Lewton series from back in the 1940s.I will forever remember hearing Colin Clive yelling, "It's alive!!!" but other than that, this did not turn out to be that memorable or exciting...at least not now, over 75 years later. A lot of those '30s horror classics look too dated and are too slow. The big exception, of course, is "King Kong," which has never been equaled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie comes off as silly at times and brilliant at others, but it is probably considered to be one of the greatest monster movies of all time. The greatest thing to come out of this movie was the performance of Boris Karloff as the monster, it is just incredible how much emotion and feeling he was able to convey while under all that makeup. The direction of James Whale is spot on with a great use of sets and outdoor locations, in fact, the only real flaw in the film lies in the script, which has a few situations that make very little sense and because of which interrupts the films flow. But other than that, Frankenstein is a classic and very important movie, and it launched Karloff on to a great career, plus the sequel Bride Of Frankenstein is even better. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomHi6vIds4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent horror - a lost genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein was a seminal movie. It was in many ways the first modern horror film. But is also marked the beginning of a decline. The subsequent Frankenstein films were poor copies. Other monster movies emphasised the horror and the deaths. The original film was a tale of a scientist dabbling in things that were forbidden. Secrets that cannot be kept secret. A monster that will inevitably destroy its creator. Along with the horror elements, there was pathos and humour. Who can forget the innocent playful interaction of the Monster with little Maria, ending with her unintended death? Frankenstein was an intelligent movie, something too rare these days. Perhaps its intelligence was because in many ways it was a British movie - with a English director and the two leading actors. Do not remake this movie, it would be a mistake. Watch the original, it cannot be improved upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you want about the creakiness of the plot and some of the seriously dated performance techniques that are quite laughable. Say too what you may about the fact that this film has really nothing in common with the gorgeous novel. But please enjoy Boris Karloff, possibly the most overlooked and underrated actor in film history. Karloff's craftfull creation is simply one of the finest performances ever lensed on film. It may be one of the two or three great performances never awarded the oscar. Largely a pantomime creation from an actor trained on stage, the creature is not only terrifying, but hauntingly human and tragic. What Karloff is able to do with just the simplest of gesture of roll of the eye is what acting is all about: telling a truthfull, electrifying and emotional story. The academy and the industry underutilized this expert craftsman. Because of his odd looks, there was admittedly a limited market for him. However in many respects he was as good as Sir Olivier and could have been used in oh so many ways. I urge you to take a look at this film if for no other reason than to savor an expert example of acting for the film. A 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Of Two Halves - Both Of Them Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been many many years since I first saw this film which was broadcast as a horror double bill which BBC 2 used to broadcast in the Summer . It was shown as a double bill with Tod Browning's 1931 version of Dracula and having a double bill featuring both Dracula and Frankenstein was a big event amongst my school mates . After seeing the two films we all thought Dracula was a pile of rubbish that contained less chills than a Walt Disney film but FRANKENSTEIN still held up as a horror film . I think I only saw it once after that time round about 1989 and it's not a movie that turns up on British television often . I do recall from memory that the film doesn't really take off till the monster appears so sat down earlier tonight thinking it was going to be a film of two halves - one monsterless and bland and one part monsterful That is actually how it turns out but any prejudice I had that the first half was going to be uninvolving and in need of fast forwarding to the monster scenes was quickly unfounded . The first half concentrates on Henry Frankenstein played superbly by Colin Clive and gives a compelling performance as a man driven to break the very boundaries of human taboos by bringing the dead back to life . When people talk of fictional mad scientists this is the definitive performance which turned in to a cultural meme Of course once the Monster itself appears the impact is so powerful that the intelligent and carefully built up atmosphere to this point overwhelms everything that goes before it . Karloff totally dominates the movie with his combination of horror and pathos, so much so that not only does the audience forget all about the first half of the movie but become so compelled that it becomes legend . Hands up anyone who has read the original novel by Mary Shelley ? No one ? I didn't think so but we all know what the Frankenstein monster looks like and " Iconic " doesn't start to do it justice FRANKENSTEIN was directed by Briton James Whale who moved to America the previous year to make use of Hollywood's superior sound technology for the war drama JOURNEY'S END and decided to stay . This also explains the why several cast members have British accents . It's very appropriate indeed that it was made by Universal Studios set up by Carl Laemmie a German immigrant . Legend has it that Laemmie named the studios after " Universal Pipe Fittings " advertised on a passing truck . Perhaps a more romantic myth that could be added that the studio is best remembered for its horror output and this was down to a cosmopolitan bunch of Europeans such as Whale , Karloff , Lugosi , Clive and Siodmak . When people talk of the horror films it's impossible not to be reminded of the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s and this is the film that started off that cycle which has gained universal immortality</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein - A less than "monster" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein was released in 1931 and directed by James Whale. It is a film about a mad scientist Henry Frankenstein who creates a living being from dead parts. He is unable to control the monster and chaos ensues. Boris Karloff who played the monster did an excellent job and was very convincing as an unintelligent and bewildered new life. His use of grunts, staggering body movements, and facial expressions relay to the viewer that the monster is truly helpless. The lack of music made the movie less suspenseful than it could have been. Colin Clive's acting was annoying and unoriginal. In my opinion Frankenstein could have been portrayed much better by another actor, one with more conviction and emotion. The use of cinematography is what made the film memorable, as the camera is able to capture beautiful views of the mountains, cliffs, and ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the most famous of all of Universals great monster horror films is the Whale's 1931 version of Frankenstein. Whale is amazing at hooking the audience into the movie with a well written story and interesting characters. He truly, along with makeup artists brought life in the Frankenstein monster just as much as Henry did in the movie. Karloff was tremendous in his role by his stiff walking and a dead blank face. The scene with him near the lake with the little girl is ballsy and the people during the 30's had to have their mind blown. As the viewer it seems that the Monster becomes a sympathetic character at times, however there is just no helping reconstructed evil. The movie has a perfect run-time and has no fluff scenes. It may very well be my favorite Universal Classic and is undoubtedly a revolutionary film for the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful classic horror film... this is a must see for all sci-fi horror movie fans! Who is the evil one in the film? A) The Monster - Who did not ask to be created. B) Frankenstein - The scientist who created the monster - the one who simply was obsessed with bringing the dead back to life. C) The Towns People - The one's that wanted to destroy the monster and stop Frankenstein from more scientific experiments.Maybe no one in this movie is actually evil. The monster could not help the fact he is alive nor could he help the brain that was put into his head. Frankenstein just wants to conduit experiments to keep people alive, living again. The towns people have a right to be afraid of a monster that has killed.The story of Frankenstein has brought many questions as to ethics concerning the dead and dying. Should science meddle in such matters? Each of us know how we feel on the subject - that is up to you. And many of want to live forever if possible and Frankenstein (science in real life) is working on doing just that - including heart &amp; kidney transplants for example.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My personal favorite of the classic Universal horror films. I saw this for the first time at age 14 and was hooked on classic monster movies from that point on. The story, for those of you living under a rock, is about a scientist named Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) obsessed with unlocking the secrets of life. To this end, he pieces together a body out of parts taken from corpses. He then harnesses the power of lightning to bring this creature (Boris Karloff) to life.Boris Karloff's monster and Colin Clive's Frankenstein are the versions by which all others are measured. Career-defining roles for both actors and they can't be praised enough, in my mind. This movie, along with Dracula, set off the 1930s horror boom as well as cementing the public image of Frankenstein's monster for decades to come. I don't think it's a stretch to say that this film did more for Frankenstein's popularity than the source material ever did. This is certainly a very different story than the one Mary Shelley crafted, which was more philosophical in nature. In recent decades there have been attempts to produce versions of the story more faithful to Shelley but, so far, they have not been particularly successful endeavors. I have to wonder if that's not because decades of Karloff and Karloff-inspired monsters have left audiences not only expecting this version of the story, but preferring it.In addition to Karloff and Clive, the excellent cast includes Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, who were both in Dracula. Frederick Kerr provides most of the film's humor as Baron Frankenstein. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancée Elizabeth. She would be replaced in Bride of Frankenstein. Boring John Boles is the film's only weak link, playing the guy trying to break up Henry and Elizabeth so he can have her to himself. This was probably a part of the plot insisted upon by the studio for demographic reasons. It adds nothing to the film and Boles' character is dropped completely from the sequel. The tired triangle plot would be reused by Universal later in Werewolf of London with nauseating results. Striking direction by James Whale, who crafts great scene after great scene. When I think of Universal horror, one scene springs to mind immediately: Colin Clive screaming "It's alive!." It's one of the defining moments of cinema. The film boasts impressive sets, cool sound and electrical effects, and iconic make-up by Jack Pierce. Some have criticized the lack of music score but I feel it doesn't hurt it. Frankenstein never creaks like Dracula or other early '30s films do. Whale keeps things moving and interesting, overcoming most of the limitations of the era. It's a highly influential film that inspired a host of mad scientist films. There were also some wonderful sequels to this, starting with the equally classic Bride of Frankenstein, argued by many to be even better than this film. It's definitely a must-see for anyone who loves movies and isn't prejudiced against older works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff Has Made History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Frankenstein (1931) directed by James Whale, is based off the novel by Mary Shelley. The film like Universal 's other monster film Dracula (1931), creates a cultural icon that is forever immortalized in pop culture. Boris Karloff's role as the innocent and macabre monster is genuine and quite iconic. Whenever we think of Frankenstein's monster, we think of this movie. The film had a great Gothic feel to it. The castle, the village, the torch-lights, and the villagers themselves. The plot was interesting, as we were exploring the world with the monster, and got to feel his struggle. He was not a bad thing, just innocent. He had no idea what he truly was, an amalgamation of flesh, brought back by a psychotic scientist. He was just a being trying to be free, but couldn't due to his lack of understanding, and his creation. The film is a horror film, but you don't see the creature as a monster by the end. It is a great film and definitely is one to watch. Overall, Frankenstein (1931) is an 8 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monsters lead such interesting lives....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Herman Munster to Mel Brooks to a Tim Burton pooch, this beloved creature of Mary Shelley's imagination has had more lives than Shirley MacLaine. He's survived floods, quicksand and fires, and even adult videos have utilized his legend. But in this original version, what the monster remains today was created, and that is not only thanks to Ms. Shelley, but the artistic vision of its director James Whale and the actor who played the unnamed monster, Boris Karloff. So break out your old video copy or even better, the newer DVD collection of most of the series, almost a serial (or "Dark Shadows" like soap opera) in its continuity.Universal followed up its enormously popular "Dracula" with its tale of the flat-topped, green-skinned mass of muscle that only kills because that's what classic movie monsters do, its own heart breaking when he accidentally drowns a little girl in one of the most notorious death scenes in movie history. It's not all horrific, some humor put into the Igor predecessor who drops the good brain he has been sent to steal when confronted by a hanging skeleton and replaces it with what Mel Brooks would later refer to as belonging to "Abby Normal".Like many of the follow-ups, the film utilizes an almost silent movie art direction, obviously influenced by German impressionism and films like "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and "Nosferatu". There's some truly frightening moments, especially with Karloff stalking the film's fragile heroine (Mae Clarke) who would need something more than grapefruit (utilized on her in the same year's "The Public Enemy") to get rid of this brute. Colin Clive truly steals acting honors here, swinging between rationality and absolute madness in his desire to cross God and go into territories that threaten to doom his soul. Veteran romantic lead John Boles ("Craig's Wife", "Stella Dallas") is wasted as Clive's concerned pal, but Dwight Frye is a riotous delight as the Igor-like assistant who pays dearly for messing with things outside his sensibilities as a human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, but a better book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein hasn't stood the test of time as a horror movie, but it will always be a great movie for what it did for the genre. Looking at it now, having seen the modern cinematography and CGI effects capable with our technology, we lose some of what the original audiences felt at seeing Boris Karloff as the monster for the first time. I think the movie is unique, especially in the horror genre, for not having a clear protagonist and antagonist, though I'm sure the early audiences clearly saw the monster as antagonist once it was created. From my perspective, Victor Frankenstein is as much at fault for the monster's actions as the monster, and it's a wonder that none of the village turns on him for creating the monster in the first place, even contrite as he is. I do have to say that, having read Mary Shelley's novel, the movie falls short in many respects. The book brings a richness to the characters that is not present in the movie, and has a much longer timeline than the movie, which brings more verisimilitude to the characters than the movie can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait, there's a book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my least favorite complaints about movies is "it's not accurate to the book". I hate when people say that because that's not being fair. Books and film are two completely different forms of media. Of course it's not going to be 100% accurate to the book, unlike a book, a film has dozens of people working on it, and it has to be made to fit the film format. A movie based on a book doesn't need to be 100% accurate to be good, and I think James Whale's "Frankenstein" from 1931 is the perfect example of that. It does baffle me that people complain that this particular movie had very little to do with original Mary Shelly novel, because the original book is one of the darkest, most jaw dropping story ever written. Besides, they made a more accurate version in the 90s, and look how that turned out. Anyway, back to the movie. From beginning to end, this movie is just fun. The opening with the guy coming out and warning the audience that this movie might be too scary for some people, that just sets the tone for what you're about to watch. Every scene in this movie is just classic. There's Dr. Frankenstein and Fritz digging up bodies in the graveyard, the laboratory scenes, the little girl by the pond, the angry villagers, and so on. As a kid, I saw most of these scenes for the first time parodied in Saturday morning cartoons; and it's really cool seeing where it all began. Even if you think this movie sucks for being unfaithful to the book, this is the classic "Frankenstein". This is what people think about when they hear the title. Sure, there can be other versions, but they'll never be as iconic as this one. When you hear "Frankenstein's monster", do you think of Boris Karloff or Robert De Niro? Obviously you think of the classic, with the Jack Pierce make-up. To me, there will never be a Frankenstein to match this one. It's just so classic, so creepy, so entertaining, that it's impossible not to enjoy. Who cares if it doesn't do the book justice? The movie was made, and it has become so iconic that people are starting to accept it as the classic it is. P.S. This applies to the first three "Frankenstein" movies by universal. To me, "Frankenstein", "Bride of Frankenstein", and "Son of Frankenstein" are all equally good, so the sequels should definitely not be overlooked. "Frankenstein" is the most classic, "Bride of Frankenstein" has the most heart to it, and "Son of Frankenstein" is the creepiest. They're all great movies, with some underrated performances, so don't miss them if you're a fan of classic monster movies. They're movies that bring out the mad scientist in all of us. Muhahahahahahahahahahahaha?..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Frankenstein 1931</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a classic horror film. It's really part of the basis/beginning of present day horror films. This 1931 films portrays a very Gothic feel and setting. The following images help to depict this Gothic feel; dark film, stormy nights (rain, thunder, and lightening), dead bodies covered by sheets, and brains in jars. Images like this give the viewer a psychological experience, and feeling that they're in a scary environment. Frankentein's house is a great example of this, its secluded, made entirely of stone, it seems very dark and cold, and much like a dungeon. When Frankenstein's monster comes to life, Frankenstein yells "It's alive, it's alive... I know what it feels like to be God." This was a very controversial quote, surfacing a moral story to the movie; is it right to do what God should be doing? It seems that the story was more depressing and pathetic than scary, you almost felt bad for the monster, because he was never able to fit in to society.In terms of the camera work for the film, I thought it was quite good. The camera angles exaggerated the plot, especially as the camera followed the man through town while carrying his dead daughter. You could see the whole towns reaction, and hear church bells in the background, giving the scene a very real and emotional feeling, something the viewer could relate to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein / 1931 / Directed by: James Whale / Written by: Garret Fort and Francis Edwards Faragoh / Adapted by: John Balderston (from the play by Peggy Webling).James Whale's adaptation of the classic Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley novel of 1818, is nearly a masterpiece. This grand and imaginative film makes a profound moralistic statement about the consequences of tampering with nature. As to the source, this famous novel was inspired by a real life dream and created by Shelley at the surprisingly young age of 19. Though the film has no music soundtrack, it's works very effectively without one, due to it's excellent style and technique. Direction, cinematography, art design and makeup all come together to create this impressive film.The film is based on part of the famous Shelley novel, in which an obsessed scientist creates life from the reassembled body parts of corpses.Boris Karloff portrays the character with sensitivity, compassion, including childlike innocence and wonder. This became the most famous role of his career. Legendary makeup genius Frank Pierce created an inspired monster with attention to detail, definitely an important detail in the film's success.One odd thing about the film, is that the village in the story appears to be Germany, though the original novel was written in England and director James Whale is English. The characters in the story are all recognizably English. Whale uses painted backgrounds along with imaginative sets to tell his version of Frankenstein. The castle tower and the laboratory sets are impressive. The famous creation sequence in the laboratory is majestic and ranks as one of the great set pieces in motion picture film history.Made for $300,000 and grossing $12 million, the film was a smash success, that sent Universal Studios to make many more horror films during the 1930's. Now 69 years old, the film still retains it's power to impress new generations of film goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1931 motion picture of Frankenstein begins, famously, with a short introductory word, warning nervous cinema-goers that this was their chance to leave if they felt the horror would be too intense. Was this message, delivered by a chirpy Edward van Sloan with a twinkle in his eye, a genuine customer care measure, or part of Universal Studio's overt yet self-aware product packaging, which also involved crediting the monster with a tantalising question mark? After all, Frankenstein is not the most horrifying picture of the period, even if it was more so by the standards of the day. The Bela Lugosi Dracula, as well as some of the Lon Chaney silent horrors, certainly go to greater lengths to disturb and terrify audiences. Frankenstein features some creepy set design, spooky cinematography and one or two shocks, but it becomes more and more apparent that van Sloan's "warning" is in fact a canny and slightly tongue-in-cheek stunt which far from discouraging viewers, challenges their nerves and entices them to stay. Incidentally, Frankenstein was the highest grossing film at the box office for 1931.And that spirit of showmanship pervades Frankenstein. The adaptation contains only a kernel of Mary Shelley's novel, its central premise of a reanimated monster running amok, and then expands that kernel outwards into a new story of its own. Much of this was not invented for the film but was derived from the numerous stage versions, which during the 19th century had developed such embellishments as the hunchbacked assistant and the elaborate sciencey "It's alive" sequence. All this is now presented in a kind of cod-Germanic, somewhat Ruritanian realm and indeterminate historical period, which serves to give it an almost fairytale quality. This is another part of the theatrical veneer that director James Whale and producer Carl Laemmle Junior have heartily indulged in, without quite diverting from the mission statement of creating a horror.Let's look a bit more closely at Mr Whale's contribution here. An ex-theatre man himself, his approach to cinema was unique but highly inventive. His unconventional alignment of shots, for example beginning a scene with close-ups and ending it with a wide shot, is occasionally awkward but often brilliant. His roving camera movements are complex, but they do not forcefully draw our focus as Hitchcock's do. Rather, they gently lead us through an environment as if we were entering it ourselves. Nevertheless, Whale is a master of the sudden attention-grabber, suddenly throwing his camera into the midst of a situation at a key point. In short, it's a very pure cinematic technique, yet it has that quality of the showman, drawing us into the flow of the images and then suddenly demanding "Look at this!" And while Colin Clive's famous line "Now I know what it feels like to be God" was deleted upon release, only to recently be restored for the DVD, Whale himself is responsible for a more subtle bit of visual blasphemy. The shot of the monster's hand stirring to life is a direct parody of the resurrection of Lazarus in Cecil B. DeMille's 1927 King of Kings.Most intriguing of all is the cast of Frankenstein. Colin Clive, as the eponymous doctor, treads a fine line between a stark dramatic figure and an overblown theatrical one. Boris Karloff too treads a similar line between a realistic portrait of a childlike human and a monstrous horror creation. Their co-stars tend to fall either side of this line, either filling in the functional straight roles or presenting with overt caricatures. Of the latter we have that delightful curmudgeon Frederick Kerr, who always gives the impression of having just wandered onto the set and simply bumbled about unscripted. Then there is Dwight Frye, a creepy capering subhuman who has little purpose except to add another facet of weirdness. Frye is also the subject of my favourite bit of humour of the movie, in which he is present but not included as one of the "three perfectly sane spectators" described by Clive, presumably occupying a special category of his own. Typically of Frankenstein this gag is not drawn attention to, and looks unintentional.And this is the key to the Laemmle-Whale version of Frankenstein. It is an atmospheric horror, of a creeping, eldritch manner, laced with an oddball silliness which never slips into outright farce but prevents the genuine horror elements from becoming inadvertently comical. The makers of Frankenstein know that the picture can't quite compete in the thrilling or spooking stakes, and so wrap it in a cloak of grand theatrical extravagance, without ever robbing it of its dignity or its horror credentials. Frankenstein is perhaps the first open acknowledgement of the notion that watching a scary movie can be good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone who is anyone who knows about movies knows about Frankenstein. Everyone knows the plot. Every frame of this movie has been analyzed and dissected and committed to many a film buff's memory. The interesting thing, though, is that nearly 80 years later it's still as visceral and deep as it ever was.Using a mix of pre-built sets (to give it that moody vibe) and on location shooting that really captures the essence of birth and wonder, we watch a man in Dr. Frankenstein care for his tragically misunderstood monster in a somewhat strict way. Boris Karloff plays the monster with much aplomb, at first barely self-aware but constantly learning.There's almost too many themes to count in this classic, ranging from the human effect on personal development to a man understanding his place (or lack thereof, and then later understanding his actual place) - to the misanthrope nature of building a person out of spare body parts (read: don't do it!). Great movie, could only be better if John Lithgow played Dr. Frankenstein. (Harry and the Hendersons, anyone?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not as nuanced or intricate as Mary Shelley's source novel, this early Universal monster masterpiece is a relatively faithful telling of her masterfully macabre tale that holds up admirably under modern scrutiny. So many films have referenced Frankenstein that many of its more powerful elements may be lost on viewers discovering it for the first time today, but age has not diluted this classy production, or dulled the most potent of its indelible visuals.Universal's earliest monster outings were constructed much like the dramatic and noir flagstones that propelled the studio into greatness. In essence, they were Gothic stage plays captured on film, using strong acting and atmospherics to stimulate terror where the primitive special effects capabilities of the era could not. Frankenstein is crafted with this same approach, and one of the reasons it has aged so well is because it was developed with a sense of timelessness that befits the timeless nature of the source material.The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling backlot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European countrysides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here.The massive castle sets, particularly Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, are still impressive by modern standards, and though we now have more sophisticated toys than those seen in the lab, the devices in the doctor's dwelling are far more than elaborate set decoration. Each apparatus looks functional and logical, and though most of us have never tried to re-animate a corpse in our basement, we have to concede that the machines we'd need to do so would probably look and work just like the ones we see humming in the house of Frankenstein.Surely, no one reading this has managed to go their whole lives without seeing the iconic image of Boris Karloff's amazingly realized monster. But seeing him in action is another matter altogether, and even stifled under the unforgettable make-up, Karloff gives a brilliant performance as the tragic and misunderstood creature struggling to comprehend its existence after being spurned by its creator. The range of emotions Karloff conveys is astounding, especially considering that he doesn't have a single line in the film, and we surely empathize with the horrid reality of this damned creation as it uncovers each curse brought on by its unnatural birth. The make-up remains truly stunning, and the first time Frankenstein's monster steps into frame is still one of the most powerful and haunting images to ever grace a horror film.Ditto with the controversial drowning scene, which was edited from the film at various points of its history. Those seeing this sequence for the first time may be surprised that such a brief display was deemed so controversial in its day, but the stark simplicity of the image, and the horror that is implied rather than shown, shape an unforgettable scene that is crucial in driving the film to its climax. When the drowned girl's father later carries her limp and battered body down the street, the mourning and furious emptiness in his eyes is one of the film's most compelling images, as it perhaps most completely essays the outrageous evil of Dr. Frankenstein's horrific work.Those not used to classic movies may have trouble acclimating to the film's style, but the rewards of Frankenstein far outweigh any discomfort of adjustment, and there are a multitude of reasons this cinematic landmark has endured the way it has. For anyone who has yet to discover those reasons for themselves, consider your horror acumen woefully malnourished until you've added this certified classic to your library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In honor of the Halloween season approaching, I find it a great time to review one of my favorite sci-fi/horror films of all time. Frankenstein by James Whale is very different from Mary Shelley's original 1831 novel. Frankenstein's monster doesn't talk like he does in the novel, and Victor Frankenstein is renamed Henry Frankenstein. But even though it has major differences, it is still and epic classic.Everything about this film is something to enjoy, every scene well thought out and designed. The iconic scene with Frankenstein clinging from the operating table is one of the most epic scenes of all time. Even Darth Vader does it in Revenge of the Sith.In the end, Frankenstein is one of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time, and just goes to show you that movies based off books with a quadrillion things different can still turn out to be beloved classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said Frankenstein wasn't the monster?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first, very strange thing that you will witness in 'Frankenstien' is a man politely warning you that you may find the film a little scary. Yes indeed, 'Frankenstein' was made long, long ago in the days when manners still existed.I approached 'Frankenstein' expecting to see all the clichés. Igor the hideously deformed, hunchbacked manservant, Dr. Frankenstein laughing maniacally and screaming "He's alive! Allliiiiiiiiiive!", and the rancourous Monster killing everyone it sees.But the actual film is a lot more subtle than that.Firstly, Fritz (Dright Frye) the hunchbacked manservant is more of a wide-eyed simpleton than anything else, and far from speaking in the croaky lisp that everyone knows Igor speaks with, he actually sounds kinda normal.Secondly, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) was a much more subtle character than the gibbering, maniacal cliché. OK, he's not that much more subtle, but he's vaguely believable.And finally - the Monster (Boris Karloff) was a sympathetic character.Say _what?_ Yep. I might just be showing my ignorance here, but I was surprised by this. Throughout the film he's the victim - first Dr. Frankenstein locks him for days on end in a dark cell, then Fritz taunts him with a burning torch (he's afraid of fire, you see), and when it's finally decided that the monster had become too much of a handful and should be put down, Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) decides to vivisect him rather than kill him quickly.Basically, it's no wonder the Monster is a little peevish. But he's still willing to sit and learn, as he comes across a little girl and plays an innocent game with her.But - and this is the clever bit - Dr. Frankenstein and all his friends are still presented in a directorially good light. There is no sinister music to vilify them, and they are shown to be loving, caring people that we might call normal and decent.So it's left up to us, the audience, to decide who is good and who is evil. We have to look at what the characters do and consider their actions rationally.This is a level of maturity in storytelling that far exceeds anything I'd expect to see in films these days.Why is that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!" A brilliant but arrogant scientist, experimenting in the nature and creation of life, manages to build a living creature from exhumed body parts and the brain of an executed criminal. The creature gets loose in a strange world where tragedy ensues and a frightened populace seeks its destruction.Both Dracula and Frankenstein have great Gothic sets and settings, but somehow, while Dracula creates this grand and grim atmosphere, Frankenstein's seems just as grim but far more bleak. And this is contrasted by very light and cheerful settings at times, like when the Monster is playing with the little girl at the edge of the water, where the viewer sees a ray of hope that there might be some happiness in this monstrosity's life.James Whale's Frankenstein is my favorite movie of the big Universal horror films of the 1930's and is one of the best horror films ever created. A wonderful story adapted from Mary Shelley's novel turned into a great screenplay, beautiful sets, and an incredible performance by Boris Karloff as the Monster, all contribute to its greatness. This film has been praised and analyzed so often that I have little to add.Let me just say that I enjoyed it a lot. It holds the attention of the viewer, creates a very suitable atmosphere and is paced well enough that it never gets boring. There is also enough time devoted to the development of the characters that I felt very sympathetic for them and almost as if I knew them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic in every sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" is one of the classic films that has still held up remarkably well.**SPOILERS**Following a local burial service, mad scientist Baron Henry Frankenstein, (Colin Clive) and his hunchback servant Fritz, (Dwight Frye) steal a corpse and return to their laboratory for an important experiment. As he gets closer to finishing it, friends Victor Moritz, (John Boles) Elizabeth, (Mae Clark) and Dr. Waldman, (Edward Van Sloan) are forced to witness the experiment, which involves bringing the dead back to life. The product of the experiment, a man created through dead body parts, (Boris Karloff) is kept there, but soon grows vicious and manages to escape into the countryside. Hoping it won't start a murderous rampage, they all band together to stop the monster.The Good News: One of the all-time best films in that time, there's a lot to love about this one. It's one of the few films of that time that actually put up some scares. The sequence near the end with the monster slowly approaching an unsuspecting woman with a devilish grin is unbearably spooky and tense, and that it comes from the shadows makes it all the more creepy. Nothing, though, can match the reanimation sequence for thrills and chills. What was undoubtedly a startling creepy scene back then still resonates, and the chill that slowly moving had generates is just as shocking today. Almost as shocking as the actual first appearance of the creature, which leaves an incredibly memorable image. Beyond the scares, it's a wonderful film to look at. It is a fearless visual splendor. Sets are opulent and askew. Mountaintop laboratories look like huge mausoleums, monumental markers for the upcoming death, forests are filled with tall, foreboding trees, and the now-familiar old windmill is as stunning now as ever. That sets up the best conclusion to any film at that time, filled with action and a great way to end it on a high note. What is also impressive is the great way it paces itself. The biggest problem with most of those was that it took too long to set-up their story. This one has it up and running within the first half hour, and that is a great way to pace itself. Combine these factors with Karloff's memorable turn as the monster, and you've got a film that deserves its status as a classic.The Bad News: There is really only one small fault I can find in the film, and that is that it looks way too stagy at the beginning. The sets are way too big and mostly look like left-overs from a theater production, and this is especially true in the laboratory scenes. This is the only thing I can fault with it, however.The Final Verdict: With only the fact that the sets look to big holding this down, there's really nothing to stop this from becoming one of the all-time classics of the genre. It holds up remarkable well for the time period, and is the best Universal series starter among their classic line-ups. Highly recommended to any and everyone.Today's Rating-PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931): Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, Frederick Kerr, Edward Von Sloan, Dwight Frye, Lionel Belmore, Marilyn Harris, Arletta Duncan, Ted Billings, Francis Ford, Mary Gordon, Michael Mark, Paul Panzer, Cecilia Parker, Ellinor Vanderveer... Director James Whale, Screenplay John L. Balderston from the play by Peggy Webling.Based on Mary Shelley's 19th century horror novel, this was a huge success for Universal when released in 1931. Drawn from a play, Director James Whale's film would enjoy the same level of acclaim that Dracula with Bela Lugosi did in the same decade. Boris Karloff became a household name in horror along with Lugosi and unfortunately for these actors, these roles were the only ones they were cast in. Frankenstein captures the spirit of Hollywood movies at the time. The Depression was still on, radio and not television was the only other available source of entertainment and so audiences flocked to movie theaters to see movies with melodramatic and incredible plots (King Kong, etc) when they weren't watching romance or their favorite actors in either comedy or serious films. Not entirely accurate to the novel, this movie is built around Boris Karloff portraying the Frankenstein monster. Because this role is that of an overgrown, awkward, dead-looking, automaton creature, it was an impressive performance by Karloff under heavy make up and costume. There's no real need for him to act but even so, he plays the role with sensitivity and humanity in small subtle doses. Much has already been said about the famous scene in which Frankenstein plays with a little girl and is confused by the game she's invented and ultimately kills her. He is a big child and he wants to learn about the human world but it's scary and his strongest instincts are to kill. The thing is this same instinct is inside us as humans. The best performance is that of Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. He is maniacal, driven by ambition and oozing the classic "evil scientist" persona. His scene in which he revives Frankenstein during a lightning storm is one of the most memorable scenes in horror movies. "It's Alive! It's Alive! At last I know what it is like to play God". This is the message of the film. Dr. Frankenstein has played God in resurrecting a corpse and the consequences are dire. Still, the novel is a lot stronger in this theme and a lot more haunting. This film is sensational and at the same time filled with "everyday" scenes in a village. The ending in which a baby is born in Baron Frankenstein's home is absolutely commonplace. The romance between Elizabeth and Victor is wooden and underdeveloped. This movie was a hit at the time because few movies had reached a level of horror at the time. But it's a classic and all horror film fans should view this as a valuable treasure from the early 30's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You have created a monster, and it will destroy you!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the most important horror movie ever made, James Whale's 1931 adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic 1818 novel 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,' is both beautiful and terrifying, a film that almost single-handedly defined an entire genre for decades (though such a thing might also be said of Tod Browning's 'Dracula,' starring Bela Lugosi). Generally agreed upon to be the first science-fiction novel, Shelley's 'Frankenstein' was a shocking cautionary tale of the dangers of playing God, and a depiction of the influence of violence and maltreatment on the developing human consciousness. Whale's film keeps the novel's themes largely intact, the horror film specialist ensuring that 'Frankenstein' is not a film that we can expect to forget any time soon.Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), an overly-ambitious young scientist, is obsessed with the desire to create life, to feel what it is like to be God. Secluded in his remote laboratory, built within a derelict watch tower atop a hill, and aided only by his loyal hunchback assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein has been working hard to perfect his electrical devices, with which he plans to resurrect a corpse, painstakingly compiled from the body parts of dead people whose graves he has raided. However, when Frankenstein's experiment is successful, and life is created from death, the hideous, malformed creature (Boris Karloff), initially tormented by Fritz, becomes an angry killer.Though every acting performance in this film is spot-on, none received more fame than an English actor by the name of William Henry Pratt (screen name: Boris Karloff), who rose to extraordinary stardom following this film, to such an extent that during the 1930s he was often credited simply as "Karloff," or even "Karloff the Uncanny." In fact, Karloff himself is unbilled during the opening credits (the actor portraying The Monster is denoted by a "?"), possibly to fuel interest about whether or not 'Dracula' star Bela Lugosi had chosen to reconsider his decision not to appear in the film. Nonetheless, Karloff is credited with the role during the closing credits.The physical appearance of Frankenstein's Monster is not based upon Mary Shelley's literary description, but is rather the extraordinary make-up design of Jack Pierce. The preliminary design, with Lugosi planned for the main role, has been described as reminiscent of Paul Wegener's 1920 German film, 'The Golem.' When Whale replaced Robert Florey as director, Pierce's design changed radically, with the addition of the Monster's flattened forehead, the famous electrode "bolts" on his neck and a nasty scar where Dr. Frankenstein had accessed the brain cavity. Karloff endured four hours of make-up work daily, and even volunteered to remove a dental plate to give his character sunken cheeks.Even prior to the release of this film, people had been erroneously referring to the Monster as "Frankenstein," despite that name referring to the doctor himself. In Shelley's novel, the Monster remained unnamed (referred to as "the creature," "the fiend," "the d?mon," or "the wretch"), as does he in this film. However, the title of Whale's highly-successful sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein,' reflects how widespread the misattribution had become. Many commentators have pointed out, however, that, because the Monster may be considered the "offspring" of Dr. Frankenstein, referring to the Monster as such may be acceptable.Keeping with the novel's theme, Dr. Frankenstein's Monster is shown not to be an inherently evil killing machine, but the result of abuse and mistreatment from the moment of his creation ? though the insertion of an "abnormal" criminal brain may suggest otherwise. The most heartbreaking and haunting death in the film is the innocent drowning of a girl by a childlike mind, as the Monster runs out of flowers to throw into the lake, and so decides to see if young Maria will float. The title of the film does, indeed, refer to the true villain of the picture ? it is not the Monster, but Dr. Frankenstein himself, who decided to play God, and so unleashed the horrors of the Monster upon the town. I only wish that sweet cinematic justice had prevailed, and that Dr. Frankenstein was inevitably killed by the Monster he so blatantly created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beautiful thing about a true work of art in any genre or any medium is that it will stand the test of time and be just as intriguing 75 years later if not more so. Well, FRANKENSTEIN definitely stands up to that test as a timeless horror classic featuring the definitive movie monster. Of course, in 2007, it's not a film that will scare your pants off... everyone has seen the Frankenstein Monster as immortalized by Boris Karloff, he's as big of a fictional American icon as Mickey Mouse or Superman, so his appearance in the film is more likely to bring warm feelings of recognition rather than fright. That doesn't mean that the film is boring (it fairly flies by at just over an hour) or lacking spooky atmospherics (it may not terrify you, but it can still deliver Halloweenish goose bumps with its foggy graveyards and stormy nights), but the thing that still knocks me out is the set design and the Germanic, expressionist cinematography. Although BRIDE OF FRANKESNTEIN was clearly made with a much bigger budget, they definitely made the best out of what they had in this first feature, and certainly the laboratory equipment is still a treat to behold. The retro effect of watching the creation scene in 2007 only adds to its appeal. I also think the lack of a score and the relative crudeness of the film in comparison to later flicks in the series adds to the film rather than detracts. Karloff is great as the sympathetic creature, and Colin Clive is delightfully manic as Frankenstein. Sure the acting is dated and melodramatic at times... the film was made in 1931, you have to keep the performances in that perspective. But the overall artistry of the production, the better-than-you'd-expect dialogue and acting, and James Whale's distinctive direction all add up to make this landmark film the granddaddy of all monster movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Without Reckoning With God"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dracula" may be the first classic Hollywood scare film in the sound age, but "Frankenstein's" power to horrify remains uniquely strong. That's in large part on account of its existential, post-Christian theme, it being a rare horror movie that not only eschews the supernatural but fairly cries out against concepts of a caring divinity or an afterlife.No wonder the makers felt they needed to say something at the outset about the mistake Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) made of conducting his experiment "without reckoning with God." Clearly the idea is to put 1931 moviegoers more at ease, but this introduction, so wryly given by one of the film's actors, Edward Van Sloan, also pushes forward the atheistic theme the rest of the film will pursue less gingerly.Cooped up in a lonely watchtower set against a dark, foreboding sky, Dr. Frankenstein builds his own blasphemy stitched together from robbed bodies. Given life by lightning, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly gives Frankenstein cause to regret his creation, while sowing terror across the countryside."Have you ever wanted to do something that was dangerous?" Dr. Frankenstein asks his former mentor Waldman (Van Sloan). It's this transgressive quality, both in the character and the film named after him, which gives "Frankenstein" much of its frisson even today.The chills begin right away, when we first observe Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz skulking around the edges of the world's spookiest cemetery, watching hollow-faced extras who look a few short breaths away from their own funerals mourning someone whose body Henry plans to steal. No middle-class moralist he!There's a lot of artful gloom in "Frankenstein," part of it carried over from German expressionist cinema like "The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari" (Dwight Frye as Fritz, Frankenstein's assistant, performs a function here similar to Conrad Veidt's in "Caligari") and part of it the function of director James Whale and the others responsible for the look of the film; set dressers, special effects hands, and most notably makeup man Jack Pierce, who gave Karloff his distinctive, deathly look, stronger here than it would ever be again."Frankenstein" holds true to its hard tone at some loss to the picture's quality. There is little humor or light in this film, something sorely missed in a dated period piece like this, and the acting around Clive is notably weak across the board, except for Frye and of course, Karloff. It helps Boris that his character remains mute, what with exchanges like: "But Elizabeth, you can't do that!" "I must!" pocking the script. Clive does well, albeit with a character who is rather inconsistent, going all of a sudden from ready lawbreaker to civic paragon. In the denouement he isn't chased by a mob, but leading it.Though stitches do show in this somewhat patchwork creation (sorry, couldn't resist), there is resilient majesty in its greatest scenes, like our first glimpse of Frankenstein's face (three close ups, each moving further in from a different angle) and the dreadful image near the end of the father taking his daughter in to the village fair. Though I admire "Frankenstein" more than I enjoy it, it's still a powerful thing to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant. Genius. Maniac. A few words to describe Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who, along with his freakish sidekick Fritz (Dwight Frye), attempts to challenge the authority of even God: To animate the dead. His lovely wife Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his old professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), and his father Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) all try to prevent try to prevent the hellish uprising, but even they cannot stop it. Soon, the monster is on the lose, and, to the horror of Frankenstein, terrorizing the countryside...What sets Frankenstein's monster apart from other Universal Monsters, such as the voluptuous Dracula, is that Frankenstein's monster is sympathetic, in the sense that he is a mere product of science, with a longing for human contact. Director James Whale presents science as a perversion of natural and Christian life, a prevision of death, a tyrant murder of the innocent, a separation of Christina marriage. Dr. Waldman, played by the late Edward Van Sloan, as the only exception, for he is a good man who He sacrifices his life trying to stop the monster.The performances by the now late cast are all very well. Colin Clive's intense performance is great. To see the true depth of his performance, view the scene where Dr. Waldman informs him of his mistake in brain theft. His face is one of up most doubt and concern, which quickly transforms into a face of over confidence. Brilliant. Mae Clarke fills the screen with a presence of vulnerability and innocence. Frederick Kerr adds great helps of humor as Baron Frankenstein, with quirky and wonderfully delivered lines, including his hardened belief that Henry is involved with another woman. Dwight Frye's performance as Henry's sidekick Fritz is eerie and quite a contrast to Colin Clive's proper character. The rest of the cast, including John Boles as Victor Moritz and Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman are all goodThe most notable performance, of course, has to be Boris Karloff as The Monster. Karloff's fame as a horror legend was build on his performance as The Monster. With a lack of dialog(Until the 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, that is), Karloff is limited in his performance. However, he takes full advantage, offering an array of unforgettable grunts and movements. Juxtaposed with some nifty make up effects(for the time) and director James Whale skill of showing just enough, but not to much, make for an unforgettable screen performance.By juxtaposing Gothic decay and modern science, Whale creates an untrusted and ironic tone, developed further by Arthur Edeson's cinematography and the lyricism of the writing.Wonderfully acted, beautifully filmed and crafted, ironic, thought provoking, and chilling to this day, FRANKENSTEIN remains a horror classic, one not to missed. If not for its ionic stance in film, see it for it's thought provoking themes and simplistic nature.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The torch burning mob is more scary than the monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Boris Karloff does a wonderful job giving emotion to the monster, the reaction evoked towards the monster is itself scary. German peasants carrying torches and burning someone alive in a windmill circa 1931 lends its own scary quality to the movie. Wagnerian strains of ubermensch scientist playing god carries a nasty tinge of what the Nazis would soon do to Europe. The monster can be seen as symbolic of a society's attitude toward the mentally ill.The audience has an odd hint of sympathy to the monster struggling to comprehend its new environment. I am thinking about the scene where the monster smiles at the little girl giving him a flower to toss into the water. Ultimately, the monster ultimately cannot understand and kills the girl. The audience is simultaneously repelled and sympathetic towards the monster.Shelley's book Frankenstein was a reaction to the emerging emancipation of the English peasants. Shelley's monster, if I remember correctly, was given an education by Dr. Frankenstein. English society's correctly feared that education would create a Frankenstein monster that would destabilize the rigid class structure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great-Granddaddy of all Mad Scientist/Monster movies, James Whale's seminal classic still packs quite a punch. Based only loosely on the novel by Mary Shelley, FRANKENSTEIN set the standard for a generation of horror movies, and created genre staples that would be copied through to the Hammer horror films of the 60s, and parodied mercilessly thereafter. While it can hardly be considered an horrific movie by modern-day standards, it does establish its superiority over contemporary horror flicks through the quality of its writing which maintains an atmosphere of both tragedy and pathos that is never seen in the genre today. Perhaps this is why there hasn't been a decent version of the legend for decades.With a brisk running time of just over 70 minutes (including a somewhat camp warning by Edward van Sloan about the nature of the story that is about to unfold), the movie wastes no time with exposition. We're thrown straight into the action as we join Dr. Frankenstein (a vaguely cadaverous Colin Clive) and his stunted sidekick Fritz (Dwight Frye) on a grave-snatching expedition in a wonderfully spooky graveyard full of tilting tombstones and a grim reaper statue. Frankenstein is just a body part or two away from beginning his great experiment, and we learn of his obsession from his former tutor Dr. Waldman (Edward van Sloan again) as he explains to Frankenstein's worried fiancé (Mae Clarke) just why her future husband keeps putting off naming their wedding day. Things quickly move on and, having inserted what turns out to be an abnormal brain into the cadaver they lifted from the graveyard, Frankenstein is ready to zap a few thousand volts through his patchwork creation, courtesy of a passing thunderstorm. The movie is worth seeing for this sequence alone.Boris Karloff, as we all know, plays the part of the monster. It was a role that would make him famous, and it was probably the best part he ever played. The screenplay, while it refers to Frankenstein's creation as a monster, is depicted as a lost and frightened creature, raging at those who have chained him up and tormented him with burning torches. In a world he doesn't understand everything seems hostile, and the brief moment of pleasure he enjoys (floating flowers with a little girl on a river) is destroyed when, having run out of flowers, he picks up the girl and throws her into the water, only to flee from the scene when she fails to float. Of all the memorable moments in the film, this is the one that remains truly horrific. It was considered too harrowing for audiences at the time, and was only restored to the picture nearly 60 years after its original release. Rumour has it that additional scenes showing the girl's struggles as she tries to stay afloat were also filmed.While FRANKENSTEIN has proved to be a massive influence on the horror genre (it's far superior to Dracula which was also made by Universal in the same year) it also clearly has influences of its own: the opening graveyard scene and the design of the watchtower in which Frankenstein conducts his experiments are clearly inspired by the German expressionist style of the 20s, and suit perfectly the nightmarish world into which Frankenstein has plunged both himself and his creation.The horror genre has moved on since the days of Frankenstein and Dracula. While the vampire sub-genre has evolved and remains strong today, Frankenstein and his monster are fast becoming relics, representative of a bygone era ? largely, perhaps, because their story lacks the sexual element inherent in vampirism. Lumbering monsters who give chase on clumsy feet with their arms outstretched don't stand a chance of competing. And perhaps that's the way it should be, because modern representations of the legend will never be as enthralling ? or as much fun ? as this horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential monster movie...A classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's alive, it's alive, it's alive!" In fact, despite being more than seventy years old, this film is still very much alive. James Whale's Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies of all time. Bolstered by Boris Karloff's spectacular portrayal of the Monster, Jack P. Pierce's incredible talent as a make-up artist, and Colin Clive's mad Dr. Frankenstein, this version of Mary Shelley's masterpiece remains unmatched by the countless films that have sought to recreate its magic. Boris Karloff brings so much depth and sensitivity to the creature that it is often difficult to call him a monster. This is a rare achievement, playing the "villain" in a film so well that the audience can relate to him, or feel for him. Who has not felt misunderstood, lost, confused, rejected, or even despised at some point in their lives? If not all of us, then I would imagine, most of us. Karloff's ability to show a bit of humanity from behind his menacing make-up is truly astonishing. I could not help but feel pity for the Monster when Fritz (Dwight Frye, who also played Renfield in Universal's Dracula that same year) tortured him with the torch. At times like these, you must ask who is the monster here? Is it the creature brought back to life by no desire of his own? Is it the insanely over-ambitious Dr. Frankenstein who cannot see life as more than a vehicle for his experimentation? One could certainly argue that Fritz was a monster, based on his cruel treatment of the monster. Not all monsters choose to be what they are perceived to be. Some monsters, as in this case, are created by true monsters. You could say that I have read a little too much into all of this, but I mention it because I think that a great movie makes you think, makes you ask questions, and this movie does those things. With its impressive performances and amazing (albeit, for its time) special effects, and endless influence on subsequent monster/horror movies, James Whale's Frankenstein is a classic not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OR...PART 1 ! Bride of Frankenstein concludes the Story (or does it??)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that sound in the movies had only been around for a just over 2 years; film language (with sound) was not yet recognized as an art form (most directors hadn't figured out proper film language yet...come to think of it, most directors still haven't), this movie has a proper place as a pioneer of a chilling story that, despite its age, is well told...and for two reasons: James Whales's direction and Boris Karloff!This movie creeks with age! It's very "Stage-like" !! (from the opening shot with Edward Van Sloan's intro, complete with the actor parting the curtains to warn the obvious audience...he never looks directly into the camera...to the final shot). It's theatrically 'overacted' (but NOT by Karloff). And it has no music score, which in a creepy kind of way...works without it.Yet this movie still entertains, in a way that entertains adults AND children. James Whale put many subtleties (influenced by his sexual preferences), and does it brilliantly! The Creation scene; where the watch tower is shown against the thundering clouds...as if it represents 'BLANK' thrusting its way into the womb (the storm) that ultimately gives birth to the Monster. And the comic relief provided by 'Old Baron Frankenstein' who suspects that his son's absence is the result of 'another woman' (when, in reality, Henry isn't around because of another 'man-made'...man!). For the children: most instantly see the Monster as misunderstood and abused. And that is the result of Karloff's sympathetic and non-horror approach to his performance.If Mary Shelly's novel was more faithfully adapted, arguably, it would not have worked as well (the novel's creature speaks 'upper class' English better than anyone I know). But if you see 'Frankenstein', along with its sequel 'Bride of Frankenstein', (in one sitting), the two films capture the essence of the novel's portrayal of the Monster's loneliness and his longing for love and companionship. History shows that neither film, both directed by Whale, is independent of each other. Together, they tell a complete story!Great sets!(the creation; the mountains; Universal Studio's back lot).And no one can play Frankenstein's Monster like Boris Karloff. No one ever will!8.5 out of 10 ! A Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff's performance is fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following in the wake of the success of DRACULA, Universal's natural next step was an adaptation of Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN. Bela Lugosi, the star of DRACULA, was courted to play the role of the Monster, but he turned it down. He felt that he didn't want to take a role with no lines (other than grunts), and he really objected to having his handsome good looks buried beneath mounds of makeup. The story goes that director James Whale "discovered" Boris Karloff in the commissary and recognized that his facial features would make a great monster.The truth is that Karloff had made over 80 films prior to FRANKENSTEIN, and was no beginner. The experience he brought to the role helped to make it such a defining moment in his career, and in film history. Many of the films Karloff had made up to that point had been silent films and that seems to have been a fortunate fact, given the range of emotions he would have to deliver with no dialogue.Director James Whale gave FRANKENSTEIN a decidedly impressionistic feel, akin to the German films of the day (THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARY, for example), with great vertical shots and long shadows. Both Colin Clive in the role of Frankenstein (Frankenstein was the Doctor's name, NOT the monster's) and Mae Clarke, in the role of Elizabeth, had worked with Whale previously and this already-established rapport helped to make the director's vision become a reality.Despite the fantastic effort of all involved it is, more than any other thing, Karloff's performance that makes FRANKENSTEIN one of the great films in Hollywood's history. He portrays the Monster in a sympathetic manner. Indeed, it is the way that others react to the Monster that is the true horror of the film, as is the real life treatment of any person who is different, through no fault of their own.The other ingredient that made FRANKENSTEIN a truly great film is the makeup work of Jack Pierce. His realization of the character of the Monster, in the person of Boris Karloff, is one of the milestone achievements in special effects. The makeup he created has become synonymous with the character and is perhaps more enduring than the film itself. How many people have never seen this film, but would instantly recognize the makeup? Too many. If you haven't seen this film, you're missing one of the genuine treasures of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Misunderstood as the Monster Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody with half-a-brain knows that this film, made in the EARLY 1930s, is a melodrama in tune with the silent movies still looming large in FRANKENSTEIN's rearview mirror. Any slope-browed cretin trying to compare FRANKENSTEIN to any modern-era horror film, or even to the vastly superior BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, doesn't have the compacity to understand the pure fact before them: FRANKENSTEIN is the movie that trampled barriers in film, and the culture itself, allowing for all the innovation and creative output to follow. Without FRANKENSTEIN there is simply no base: the Monster is, to put it mildly, the most incredible, ground-breaking creature ever put to celluloid.FRANKENSTEIN, as a film, is not great. But the idea of the Monster, a living dead man with immense strength, unable to communicate, desiring to be human while forced to shamble in darkness, a massive bonecrusher with the power of a god yet helpless as a child, THATis the essence of FRANKENSTEIN's grand, pure tragedy, the knowing that to live forever as a walking corpse denies the Monster the right to exist: imagine being a stitched-together brute longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, or the fearless adoration of a small child, knowing always that your hands belong to a dead killer, and their cold iron sinews are designed to strangle, not caress. Always will the Monster be the victim of his own power, the accidental blow in anger, the drowning of a child in misunderstanding. I grow incensed at the moronic nature of some of these comments. Dig that FRANKENSTEIN is your grandpappy's motion picture, old and stiff as Karloff's walk, but respect that the creation of the Monster, KARLOFF's Monster, is still the first and foremost pinnacle of our movie heritage, from which we are allowed to view all the horror and violence and tragedy of the human existence. In other words, your Anne Rice fluff vampires and your ALIEN and just about every 'icon' of horror since 1945 are derivative nonsense. You don't have to watch FRANKENSTEIN, but don't blame it for being one of the greatest ideas American culture has ever come up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein: The Monster Maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" (Universal, 1931), directed by James Whale, became the second horror film of the year following its earlier production of "Dracula." The feature opens with Edward Van Sloan, who appears in the photo-play as Doctor Waldman, coming from behind a curtain and on stage to inform the movie audience on what they are about to see, "To present this picture with a friendly warning." Following his phrase and a few more lines, he ends it with, "Well, we've warned you." Then the opening credits begin, and unlike some other horror movies of that period, it doesn't open with the underscoring of "Swan Lake."Set in an unnamed German village at no particular time period, a young scientist named Doctor Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), who, with the help of his hunchback assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), digs up a recently buried body preceded by a funeral, later fashioning the human body to conduct his experiment to see if he can make it come back to life. Learning of what he is doing, his fiancée, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), along with his friend, Victor Moritz (John Boles), and Doctor Waldman (Van Sloan) try to stop him, but to no avail. Frankenstein proves his theory to his skeptics by taking the body he has created, now lying on an operating table, and having the table raised through an opening in the roof during a lightning storm. When the table is back in the lab, the hand of the body slowly rises, with Frankenstein yelling those famous words, "It's alive, it's alive!" Time passes. Frankenstein learns from Doctor Waldman that the brain placed on the Monster (Boris Karloff) is actually a criminal brain stolen from his lab by Fritz. The Monster, in a confused state, is constantly teased by the unsympathetic Fritz with a fire torch, and because of this, the angry Monster hangs Fritz with his own whip. After the Monster leaves the lab and into the countryside, he goes out on his rein of terror."Frankenstein," helped advance the career of Boris Karloff, who would reprise his role in two more sequels. Karloff succeeded into making his monster figure both frightening (compliments of make-up artist Jack Pierce) and yet sympathetic at the same time. Baby boomers who grew up watching this and other classic horror films of the 1930s and '40s presented on local TV stations back in the 1960s and '70s every Saturday night on Creature Features, Fright Night, Chiller Theater, or whatever name it was given, will recall certain scenes from "Frankenstein" having that sudden editing look, such as the one after the Monster, who accompanies a little girl named Maria (Marilyn Harris), into throwing daisies into the water. After throwing his last daisy, the Monster looks at his empty hands, holds his hands out and...(CUT to next shot). In the scene now restored, the Monster is shown throwing Maria into the water, and running away in a state of confusion. Also deleted but now restored is the scene earlier in the story in which Frankenstein, after seeing his experiment come to life, saying, "Oh, in the name of God, now I know what it feels like to be God." Those lines were taken out, leaving the viewer to see Frankenstein's lips moving without hearing words, but dubbed in laughter of hysterics.Unlike the future sequels, "Frankenstein" concentrates more on plot development, focusing on the leading actors played by Clive, Clarke, Boles and Van Sloan, who they are, etc., before it gets down to business with Karloff's Monster, which appears about 30 minutes from the start of the story. There is no underscoring to help it along, but plenty of extreme close-up shots on the central characters, seeing their expressions and wondering what they are thinking at present. The plot itself would set the pattern for future sequels to come. Also in the cast are Frederick Kerr (who lisps whenever pronouncing any word with an "S" in it) acting the role as Baron Frankenstein, presented here with some "comedy relief"; Lionel Bellmore as the Burgomaster, among others. Although John Boles, usually likable playing devoted husbands in dramas or as a singer in light operas, seems out of place here. On a personal level, maybe David Manners, who played the handsome romantic co-star in "Dracula," "The Mummy" and "The Black Cat," would have made it work somewhat better as Frankenstein's best friend. Some of the dialog Boles in given to recite somewhat succeeds in weakening the strength of the story. Mae Clarke does get her chance to let out some screams in a classic moment where she is encountered by the Monster in her locked room.On and all, the original sound version of "Frankenstein" which has a successful run on American Movie Classics in 1991, revived on AMC from 2001 to 2002, and then Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: October 8, 1998), is quite memorable by all means, thanks to video and DVD distributions as well as Karloff's understanding of his character, but its sequel, "The Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), however, makes up for some weaknesses in the original.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most important horror film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important horror films ever made, this adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel is both sophisticated and thoughtful (much more so, in fact, than Branagh's more recent "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.") The monster has never been played better than Boris Karloff does here. Director James Whale finds pathos both in the creature and in its creator. Whale's adaptation of the Romantic classic finds a strange resonance in 1931 as technology actually began to fulfill some of the Promethian prophecies Shelly had made.Watch closely in the restored version as Frankenstein cries "In the name of God, now I know what it feels like to be god." The film should have special meaning for contemporary viewers as it seriously asks the questions we are faced with in the light of recent advances in cloning technology. What will be the status of "created" human beings? Who will be responsible for them? How will they be received by the public? As this line of questioning suggests, the most frightening thing in the story (for Shelly, for Whale, and for us) is not the monster but the technology that might make his creation possible. Banned in cities across the United States and England at its release in 1931, the film was considered by many theatergoers simply too shocking to view. Perhaps the most chilling thing about this film is that contemporary pre-teens view it as simply silly compared to the steady diet of blood and gore they face on television every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film, Not a Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a century of film-making, there is still such a vast and all-consuming ignorance of what films in general, and FRANKENSTEIN in particular, are supposed to do. Source material, fromMary Shelley's novel of the same title, sub-heading "Modern Prometheus", is an overheated gothic tale exploring a topic that was very prominent at the turn of the century: the morality of Science. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the protagonist, creates artificial life in his laboratory, and witnesses that life gather its own intelligence. Eventually, the life-form demands more, haunting Frankenstein to his end.The book is literature, a time-piece. The film FRANKENSTEIN is also a time-piece, but the book has no bearing on the film. This is a film about a creature, the Monster played by Boris Karloff, and the great Jack Pierce make-up which is an icon of American culture. The Monster is inarticulate, confused, and dangerous. The story concerns the Monster's attempt to understand anything around it: the Monster has been given electric life by von Frankenstein, but it has no understanding, and no time to understand before its immense strength commits the murders that will condemn it.The book is a reaction to intellectual exploration of life and death, and the consequences of assuming the role of "God". The film is about the loneliness and despair of a freakish creation trying to understand the simpliest, but most powerful, human emotions, and being unable to do so. The movie is not the book, thankfully, but is a jarring introduction to cinematic story-telling that is still powerful and evocative, while the book remains an excellent work hampered by the literary conventions of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all-time best horror films, but an antique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the best that the Hollywood studio system ever produced. Most today might not agree with that because the craft of making movies has developed so much since this film was made nearly seventy years ago. But in its day this film was stylishly directed and very effective -- it scared the hell out of people. Director James Whale's style may seem quaint now, but he knew what he wanted to do to an audience and he succeeded. Many people also credit Whale's fortunate choice of Boris Karloff to play the monster, and he's very good, but credit should equally go to Jack Pierce's make-up design. The monster is one of the most recognizable images of the 20th century, and has lost none of its fascination. However, the film is now a very old one, and it does creak quite a lot. It may have been the "Jaws" of its day, but that day passed away long ago. Now, its dialogue seems very stilted and the acting has more in common with silent pictures than modern ones (which is kind of ironic considering that the most impressive performance, Karloff's, is a largely silent pantomime). And, how much better this film would play now if it had a score! Still, it has great gothic atmosphere, was the blue print for all horror films to come, and is talked about today at a surprising level. It also has one of the best damn sequels ever made. This film remains a must-see even into the 21st century. And oh yeah, it's not the Mary Shelley novel, but then that book is even more of an antique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of Dracula in 1931, Universal Studios produced this film based on Mary Shelley's thoughtful novel. The film is flawed, creaky, and bears little resemblance to its source material, yet has captured the imagination of a culture and created one of the MOST recognizable cultural icons of the 20th century, the Frankenstein Monster. There are some brilliant scenes in this film and James Whale rightly deserves the recognition he gets as being a masterful director. Whale borrows heavily from German influences and creates some wonderfully dark, gloomy atmospheres throughout his film. He is constantly using religious symbols in the background, always emphasizing his theme of science against religion....,man against God. The greatest thing Whale does is give us the gift of Boris Karloff...I cannot even imagine what a world without Boris on the screen would have been like. Karloff effectively creates a being with child-like innocence amidst a world of hatred and fear. He knew that one of the major points of the novel was to show the creature as a symbol of pity not for its deformities, etc....but for the way in which society and creator interacted with it. The real monster is the fear and contempt society has for those that are different. Mankind is the monster, and Victor(Henry for some inexplicable reason in the film)is the worst of all. A man wanting to surpass the boundaries of known scientific knowledge, yet unwilling to burden the responsibilities that go with it. Frankenstein is a must-see!!!</fullReview>

Clive is at his hysterical obsessive best as the mad doctor. Other people are right that it does not follow the book, but the screenplay was actually based on a stage play that was adapted from the book. The movie actually follows the play quite closely.

		<fullReview>_Frankenstein_ represents a synthesis of great work. Whale and Webling wisely decided to avoid the epic stature of Shelley's book. Instead, they created a tight story with some of the most memorable scenes in film history. Cinematographer Karl Freund borrows from his German Expressionist roots in using shadow to create a foreboding atmosphere. Special effects artist Kenneth Strickfaden and makeup genius Jack Pierce became legends for their work on Frankenstein's laboratory and the creature's appearance, both of which have ascended to archetypal stature in the human consciousness. Perhaps the greatest credit, however, belongs to Boris Karloff, whose pantomime of the monster evokes tremendous sympathy even as it scares us. _Frankenstein_ is a true classic in a field of pale imitators.</fullReview>

The main problems are some of the performances (besides the lead and Clive, the rest of the cast is typical of early talkies) and the dialogue, which is laughable in the dramatic scenes. Still, the film carries some real power and has pointed the way for every horror film made in the past 70 years. Interestingly enough, the sequel is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read a review that said "this movie sucks," and was completely appalled. As a writer and avid movie fan, the Universal series of horror films were my starting point from which I got interested in the genre. Frankenstein, although not very close to Mary Shelley's novel, is a very importance piece. James Whale's gothic filmmaking, on this film and it's sequel, where the cornerstone of which horror films are built. Shame on you if you dismiss this film for black and white garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The core of the film is Karloff's masterful and never equaled portrayal of Frankenstein's Monster. Karloff's Monster is Man, placed in a world he did not choose to be born into by a God--Frankenstein--who has no understanding of his own motivations in creating life (the theme is driven home by several examples of Christian symbolism in this and the second film, culminating in the monster's literal crucifixion by the mob in Bride). While it is no direct translation of the novel, the spirit of the novel has yet to be better invoked. Whale was heavily influenced by German films (particularly Caligari), but his own characteristic whimsy--which would come to full bloom in The Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein--peeks in from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sucks? Hardly... a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing that your reviewer would say that Frankenstein (1931) sucks. Obviously, the reviewer has no clue just how fundamental this brilliant piece of filmmaking is to the horror genre. Almost every horror/thriller film subsequently owes its existence to Frankenstein... the powerful portrayal by Karloff... the eerie sets... the over-the-top archetype mad scientist in Colin Clive... the wonderfully atmospheric direction by James Whale... and on and on. Is it like the book? No. No film of Frankenstein has ever come close to the book; it may truly be unfilmable. So how about real reviews by qualified people of this amazing, scary, heartbreaking CLASSIC! After all, it's now in the AFI "100 Best Films of All Time" and, though you might argue with the order of the list, that's pretty damn good company for a film that "sucks."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went on a binge, watching all four of the first Universal Frankenstein movies. I know that many believe "Metropolis" to be the first mad scientist movie. But that wasn't about science or scientists, but about repressive society. The "science" there was actually technology and had as much to do with things as the devices in "1984." This, this, I think is the first movie where the whole point was that science was inerrently evil in its tendencies. Its different than a Faust story, where powers were conveyed for selfish ends; here the ends are discovery. Its no mistake that there's the heavy hand of religion in the village context that surrounds the man and his work.So when I watch these, I pay attention to two things. One is how science is portrayed. Its radically different in all four. And the second is how the cinematic grammar is used to present that notion. Its a sort of hobby of mine to compare sequels and remakes.+++In this first one, the scientist believes that if he understands how life works, he can heal the sick. He is a doctor, a medical doctor and studying what wouldn't be out of the ordinary today or even then. Only the experiment was unusual and grisly, messing with corpses, but even that isn't very far from ordinary. Science, and especially mathematics is extremely cinematic to the people doing it, but I know of few films that seem to capture it well. The cinematic path seems to be through technological gizmo's, and I think we have Whales to thank for that. The lightning business wasn't central in the book, I do not think. So it is something of genius to choose all those flying, vertical, sparking things. You can sense the energy. Its literally light, and the motif of light and dark in several literal and metaphoric threads throughout works with that.Tod Browning was working in parallel, but his world was not one of man bringing light to darkness, but the other way around: the forces of darkness (and so called in the film) bringing darkness to mere humans.This is not an evil man.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror movie, a genuine classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best and most influential horror movies of the 1930s, FRANKENSTEIN can still grip intelligent viewers today. Yes, there's virtually no music, and yes, some aspects of the production are dated -- but Whale's sure-footed direction, the performances, the sets and the overall style of the film keep it remarkably fresh. It is, for example, far less dated than Browning's DRACULA -- though they were made by the same studio and released in the same year. Those who dislike this film because it's not "just like the novel" are being hopelessly naive. Not only is every novel changed when filmed -- it's impossible to do otherwise -- but to film Shelley's novel &gt;as written&lt; would take 10 or 15 hours of footage. And not only would the Monster talk, he'd talk IN FRENCH throughout. Parts of the movie would be a travelog, and other parts would stop dead while the Monster talked steadily for several hours. This is a fine movie; that it is not faithful to the novel is a mere footnote. Anyone who objects to the fact that this (or any movie) is in black and white obviously knows and cares nothing about movie history. And of course, the messages posted here where such complaints are made are the ones that are full of spelling and grammatical errors (like confusing "its" and "its"). They probably dislike every movie made before they were even born.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a film were judged solely on how close it's plot resembled the novel it's based on instead of it's own artistic merits and the director's interpretation of the subject, we would never have great art in film. No film can cover all the elements of the book that it is based on because of a books' hundreds of pages and film being entirely visual, an entirely different format. James Whale's interpretation of the themes of Mary Shelley's book, although not a scene for scene retelling of the novel is a film with brilliant moments and is able to express more intimates aspects of the books' broad theme. Specifically, the terror of beholding the monster in the film done brilliantly by James Whale. For example, when we first see the Monster, it appears through a doorway in a slow close-up, the Creature turns around and the light catches the light on it's face as it pauses, then slowly turns revealing the Creatures face for the first time. Before we have a chance to recoil, two intense close-ups follow . Watch this for yourself. It has the same effect as Stanley Kubrick's sudden close ups, and no doubt, Kubrick saw "Frankenstein"</fullReview>

Karloff's tour de force performance is powerful and moving 67 years after the fact, and if you don't feel even a little sorry for the Monster before the movie comes to a close, you have a heart of stone.For my money, this is the second best version of the story (Bride of Frankenstein being the first).

		<fullReview>Frankenstein starts with Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) confiding in her friend Victor (John Boles) that she is worried about her fiancé Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), he talks of nothing but his 'experiments' &amp; locks himself away in an old windmill to conduct them. They both decide to go &amp; see him along with his university professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) to try &amp; talk some sense into him. They arrive late one night, as a thunder storm rages outside Dr. Frankenstein admits that he has created a body from stitching corpses together &amp; claims that he has discovered a way to re-animate the body, using his lab equipment &amp; bolts of lightening Dr. Frankenstein's experiments prove to be successful &amp; his creation (Boris Karloff) comes to life. However the monster turns out to be very violent &amp; escapes the lab &amp; begins to terrorise a nearby town...Directed by James Whale this is the classic Frankenstein film which all others have tried to emulate, this one set the standard &amp; still does. Released by Universal in the same year as the just as influential Dracula both helped start a horror boom. Based on the novel by Mary Shelley the extremely effective script by Francis Edward Faragoh &amp; Garrett Fort moves along at a nice pace &amp; is never boring, it manages to create a fair amount of sympathy for the monster &amp; has a good solid story that works well even today, over 75 years since it was made. It's debatable whether a better adaptation of Frankenstein has ever been made, although having said that I personally still think Flesh for Frankenstein (1974) is my favourite version of the tale.Director Whale does a terrific job here, there are some truly classic &amp; iconic images in Frankenstein. The sets are great from the stone castle to the run down windmill to a spooky graveyard. The Frankenstein make-up by Jack Pierce is impressive &amp; is the way everyone now envisions the Frankenstein monster to look like with a flat head, bolts through his neck &amp; stitch work across his body. The special effects are actually pretty good including a burning mill at the end.With a supposed budget of about $291,000 Frankenstein is well made &amp; pretty impressive to watch even today, I'd have thought a lot of time &amp; effort went into the film. The acting was OK, Clive's Dr. Frankenstein is a touch theatrical at times but he has a certain madness that seems appropriate.Frankenstein is a great film, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. Obviously don't expect any explosions or CGI effects as this is a film which relies on a good story done properly. A must for horror fans &amp; definitely worth a watch for anyone else. A sequel Bride of Frankenstein (1935) was made several years later &amp; in my opinion is actually better than this.</fullReview>

If I had to pick a favorite character it would be Doctor Frankenstein. I liked the emotion he showed that he believed in his work even when no one else thought it was possible. I enjoyed that idea of the plot and the creation of life from just the power of nature. The beginning scene of him with resurrecting him using the power of the lightning stood out to me as one of the best scenes of the movie. The plot did show a steady progression it just didn't catch my attention throughout.

		<fullReview>I believe that horror movies are the most difficult to stay scary as time passes. I can understand that at the time this may have been scary because there was nothing like it but it was hard to bring myself into this movie because fear in these old movies seems so fake. I appreciate the idea of Frankenstein and how iconic it is. When it comes to the execution of it in 1931 I cannot find it entertaining. This being said there was good use of stretching a low budget by using low lighting and keeping the audience focused on what the cameraman and director wanted to see. The most invested I was in this movie was when you see the monsters interaction with the little girl. This scene is necessary since it lets you see the innocence of the monster and how he is childlike and misunderstood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic Frankenstein is a horror film directed by James Whale in 1931. This genre of film is not my favorite, but I found this film to be interesting and somewhat entertaining. The special effects are really quite impressive given the time period the film was made, especially the electrical current effects during the scene where the monster comes to life. Even more impressive is the that the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein is not cheesy like many supposedly more modern horror films. The lighting, set design and cinematography are all very impressive, and even more so given the technological limitations at that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely deserves its title as a classic! What a fun monster movie, and an important one considering it was among the first of its kind. The whole thing was great. Amazing production design- the sets are amazing, props are creepy, and the setting is perfect. The special effects are creative and effective, occasionally silly but they did great for what they had. The cinematography was well done also. The variety of shooting techniques/angles utilized exceeds those of my recent viewings of films from around this time. The use of light and shadows was impeccable, felt its influence permeate the mood of every single scene. It's so?.put-together-looking. Every detail was considered, and it's clear a lot of work went into this film! The performances were excellent all around. Dr. Frankenstein was the ideal mad scientist. Not excessively bananas, like ridiculously so- just the right amount. Intelligent, handsome, proper young man who just happens to have freaky ambitions when it comes to his career, or his legacy more appropriately. The monster was also brilliantly performed. Outstanding. Dope reveal of the monster. What an iconic moment. I can't imagine what it felt like to be in a theater watching this in 1931, wow. The movie also features some bomb symbolism, adds a few layers to the cake. Great hair, make-up, and costumes. Appropriate for the era, and creepy at the same time. The story-telling was good! The script certainly didn't waste any time, in good and bad ways. There were points where the plot progressed too quickly/nonsensically (i.e. characters make enormous assumptions based on fragments of information, wholeheartedly invest themselves in them and their plans of action in response, and are correct somehow), but generally it was paced well. I recommend it. I'm sure I'll watch it again someday but I'm not in a rush to add it to my collection. 8/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the first horror film from the sound era that stands the test of time as a great piece of cinema. Definitely a classic horror film. The movie has a certain dreamlike feel in which events occur because they seem appropriate in a psychological sense, whether or not the plot justifies them. The Gothic set design is very imaginative, helped by the beautiful cinematography with suitably bizarre camera angles, and the music score is haunting, melancholy and atmospheric. The locations, all made to order on Universal's sprawling back lot, are utterly believable and realistic, and basing most of the film in tucked-away parts of ancient European country sides benefits the graceful aging of the film, since there are many parts of the world that still look just like the settings we see here. This film paved the way for how horror films should be portrayed. Certain elements such as special effects are certainly mandatory when trying to create the feel and visuals of doom and gloom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a monster movie classic and a must watch for a film enthusiast of any kind. Boris Karloff's performance within this one has made him a household name, even today. The Dr. is the most frightening character in the movie. He plays with the idea of human life and how to create in an unnatural way. Karloff plays "the monster" as gentle giant. He is learning about the world and has the mental state of that of a small child. He does not know right from wrong and because of this accidentally kills the young girl, Maria. Each of the scenes within this movie drives the plot forward. There are no unnecessary scenes that draw out the movie and make it longer then it should be. While Dr. Frankenstein created the monster, it is clear to the audience that the Dr. is in fact the true monster of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me there were things I liked a lot, and there were things that I didn't enjoy as much. To start I enjoyed the directing. Specifically the use of quadrants, in the scene in which Dr. Frankenstein had all of them in his lab to prove to them that he had done it, that he was right. And in that scene while he was trying to prove how right he was, the camera only showed him on the right half of the screen. That is, until he turned the wheel, that was the final step in bringing his monster to life. That was when he was first shown on the left side of the screen. I thought that was brilliant. Later on though it seemed that his character changed too much without the amount of character development that he needed. He starts out as this mad scientist that only cares about his work and then all of a sudden when the monster is freed he changes into this caring man righteous man. And you end up feeling like you're supposed to feel bad for him but you don't really, because he was just a psycho a few scenes ago. It was just too rapid of change.</fullReview>

An excellent example of how to inspire things once you get started. An excellent work of art from the universal film crew, working on a below average budget, managed to create something that would set the trend for the monster film for ages to come. Whether the films happen to be made by Universal or not. I will refrain from the use of specifics, to prevent as much ruining of the movie as possible. A great example of how a film should be designed in general when going for an eerie feel. Dark lighting, tons and tons of dimly lit scenes. All being used to the advantage of the cinematographer. No scene really does feel empty in this movie, when you take the time to observe each and every scene, every angle and shot has a bit of purpose. All to set the mood and get across the actors emotions. Sometimes though some of the characters over embellish their actors emotions, making them seem more or less to silly for the subject matter at hand. Overall a must watch.</fullReview>

Besides my personal feelings about the Monster and how he was clearly mistreated by the townspeople, I felt that this film was special. Look at the legacy that it has left. When you think of Frankenstein, most people would immediately picture Boris Karloff and his portrayal as the Monster, or "?" as he is called in the credits.My point about this film is that if you haven't seen this, and you consider yourself a fan of classic movies, you are doing yourself an injustice.

Even if you happen to be one of the world's most rabid/jaded horror-movie freaks ever, I'd confidently say that (for a mad scientist/monster picture) Frankenstein (which is now 80+ years old) is still a film that's quite capable of giving you chills &amp; thrills that not even modern-day horror can satisfactorily deliver.Featuring some truly impressive sets, superb cinematography, and solid direction by James Whale, Frankenstein (which just drips with dark &amp; gloomy atmosphere) is, undoubtedly, an undisputed classic gem of Gothic horror.Believe me, when the viewer finally gets their first look at the re-animated Frankenstein monster, this has got to be one of the most awesome moments ever captured on screen in horror-movie history.Needless to say, Boris Karloff certainly gave it his best shot as the tragically doomed creature of Henry Frankenstein's creation who was destined to be crucified.Loosely adapted for the screen from the novel of the same name..... Now, I don't mean to sound sexist here - But, it truly amazes me that such a story as this was actually penned, not by a man, but by a woman. Only 21 at the time, like, what could've possibly been going on in young Mary Shelley's head (way back in the year 1818) to have prompted her to write such a macabre tale as this? I sure got a kick out of this film's priceless "Word of Warning" opening sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As most of you already know or heard of this film "Frankenstein". In which a doctor creates life during a thunderstorm.This film is one of the first films of this story with sound and an actual monster that looks like the typical Frankenstein today.While the film even begins with dialogue of warning the audience this film can be scary. This gets the viewer prepared for this horror that will begin. One other quick detail to point out is the opening credits for the cast does not show a name for the monster; this is more to add to th scare in the viewers mind before the film begins.The film takes the viewer through the steps that the doctor has to go through to get an entire body built and prepared for life to be put into it. The film begins to take viewer away from the main story when we are forced to see the story from Elizabeth's eyes. She is the doctor's girlfriend/future wife and she takes the viewer through her struggles of worrying about her boyfriend, thinking he is not well and takes his professor to see if he is sick. With them coming to his lab creates tension for him while he is ready to create life.The famous scene of when Frankenstein creates life uses sounds of thunder and add light to make it seem like there really is thunder storm in the film. This is actually done very well for an early 1930's movie. This film holds mostly dark photography except the thunderstorm scene with a lot of light from it. The only close up shot used is for the monster and even though it is a close up only the face is seen and everything else is black.As the story progresses after the monster is given life Doctor Frankenstein begins to rest more with Elizabeth, but once news of the monster killing his professor and then a little girl he knows he has to stop the monster. These murders are added to show that the monster can kill, but with the little girls murder shows more of the monsters innocence and that he was not trying to killing her.This film is intended to be scary but anyone watching today won't think so since there are so many different makes of the movie today that it seems novice to the others. Still this film is a classic because it takes the actual book to life and is able to get the real story across.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with how long this film has been out, from my experience I do not think there has been another horror film I have seen that was better than it. It is masterfully arranged, with many subtle details that you may not discover on your first time watching the film. Boris Karlov, wow, he manages to take a character who is unable to articulate more than grunts, yet he is the most expressive in the film, or almost all horror films I have seen to be frank. If you look you can see how tormented the monster is during the closeups, how confused and scared by the world around it. If you think you could ever call yourself a horror fan, then it is a necessity to see this film, it is a wonderful rendition of Mary Shelly's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Alive Apparently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the greatest monster film created. Or at least part of the greatest monster franchise in history. Frankenstein is the second monster film released in 1931 by Universal Studios. The success of this film along with the earlier Dracula solidified Universal as masters of the craft. A sympathetic monster made from the corpses of men is portrayed by British actor Boris Karloff. His portrayal of a simple, but powerful creature, shaped by the cruelty of his captors would be engraved into popular culture. His towering posture, iconic prosthetic makeup, and shambling walk became synonymous to the creature. Colin Clive's line "IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE!" is perhaps one of the most iconic lines in cinema as well. The movie helped launch a genre of film and is by any definition a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best stories ever told. I really enjoyed this movie. the plot was on point. the acting was very good especially Boris Karloff. even though he didn't speak, his body language and his facial expressions stoled the show. i felt sympathy for the monster. he really wasn't a monster at all. he had a heart and all he really wanted was to be loved. he was more like a little kid that didn't know any better. with the scene where the girl gives him a flower to throw in the water then he threw the girl in, it wasn't like he was trying to kill her, he seen her as beautiful flower and wanted to see if she would float. its like you can't judge a book by its cover and also be careful what you wish for because it might not be how you wanted. the camera movement was good and forms of continuity was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film! The camera work offered the viewer many different perspectives, such as following beside a villager carrying his child or watching the monster being lifted from the ground and raised to the lightening storm. The perspective allowed the audience to get the feeling that they were right there in the middle of all of it. I also thought the lack of music throughout actually worked very well. The sounds throughout proved to be enough.I really enjoyed the monster character. During the scene where the monster is interacting with the little girl, you can tell that it touched him that she acknowledged him in a calm manner, not judging or anything. I actually a felt a bit of sympathy for the monster. It's easy to tell that he only did what he did because he did not know any better. He can't entirely differentiate right from wrong. Boris Karloff was a phenomenal monster. The camera angles and lighting helped accentuate his rough features, which made him an even more believable monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best, and most important, horror movies you'll ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931) is a monster movie... well you probably know what its about already. Personally, I've never really been a big horror fan (with the exception of Evil Dead, The Shining, and John Carpenters 'The Thing') but Frankenstein swept me off my feet. The most glaring praise i can give to it is the absence of a soundtrack. Most movies, especially horror movies, can't work without a good soundtrack (would Star Wars be even half as good without John Williams?) yet Frankenstein doesn't need it. What makes the movie scary, in terms of form, is the camera angles. The movie is very effectively edited and uses reaction shoots perfectly. The best example of this is tracking shoot of the man from the woods walking through the town with his daughter and peoples reaction to them. However, this movie excels in its narrative. It boils down to a struggle with something that has morphed into something out of ones control. This is simple narrative, but it is one of the most influential narratives in all of cinema. The struggle between Dr. Frankenstein and The Monster is the same we see between David and HAL-9000, or between Deckard and the Replicant's. Its a great representation of the internal struggle of man, and its just another reason why this movie is so great. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of the most important horror movies ever made. It is significant for two reasons. Firstly, its success is one of the reasons that horror movies have survived throughout entertainment history. It set the basis for writers, actors, directors, and producers to build on and fully develop this genre. Other movies, Phantom of the Opera, Nosferatu, Dracula, The Wolf Man, to name a few, also have had the same effect. Frankenstein has another factor not included in any of these other classic movies. Boris Karloff and his superb performance are the second important reason credited to this film. Boris Karloff does so well with this role, that you can almost believe these events took place. The Frankenstein Monster, to me, is simply a child stuck in an adult's body trying to make sense of the world. He is often times misunderstood, and seen as evil. Great film overall, definitely a must see for fans of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the outskirts of the town of Goldstadt, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has converted an abandoned windmill into his personal laboratory. Obsessed with creating life from death, he begins by stitching together dead body parts from various corpses. After finally acquiring a brain from a nearby university he harnesses electricity from a lightning storm and reanimates his monstrosity known today as "Frankenstein" (Boris Karloff). What he doesn't know is that his assistant, "Fritz" (Dwight Frye) accidentally stole an abnormal brain. Because of this, and Fritz constantly tormenting him, the monster eventually goes berserk and embarks on a killing spree. Now, while most people today would find this type of classic horror film rather tame, it was a sensation when it was released in 1931. Most people give high marks for the performances of Colin Clive and Boris Karloff. Rightfully so. However, I thought Dwight Frye' performance has been vastly underrated and deserves equal applause. Likewise, Mae Clarke gave a decent performance as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé, "Elizabeth". In short, although this film was made over 80 years ago it still manages to entertain audiences and I would highly recommend it for all true fans of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man Mister Karloff if I saw you in the street casually walking to work I'm sorry to say I wouldn't recognize you no sir not one bit, but if I saw you lumbering through the woods with your hands awkwardly placed in front of you, groaning like you're stuck in traffic or like you just checked the fridge for something to eat and all you found was 2 week old meatloaf, with those screws popping out of the side of your neck I would ask myself what I'm doing in these dense woods on a shadowy stormy night acknowledge the brilliance of the photography around me and then.....well probably run to the nearest village. The settings and backgrounds and special effects were absolutely gorgeous, ominous and believable, just exactly how much character and mystery they put into each shadow and each light, it's stunning what they could do with black and white, the special effects they were capable of producing and how beautifully they did, that burning revolving windmill at the end is a fascinating scene that white fire burning into the blackest night I've seen in a while is wondrous. I have a feeling that it wouldn't be as effective in color. There's something depressing and disturbing and and gloomy about these ancient colors, perhaps it's all become a part of the imagination over time. Boris Karloff has made such a legend out of himself that it's double scary when you first see him step through that door, it's as if it's this great arrival of this man this myth something truly otherworldy, and when he slowly turns to face us there's this evil curl in his lip and drunken look in his eye as if he knows that he will live on forever and he's just there basking in all that glory. The story really is frightening if you think about the monsters (industry, technology, trying to be god, greed) man is capable of and how these monsters can come to destroy us and ruin us and if you think about it it's going on all around us. So beware not all monsters come out of the dark.</fullReview>

He didn't hurt or try to hurt anyone that didn't hate him the only people that he hurt were the ones that hated him. The little girl by the pond was an accident because his brain was not fully developed and not ready to put onto the world. He was not a monster and shouldn't be classified as one for his actions were just of pure ignorance and curiosity. The lighting in the movie gave the feeling of fear because it was ominous which made the film a lot more entertaining. The two main people that deserved to die did which showed that even thought frankenstien had the mind of a child his feelings were mature enough to k.ow who really hates him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic. I watched this film for the 2nd time yesterday the 1st time i saw it I was a lot younger and didn't understand the message behind this movie. The message is that Henry thinks he is a form of a God and can create another human being. He was horrifically wrong because the human he made turns into a vicious monster. I really like the part where the monster is playing with the little girl (Maria). Maria shows the monster how her flowers float in the water and then the Monster proceeded to make his flowers float in the water. Its a great scene because the monster throws Maria into the water without any intentions of killing her. This shows that the monster has the brain of a little kid but the body of a full grown man, the monster didn't know any better and didn't know what he did. I would highly recommend anyone who likes horror films to watch this one because it is great and its truly a classic one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The unforgettable Frankenstein rendition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale's black &amp; white Frankenstein (1931) movie remains a timeless masterpiece and the most remembered of all. It is without a doubt what kept people fascinated in Mary Shelley's story for years. You could tell the way the movie was put together, that highlights every scene to be thought provoking and intriguing; all a labor of love. Boris Karloff who portrayed the monster also had an important part in the movie's success. For you couldn't help but feel sorry for the monster who was hated, feared and misunderstood. What escapes me, as I'm sure others have also wondered, is why did Dr. Frankenstein felt it was utmost important to create life from death in the first place? When Bride of Frankenstein (1935) came out you finally get a clue that maybe there was a race ongoing race in medical science over the secrets of life and death. I don't know if anyone has gather this but it seems like the author Mary Shelly had interwoven her own birth as like the created monster, which was own mother's fatal undoing, much like Dr. Frankenstein. One has to question whether she might of heard of the real Dr. Frankenstein who tried to create a formula that when taken internally was suppose to give him eternal life. But unfortunately actually created poison, which slowly brought about his own demise. The sudden death of Shelley's mom at her own birth had to have been something she never fully got over and must of really got to her is why she ended up getting the nightmare that inspired the story. Superstitious people back then might of also helped incite the nightmare, as though her type of birth could of been thoughtful as like some kind of bad luck. The Frankenstein concept also seems to be a warning that what we create today that suppose to help us could very well become our own undoing. Which is brought out more clearly in James Cameron's Terminator movies. Interesting how both this classic Frankenstein (1931) &amp; Terminator (1984) movie was created by persons both named James. Both movies a success, timeless masterpiece, intriguing and thought provoking. Like Mary Shelley, James Cameron's dream inspired the story concept Terminator, into a movie. What I liked and appreciated was finding out that James Whale made his Frankenstein movie cause nothing else interest him and he certainly didn't want to do any war pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuff of cinematic legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an honour bestowed on few movies that a part of it (whether it be an image, a snippet of dialogue, or a section of its musical score) is considered so iconic that it transcends its original context and moves into the wider arena of popular culture and yet 'Frankenstein', with Colin Clive's hysterical announcement that "It's alive!" and the rapid progressive close-ups of Boris Karloff as the monster, offers two! It is also likely that 'Frankenstein' hasn't offered a piece of its score into the pop-culture domain due to fact that it doesn't actually have one(!) otherwise all three categories would surely have been checked.However, within the iconic power of 'Frankenstein' lie the seeds of some points of criticism which the fledgling cinephile should be wary of. One such criticism is that the film comes from an era when cinema was a young medium and struggling to distinguish itself from theatre and its conventions. As such, many aspects of the direction, editing, and narrative pacing owe a lot to theatre (Whale had previously been a theatre director) and may seem quant and/or dated by modern audience standards. Also, the strong imagery and lasting impression of the film saw it descend first into unselfconscious parody with the series of sequels that followed, culminating in 1948s 'Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein', and later with the wholly self-conscious parody of Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein' (1974).As for criticisms, the two points above are about as far as it goes, and neither can really be said to be a fault of the film itself. What remains is a film suffused with a Gothic ambiance of decay, derangement, and despair: from the opening grave-digging scene, to the inside of Frankenstein's laboratory and the animation of the monster, all the way to the marauding villagers who hunt him down. Karloff's performance as the monster is legendary, and what makes it so effective is his choice to portray the monster as a victim who is able to evoke sympathy and terror in equal measure, a mix which finds its most controversial expression in the girl-by-the-lake scene which was cut from the movie in its full form for many years. While the stand out performances are clearly Clive and Karloff, the rest of the cast support adeptly, serving as understated splashes of normality against which the madness is enacted. Completing this twisted milieu are the studio sets which clearly owe much to such German Expressionist classics like 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1920), 'Nosferatu' (1922) and 'Metropolis' (1927) and summon the claustrophobia which reflects perfectly the distorted view of reality of the protagonists.Along with Tod Browning's 'Dracula' (1931), 'Frankenstein' was responsible for the Universal horror movie boom, and yet, apart from Whale's own 'Bride of Frankenstein', none of the other titles in the catalogue match the vision, power, and pathos of 'Frankenstein': a movie about technological advancement usurping God and creating life, so how fitting that 'Frankenstein' is arguably one of the first films to achieve cinematic immortality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three films with almost the same plot, The Mummy, Frankenstein and Dracula all really great films but all with the same annoying flaws. A dead/undead person is revived or in the case of Frankenstein ? assembled and then goes on a killing spree. The annoying parts are the characters used to "Fill in" the plot, Baron Frankenstein and all his jolly wedding guests and nurses. With Dracula and The Mummy it is the stupid boyfriend of the female victims. These actors stand like mannequins reciting their lines which always suggest that the girl is quite safe and the everybody is over-reacting. The beginning scenes in The Mummy are superb as are the First scenes in both the other films ? if only footage hadn't been wasted on the "Love interest" each film would have been a little sharper. Perhaps more dialogue could have been written for the terrific lead characters instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply amazing are the only words I can use to describe how masterfully this film was put together. The mise-de-scene of this movie is so dark and foreboding and truly leaves a very good impression of this film on the viewer.The acting alone makes this film worth watching. The crazed obsession of Dr. Frankenstein with completing his experiment was very well reflected through his wild appearance when he gets excited about it.The monster itself, despite having no speaking lines had some amazing acting going on. Without using a single word he perfectly reflected the confusion and fright of being brought back from the dead. A creature, not inherently evil, but drawn to acts of unknowing wickedness by the way it was treated by its creator and its own ignorance of the ways of interaction is perfectly shown in this film.The scene at the end where the monster is trapped on top of the tower that they have just set on fire is amazing because you can see the confusion and fright that the monster is feeling because it doesn't know that its even done anything wrong and doesn't understand why it's being hunted down.Excellent movie, I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago at a friends house. Most of my friends were annoyed that this was not the stereotypical horror movie most people expected. It's not gory, and it's not bloody, but it's bizarre enough to really make someone think. The beginning scene when Henry and his assistant are digging through the grave for dead bodies was fantastic to start with. The whole scene is heavily foreshadowing the terrible events towards the end. The whole movie gives off an eerie type of feel, everything dark, and the actors, especially Colin Clive are so passionate in their roles. The fact that no music was used during the film adds an extra element of eeriness. Every sound is heard, such as the cries of the angry mob of towns people, and the tortured shouts and grunts of the monster are excellent examples of this raw sound. Another brilliant scene was the electricity scene when the monster was first brought to life. The vivid electric currents and the sounds created a wonderfully powerful scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful classic horror film, it has a feeling of darkness and gloominess about it the entire film due to lighting and the sets used. While not particularly scary, it does give the viewer a feeling of suspense. And, at some points in the film, you cannot help but wonder if the monster is truly evil, or if it simply doesn't know any better. In the scene with the little girl, the monster plays along innocently enough, and even has a smile come across his face, only tossing the girl into the water because he has run out of flowers. You can even see the remorse and panic on the monster's face after he realizes what he has done. At the very end, when he is in the burning mill, I even felt sorry for the monster as he flailed about, desperately trying to get away from the flames. A great movie and a true classic.</fullReview>

The movie strays away from the book in quite a few ways but all together tells the story excellently and completely in the small amount of time the movie takes to be watched. At times in the movie the viewer almost feels bad for the monster pitying the way the men treat him but in the end it is made apparent that he is in fact a vile creature who was never supposed to be at all.

Of course Boris Karloff as the monster Frankenstein was great as well, but i feel that anyone with decent acting could have played a monster. I do not feel this way about Dracula though, because there is a lot more going on facially with his character.The sets, cinematography, and lighting were all superb.

		<fullReview>Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" finally comes to life. This was more of a second-hand adaptation of the novel, but it turned out exceptionally well. What Carl Laemmle Jr. and the creepy-minded folks at Universal Pictures picked for the movie medium fit perfectly, and left room for sequels. Beginning with a funeral attended by the grim reaper himself to the climactic windmill on fire, "Frankenstein" is filled with astounding set decoration. It's directed and photographed with shadowy style by James Whale with Arthur Edeson.Taking cues from silent German impressionist filmmakers, Mr. Whale creates a vast landscape from a small space. With great monster makeup from Jack Pierce, brutally innocent Boris Karloff startles and shines, especially with little Marilyn Harris (as Maria). Exclaiming, "It's Alive! It's alive!' creative Colin Clive (as Henry Frankenstein) sends up an appropriately manic performance. Presently, the film can be seen with missing parts resurrected. "Frankenstein" remains legendary and influential. Universal created a monster.********** Frankenstein (11/21/31) James Whale ~ Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Dwight Frye, Marilyn Harris</fullReview>

This movie really made me feel like I was taken back into their time. I think it allowed people to use their imagination, something that remains true to this day.

		<shortDescription>A landmark in horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never heard the famous lines, "It's alive! It's alive!" then there is something severely wrong with you. Mary Shelley's classic horror story Frankenstein is one of the most memorable and remarkable tales of tragedy and horror, and James Whale's 1931 adaptation of the dark tale does it a lot of justice. Frankenstein is the story of the mad scientist Henry Frankenstein, who has set out to create life out of pieces of dead humans. He successfully plays God until he realizes that what he has created is an uncontrollable monster. Yet we the audience get to witness this "monster's" actions and it turns the story into a tragically human one when we learn that this creature is just confused and misunderstood, being brought into this world under such inappropriate circumstances.Possibly the most memorable scene of Frankenstein, other than the "It's alive" scene, is the scene where the monster meets and accidentally kills the little girl. In this short scene the humanity of this creature and the atrocity of trying to create new life in this way is brought to light. This little girl is not afraid of the monster and sees him as a friendly thing to play with. Upon this acceptance, the monster expresses its first true happiness. We see how he can connect with this little girl, only to have tragedy strike and we see once again just how detached this creation unfortunately is. The two throw flowers into a lake. When the monster runs out of flowers to throw, he sees the little girl as a good substitute. This suggests that this creature is capable of seeing beauty, as he equates the little girl's beauty to that of a flower, only with unfortunate consequences, as the child drowns after being tossed in the lake. Immediately after the monster throws the girl into the lake he realizes his mistake and runs off, expressing true human fear that sadly only the audience gets to witness. This event leads the rest of the town to believe the monster is a mindless killing machine, which leads to the tragic end of the film.Frankenstein thrives off of an aura of mystery surrounding it. The film is very modernist in its lack of detail and exclusion of certain things that we wish would could know or see. The ending of the film leaves two very important questions unanswered, only adding to the tragedy and mystery of the film. The film also surrounds its monster with a lot of mystery, going as far as to leave out Boris Karloff's name from the opening credits. Instead the monster is said to be played by "?" This film hones in on our fear of the unknown, which was especially effective in a time where the tides of war were upon America and there was a great fear of the growing fascism overseas. It is very successful in its building of fear and emotion in the viewer, even today.It goes without saying that Frankenstein is one of the staples of classic horror. It is very successful in everything it attempts to accomplish. It is thrilling, emotional, and meaningful, and its final moments will leave you speechless. Frankenstein is an astounding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Monster Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The science fiction horror film Frankenstein is directed by James Whale and stars Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, and Boris Karloff. The setting is an unidentified city and it takes place in modern day which is 1931 at the time of the film's release.The film starts out with Dr. Frankenstein (Clive) and his hunchback assistant Fritz at a cemetery. The two of them dig up a recently deceased corpse for Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, which is to create a man in the image of himself. If Frankenstein does this then he will be able to feel like God himself. Frankenstein and his assistant realize that the brain and the head of the stolen body are badly damaged so they are forced to steal a brain from Frankenstein's old teacher. When Fritz goes to steal the brain he breaks the jar containing normal brain so he takes the one that says abnormal instead. Then Dr. Frankenstein uses a machine he built that utilized a mysterious ray he discovered so the monster (Karloff) became alive...The screenplay for this film is one of the best of the horror genre. With a running time just short of seventy minutes I was doubtful the story would be strong enough for me to enjoy the film. I was pleasantly surprised though. Garrett Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay adapted from Mary Shelley's novel. Dr. Frankenstein and the monster were both very strong characters, I liked how savage and animal like the monster was and Frankenstein's obsession. All the supporting cast were pretty one dimensional though, but it did not stop the film from being great. The quote from Dr. Frankenstein "It's alive" will always be embedded in my brain now.James Whale's direction was superb which really surprised me. I find for most older films that the direction is always rather simple, but this had many complex shots. The one that comes to my mind first is the father entering town holding his daughter. The camera dollies with him and the audience is able to see everyone in the city looking at him. It was just a beautiful shot. The whole entire scene where the monster comes alive is excellent as well. As the unborn corpse rises to the sky and stays at the top for a few seconds then slowly comes down just kept me on the edge of my seat. And then when the monster's hand twitches slightly, just wonderful. The final scene that I loved was when the monster is playing with the little girl. It was so simple, and that is what made the scene so effective because the monster was so simple.Whale got a couple of great performances from his actors as well. Colin Clive gave a very effective performance as the obsessed Dr. Frankenstein. I could feel his passion and desire to create something so he too could feel like God. He absolutely shined in the scene where the monster came alive, if he did a poor job there the film may not be as legendarily well known as it is today. Mae Clarke did not do anything spectacular in her role as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé. She basically just kept on telling Frankenstein to stop being crazy and come back home, she had a one layered character which is not her part. The thing with her performance though is I do not even remember her in the film that well because unlike Clive she did not put any passion into her performance. Now Boris Karloff made the film and character iconic. He played the role as the monster and played it perfectly, there was no way he or anyone else could have done it. The scene where he acts the best is the scene with the little girl, because he is trying to play with her, not be a monster and kill her. Just magnificent performance. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job, but no one really stood out or added much to the film.This film is a classic and will always be remembered as one of the greatest monster films ever. You won't scream or jump in your seat while watching this because even though it is horror it is more like an intriguing story about a killer monster which has to go in the genre of horror. It is just a fantastic film of obsession that leads to a new creature, that does not know right from wrong. The monster is just like a wild animal, it is just trying to protect itself. Overall I give this film a 9/10 and recommend it to anyone who likes classic films, science fiction, and monster movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to watch the first version of Frankenstein. Even though this movie was not "scary" at all, I did enjoy it. The setting of where it was filmed helped give it the "scary"feel. The buildings looked old and all the rooms were dark with only a single light lit. The background music and the noises through out the film were suspenseful. When Frankenstein first "wakes up" he moves very slowly and you don't think he's bad, but then the movie progresses. In the 1930's when this was produced no one has ever seen anything like this film thats why it was such a bug hit. If this filmed was produced now as a scary movie it most likely would not be a hit at all. But I think that this movie was really good for the 1930's and I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror story with a sad side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's Alive!" a powerful line of the movie, when you realize Dr, Frankenstein's obsession of creating a man has become a reality. This movie contains an eerie feeling with all the dark lighting, the laboratory in the mountain, the rain, and the lightning. All these effects add to the mood of the film. A powerful scene when the human is raised into the sky and struck by lightning to become "the Monster." This movie was meant to fear the monster, but in a way you feel sorry for him. By being given the murder's brain, he became a person he was not supposed to be. And because he was created, not raised, he does not understand certain things, such as when he through the girl in the water, because they were throwing the flowers into the water. The monster was always scared of fire, and Dr. Frankenstein's assistant would constantly scare him with it and make him mad. This makes for an ironic ending when the Monster dies because of fire. The theme of the story in my opinion is to not mess with fate. People should not be created through science.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has devised a way of reanimating life. Using spare parts, he constructs a man, who is something of a monster (Boris Karloff). Unable to keep the creature under control, it terrorizes the village and surrounding areas...While a superior film to "Dracula", there is something to be said here about taking liberties. "Dracula" stayed more or less true to the book, whereas "Frankenstein" makes a number of divergences. The monster is less intelligent, the method of re-animation is more explicit, the Arctic scene is removed entirely...Great on its own, and highly memorable, this film's real contribution is to the horror world. The monster is now known as Frankenstein, we know he is brought to life by electricity, he has greenish skin and he has bolts in his neck. These all came from this film. And it is so overpowering that there is no bringing back the original concepts.Although I want to keep this review very short, I have to give credit to Dwight Frye. After playing Renfield in "Dracula", he came on to this film and played Fritz (the character we commonly call Igor). I don't know what it is about playing horror assistants, but Frye does it perfectly... he regretfully died at age 44.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Frankenstein was a god who created life with his monster. Universal Studios and James Whale were gods who created life with this film.After watching Dracula (1931) and being disappointed, I thought that Frankenstein wouldn't be too much to my liking either, but I was wrong. There were no parts in this film that didn't keep my attention. At times, though, I felt that this was a mediocre movie, but as soon as those thoughts arose I always came across a scene that would take the film to a new level.Before talking of specific scenes, I want to mention the obvious things that I must talk about. The writing for this film was very good. Nothing like the book (but I knew that before going into the movie thankfully) but it at least grasps the idea and themes of the book and portrays them quite well. James Whale also did some great directing on his part. One of the two of the most impacting scenes in the film were displayed fantastically and without a doubt perfect. The acting by the more "villainous" characters of the film (Dr Frankenstein, the Monster, and Fritz) was phenomenal, while the rest of the acting was quite average in my opinion.The writing for this film took many specific themes from the book, especially the 'God-like' theme that is the most important. It isn't portrayed very well in this movie, at least not nearly as much as in the book, but it is still there. The book is much more subtle in showing it's themes of 'God' and 'creation'. The film has these, but not as many, and not as subtle either. I didn't see many thought of 'God' and 'creation' up until the scene where Frankenstein's Monster comes to life and Dr. Frankenstein exclaims "Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!" That scene shoved into your face those two themes, but they did it in a more polite way than just forcing them on you.James Whale's directing seemed very mundane at times, nothing to extraordinary. He would just shoot the scenes and nothing seemed too unique to me. But, as soon as I would start thinking the film is mediocre, he would come across and take another scene but shoot it in the most fantastic way. One instance of this is the most hard-hitting scene of the film, when the farmer is holding his daughter, little Maria, after the Monster had accidentally drowned her and is sullenly walking through the village. What a very sad and upsetting scene as the camera takes one shot to show him walking past all of the partying villagers with the deepest of emotionless faces a man can show.I must also give Whale credit for shooting the scene where the Monster throws Dr. Frankenstein off of the building. At the time of the film, back in 1931, to show someone being thrown off a building, hitting a windmill, and then falling to what looks like his death, must not only have been controversial and surprising to see but also very difficult to shoot without the use of the effects we have now. Two thumbs up to you James; you are indeed a master of your craft.As for the acting, most of it was bland, except for the portrayals of Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Fritz. Colin Clive's performance of Henry Frankenstein started out as mediocre as the rest of the characters but increasingly got better throughout the film as the character and characters around him developed and changed. Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster gave a great performance. All he really needed to do was wobble around and give out groans and moans, but Karloff brought much more to the character than the average person could have and he made the Monster feel much more human than he was, which was perfect. Last, but certainly not least, Dwight Frye's performance as Fritz was stunning. Maybe it's just me, but Frye seems to be one of the greatest actors of all time that could portray such dark, disturbing, and insane characters. Probably the most disturbing scene of the film is when Fritz is showing his 'power' over the Monster with fire by scaring it over and over again with the torch he is carrying. It shows just how terrible human kind can be and how we can go from mere human to terrible monster just by having power over others. That is still something that exists in societies today and is still a thought that is as terrifying as ever.Overall I must say this film greatly exceeds my expectations and is now one of my favorite horror films of all time. A timeless classic with themes that are still relevant today and some of the earliest stunning acting and directing in horror film history that could still be watched and learned from today.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The brain's the thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Differences between the sensitive, articulate creature in Mary Shelley's novel and the monster in the movie are not because original director Robert Florey, his replacement James Whale, and writer John Balderston dismissed Shelley's original ideas. They were working not from the novel but from Peggy Webling's dramatic adaptation. It was her changes to Shelley's novel that Baldertson dismissed. The creature in the movie is therefore twice removed from its source, its face the face of the corpse, its reactions those of a caged beast.Christopher Frayling in his otherwise excellent commentary on the latest DVD release suggests that Robert Florey's contribution to the script - the implantation into the creature of a "criminal" brain - makes for a less complicated and interesting story. But uncertainty about the creature's brain adds a dimension of ambiguity that didn't exist in the novel, in which the creature understandably lashes out at his creator's rejection and society's hostility. In 1931, however, the influence on this film of German cinema (the expressionist design of "Caligari" and "Der Golem") may have prompted Florey to address troubling questions about the nature of evil raised earlier that year by Peter Lorre's tortured portrayal of a child molester in Fritz Lang's "M." Could the killer control his impulses? And if not, is he morally guilty?Those parts of the film not scripted by Florey go even further, questioning whether a "criminal" brain even exists. "After all," says Frankenstein to his mentor Professor Waldman, "it's just dead tissue." Also, a lecture Waldman delivers to students on the behavioral effects of certain "convolutions" characteristic of the very brain implanted in creature aren't born out by his actions. He never demonstrates the impulses one expects of a "criminal," and has ample justification for killing Frankenstein's assistant who tormented him with fire, and for killing Waldman who attempted to dissect him. The most damning evidence against the creature - his inadvertent drowning of a child - is the result of his own innocence in believing she will float on the water like her flowers.Nevertheless, the creature's unsophisticated reactions to a world he does not understand make him utterly unpredictable and a real danger. He lives in a nightmare world that assaults our own senses in the wonderfully angular and expressionistic props and sets constructed by art director Charles D. Hall (who had worked with German director Paul Leni on THE MAN WHO LAUGHS three years earlier).It is easy to retrospectively dismiss this movie as tame. But in its day no one knew what the echoing footsteps in the watch tower would bring through the door. It is only because of budget sequels and performances of lesser actors than Karloff that the Frankenstein monster has become such a comfortable cliché.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein: review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a great film with an underlying theme. This film presents a peculiar scenario of what it's like to be different. Dr. Frankenstein portrays the perfect "evil genius" character whose genius is only surpassed by his madness and whose fall is a product of his insanity. This film is an early attempt, and warning to the public, to show the tragedy of creating artificial life. Dr. Frankenstein's famous quote "Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!" is perfect expression of the dark side of science. On the other hand, this film is a loner movie. The monster drifts through the landscape searching for his own meaning despite his obvious handicap. This theme speaks to many of us who know what its like to feel completely alone in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the Sequel is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein(1931) is a film which has stood the test of time. Far better than other films of it's generation, there is probably no film better than this to sit down with, and spend a rainy, thundering evening eating chips and drinking tea. Even though few people alive today can actually claim this movie is nostalgic and be sincere, even a first-time viewer can watch and feel the nostalgia. The old watch tower set is among the most famous towers seen in any movie, and by far the most memorable. Not many people mention it, but I think Colin Clive had the perfect voice for the role of Henry Frankenstein. Though it seems impossible, the film could have looked quite different with Bela Lugosi to be the first choice to play the monster, but refused due to the lack of dialogue. That mistake would prove disastrous for his career. Karloff was given a screen-test, and created the monster that we all remember today. It was this interpretation of the Frankenstein Monster, and this make-up design by Jack Pierce that have inspired the thousands of knock-offs we have all seen. This is the definitive version of Frankenstein. No October will be complete without a viewing of this work of art of a film. The beautiful back rounds (though obviously fake) give the film it's feel, and for some reason, it all seems part of the nostalgia.We all know the story, but in case you don't this is a review. We begin with Edward Van Sloan introducing us to the film, warning us that it may "shock" us. From there, we see Henry Frankenstein and his hunchback assistant Fritz peering into a graveyard, waiting for a funeral to end, opening up an opportunity to exhume dead bodies for their experiments. The plan to create a man in Henry's image goes awry when Fritz steals an abnormal, criminal brain, which is of course inserted into the monster. All this, right before Henry Frankenstein is to be married. From there on the film gets more exciting, but I won't reveal it for the few who have yet to see it. It is somewhat dated by today's standards, but the film is far superior to the trash fest horror films we see now days such as Saw, Ghost Ship, and many others.I recommend this back-to-back with it's surprisingly superior sequel, Bride of Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read Mary Shelly's original novel Frankenstein and are expecting to see it come to life on the big screen (or whatever size your television screen is) prepare to be extremely disappointed. For one, the monster is completely illiterate the whole movie, all he does is grunt. Second, in the movie, the monsters desire to commit murder and cause terror among the town folk comes from the criminal brain the doctor's assistant, Fritz, accidentally puts in the monster. In the book, his desire to commit murder among other atrocities comes from his hatred of mankind from condemning him due to his appearance. The movie is the epitome of 1931 special effects, and it's as good as it gets for being made more than seventy five years ago. Boris Karloff did do a fantastic job as the monster, however, and the flat-head makeup and outfit are perfect for his role. Colin Clive was also outstanding at portraying the doctor who gave the monster life, and he captured the emotions that came with playing god and the eventual regret for creating such an atrocity after it began killing the citizens of the town below. The set was flawless, all the machines and devices and mechanisms in the laboratory running perfectly and perfectly portraying the sanctum of a mad doctor capable of producing life where there was once none. The movie opens with a warning from Edward Van Sloan, stating that what you are about to witness may "shock you, surprise you, and maybe even horrify you", and explaining the basic plot of the story. I wouldn't say it's scary or frightening or even surprising, but I believe that this is mainly due to the fact that I'm very desensitized, as is most of America, and I strongly believe that if I grew up in the 1930's, I would have been extremely frightened by this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankestein could be defined as "a classic horror film that still important today." It's an impressive film for it's time and it still manages to impress after all these years.The make-up and costume design of the Frankenstein monster are amazing for their time, Karloff is almost unrecognizable. The acting in the film is not bad, but Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein made his "It's alive" line, one to the most recognizable quotes in cinema history.I've seen this movie at least a dozen times since I was young, but it still holds a place in my heart. It's truly an example of what horror could be. I wish that I could see the first audiences reaction to the Frankenstein monster, it must have been sheer terror.</fullReview>

I do have some questions though. I never understood why they kept him in the dark for the first few days and why didn't he kill Elizabeth when he was in her room. Fritz creeped me out and I can understand why Frankenstein killed him because he was always torturing him. Poor Frankenstein he never had a chance because he had an abnormal brain to begin with. I'm still also unsure of why Frankenstein was the way he was. Was he violent because he had the brain of a criminal? Or was he violent because he was tortured and that's what he learned? This movie is another reason why you should let the dead rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw James Whale's 1931 horror film "Frankenstein", I think the reason why I did not enjoy it the first time around was due to the fact that I was expecting too much from a film seventy-seven years old. I was expecting something a little more serious, a little more drawn-out, a little longer, and then I remembered that that was not how films were typically made back in the 1930s. When I saw the film a second time, I enjoyed it. I still think it is perhaps a tad bit overrated, but I am very thankful I took the time to see it again, for I do now appreciate it as a horror classic.By today's standards, "Frankenstein" is very dated. Many audience members today may find the monster, played by Boris Karloff, to be more funny than frightening. I did at first. But when I pictured myself as an audience member of 1931, I could imagine the film being scary. There was a sequence in the film that I did find pretty intense and the rest of the monster scenes were just flat out fun to watch. The performances are very good, some of the characters are under-developed, but this is made up for by fine acting. Colin Clive was sensational as the somewhat mad and obsessed Dr. Henry Frankenstein and how could anybody forget the classic line "It's alive!". Boris Karloff also stole the show as the monster. Karloff did a great job with all of that heavy makeup and padding at making this monster seem frightening at times, and at others, strangely pleasant and even vulnerable.The monster is not always this fearsome creature that stumbles around going "err! ERRRR!" Don't get me wrong, he does do this and quite a bit. But there are some scenes where he is shown to be more like a confused, sensitive creature. There is a scene that is almost cute where he still retains some of his humanity and becomes friends with a little girl. In fact, he wasn't shown to be dangerous until provoked. I think a modern retelling of the story could examine this in more detail and with more running time to suit contemporary audiences, but the 1931 film does it fine in its own way.I do feel that "Frankenstein" is SLIGHTLY overrated and I wouldn't classify it as one of the best motion pictures of all time. It is, however, a significant horror film and I would call it a classic of that genre. Its limited use of a music score, great acting, and quick pacing makes this film a great means of afternoon or nighttime entertainment. I am so glad I gave it a second chance, it really is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1931 horror film is the first well-known full-length adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel, "Frankenstein". It has now been over 7 ? decades since it was first seen by the public, but it is one of those films that is still regarded as a classic. I must confess that I have never read the novel, so I don't know how this adaptation compares to it (some will compare this movie unfavourably, and it is apparently a lot different), but regardless, it has not failed to impress me.Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a scientist who is determined to create new life! He and his assistant, Fritz go to a graveyard and steal a corpse for the experiment, but Frankenstein discovers that they will have to find a useful brain elsewhere. So, the two go to a medical college, and after the class is dismissed and nobody is in the room, Fritz sneaks in and steals one of the brains. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is unaware of the fact that this is a criminal brain! Meanwhile, several people, including Frankenstein's fiancée, are concerned about the scientist and his experiments, so they go to his castle laboratory, where they witness the finishing of his latest project! Sadly, Frankenstein has just created a dangerous monster! As a horror movie, one would probably expect to find this movie scary. I'm sure it was considered very scary back in the day, but today, many could be disappointed to find that it is not so much so. This is understandable, as times have changed, and this film is obviously a bit tame compared to what is expected from contemporary horror films. However, I have now seen this version of "Frankenstein" three times, and although I have never found it very scary, I have still found a lot of it, well, intense, which is good enough for me. I couldn't stay fully intrigued the whole time, but overall, the film had enough intensity to leave me satisfied in the end.If you're used to contemporary horror films, filled with action and special effects, 1931's "Frankenstein" could bore you to tears if you're expecting the same from it. However, you have to remember the fact that it took a long time for film-making to get where it is today (it has obviously been a gradual process), and this movie obviously can't do the same for today's viewers as it did for its original audience. Many people today still dig these early horror films, and for those people, I would say this version of "Frankenstein" is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Book, But a Beautifully Crafted Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read the magnificent, poignant "Frankenstein" (1818) by Mary Wollestonecraft (probably heavily rewritten by Percy Shelly), which is really an allegory about how we, the created from the parts of others (our parents), are brought without our consent into a world of brutality that may treat us cruelly, you'll be totally offended by the liberties that this film, and its sequel, 'The Bride of Frankenstein' (1935) take with the original work. It has too much that is not in the book, and in at least one case (the use of the 'abnormal brain' as a cause for the Monster's cruelty) contradicts the book's theme of one born innocent responding to the world's cruelty with cruelty. None of this is James Whale's fault, as the great DVD commentary in Universal's Legacy Collection explains, since there were so many different plays and sources from which the film's content was drawn.But try to look at the film, as I do now, as 1) how those who first saw the film in 1931 reacted, and 2) what kind of a film making experience it provides those of any age and time. Then we can appreciate that this is a beautifully crafted film! So many pluses: It was the first sound presentation (there had been three silent versions) of the macabre theme, that is, giving life to the dead and creating a new body from others' body parts-- so amazingly presented in the bleakly atmospheric, and suggestive opening sequences with Dwight Frye and Colin Clive. The astonishing way the Monster is first shown-- Frankenstein lowers the lights, the door opens, and the Monster BACKS into the room (heightening the suspense) and then he slowly turns around, and then we see him in three increasingly closer shots! Wow! You'll never see this subtlety in any other Frankenstein film! The prologue by Edward Van Sloan, and the unseen face of the Monster when he comes to life really sets you up for the screams that must have ensued when the cavernous face of Karloff was first shown! From then on, it must have been pure blasphemous shock for audiences of the time! But what about us? This movie passed my "Test of Time" test -- I watched it with my 8 and 10 year old grandchildren! They were hypnotized throughout the whole movie (not getting bored to play with their toys) with the 10 year old having a nightmare and waking up at 4:30 a.m. this morning ("I can't sleep!"). (Of course, I've raised them on 'Betty Boop,' and 'Popeye' so they were no strangers to black and white films.)To continue with the pluses: first, Boris Karloff's impressive, compassionate and intelligent performance. The close up of his hands in which he skillfully expressed emotion-- yearning for friendship and connections with others. Of course, it was not unusual in the days of silent films for pathos, feeling and emotion to be expressed with the body; one thinks of, for example, of how Conrad Veidt's hands get scarier and scarier in 'Orlac's Hands' (1925), or of the amazing Lillian Gish, and the use of her eyes to express fear in 'Broken Blossoms' (1919). We still have this great use of silent technique in 1931. Second, the photography. The black outs that allow a brief 'whew' between contrasting macabre scenes with normal movie scenes; the innovative camera angles to show off the off-kilter 'Caligari' sets; the cutaways during lateral shots; the great high and low angle shots in all of the watchtower scenes. Third, the use of James Whale's 'stable' of British actors previously used by him, who did so well in the film. Colin Clive, the precursor of Peter Cushing as the quintessential British scientist, has been immortalized for his manic, hysterical yet justified (as an experimental scientist) cry of "It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive!" (Shades of Rotwang in 'Metropolis'!), even though he is fine throughout the film. Mae Clark and Frederick Kerr as the cantankerous Baron (and even John Boles) perform their roles well. All with good direction by Whale, that places this way above the (mostly) stagy, stilted acting of 'Dracula' (also 1931).Therefore, the more we watch this film, the more we see how well crafted it is on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Monster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale's brilliant "Frankenstein" of 1931, starring the great Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster, is arguably the single most influential Monster movie of all-time. Creepy, moving, sad and beautiful at the same time, "Frankenstein" is an ingenious cult classic whose brilliance is only outshined by its sequel, Whale's "Bride Of Frankenstein" of 1935. Perfectly written, brilliantly directed, excellently acted and splendidly photographed, "Frankenstein" is the ground-breaking masterpiece that made Boris Karloff the unforgettable Horror-icon he is.I suppose that everybody knows the story of Frankenstein's monster, so I don't find it necessary to write a description of the plot. The acting in this movie is exquisite. Karloff is perfect in the role of his life. No other actor who ever lived could have fit into the role of Frankenstein's Monster as perfectly as Karloff did, and nobody could have played the role with such brilliance (allthough Christopher Lee was, of course, also great in the 1957 Hammer Classic "The Curse Of Frankenstein"). Nobody else could have given the Monster this incomparable personality of a monster that is feared by everybody, but actually only a pitiable, sad, lonely creature in desperate and hopeless search for an identity and a belonging. Colin Clive delivers a brilliant performance as the young Dr. Frankenstein, who is obsessed with the idea of creating an artificial human being. And the rest of the performances is also great. Dwight Frye is unforgettable as Dr Frankenstein's hunchbacked, sadistic and crazy lab assistant Fritz, and Mae Clarke is excellent as the doctor's worried fiancée. The film is excellently written, brilliantly directed, greatly shot and highly atmospheric, and James Whale has to be described as a genius for bringing Mary Shelley's novel to screen so perfectly and creating one of the most important milestones in motion picture history."Frankenstein" is not a movie that lovers of film should see, it is a movie that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! In case you haven't seen it yet you should go and rent it, or, even better, buy it, because this is a movie that should be seen more than once and it shouldn't be missing in any collection! A true masterpiece! Absolutely Brilliant! A Must-See! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #058: Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>058: Frankenstein (1931) - released 11/21/1931; viewed 5/23/06.DOUG: We take in another cornerstone release from Universal, James Whale's Frankenstein. Like Dracula, this movie is very stripped down. Right at the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein is in the thick of working on his experiment, along with his hunchback servant Fritz (Dwight Frye, who doesn't have to waste any time being a nimrod straight man this time around). Earlier, I listed the Frankenstein monster as the fifth major villain to hit the screen in this year (after Caesar Enrico Bandeli, Tom Powers, Dracula, and Hans Beckert). It occurred to me while watching that perhaps the villain isn't the monster, but is actually the doctor, played by Colin Clive, who carries the first half of the movie with his performance. I think I'm going to let it be Boris Karloff's monster, who carries the movie through to its home stretch; I look forward to the sequels later on. It is, of course, impossible to watch this film today without thinking about Young Frankenstein (and I'm sure the same is true of a number of the sequels). Some of the movie is a bit dated, though the scene where the monster tosses little Maria into the pond is still chilling. Talk about dated, there's a scene late in the film that I'm sure was very scary in 1931, but I found extremely funny: the Monster sneaks into Elizabeth's room, and there's about 20 seconds where she's unaware of his presence as a modern audience screams "LOOK BEHIND YOU! HE'S RIGHT THERE!" the way we do in all silly horror films these days. Then when she notices him, he goes in for the kill; the camera cuts to a close-up, and the Monster's lip curls up as he growls like Bob Hope. That was weird.KEVIN: Here we have the fifth and final villain of 1931, but it's up for debate whether it is Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) or his Monster (Boris Karloff). Most of the horror in this movie has become terribly cheesy, but Karloff's performance is still scary as hell. When he first lumbers in, he doesn't seem fully human or truly alive. His face has become the standard for Frankenstein's monster, yet even now it still invokes such uneasiness. Colin Clive's titular doctor is also surprisingly creepy, with his escalating madness bringing out a performance almost as unforgettable as the Monster. This film holds up much better than Dracula. There's much more on screen violence, and the characters aren't as idiotic. One of the unique qualities about this version of the story is the way it starts in the middle. In the very first scene we find Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye, back again!) digging up another corpse for their experiments. The advantage of this kind of storytelling is that it adds mystery to the doctor's actions right as the film begins. If you don't know the story, you're not sure what he's up to, but you know it's not good. It also allows us to get right into the action. The disadvantage of doing this is that we don't get a clear picture of who Frankenstein was before he became obsessed with playing god and cheating death.Last film: The Champ (1931). Next film: Mata Hari (1931).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that this film was made in 1931,it is to it's credit that it still has the power to shock. I think that it is far too easy to say that it looks tame by today's standard's and I guess that it does look dated.But it is over 70 years old and that has to be remembered. It was the role that made a legend of Boris Karloff and rightly so.He manages to exude some sympathy for the poor,tortured creature and it is a master class in actions speaking louder than words. There are many great scenes of course.The first appearance of Karloff,the creation of the creature in Frankenstein's lab,the hunt for the creature.This film has had an enormous influence,alway's the sign of a true movie great. In all,this is a true classic and fully deserve's it's place in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Whales' creation is still a spine-tingler...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment COLIN CLIVE speaks that immortal line: "It's alive! It's alive!" you get the kind of chill that makes watching FRANKENSTEIN such fun. Atmospherically, it ranks with the best of the old B&amp;W Universal horror films, although today, watching it produces rather distracting visions of what Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks did with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, adhering to all the traditions of this early version of the tale. And, of course, with a lot of humor that is missing in this grim take on the story.It's Clive and DWIGHT FRYE as his helper, Fritz, that really give two of the film's most memorable performances. The secondary roles played by JOHN BOLES and MAE CLARKE make no particular impression and are merely standard stock parts. EDWARD VAN SLOAN as Dr. Waldman is effective in a lesser role.And, of course, BORIS KARLOFF is truly magnificent as the creature who, indeed, looks as though he's made from dead body parts. Even the haunted expression on his face is enough to chill. He uses his whole body to express anguish and emotion--including his arms, his hands, and his walk. All of his mad rages are extremely well handled by the consummate actor.Karloff manages to bring sympathy and pity for the creature, despite his many manic moments. The suspense builds when he escapes from his confines and all of these climactic scenes still have the power to enthrall, as he strolls through the countryside and terrifies the villagers. The scene by the water with the little girl who befriends him is particularly touching.Summing up: Still chilling after all these years thanks to masterful direction by James Whale, great sets and fine cinematography. Well worth treasuring for preserving BORIS KARLOFF's memorable role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Horror Films Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie and am sure at it's time it was the ultimate scare fest. Of all the Universal horror films of that era, excluding the 1935 sequel, this is the best. It still holds up well today and I love that Boris Karloff was really the first franchise monster actor. He is the precursor to Robert Englund, Kane Hodder, Angus Scrimm, Tony Todd, and Doug Bradly, among others. Karloff's films though had more prestige in them then any other horror film. This is not to say that all other horror films are bad because the are not good looking. It just means that this film was made differently than the way horror is made today. Today the vast majority of the films are backyard productions done quick fast and cheap, which there is nothing wrong with and I love those movies too, But this film was one of the first and it is by even todays standards probably one of the most expensive studio Horror productions out there and it makes this film different. I love too that this film went for it with killing the little girl by the lake. I can't imagine how in 1931 they managed to get this one past. In today's world of stupid PG-13 Asian horror films it almost impossible to show the kids being killed. This movie is classic and should be watched by everyone. Stay tuned for the Bride though.</fullReview>

The moody atmosphere, the great and only a bit over-the-top acting and the story are all great. One particular scene I liked was where the monster meets a young girl by the lake. I won't give it away but it's touching and sad, and ends very shockingly.

		<shortDescription>A Classic Frankenstein!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was really the first film about Frankenstein. While it is over seventy years old, it is still amazing to watch. It's one of those early cinematographic achievements that remind us the origins of film-making. Colin Clive is superb as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Unfortunately, he died of alcoholism. He could have accomplished so much more in his acting career if he had stayed off the sauce. The monster of Frankenstein has poignant moments like the scene with the little girl by the lake. I don't think he knew his own strength when he threw her into the water. I think he thought it's what she wanted. He didn't know any better. There is a great morality in this tale about cloning and playing God. Doctors today still play God by creating monsters. The cloning issue is a today issue and this film can remind us of the consequences when you play with God. You have to feel sympathy for Frankenstein. HE did not asked to be born or created. I am sure that there will always be remakes but this is the best original Frankenstein. The other version was silent. I felt that this film transcend time and reminded us of the early golden days of Hollywood where they were just happy with speaking in films. Maybe our film industry has gone too far, they have forgotten about language and character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1931 director James Whale was a promising young director that was set to direct the adaptation to the big screen of Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein. After the success of Tod Browning's "Dracula", Universal studios picked "Frankenstein" as their next project, and with this, they would change the history of horror movies for ever.The movie is not a faithful adaptation of the novel, in fact, it covers only the first half of it (the rest would be used as the sequel, "Bride of Frankenstein"); nevertheless, the film was a mixture of raw talent combined to create one of the finest movies ever done. We follow Henry Frankenstein, in his attempt to emulate God and give life to a body he made with corpses. As the experiment succeeds, he rejects the creature who is left alone in a world that rejects him.Many words have been written about this marvelous film and its superb sequel; James Whale constant perfection of his technique would reach a peak in his two next horror movies, but is here where it shows how brilliant his future would be. Following the school of German expressionism, it is notorious how different "Frankenstein" was from typical American movies, giving new life to the industry and showing that entertainment could Be art as well.The acting is top notch, with Colin Clive and Boris Karloff as two sides of the same coin: Creator and creation, God and Monster; the powerful acting of both stars is pivotal for the movie to succeed. While the rest of the cast is average for its time, it is worth to mention Dwight Frye interpretation of Fritz, the doctor's assistant. His performance, while underrated, was on par with their costars and shines in his supporting role.Jack Pierce is the other name associated with this masterpiece, as he is the main responsible of the iconic image of the monster. No doubt his work was the work of a genius as his vision of Frankenstein's creation is the one that has go down in history as the definitive image of the monster.While certainly a masterpiece, it's incredible that the same team who did this awesome film would surpass themselves with the sequel: "The Bride of Frankenstein". This movie is among the most important films ever done,and a must see for everyone interested in film history, or simply willing to spent son good time.James Whale's "Frankenstein", is an immortal movie that will be always remembered rightfully as the classic it is. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is truly one of the all time horror classics and a big part of Hollywood's golden age of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: James Whale, Script: William Hurlburt, John L. Balderston, Cast: Colin Clive (Henry), Boris Karloff (?), Mae Clark (Elizabeth), Edward Van Sloan (Dr Waldman), John Boles (Victor Moritz), Dwight Frye (Fritz) Frederick Kerr (Baron)Who can forget this great film adaption of the Mary W. Shelley novel. Henry Frankenstein appears to be a decent man with a beautiful fiancée but he allowed himself to become seduced by an obsession to create life. In his quest to do so, he created a 'human' body from corpses that he and his hunchbacked assistant 'Fritz' steals from graveyards. In order to obtain a brain for his 'creation' he has Fritz steal a brain from the medical school. In doing so, Fritz gets startled by a sudden laud noise and drops the normal brain so he grabs the abnormal brain hoping his master won't notice. As a result, a monster is created. Not knowing any better, Frankenstein's monster terrorizes and creates havoc with the citizens of the village.This might just be the first great horror film to emerge during the era of 'talkie' films. I believe Universal produced Dracula first but as far as I'm consented, this is the superior film. This is the film that helped make both Karloff and Whale legends. Karloff had been in numerous films before this going back to the 1910's but he was unknown until he got cast as the monster. The success of this film made James Whale a leading director in Hollywood and enabled him to have total creative control of later films he would make such as Bride of Frankenstein and The Invesible Man. IMDb states in their trivia that Universal (Carl Leammle Jr.) wanted Bela Lugosi to play the part of the monster but he refused because their was no talking part so Whale selected Boris Karloff for the part. I can't even imagine Lugosi as the monster! The film as we see it on the Universal DVD set isn't quite how folks saw it in theater houses back in 1931 (as if I'm old enough to know!) Due to the Hays code or whatever, at least two scenes where cut. One scene was where Colin Clive says "now I know what it is like to be God". That line was very controversial for the time probably because it suggested that man could be like God or because Dr. Frankenstein played God by creating life. Also, the famous scene with the monster and the little girl. The film as originally seen did not show him throwing the girl into the lake. These scenes were restored for the DVD release. This film was considered shocking for the time. Ed Van Sloan warns the audience of what they are about to see at the film's beginning. There isn't hardly anyone who hasn't heard of Frankenstein as a result of this film and the novel. This film had a big impact on horror films and still holds up today. All the actors preform well. Everything from the acting to direction and set design to the make-up effects by the legendary Jack Pierce is top notch. Like the German expressionistic films that preceded this (Nosferatu, The Cabinet of Dr. Calgari etc.) this movie has a Gothic feel about it that I like.</fullReview>

And, of course, the great Universal horror movies of that decade. These films were played to be serious dramas, not campy, gory stupidity like later "horror" films.

		<shortDescription>"Primitive but still a movie milestone."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is obsessed with the secrets of life and death. Aided by his dwarf assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) he collects body parts from graves and the gallows pole and creates a human being from them. He brings the creature to life with his electrical equipment in his laboratory (an abandoned windmill)and the apparatus is triggered by lightning. Unfortunately the creature has been given the brain of a criminal lunatic and it goes on the rampage.Universal's first Frankenstein picture is famous for starting the studio's infamous cycle of horror films throughout the 1930's, establishing it's director James Whale and introducing a then unknown Boris Karloff to the public. Whale selected Karloff to play the creature in preference to Bela Lugosi. Nearly seventy-five years since this film was first released, FRANKENSTEIN is regarded as a milestone in the history of the horror genre and numerous books have been published about it.My view is that in a primitive way it still holds up very well as a model of cinematic storytelling. The sequence where the creature throws an innocent little girl into a lake with the misguided belief that she would float is both harrowing and heartbreaking. Censorship demanded that this sequence along with the lines with Frankenstein saying that he knows what it feels like to be god be removed when the film was re-released in 1937. This lowered the film's impact and both scenes were restored to the picture in the mid-1980's. Obviously the film isn't scary anymore because it comes from a different age of horrors, but there is no denying that this is one of the most important films in the development of the horror genre (it would inspire future filmmakers) and it's impact as a fine piece of cinematic narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still retains its power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Henry Frankenstein, Colin Clive, foolishly ventures into God's domain when he gives life to a creature he constructed from corpses in this classic adaptation of the novel by Mary Shelley. I am somewhat surprised that this film manages to retain its power over me. If someone were to remake this film using the same script and actors, I would probably complain that it was too slow, lacked sufficient character development, was overly-melodramatic, and veered too far from the source material. Still, despite its problems, this film still works for me. Why? First, this film has something many modern horror lack: atmosphere. The sets... The lighting.... Of course, there's nothing real about them, but that's part of the fun. Secondly, there are some good performances. Colin Clive is certainly over the top, but wonderfully so. His mad and impassioned "It's alive" is one of the classic moments in cinema. While Mae Clark and John Boles seem to have wandered in from some drawing room drama, Edward Van Sloan manages to provide a sturdy performance. However, the film belongs to Boris Karloff. His Frankenstein is more than make-up - though the make-up is magnificent. Karloff imbues the monster with an aching touch of humanity. He makes the film a pleasure to watch. It remains a true classic which only suffers in comparison to its sequel "The Bride of Frankenstein."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mad scientist (Colin Clive in the titled role) creates a monster (Boris Karloff) from old spare human parts and soon total chaos strikes. The monster, strangely sympathetic, appears to be caring at times, but also does not understand his existence, his differences, his appearance, his brute strength or why he seems to frighten all that come into his path. An unwitting murder of a young girl means that his own death at the hands of an angry public is the only real logical solution, or is it? The novel is one of the best I have ever had a privilege to read. Mary Shelley constantly questions God, science, why things happen, human nature and isolation throughout her landmark book. However this movie is a complete Hollywood product and it is not really very close to the novel, but the main themes are still present in candied shells. British director James Whale (who became immortalized himself in Bill Condon's "Gods and Monsters" in 1998) uses dark cinematography, scary audio sounds and landmark makeup/special effects to create a truly interesting and frightening movie experience. Outstanding movie-making from a relatively early part of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My opinion of this film only grows each time I see it. The horror portion, the drama and acting is often totally dated and cartoonish, but the scenes that are played for pure fright are so incredibly effective, I find myself reaching for it again and again. I think the credit all must go to director Whale. Drawing on his experiences in the hell of WW1, he successfully recreated in his images the fear and terror his senses were subjected to while serving in the British army. And thats saying an awful lot. If you are a true fan of Frankenstein, Gods and Monsters is a must see to explain this further. Dracula is good, but because of Whale and Karloff too of course, Frankenstein dwarfs it and I think really places it atop all of the Universal horror films and indeed all horror films that have ever been produced.</fullReview>

This picture was important in many ways. Financially one of the most successful of the 1931-32 season, and gave Universal the go ahead to make "Dracula". Karloff performed excellent things in pictures, though usually in minor roles. This was his big opportunity, and whether you like the picture or not you won't deny his efficacy.

If you enjoy this movie watch 1931's DRACULA or it's sequel, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN. Because it references the book. The 1994 version is much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 12 when I saw this picture in 1932. This little boy was held breathless. My younger brother, 9 years old, went to a matinee performance and was struck senseless with terror. The theater manager called our home and asked for someone to come get him. My mother waited in the car while I went in the theater. The projectionist stopped the film and turned up the house lights. My brother was cowering under a seat and when he saw me he yelped and fastened onto me with his arms and legs. I returned to the car, walking with difficulty. For weeks I had to look under the bed for monsters before my bud would even enter the bedroom. Oh yes, "Frankenstein" certainly is a gem of a movie. It is a bit passe now, but I still run my tape of it once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Universal Classic Horror movie Fan and die hard Boris fan this is one of my all time favorites. Colin Clive in his role of Dr. Frankenstein is to me the best part of the movie (although you can't beat Boris' monster). Clive's "its alive" line will forever be remembered. Even Gene Wilder's great recreation of that line is no match for Clive's intensity with its psychotic overtones. The scene with the villagers and their torches is a classic dramatized lynch mob.

		<shortDescription>An Old Classic That's Still Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This old classic is still a lot of fun. The story moves quickly, is told well, and Karloff is very good as the monster. While the production is mostly straightforward, it does have some fine touches, a few memorable scenes, and has the virtue of letting the story tell itself.Karloff brings both believability and humanity to the monster, even without having any lines, and is an important part of making the story work. Colin Clive is pretty good, too, as the wild-eyed Dr. Frankenstein. Some of the other cast members also get a couple of good moments of their own. The settings and photography are good too, although director Whale would outdo himself with the outstanding sequel "Bride of Frankenstein", which builds on the original "Frankenstein" in every way.If you like older movies and have never seen "Frankenstein", or if you haven't seen it for many years, make a point of seeing it sometime, as you probably won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gothic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know Frankenstein's Monster, or think we do. The face of the Monster has become a pop art institution up there with Elvis and Mickey Mouse ? but somewhere along the way, the Monster became so familiar, it quit being scary. Watching Boris Karloff in the original 1931 `Frankenstein' is a revelation.The centerpiece of `Frankenstein' is Karloff's uncanny performance. I recently watched several of the Universal Frankenstein movies in a row, and I was surprised by how agile Karloff's Monster is, how cunning and animallike compared to the lumbering robotic brute of later movies. This Monster is very much a wild animal, ferocious and tentative at the same time, yearning for freedom and acceptance in ways it can't understand and can't articulate.Even though `Frankenstein' is mainly Karloff's show, there are plenty of other wonderful things in the movie. Director James Whale infuses the film with atmosphere and action, much more than Tod Browning's stagebound and static `Dracula.' Plus, there are wonderful stylized performances from Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Dwight Frye as Fritz. The film itself is full of graveyards, laboratories, dungeons, shot through with lightning and Kenneth Strickfaden's art-deco electrical apparatus. When the Monster does appear in the sunlight, it brings out his innocent side, particularly the tragic episode with little Maria down by the lake.To sum up: `Dracula' was the first of the classic sound Universal horror films, but `Frankenstein' really opened up the genre to what a great horror film can do. It gave birth to a legend in Karloff's portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster, and gave us all an icon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Shelley seemed to be expressing a warning to science in her "Frankenstein" to take greater responsibility in experimentation.Recent reports during the past decade of strange phenomena echo her warning: fish found bearing 'human teeth,' unexplained bigfoot creatures, bees that thrive on meat, puzzling unaccounted-for diseases, and the like. Not to mention a 'deadly' viral strain of which no one knows the origin.The 'accident' of the exchanged brains in creating the monster seem to symbolize the consequences of such unbridled experimentation-gone-extreme. Colin Clive's scientist seems more interested in ego-gratification than in making a useful contribution to humanity. Is there much different today, in wild research and experiments which have dubious usefulness. The mode seems to be to conduct the experiment first, then find its specific usefulness. This reverses the 'scientific method' of first establishing the void and then working to fill that limitation. Shelley's work was certainly philosophical, and James Whale's filmic adaptation effectively dramatizes her 'challenge.' The monster's variable personality traits demonstrate the greater need for built-in safeguards to prevent resulting havoc. Shelley's message is as urgent today as when she first penned her gothic polemic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, having seen this twice in my life, once in '88 and again this week, a few things come to mind...It's pretty slow, but then many flix of the time-Dracula, Iron Horse, etc are too. It's not hurt by the slow pacing, much-but there are times that you'd like to see the Monster do more. But I'd rather have James Whale's flick slowly moving that modern junk like Stigmata that move 100 mph without any chance for coherence....Karloff is great, of course. There's no reason his performance here shouldn't be remembered another 70 years from now. One of the all time greats. Makeup is terrific, and the setting, lighting. Gotta love the 'it's ALive! It's ALIVE!!' sequence; this has been copied a million times but nothing quite like seeing it the first time.Colin Clive overacts some and chews the scenary, but doesn't drag the flick down much.I enjoy the Burgomeister, kinda chews the scenary himself but its fun to watch him go through his paces. And kudos to the great Windmill finale, with the blazing mill, whirring gears and angered/frightened Monster in its middle, the mob surrounding-it does hold up well.***1/2 outta ****, it's a classic.And remember-always read the label-'Good Brain'...'Bad Brain'!

Do you remember chunk's friend in Goonies? he was that really ugly guy who was kept chained up in the basement eating ice cream. well the monster is made to be JUST like him if he were treated if nobody ever loved him.a good film for anyone even remotely interested in the book or just old thrillers in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not AS great as you may have heard, but still has a classic vibe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale and Carl Laemmle Jr's adaptation of Mary Shelly's book is scary in one respect if nothing else: the got the right Monster. Boris Karloff was, apparently, not a known actor by any real stretch, despite working in almost eighty films as a character actor and on stage for quite a while (think about how many actors today could break through at 44?) When combined with Jack Pierce's unique, strange/deranged make-up, it is quite a sight to see the man transform himself into the un-dead 'brute'. His physicality is what makes him an imposing presence, and it's not so much a scare of where he'll come from, but just seeing his face and shape and knowing what damage he can do. I have to think a little of the Hulk, despite being more about anger, had something in debt to Frankenstein's monster.And there is one truly great scene in the film, where the Monster, after escaping possible dissection by Dr. Frankenstein's mentor (this is actually a scary/cool bit where he flicks opens his eyes little by little and then attacks suddenly), and comes upon a little girl by a lake. The little girl is very sweet and understanding, not really knowing that it's a monster of the un-dead, and wants to show him some flowers and how they go on a lake. And then, seeing as he doesn't have flowers, he tosses her into the lake as well. What's shocking here are a few things to me: 1) the action itself, since it seems so sudden, and yet so inevitable, 2) that the scene was cut-out for many years, and yet, in a way, made the Monster less of a 'gray-area' sort of creature, that there *could* be the potential for understanding and human connection, but severed once he did wrong. And 3) that an audience I saw the film with today (on its one-night-re-release in theaters) thought it was funny. My how times change. The rest of the film has some spooky atmosphere of course, if nothing else cause of the tower where Frankenstein does his experiments (and the set is the Grand-daddy of all sci-fi/horror film sets where madness and science collide with electricity and gadgets and such). But there's also dated stuff to it as well, and a brief excursion to show the town in excitement and dancing, shot with a not-so-steady tracking shot, doesn't flow well. And outside of Clive, who plays the doctor, I wasn't very keen on a lot of the performances; Baron Frankenstein especially is tough to watch as he ambles about as a gruff 'Well what is the meaning of this such-and-such' sort that is tiresome after the first minute. And a very last scene where the Frankensteins are seemingly beloved again with a 'toast' is extremely bizarre and not in a way I found amusing.But so much of Frankenstein is just cool to watch, maybe just for the iconic 'It's ALIVE!" moments, and its beginning which doesn't really waste much time with preamble about who this doctor is: right away, he goes for digging up the bod(ies) and getting to work. While a few moments have become sort of laughable, in general Frankenstein still works as one of the keystones of Universal horror, as Whale had a good eye for detail right at the start of the sound era (though one can only imagine what he could have also done in silent film, seeing as how the Monster, in this film, doesn't speak outside of grunts and ROARS). Oh, and the ending sequence at the tower is excellent, and exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to approach Frankenstein from another angle than typical synopsis and rundown of how I feel about it. I don't think I need to explain the plot of such a seminal horror classic. I provided my five favorite scenes. 1) The bummer on a celebration: the scene I consider the most powerful of the film, a farmer carries his dead, drowned daughter into the city as village folk were having a spirited time partying to the wedding day of Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and Elizabeth (Mae Clarke). It states loud and clear that Henry's "mad dream" had brought unforeseen consequences. Equally haunting was the incident itself, a mistake from a Monster whose brain is abnormal. 2) The hanging of Fritz: I consider the main reason the Monster (Boris Karloff) reacted in such a maniacal way was because Frankenstein could not keep his hunch-backed assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye, creating another ghoulish character so emulated in mad science films) from mistreating the titan of stitched body parts. Using a flaming torch and whip, Fritz seemed to have a gleam in his fiendish eyes and a relish in his smile when tormenting the Monster. That scene where we see Fritz dangling from a chain, hung there lifeless, we know that he had gotten too close (and gotten what he deserved). 3) The graveyard: I adore the opening minutes of the movie where crosses stick out from off angles as if the earth of the cemetery were full of lumps and mounds. I remember much ado about the sketch drawings from director Florey (and they are awesome) and his influence on the project without the deserved credit, but all those unique visual angles (German expressionism seeping impressively into Hollywood, and we horror fans were all the better for it).It also has that eerie sight of a criminal hanging from a wooden cross, the body of the monster for which Fritz would cut down. We see here how determined Henry is, the way he orders Fritz to do his bidding, and the audacity to raid the graves of people loved in order to satisfy his scientific curiosity and desire to create life by his own hands. 4) The flaming inferno: The awesome sight of the windmill burning asunder after a mob of villagers (the now famous horror cliché of villagers gathering together with torches and pitch forks, going after the beast that has terrorized their countryside) set it on fire, with the Monster trapped inside (after tossing Henry's limp carcass off the balcony, onto the windmill cross, with him crashing to a heap below), crying out in horror, since it is established the creature hates the flame. 5) Seeing the sun: I find the scene where the Monster glimpses the sun, he kind of waves with his hands, and seems to be like a newborn discovering a brand new life, trying to understand everything its eyes see. Perhaps Fritz ruined what potential such a creature had, only further burdening his master, Henry who seems to grow wearier as the Monster becomes increasingly volatile.There are certain little annoyances that have bugged me, nothing that major as director Whale had a sense of humor and couldn't help include a character like crusty old buzzard, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), always grumbling and barking mad about his son's cooking himself up in the medieval "tomb" of a large, gloomy castle, isolated on a mountain, a symbol of "death and destruction" instead of doting on his soon-to-be bride. I know some fans hold this in great favor for quiet, introspective scenes like Henry talking with Professor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) about the pursuit of the secrets of life and death or Henry lamenting about being considered crazy for simply wondering, inspired enough to search by any means to achieve a dream most feel is morally objectionable. I hang on specific scenes, as described above, which hold their place in my fondness for the film. The wedding seems to work as a monkey wrench in Henry's "engagement" to the creation of life. I find the mobile scenes through the village and forest following the Monster really impressive because it shows that Whale wanted the action to move instead of remain still. Whale likes to shoot faces, allowing the interesting cast of characters close-ups, an interesting contrast to the massive sets. I could talk about this movie endlessly...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went through a Frankenstein phase as a child (doesn't every kid?) and I vividly recall being upset by this film. Not because I found it scary, but because Boris Karloff's pained mannerisms and lost expressions really depressed me. I hated how people treated the monster and I was so down in the dumps by the end that I abstained from watching again until recently.The film deviates massively from Mary Shelley's novel (it is adapted via a stage play) with many peculiar changes along way. The epic story and adventure is substituted with Gothic sets maniacal over-acting by the wild-eyed Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein. I guess when Universal opted for a 70-minute quickie the bulk of the story had to go, only the basics remain, but it's still a strong connection to Shelley's work.Maybe it's just my fondness for Herman Munster, but the iconic Universal image of the Monster is definitely the best. I'm surprised that they haven't remade it along with the Mummy and Wolfman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Universal's finest horror classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of Mary Shelley's book may dislike James Whale's Frankenstein for straying too far from its source material, many of today's viewers will no doubt find the film too slow, and as is the case with so many of the classic Universal monster movies, over-familiarity with the material?the result of nearly 80 years of endless sequels, remakes, spoofs, and homages?renders certain aspects of the film amusing rather than horrific (the now clichéd sight of a hunchbacked assistant carrying a brain in a jar or a mob of torch wielding villagers cannot help but cause a snigger).For a more balanced perspective, Frankenstein should, if possible, be viewed with a different mindset: that of a cinema-goer of 1931, for whom grave robbing, man-made monsters, and incredible, electricity-filled laboratories capable of bringing life to the dead were enough to prove utterly terrifying (and were also a great diversion from the real-life horrors of the 'great depression'). Only when seen from this viewpoint can the real magic of the piece be truly appreciated.The creature, for example, might understandably be perceived by today's audiences as distinctly unfrightening, but look beyond the seemingly comical flat-topped-head, over-sized shoulders and platform hobnail boots, and the delicate nuances of Boris Karloff's performance will become apparent: even under Jack Pierce's iconic make-up, Karloff is able to convey a wide range of emotions?fear, anger, frustration, loneliness?all without uttering a word, and at the same time make his audience not only pity the creature and understand its child-like mentality, but also find it absolutely horrific. In contrast, Colin Clive's turn as Herr Frankenstein is deliberately over-the-top; teetering precariously on the brink of insanity, he is often almost as frightening as his creation, and perceivably more of a monster.Whale's assured direction is also worthy of high praise: he makes optimum use of impressive sets and expressionistic lighting to add immensely to the atmosphere of unease (the lab in the watchtower and the ruined windmill, in particular, are superb), and he successfully draws convincing performances from his main players, thereby avoiding the awful staginess that marred much of Tod Browning's Dracula. Some of his supporting actors are unfortunately a trifle hammy in an effort to provide brief moments of levity (Baron Frankenstein and the Burgomaster are clearly played for laughs), and a few of the painted backdrops could do with a good iron to remove the obvious wrinkles, but these minor quibbles aside, Frankenstein is a movie well deserving of its classic status.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking and enthralling interpretation of the classic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been complaints that Frankenstein is dated. Personally I don't find that, it isn't the most sumptuous of all films, but it is still a wonderful film, that is still shocking and enthralling to me. The Gothic set design is very imaginative, helped by the beautiful cinematography with suitably bizarre camera angles, and the music score is haunting, melancholy and atmospheric. James Whale's direction is also very impressive, it is very focused and innovative. The story is without a doubt a classic, tense, moody and melancholic, and the Monster itself is just a masterful creation. The cast are superb, Colin Clive is very good as the eccentric Henry Frankenstein, while Mae Clarke is an alluring and sympathetic Elizabeth. There is no doubt in my mind though that Boris Karloff gave the best performance, not only that but the definitive portrayal of the monster. He is almost unrecognisable and scary with his make up, and while he was scary with the towering presence and the frightening look in his eyes, his monster is also somewhat touching, particularly when he reaches up to grasp a ray of sunlight. Overall, shocking, enthralling and just wonderful. "It's Alive!" 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I made him with these hands, and with these hands I'll destroy him."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boris Karloff's first appearance as the Creature is truly striking, done with a facial close up that in it's time must have shocked and horrified. I read once that Mae Clarke was so scared of Karloff in his monster disguise that they worked out a little gimmick between themselves. Whenever they appeared in a scene together, Karloff would wiggle his pinkie finger as a signal to his co-star that he was thinking of her, thus helping her realize that he wasn't really a monster.If you follow the story carefully, there are some plot points that upon careful analysis just don't make sense. Wouldn't Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) have had a mild interest in reading the label on the beaker that contained the 'abnormal brain'? Why would he ever have dressed in a suit and tie in that dungeon of a castle? Why wasn't anyone who was present express amazement when the creature first moved his hand? How did the monster get into the Frankenstein home without being seen while the whole town was turning out for the wedding?For detractors of the film, I DON'T CARE! This is the first iconic Universal Movie monster, and his presentation on the big screen for the first time is wonderful. Karloff's interpretation of the creature is magnificent, going far beyond the requirements of makeup. His stilted walk, accentuated by a forty five degree diagonal posture almost defies gravity. It appears he did everything he could to live up to the narrator's message of warning prior to the start of the story. Karloff is Frankenstein, and Frankenstein is Karloff.For it's time, and I daresay, even for today, Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory is one of the classics of film history. Floating it up to to the top of the castle tower to receive it's life giving energy directly from lightning bolts was inspired. Hearing Frankenstein's exhortation that the creature is ALIVE! has a way of burning itself into the viewer's consciousness, and remains there long after the film has ended. It's the movie's way of convincing it's viewers that Dr. Frankenstein was right when he challenges his guests to accept his dubious triumph. Is it possible to create life from the assembled remains of dead tissue? - "Tonight you shall have your proof".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic cinema based on the novel and not an adaptation of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewers of this film who are expecting it to be a screen adaptation of the Mary Shelly novel Frankenstein should be aware that this is three times removed from the novel and is based on a stage play adaptation of the novel. In 1927 Playwright Peggy Webling's play Frankenstein An Adventure in the Macabre debuted in London. The play was revived in 1930 in an adaption by John L. Balderson and Robert Florey. Universal acquired the rights of the play for a screen version and Robert Florey, Richard Schayer, Garret Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay. Boris Karloff stared as the monster in the stage version but the part for the film was offered to John Carradine who turned it down. The filmmakers took a chance on the star of the play and gave the unknown Karloff the role. Also coming over from the stage play was Colin Clive in reprising his role as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Mae Clark, John Boles, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan round out the cast. James Whale was chosen as director. He had previously directed Clive in Journey's End and Clark in the original Waterloo Bridge. Whale would go on to make a couple other monster classics in The Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein as well as the musical Showboat among the films of his brief directorial career. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson, a film veteran from the early days of the silent movie one-reeler's, photographed this film. He would also go on to film The Invisible Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Another veteran of early silent films was Frankenstein's art director Charle D. Hill. Kenneth Strickfaden designed the laboratory's electrical props and Jack Pierce did the makeup. The result is an excellent film from the early days of sound cinema and not to be taken as literal interpretation or misinterpretation of the novel that inspired it. I've seen this many times and would give it a 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror classic well deserving of its acclaim. This film could have been tossed off as schlock, but Director James Whale gave it the quality and craftsmanship of an A class movie. That made all the difference. Whale refrains from revealing the Monster too early. In the scene where it comes alive, we see only the thing's hand as it starts moving. Later we hear it roaming through the empty castle in the background while a dialogue scene plays out. The buildup is done so well that when the Monster finally appears in a dark, low angle shot, coming through a creaking door, it is one of the best reveals in film history. Boris Karloff is magnificent as the Monster (even if most of the credit should go to the costume and makeup artists). Wonder, anger, panic, fear and vengefulness he conveys all through his wordless performance. He is intimidating at just the right times and pitiable at others. The film comes in at just over an hour, which is really a shame. Whale definitely could have gotten more out of another half hour, and the cast was decent enough to deserve some more character development. Nonetheless, black and white horror films don't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Frankenstein must have been something when first seen. The wonderful instant atmosphere--the foggy graveyard, the two slinking figures waiting for the funeral to end, looking for bodies. Karloff, for the first time, actually interpreting the role, using his expressive face and those enormous hands, the appeal to the world to accept his being. Of course, it is entirely removed from the classic book (who says it has to follow the book, an entirely different medium) where the creature is brought to life by some secret means then goes on to become sentient, philosophical, and vengeful. Still, this hulking reanimation is trying to fit in but can't control his base impulses. His very size is his enemy. The carelessness of Fritz sets everything in motion--had he not panicked we might have had an Albert Schweitzer "monster" running through the countryside doing good deeds. Now there's a horror movie!I have grown to love this film, especially its most famous scenes. The bringing of life, using lightning, Colin Clive, almost frothing at the mouth, screaming "It's alive, it's alive," the death of the little girl through a childlike misunderstanding, the encounter with the blind man, and of course, the scene at the windmill, the villagers running with their torches. By the way, where did they get all those torches? Unlike the first reviewer, I urge you to see this film, not because of its lack of faithfulness to the novel, but because of its captivating portrayal of horror. I wish I could have been in a theater in the 30's and seen Edward Van Sloan announce to us that we were about to be terrified. What a moment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where's the tragedy, the passion, the impact, the atmosphere? Where's the great movie that everyone raves about? This is a stilted, misjudged Lett's notes version of Mary Shelley's fine novel that's aged about as well in eighty years as a bottle of milk. Fair enough, there's plenty of iconic imagery in 'Frankenstein': the bulbous laboratory equipment and lightning bolts; irate mobs of villagers with burning torches; the monster's flat head and neck bolts. But as far as tone goes, there's barely a scene that gets it right. The creation of the creature is immediately followed by three people sitting around having a nice chat while Frankenstein's dad huffs and puffs in 'comedic' fashion, which drains any impact from what should be a momentous event. Frankenstein is breaking the laws of man and nature in his work, but aside from some melodramatic wailing about how he's become a God, the movie never raises the kind of ethical questions the book did. It's too simple.The heart-breaking romance between Frankenstein and Elizabeth, and the destruction of his family, is replaced with... not much at all really, unless you count Elizabeth whining a bit. The impact of Frankenstein discarding his creation and paying the price is played down to the point that it's hardly worth bothering with. The movie makes little of the fact that the whole thing is Frankenstein's fault, preferring instead to let him off the hook and have his monster stumble about the countryside. And how about the scene where Frankenstein's assistant steals a brain for the creature? He accidentally drops the jar labelled 'normal brain' and has to settle for the one with 'abnormal brain' written on it! Couldn't we have had something a bit more subtle, like two bags getting mixed up at the airport?This reminded me of a junior novelisation I read in school years ago, where the heart and soul was missing and all that was left with was a thin outline. And it sure looks creaky now ? not only is it not in the least bit scary (only the scene where the creature drowns a little girl has any effect at all) but the studio-bound graveyards and cloth backdrops look slightly the worse for wear these days. Surely, in the scene where everyone's looking for the monster, someone should have ironed the sky? Karloff's much vaunted role as the monster (his most famous but far from his best) amounts to little more than stumbling around and moaning; there's certainly not the pathos that there should be. As with 'The Mummy' and 'The Old Dark House', he's wasted. It's cinematic heresy, I know, but this is a lousy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as long as you aren't looking for the Frankenstein story by Mary Shelley, you will be very happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made the mistake of reading the original Mary Shelley version of Frankenstein almost 20 years ago. I say unfortunate, because I then realized that none of the movies have ever come close to approaching the greatness of the novel. Most, such as this famous Universal monster movie, focus too much on the monster and not enough on the moral issues that elevated the novel to greatness. In other words, Shelley's book wasn't focused on the monster as much as how awful and cowardly the doctor was for creating this being and then abandoning it. BUT, if you can look past this, the film is great fun.Colin Clive starred as the doctor in this and the sequel, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. While he certainly wasn't a great actor (he had a very limited range--or at least it appears that way based on the roles he played), he was just right to play a slightly insane and extremely focused "mad scientist". Yes his acting was over-the-top, but for this film it was necessary.Boris Karloff played the monster. The role was apparently originally offered to Bela Lugosi (who had just made a name for himself playing Dracula), but he foolishly turned down the role. Karloff made the most of it and did a great job of infusing life and humanity into a mostly mute monster.The movie is appropriately creepy--with lots of spider webs, fog and other scenery guaranteed to set the mood. A beautiful film to look at and unjustly seen by some as just a kids' movie. See it and experience one of the best Universal had to offer.The only misgiving I have at all about giving this wonderful movie a 10 is that some of the other actors really weren't great. A couple of the minor actors in particular clearly misread their lines yet the director, James Whale, did not re-shoot the scenes. An odd little mistake in an otherwise wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal classic - all it lacks is a score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My feelings were mixed before I saw this one. On one hand, it's one of the most famous horror films ever (who doesn't know what Karloff's Monster looks like?) but on the other hand, I wasn't too keen on Lugosi's Dracula made at the same time (although after a second viewing it's grown on me...). However, I was greatly pleased with this film, a lot better than its companion piece, seeing as it contains more action, better characterisations, better everything really. The only thing the film lacks is the presence of Bela Lugosi, who despite his many detractors was always great value for money.It more than makes up for his absence, however, with the presence of newcomer Boris Karloff, who more than acquits himself in the role and was good enough to become one of the biggest horror movie stars ever in the history of cinema. He would continue his role in horror films for more than thirty years afterwards, up until his death, and really this is the performance that kick-started his floundering career. Karloff evokes sympathy and deeply unsettling horror. It would have been easy to keep the monster as a bland-faced brute but Karloff manages to bring a deep level of understanding for the misunderstood creature, and he manages to do this under a ton of makeup. Like Lee after him, he fleshes out his monster, a very difficult task with which few have succeeded (Glenn Strange never managed to do this).The film has a great Gothic ambiance. It kicks off in the middle of a graveyard, and what better place is there to start a film? With the broken crosses everywhere and the ever present statue of death hovering in the background, you know you're in for a good time. The atmosphere of this opening scene is later recaptured in the famed creation scene, set in a ruined castle on a hill. The atmosphere of these old classics is really something to behold, and I fear that it can never be totally recaptured - there was none of it in the recent adaptation, MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN.Along with this we have some brilliant acting from Colin Clive (who reached the peak of his manic performance when screaming "It's alive, it's alive!"). It's probably fair to say that Clive's definitive performance was the basis for many more mad scientists in films in the 1950s. Along with Clive and Karloff, Dwight Frye and Edward Van Sloan from Dracula are along for the ride, Frye being memorable as the hunchbacked assistant (another defining role) and Sloan excelling himself as the stern but kindly professor. Mae Clarke also adds a pretty face to the cast list, but as in many of these films is not given much to do, being the token love interest all she needs to do is scream and faint.Karloff's makeup for his role is also definitive, it is amazing that over sixty years later practically everyone in the western world still remembers his flat head and the bolts from his neck. This film is a true classic in the genre and it's easy to say why. The only thing I would say the film lacks is music, which is sorely missed especially in the dramatic scenes, but there is so much going on (unlike in Dracula) that it is never missed too much. Well worth watching, and it goes without saying that if you are a true horror fan then sooner or later you must see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this early horror movie. It was just simple and creepy, its not like modern horror that relies on shocks, it was just the movement of the camera and the lighting that made it feel like a horror film. I was surprised how humanized he is, in modern depictions I haven't really seen that side. My favorite scene was the he with the little girl, and the sudden snapping was kind of fun. The doctor was fun and properly crazy for the role he was playing. There's a reason hes alive is such an iconic line and he really kills it. I would like to watch the sequels sometime to continue to see the monster more humanized. I would definitely encourage you watch this if you haven't because it sets the standard for the creepy horror that I feel is the best kind of horror.</fullReview>

There is no music throughout the whole movie except for the sound of the violin playing throughout the movie to calm down the monster, which I think makes it feel more realistic to the viewers. It had a big impact on people because it was a very scary movie in its day. And I remember watching this film with my dad when I was very young and being very scared of the monster.

		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" by James Whale I looked several times. Although partly based on stories story is fantastic. This is a classic that even today does not lose its value. The distinctive image and a very good cinema are not unnoticed. Dramaturgy and stage design are very solid. The film captures their traits and elements of expressionist expression and psychological treatment of the central pseudo-protagonists in the character of the monster which is unforgettable starred Boris Karloff.Scientist will create a monster that will be "his baby". The monster is a reflection of science and experiments. The desire to create man sinks to the extreme. In this case we are talking about sick necessary. The man who wants to trace and sometimes cracked. The monster is an enigma, and people are wondering what it will do. People need to do something for the monster. After all it is the product of the human mind and hand. Monster, one put into life, will be treated in such a way to attack and their creator, it will attack the Creator himself through the image and likeness of his Freaks. It was awful, miserable, helpless, and hopeless supernatural strongly monstrous. It felt a tenderness toward the girl, but he kills her. It is useless, useless phantom whom the world rejects and prosecuted. I would say that acting variety, on a scale from excellent to good through dubious and bad. Boris Karloff (Monster) is excellent. Prototype of monster and character for which I regularly returned to this movie. The film has no soundtrack and hence its performance is even more meaning. Dwight Frye (Fritz), Edward Von Sloan (Dr. Waldman) and Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein) are all of them good in different roles. Dwight Frye is definitely noticeable. Frederick Kerr has brought a touch of humor, which is welcome. Mae Clarke (Elizabeth) and John Boles (Victor) have not thrilled me. Colin Clive (Frankenstein), no matter how controversial he was an actor in this film is inconclusive. Imperfection that gives off this big-screen adaptation of the story of the little Frankenstein moves us to watch over and over again, with a handsome incentive to experience the sentiment and nostalgia of the past time. This film is considered an absolute classic and I do not have anything to add.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein, the misunderstood "monster"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone today knows about the monster known as Frankenstein. But even without prior knowledge, the director, James Whale, does a magnificent job of expressing the plot line. Through use of beautiful photography, and framing shots and scenes in just the right lighting, makes this a very powerful film. The audience can understand how the people of the town feel like, and how they themselves feel. If they think the Monter's existence was a mistake or if they empathize with him. Because in a way, Frankenstein/The Monster and/or the townspeople have all been us at some point and time in our lives. There was a time for each of us where we had thoughts or did something we felt was the right thing to do or that our idea or action would be accepted in it's context, only to be met with backlash because our theories were misled due to a lack of information. Because we didn't know any better. Or simply those around us were unable to see the world from our perspective. And we have all been the townspeople, by saying that something was dead wrong and standing by that at least once in our lives. Whale catches that aspect and allows us to feel both perspectives through the use of an omniscient camera narrator. There is a scene in the film, without giving a spoiler, where the Monster does an action out of self defense. And through the framing of this shot, the Monster is clearly the victim. But when he acts, only a scream is heard and the result of his self defensive action is seen. And due to his inability to communicate, it is seen as gross and that he is a "monster". The way this film is shot does a very good job of allowing the viewer to easily take both sides and both sets of facts (omniscient fact vs. observed fact) , and comprehend both the explicit and implicit meanings with ease.</fullReview>

Boris Karloff's performance as Frankenstein was absolutely amazing. He may have looked terrible and frightening, but he really plays the role so well. You see the struggle of this monster being misunderstood. It may have been a Universal Horror work of fiction, but it had such a serious and deeper meaning, that unfortunately, we still deal with in the present. People often tend to judge other people just by the way that they look, which is exactly what the village people had done to Frankenstein. In the scene by the lake, Frankenstein didn't understand that the young girl pulling petals was not a flower herself, resulting in throwing her into the lake and ultimately killing her. He was merely following what he had seen her doing. I would watch these movies 100 times over because of how believable and amazing they truly are.</fullReview>

The acting on the part of Frankenstein's monster seemed to convey a kind of cluelessness that created a sense of empathy, even when he was causing mayhem. It seemed he didn't really know what he was doing and seemed terrified as to why he couldn't make sense of his surroundings. The doctor himself gave off a sense of lust for power, and for knowledge. He seems to have a nihilistic sort of world view where truth and facts are the only things of any importance.

		<fullReview>While this isn't the most convincing monster film I've ever seen, seeing how I'm a more modern observer. But the film has a very huge significance to not only the horror genre but movies in general. This film pushed the boundaries on the content that can be viewed in theaters and helped to spark a fascination with horror films amongst the public. With that being said overall the movie is very well filmed with some not so spectacular acting, but it didn't take away from the overall experience. Seeing how it is a horror film it is expected to have exaggerated acting and it works very well in this case. The world in the film is outrageous, people can dig up dead bodies and get away with raising the dead, it already appears to be a larger than life world so the hyperbolized acting works. The camera work and special effects in this movie is very impressive for the time. They take advantage of lighting to portray evil and fearful emotions as well as hopeful and happy emotions. It helps the viewer to get into the mind of the monster and have a deeper understanding of who he is. This film is a classic film that transcends time with it's cultural and cinematic significance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frankenstein," just its title word is enough to encompass its impact on society. "Frankenstein" created by Universal, riding high on their wave of profit from "Dracula" (1931), is one of the greats when it comes to monster movies in cinema. It shows the best intentions of man going awry due to science going too far. It steps into the realm of mans inner desire and feelings of a god complex, with unforeseen and terrifying circumstances. The photography within the movie is brilliant with dim footage and the manipulation of shadows throughout creating an overarching sense of dread, fear, and suspense. My favorite example is the night scene with the torches, that to me was truly a magnificent scene. The misunderstood monster is a character that i was rooting for but my perspective consistently shifted from supporting Dr. Frankenstein to supporting his creation. The movie is distinguished in its characters, photography, and plot and remains one of the best monster movie horrors i have ever seen.</fullReview>

The lighting and set design of the film create a great ascetic. This film also stands the test of time in its ability to shock the audience even today. However in my opinion it would all amount to nothing without the Boris Karloff who does such an excellent job as "The Monster". The ending is lackluster and leaves a bit to be desired but as I said the film does still hold up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie greatly! i believe that it was very suspenseful for the time period and the technology that was at the fingertips of these producers. it was actually quite a scary movie from the audio that was used for certain scenes to the cast of characters. Especially the man who played as Frankenstein. it is truly an American iconic horror movie. however the movie did seem short and the way the light was it did not seem that you (the viewer) could not tell weather it was daytime or nighttime which was a confusing point for me in the movie but all in all i did enjoy the movie and im exited to watch the sequel to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is all about a creation of a monster and how destructive he becomes. A doctor takes the remains of a corpse and is able to bring him back to life. Even though the doctor is successful in bringing him back to life, he isn't too successful in how to make the creature into a properly functioning human being. The audience can't help but feel horrified and bad for the creature at the same time. We feel horrified at what destruction he's done but we also feel bad because he doesn't know any better. He also didn't ask to be brought back to life and to be part of this science experiment. In the end, we ask, who is the real monster, the doctor who brought him back to life, or Frankenstein himself?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931): Dir: James Whale / Cast: Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, Dwight Frye: Frankenstein has long been presented as the creation of fear and wonder. With effective makeup effects this brutish creature is brought to life through energy and electricity through the maddening desires of Henry Frankenstein whose science aims to bring dead to life. This carries consequences once the creature breaks free and terrorizes a nearby village. Boris Karloff will be forever remembered for an effective makeup work that transforms him into a creature of brute strength. The climax in a windmill is riveting as the chase conclude and angry torch wielding villagers seek justice. Colin Clive plays Henry whose wedding is interfered with by his obsession with the reality of his creation. He will discover that controlling this creature is a whole other risk. Mae Clarke plays Henry's fiancé who cannot understand his aims, and becomes a target of the creature. Edward Van Sloan plays a medical doctor sent by Clarke to attempt to render sense to Henry, but in doing so he has a fatal encounter with the monster on a lab table. Dwight Frye plays Frankenstein's assistant Fritz, a hunchback who will be known as Igor in later versions. Remarkable achievement by director James Whale about man's desire to be God and his failure to understand God's nature. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of my all time favorite classics. I love the aspect of the monster being within each and every one of us; we just have to find something we're passion enough about to drive us to that madness. Dr. Frankenstein was a very driven man and became so obsessed with his work he stopped at nothing to achieve his goal. Although he did not handle this situation in the best way he could have, it was still a great film. He did in a way abandon his fiancé and became so immersed in his work that nothing else mattered. But creating his monster mattered to him, and I think he needed to do that for himself in order to move on with his life. Had he let his fiancé or father pull him away from his dream, he would have forever resent them. In my eyes, the monster was not really a monster. He had a child-like innocence about him, and simply didn't know better in some instances. I also absolutely love how ambiguous the ending of this film is, it adds such suspense, and also a bit of hope that the "monster" is not really gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with any book to film adaptation, Frankenstein did not follow the formula of Mary Shelley's novel exactly, but having read the book the film held a similar pattern to the events of the novel. Although nothing really came as a surprise the movie itself was very enjoyable. Boris Karloff's performance was the highlight of the film. His character had the least amount of dialogue, but his physical execution was outstanding. He really conveyed the monstrous look, but also managed to intertwine it with very human actions. The monster is truly a character to sympathize with, disregarding some of his less glamorous deeds. The lighting added a lot to the story as well, making the grittier moments more intense and the lighthearted moments brighter. A great horror film overall.</fullReview>

Karloff was excellent as the freak of nature and the rest of the cast made us believe this as well.I have seen this on the big screen and highly recommend it if you can catch it at a film festival. The suspense and horror that Karloff brought to his movies was on full display in this one. This is by far the best screen adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. The music and the story line bring you in to world that maybe you should not enter. Actually, if you like horror, walk right in! You will thank me.</fullReview>

It is truly like stepping into a time machine and going back to the 1930's. The lighting in the film is on point, with a great contrast of the really gloomy darks, to light. Although some of the dialog is cheesy, I thought the acting was quite good. Although I was never genuinely frightened, the film is very entertaining. I thought the music matched up very well, as well as the interesting sound effects. Scenes that stick out, such as re grave digging scene, are executed with perfect tastefulness.

The plot of this film is truly captivating from the dramatic creation of the monster to the angry mob terrorizing the town. The acting in this film also adds to its thrill and the roles where cast perfectly. What really sets this movie up for success is the setting the castle that this monster was created in is creepy and eerie. Also the weather and the lighting strike add to the scare factor of this film. Overall this film is captivating and just creepy enough to allow it to be a great inspiration to future films in the genre and a timeless classic.</fullReview>

This is supposed to be a horror movie? What does this movie offer us that's "horrifying"? Strangulation, drowning, and fire. We have much more creative deaths in modern horror, stuff that actually keeps you up at night scared. On top of that, a lot of times, they don't actually show any of the dying! Isn't horror supposed to scare you? I wasn't scared by this at all! I was more scared by James Cagney being a gangster than this! This movie might've been scarier to the people of the time, but for someone who's grown up with the modern era of rated R horror films, this is kinda pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good but there are a few pretty glaring problems with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my continuous watch for top of the range classics I decided to watch Frankenstein. I have a few problems with this movie. I personally felt the movie is too short running at 65 minutes... No, I don't count the few minute introduction as a warning to those that would find it too scary (and in this day and age why is it here?), As a result the movie ventures off into telling exposition when in my personal opinion showing the monster's rampage or Frankenstein's decreasing sanity at the beginning would have made this better. The other problem is the ending but I'll get to that. What's good here? I like the acting. Boris Karloff balances out the monster being both sympathetic and intimidating without a single line of dialogue and honestly there is nothing else to say, he's one of the most iconic movie monsters ever next to the Bela Lugosi Dracula. The set design is really good and I liked the cinematography at the end with the burning windmill and it does it's best to tell the story in the ridiculously short run time (I'm sorry, it's like adapting a Young Adult novel in a half hour!). But as I said the ending is what gets me. The point of the story is supposed to be that the monster is the first of his kind, which does carry though here. My problem is that the ending is supposed to be a triumphant "The Monster is dead and there's a son on the way in the house of Frankenstein"... Okay, What? I just don't think it serves the point of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein was &amp; continues to be a monster hit. It's still alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made during the American Pre-Code Days. The movie, Frankenstein directed by James Whale is one of most iconic Universal Horror movie productions ever made. I love the black and white Gothic horror romanticism atmosphere and great use of "progressive close-ups". It's one of the best-well shot, films. This is also the best-known adaptation of author Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus; which tells the story of a mad-scientist bringing a corpse back to live. While, the movie, Frankenstein is an iconic treasure piece from the 1930s &amp; a lot of things from this movie was accepted methodology and appears in virtually every Frankenstein movie ever since. This movie also tells a much loosed story version of the book. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say; I wish it, was more accuracy. First off, I didn't like, how the movie starts, with actor, Edward Van Sloan playing Dr. Walden stepping from behind a curtain and delivering a brief caution before the opening credits. It really does, hurt the in-universe illusion. Second off, I didn't like his character, Dr. Waldman. In the novel, he only appeared in one chapter, his primary purpose to spark Frankenstein's interest in science. The film, he becomes sort of a mentor to the doctor, and even, overtakes, most of the scenes from Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive). It really takes away, most of the story-arch from Victor, now known in this movie as Henry. This was sad, because Colin Clive wasn't given much, to show, by. Still, he did, his best with his limited role. As much, as I like Clive, here; I really was hoping for Bela Lugosi to play Dr. Frankenstein. I know, they wanted him as the Monster, but I really didn't see him as it. Several disastrous make-up tests, proves that, and sadly, Lugosi left the project for good. Just think, how better, it would had been if Bela Lugosi co-star with Boris Karloff as the Monster and maybe Lou Chaney Jr. as his assistant, Fritz AKA Igor. It would be awesome. Anyways, one of the biggest things, I didn't like, about the film is how the movie change, a major theme from the novel. In Shelley's book, nurture is why the monster became evil. He only wanted friends, and the world treated him horribly for his appearance. In the film, nature is why he's evil. He has the brain of a notorious ex-murderer. Honestly, I don't know, why the movie even, bother to add this, because rather than using the more-cynical, depress, intelligent monster of the book, that would make sense as a murderer. Universal Studios version presents a childlike creature (Boris Karloff), who unsure of the world, in which, he was brought in. I really hate, that you really don't see, the story-arch of the monster's learning anything. I really wish, it was in this movie, rather than the sequels. It really was, missing that sophisticated complexity. While, I do like the na?ve behavior of the creature from Karloff; still it doesn't come across as murderous, because there was no animalistic like behavior. A good example of this, was Boris Karloff's snarl, upon finding Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), Dr. Frankenstein's fiancée. It really sounds unintentionally hilarious &amp; corny. His acts of murder, looks more like accidents, than anything else. While, Jack P. Pierce's make up for the creature's physical appearance, looks scary. He wasn't that threatening. I know, the movie was made in the 1930s, when violence scene weren't gory, but couldn't they make the deaths, a little more gruesome and not slow-paced if they were going with the murderous plot-point. I also didn't like, that some people really try hard to censor, this movie. The state of Kansas, alone, requested the cutting of 32 scenes, because, how blasphemous, they felt the movie was. However, two most requested scenes to be censored, were the scene in which the monster throws the little girl into the lake and accidentally drowns &amp; the scene, where Henry admitted, how God must have, felt, when he create life. Upon its original 1931 release, some states cut the scene, right up to, as the Creature is reaching for the girl &amp; muted the line, in which Henry spoke. This made the implications of the two scene much worse. Thank Goodness, those scenes were, later restored in later versions. One thing, that I really didn't like the movie, is the lack of score. It would have, add some much, to the creepy factor. I also didn't like the movie, adding the force happy ending. It really take away, from the powerful North Pole ending, in the book about compassion and forgiveness. However, the movie still has a lot of great themes, worthy to try to dissect, such as dangers of science and knowledge. Others, see the movie as a great discussion about life, consciousness, and the reason of existence. Whatever, they see, the movie is very memorable. Frankly, I'm shocked, how still, well-known, this movie is. The movie is so unforgettable, that, in 1991, the Library of Congress selected Frankenstein for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." Overall: This is a striking achievement in horror. A great watch. A must-have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome. Its old and black and white but this is some good stuff. Frankenstein (1931) was directed by James Whale and stars Colin Cline as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. Colin Clives performance as Henry Frankenstein was awesome. He was insane! I never saw this movie until recently and i must say it was probably one of my more favorite movies now. It wasn't realistic or anything and Ill admit i did not think i was going to like it as much as i did. First of all it was a good length of a movie i thought, It wasn't long at all but it also wasn't too short. Until recently i didn t think black and white movies were fun to watch. Ill admit that over the past few weeks I've come to respect the black and white movies. Certain movies I've realized need to be in black and white and this is one of them i feel. What i mean by that is, that the way this movie looks in black and white is perfect for the story. Its a dark and scary tale and the whole look of the image including its shadows and lighting with the black white picture makes it kind of spooky. This movie was a huge part in horror movies history and i am very glad i got to experience watching this movie and i recommend it to anyone. Like i said before i didn't think too much about it until i saw it and it allowed me to see movies differently. I am pretty happy that i saw this film, it changed my whole point of view in a good way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bland movie that can't live up to expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that is suppose to be one of the first original monster movies, James Whale's Frankenstein fails to establish itself as that. When we think of Frankenstein, what instantly comes to mind is the iconic monster that is a result of Dr.Frankenstein's mad experiments. However, the monster just seems to end up as a background character who only gets more screen time towards the end of the movie. The main cast doesn't seem as motivated in the film and are out shined by Collin Clive's performance. Later on in the film when the monster is being chased by the townspeople and is then burned alive in the windmill the film seems to just end there. There isn't any sense of closure between any of the characters and it only leaves you with more questions. Even though there are iconic moments that will always be remembered from the movie these moments are simply not enough to hold up the rest of the film.</fullReview>

The monster in this film might have been inherently bad because of the criminals brain that he was made with, but we don't know if the murders he committed was because he was just misunderstood. From the very beginning of the monsters life, he was abused by Fritz, Frankenstein's assistant. Threatened with fire which was the down fall of him by the end. It was also made quite obvious that he did not intend to hurt the playing little girl which made the hunt begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic first movie of Frankenstein's monster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the original film version of Mary Shelley's classic novel about the Dr. Frankenstein and his monstrous creation that came to life. It was a fast-paced, to-the-point movie with an eerie atmosphere and a dark, mysterious cinematography, especially the screen capture of the Dr. Frankenstein's foreboding castle. Boris Karloff gave a very creepy and frighten portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster - his crackling growl, towering height and droopy eyes represented that of a true monster-coming-to-life. He was indeed the highlight of the movie, along with the troubled Dr. Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive. Much of the acting was great and brought on more emotion than those in "Dracula," but much of the plot rushed through, living little for character development and suspense. Still, the movie is definitely a classic of its own and is among one of the most iconic horror/monster films every made. Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people think that Frankenstein is the monster but in fact it is not. Frankenstein is the doctor that attempts to create life from the dead. His creation backfires when the monster becomes extremely violent. Henry Frankenstein was so completely obsessed with creating life from death that he never put his family or loved one first. I found that the storyline was very forward and the film seemed to go by very fast. There were many moving and important scenes in this movie. The monster stops his violent tears for a moment and plays with a little girl. He becomes enraged when they run out of flowers to throw in the water so he throws the little girl to find she didn't know how to swim and she died. The monster became enraged again and continued his rampage. I found the variety sets very good at the time. The scene where the monster is killed in the windmill was a great scene, between the set and the point when the monster and doctor Frankenstein lock eyes, it seems as if the doctor actually had control over the monster.</fullReview>

Never once does the viewer stop feeling the creepy vibe. Just the site of the tower makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Throughout nearly the entire film this continues save for a few moments. And those few out of place moments make a difference. On occasion there are awkward joke scenes thrown in, usually regarding Henry's father, that feel out of place. And the final climactic scene's impact is tragically tarnished by the brief lame wine drinking joke that follows it. This movie is very nearly perfect but you have to forgive its clumsy comic relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On many levels, I would call this movie grand. Between the talent level of the actors, the interesting and varied sets, and the questions posed by the story itself, the movie operates on a larger scale than one might expect based on the production value(adjusted or otherwise).Colin Clive, for example, plays Dr. Frankenstein. Frankenstein is a man enthralled with the idea of creating life, without giving much (if any) thought to the consequences of such an action. Clive brings a dimension to this character that makes him hard to dislike. This manic, obsessive character complements Karloff's stoic, tortured monster in a way that strikes the audience, prompting thoughts of philosophical questions about consequences and "playing god." While the sets were not always perfect (today's standards aside), there was a lot to work with. There was a lot of movement in the movie, indoors and out, especially within Dr. Frankenstein's cramped laboratory. This set in particular was manipulated in such a way through clever camera-work to keep every shot within the small space fresh.The timeless questions and themes, cinematography and consistently excellent acting have helped Frankenstein age extremely well. This movie remains relevant today, and certainly will for many years to come.</fullReview>

It's story is well done and different from typical monster movies. The monster itself, made from parts of multiple corpses, is still recognized for its awkward motions and scary, deep tone grunts. This was not the norm of the time. the idea is still used today, and references are made to it in many different contexts. The famous line, "It's alive" is still heard today, though more used as a joke. Like I said, Frankenstein has made a huge impact on the monster movie world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up, I've always found Frankenstein to be a monster and I still do. Of course, Boris Karloff isn't very scary in Frankenstein, but his acting as the monster was done quite well. I know if I was back in 1931 seeing this I'd probably be a bit scared. There were a few great shots in the film, especially while Frankenstein is looking for the monster in the home and the shot continues looking in through a doorway. I haven't seen any film from that time so far do something like that cinematography wise. It seemed innovative for the time. Some things I didn't like was that the back drop in the scenes were easily painted skies. Some of the other acting in the film was not quite there. Also, I believe with the censored version of Frankenstein would not make sense excluded the scene in which the monster meets the little girl. The mob of people would've been angry about nothing. The mob didn't know of the death of the teacher. It just doesn't make sense to me.</fullReview>

Give the monster a chance at life, or kill it before it can do harm (meaning before it escaped). Would it be wrong to give something like this life? That's an issue today in regards to human cloning, in a way. Something else of note is the way the crowd became a mob who simply wanted the monster to die, at any cost. Of course that was really the only option they had at that point, but the way they became a mindless mob out for blood was wrong. They were panicky and scared, and lashed out without proper thought. When you think about it, the monster was no worse than an untreated, mentally ill person.</fullReview>

In today's horror movies, you can expect to jump out of your skin and check if there is someone behind you for at least a week. This particular movie was horrifying in a different way. Dr. Frankenstein created something that he had always dreamed of, but it ended up coming back to haunt him when he realized he made a mistake and went back home to marry his love. The monster tries to be good in the scene with the little girl, but he realizes that there is no chance of him ever being good because he is the monster he was created to be. This movie was very well created with the lack of music and the lighting. Both of these complimented the horror the movie was trying to convey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say going into this movie and being told that its a horror movie always detours me from even considering watching these types of movies. But I absolutely loved this movie I didn't exactly find it scary but it definitely was way more violent than I ever would have thought. I did like at the beginning that they would tell you the actor who played the monster. And I did like how the narrator in the beginning gave you a little speech about how scary the movie was going to be. Boris Karloff as the monster was perfect casting he's big he's scary and looks the part perfectly. The movie ran at a perfect amount of time for my taste not to long not to short. Awesome movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is the epitome of first generation horror. Movies made to scare the audience during this time period was not filled with the blood and guts of today. The most horrific part of the flick was perhaps one that was omitted for a time. The monster comes out of the woods and begins to play with a little girl. Upset that their game of throwing flowers is over because there is none left to be thrown, the monster unknowingly throws the girl in the water where she subsequently drowns. The lack of gore was refreshing however. Director James Whale did a great job of setting the tone of the movie. I was impressed by the sets. The mill was believable at this time period given the lack or technology. I would have liked to see a little more detail shown towards Dr. Frankenstein. It seemed pretty odd that the film didn't mention towards the end that it was he who set the town up for terror, although not his intentions. Maybe that was Whale's intention for the plot to be left open for sequels. I will have to see the second installment, The Bride of Frankenstein, to have a better understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a classic but there were a lot of things about it that weren't too impressive. The acting was well done. The scientist really nailed the part of being absorbed into his work and crazed. The lighting, on the other hand, was only mediocre. It was really only a black movie. there weren't much "white" parts in it. It actually got very hard to see several times. Although, the dark did help in some scenes. It did give more of an eerie tone to the scene.There were some impressive camera shots, though. Especially in one scene when he lifts the monster up in the storm and the camera looks directly up and you can see the lighting come down straight to the monster. The plot wasn't very deep.It started out good but kind of just trailed off with little conclusion or ending. If there were scenes with hidden messages they were incredibly hard to pick up on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first classic Universal monster/horror film I have seen, I have to say Frankenstein was not the least bit scary and the opening warning was a tad comical with that in consideration. Nevertheless, following the warning, from the very beginning of the actual film I found myself heavily invested in the story and characters. The film might not have been scary, but the development of the characters and the acting made them seem to be more realistic and have more depth than most characters in most current horror films. This is especially true of Frankenstein's monster which is ironic seeing as he has no actual dialogue. Another thing that caught my attention was the lighting in this movie. It was a very dark movie and I thought the way light was used kind of highlighted and set a more ominous atmosphere and gave it a really cool effect. I think what really stood out most for me about this movie though was the fact that often the people were more frightening and violent than the actual monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must Watch for Any Horror Enthusiast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most influential not only horror, but movies in general of all time, Frankenstein is a classic. The influence this movie has in pop culture is incredible, everyone knows at least to some extent the story of Frankenstein's Monster. But does it deserve its status as a classic? Does the movie hold up to today's standards?For the most part, yes, I do believe Frankenstein is an excellent movie for several reasons. First, the cinematography is amazing, even by today's standards. Thanks to it, the movie has a dark, Gothic atmosphere that is constant during the film. Second, the acting. Boris Karloff in an iconic performance as the Monster and Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein is great, as well. This movie had so many original ideas, like the mad scientist, the angry mob.I do think the movie is flawed in a way that they never explain a few things. Like why is Frankenstein so strong, yet walks like he feels weak? The movie has aged very well, except in maybe a few scenes. The biggest flaw of the movie is the ending. The movie simply ends so abruptly, you get no sense of closure. The movie is an hour and ten minutes long, so maybe it should have been a bit longer just to get the ending right.But I loved so many things about this movie and the thing I love the most is the fact that it makes you question yourself several times during the film and after it ended. Is the Monster good or evil? Is it not the Creator who is evil, instead of the Creature? Is it not cruel to chain the monster in a dungeon? How would you react if they did that to you? What are the consequences to playing God? I love it when a movie makes you think and Frankenstein is certainly a film that does that. I also found it very impressive that they use no music at all during the movie, except in the opening titles and credits, which is a tough feat to pull off, but they did it.Frankenstein is an excellent film. It is an iconic classic about the nature of life itself, it makes you think and, if you think hard enough, it is a film with a powerful message.</fullReview>

Along with her friend Victor Moritz and Henry's mentor Dr. Waldman, they witness the creation of the monster. The monster kills Fritz who was tormenting him with a torch. Frankenstein and Waldman manage to sedate the monster. While Frankenstein is away to marry Elizabeth, the monster wakes up and kills Waldman. He escapes and accidentally kills little Maria. Maria's father riles up a mob to hunt down the monster.This is a classic monster horror. The acting is functional with the exception of Boris Karloff. He creates a monster that is copied and parodied to infinity. The mob is scary and the windmill is a great set piece. It all comes down to the monster and the movie jumps off the screen when he's there. He's a magnetic presence.</fullReview>

Repulsed and ashamed by what he has done, Frankenstein leaves his lab to be married, only for the monster, terrified and confused, to escape and head into town.Lugosi's withdrawal from the picture was a true blessing, as Karloff's stirring physical performance really drives home the film's themes. The monster at first seems to be searching for a father, or someone to guide him, and he reaches up into the light of the sky in wonder. It's only once he is abused by Fritz that he becomes violent, and obviously scared. Colin Clive is also very good, depicting Frankenstein as a man driven mad by desire and knowledge, only to feel genuine remorse and guilt over his actions. The film has been so influential that Whale's take on Frankenstein has almost become canon, with almost every adaptation that followed relatively ignoring Shelley's text completely.

		<fullReview>Best lines in the movie belong to Colin Clive, as Henry Frankenstein, after he creates the monster. "It's ALIVE! Oh, it's alive! Get beck -- get BECK!" I've never felt so good in my life as Henry Frankenstein feels at that moment, not even after a foot massage in an Egyptian health café.Unfortunately, Henry has stepped on the toes of God or the gods, and created life, a procedure to which the gods have the franchise. Well, it was to be expected. The novel was written by Percy Shelley's girl friend, Mary Wolstonecraft, in 1816 and the air was filled with electricity, so to speak. Science was beginning to challenge religion along a broad front, culminating in 1859 with the publication of Darwin's "Origin of Species." The idea was beginning to take hold that science could do anything. The notion, of course, is incomplete. Even today, almost two hundred years later, there are events that no scientist has ever been able adequately to explain. Why are cats fascinated by flushing toilets? If the universe is expanding, what the hell is it expanding INTO? Why is it that every time I put my T shirts in the dryer they come back inside out? Why is hail always the size of something else?Fritz, the hunchbacked dwarf, who was never in the novel, really screws Frankenstein's experiment up when he drops the "normal" brain and substitutes an "abnormal" brain. I liked Mel Brooks' take on this incident, when the dwarf is later asked which brain he took, and the dwarf answers, "A normal brain. Belonged to somebody called A. B. Normal." Fritz muddied up the story too, because the point is made that the monster is not so abnormal after all. If a little girl treats him politely and asks him to join her in throwing flowers into the lake, the creature whimpers like a puppy. Who know? If he'd been treated with more respect instead of being teased with flaming torches, he might have become a philosopher or a champion polo player.Karloff gets to snarl but not speak, and his monster doesn't merely shuffle around either. It moves quickly when it has to, and even darts from place to place. In one shot -- and I don't know how they pulled this off -- the monster leans forward until his center of gravity is a few inches in front of the tips of his shoes. He's at an acute angle from the perpendicular but he's still upright. They may have nailed his shoes to the floor.I suppose it's a happy ending since Henry Frankenstein gets to marry his girl friend, although they don't show any signs of loving each other. But there have been a number of deaths, including the little girl whom the monster mistakenly throws into the lake. Possibly Henry can break out his Van de Graaff generators and bring her back to life.The movie is short and it's really a cultural icon, so you should see it. If you don't you'll miss a lot of jokes on TV shows, and you'll get all mixed up and start calling the monster "Frankenstein", a mistake so gauche that it will enable you to clear a room without using a gun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I have watched the original Frankenstein movie was a long time ago and on a revisit I only remembered a few things. The one I did remember was the one where the monster interacted with the little girl ending in tragedy. On a revisit it is still the most gripping scene of the movie. The movie is short and moves fast, starts immediately with Frankenstein junior collecting body parts to create his "monster" together with the usual humpback helper. You really want to have sympathy for the monster but the movie does not give me enough time for that. Also the other characters really do not get much depth including Henry Frankenstein. Anyway for a first not a bad effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am generally not a monster movie fan but James Whale's "Frankenstein" is the first of this genre and not to be missed. The special effects and cinematography alone are worth the viewing time not to mention one very famous line, "It's Alive!". The story of the German doctor intent on creating life from dead body parts is one that most of us are familiar with but the back-story involving Dr. Frankenstein's father and the doctor's fiancé plays an intricate role in the decisions of the fine doctor and it's thrilling conclusion. Boris Karloff as the monster did an outstanding job as did the mean and insensitive assistant Fritz. The sets and costumes were also outstanding. "Frankenstein" set the bar high and as we've seen since this movie premiered the monster movie isn't going anywhere and will continue to bring people into the theater.</fullReview>

The filming was also done beautifully.The shot selection and editing are very well done. The sets were absolutely stunning, and they made the film watchable. Beyond this, the execution is bleak. The acting is often corny, and the characters are inconsistent. Dr. Frankenstein goes from not caring about anything but his work, to not caring about it at all.

		<shortDescription>Analysis of Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein by James Whale was a great movie in many ways but wasn't really a horror movie. It's not like the horror movies today but it was still a good one. Dr. Frankenstein was so determined to create Frankenstein from human body parts. All of his faith in the monster was because he thought his wife believed in him. Once the monster became alive, he knew the monster would be no good. He started losing his faith slowly as the movie went on. James Whale did a good job of setting the mood for the movie because of the beginning with the background in the cemetery. The sky was gray and black and made look like a dark dreary day. Also two men sneaking around to dig a grave just makes it creepy. From there you could tell it was a dark movie. Everything else like the castle was the same way to. The castle seemed old and just didn't fit in but made it very creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Universal Studio's Frankenstein directed by James Whale is an excellent black and white movie from the 1930s. Frankenstein is a very gloomy movie and one thing in particular that produces this sense of "gloom" are the sets. In my opinion, the sets in this film are incredibly designed for the time period and engulf the viewer in the surreal world that is Frankenstein. Another thing about this movie that makes it stand out is the acting of Boris Karloff. Karloff creates a very horrifying yet innocent monster and without him Frankenstein would not be the classic that it has become today. Overall, Frankenstein is a classic movie of a classic tale and I personally loved it and would recommend to anyone who enjoys old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein, paving the way for generations of horror films to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein, directed by James Whale is a movie that would be talked about and reinvented for generations to come. Watching the classic film is so incredibly interesting because almost everyone knows the story of Frankenstein. Being able to see the first film and how it started out is so fascinating. The concept of scary movies had only just begun in this era as companies began to form around the idea of making a movie. The movie portrays a character such as the monster as a misunderstood man who is unable to express what he really means. His groans and sluggish movements really help to create the sense of "creepiness." This movie was able to shape the way scary movies would be carried out. There was no soundtrack to this movie which is odd in and of itself. Most people believe that a soundtrack to a horror movie helps build suspense and create tension. The effects in this movie that made it as creepy as it could be would be the monsters grunts and groans as he moved throughout the castle and town. Although some parts were so corny, almost laughable, this film was another one that was ahead of its time and would pave the way for more horror films to come.</fullReview>

Piecing together pieces of bodies that have been laid to rest, he creates new life through the use of electricity with the help of his assistant Fritz. When Frankenstein's creation is dubbed a "monster" he gives up on his creation to tend to his soon to be wife. It is not long before Dr. Frankenstein's monster breaks free from the lab in which he was created, we find the creature seeking a connection with the world around him, although due to lack of reason, its good intentions turn barbaric. Now on the day of his wedding Dr. Frankenstein is forced to confront his creation and bring an end to the life in which he created. This story remains relevant because it confronts the issue how quickly we are to judge that which we do not understand.</fullReview>

After a lot of hard work it finally came alive and even though it meant well it created a a lot of harm. Henry spent so much time on this project that he didn't really focus on his wedding. But that backfired because towards the end he focused on his wedding more instead of the monster that he created. Towards the end of the movie Henry tries to solve his problem and stop the harm that the monster that he created was making.

		<fullReview>I understand now why the movie Frankenstein is so well known and talked about often, it was excellent! It started off with a spooky vibe right away when the main character Henry Frankenstein and his assistance Fritz were hiding in the graveyard waiting for everyone to leave so they could go and dig up the dead body so they could take parts from it to put together and build their own person in their laboratory. Their laboratory was very freaky and it was even pouring and there was lightening the night that his creation finally came to life with contributed to the scariness of the moment. However, Frankenstein's fiancé worried about him and his sanity so she brought her friend and Frankenstein's old professor to his laboratory to try and help him and see what was going on. They came the night Frankenstein's creation came to life and saw what he was working on for all that time. The monster was very freaky looking with a scar on his face, a nail in his head, and he was very tall with huge feet. The monster's hand moved and he was alive! They thought he was innocent in the beginning but they soon found out he wasn't when he strangled Fritz because he was scaring the monster with a torch. They kept the monster locked up and Frankenstein and his professor decided that it was best that they killed the monster because he was too dangerous. They put a needle into the monster with some kind of drug in it and the monster collapsed. They thought it was dead so Frankenstein returned home to his normal life and prepared for his wedding while his professor stayed at the laboratory to make sure the monster was actually dead. The monster ended up coming back to life and killed the professor! The monster then headed to town but along the way he killed a little girl by throwing her in the water and she drowned. When Frankenstein finally heard that the professor was dead it was too late, the monster was already in his house and hurt his fiancé. The monster then ran away and when Frankenstein found out that he killed the little girl too, the whole town decided they had to find the monster and kill him once and for all. They split into groups and went out to kill the monster. Frankenstein eventually found the monster in the mountains and the monster took him and climbed to the top of a windmill where he threw Frankenstein off the edge. When the other men found him, they burned down the mill with the monster in it to destroy him. They then returned home happy that the monster was finally gone. This movie was great, I liked how it was kind of spooky and it had a great plot. You never knew what was going to happen and I love when movies are like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Frankenstein" directed by James Whale was significant for a number of reasons. This film was one of the first movies about monsters to be released and was immediately loved by the public. Today, monster movies are popular as ever and earlier movies such as this one really got the ball rolling. The monster is played by Boris Karloff and he did a fantastic job playing his role. Although the monster is unknowledgeable to what he is doing and innocent in a way, he does horrifying things which trigger the people of the town to quickly turn on him. One of the only things I didn't like about the movie in general is the inconsistency in the character of Henry Frankenstein played by Colin Clive. Originally, Frankenstein was a mad scientist who isolated the outside world and was delusional. As the movie progressed, he completely transformed into a family man who seemed to vow to never put his work before his bride. For me personally, I don't typically enjoy when a character changes personalities which are polar opposites. Other than this, I thought this film was great. This movie helped started the popular trend of monster/horror movies and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein lives and dies with the monster and like the monster, this film is more dead than alive. The disjointed nature of Frankenstein cannot go ignored. Credit must be given to Frankenstein for helping define the monster movie genre, but it did so based purely on the gimmick and not due to the quality of the film. The star of the show is indeed Frankenstein's monster however he is absent from much of the film. In addition, Frankenstein himself goes from engrossing to lifeless without logic. This transition leaves the viewer without an engaging point of focus. By the end of the film we're left with a secondary plot unresolved and a promising premise underwhelmed. Overall, Frankenstein is satisfactory. It showed the world what was possible with monster movies...and frankly, that was all we needed to become hooked.Read my complete review (w/ possible spoilers) at CD1083.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein tells the story of Henry Frankenstein, a scientist obsessed with bringing a human being back to life with the forces of electricity. Deep in his studies the scientist is able to successfully resurrect the man he created, leading him to believe that has some kind of God complex. When Frankenstein fails to control his new creation (monster) he escapes his custody killing people in the town. The film ends in the monsters inevitable death when he is chased to the top of a windmill which is burned to the ground with him inside. Im embarrassed to say that I have never seen this movie until now. I was honestly expecting a little bit more in terms of consistency especially with Dr. Frankenstein's character; going from obsessed doctor who had full faith in his abilities in his monster and his ability to play God, gives up very quickly and decided to re-devote himself to his wife to be and not his life's work. Over all the movie was rather contradicting, including the anger of the townspeople directed at Frankensteins monster and not Frankenstein himself. The end of the film left many questions unanswered and over all inconclusive. Even so, the movie did have some nice elements such as a lighting and references. One scene that stood out to me was when Dr. Frankenstein was demonstrating the monsters knowledge by revealing light from the ceiling. The monster extended both arms upward reaching for the light, tying back in the earlier referenced to God and the heavens.</fullReview>

Although some may not agree, the true beauty is found in the underlying message of the film and the way the cinematography uncovers said memorandum. The film tackles a really tough topic during the time of 1931, equality, and the misunderstanding orbiting the unknown territory it inhabits. Is the "monster" that Dr. Frankenstein spawns truly the definition of the word, a moral defector, or is he a compassionate being that is able to deter from right and wrong and experience emotional sensibilities? Surely one may take what they can from the content surrounding "the monster," or they can extrapolate his true intentions by his interactions with the living the environment in which they coexist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iv actually never seen the Frankenstein movie until now. iv always herd about it, seen a few knock of clips and stuff but never actually seen one of the original movies. and with what iv seen I got to say I'm kind of disappointed. the story of Frankenstein is a story of this big monster created and has all this hatred around him his a big menace. but this movies kind of makes him seem like less than that if it makes since. he was created an pretty much just thrown away an broke loose AND THEN things went downhill from there. The story that I know of was that he was created caused a lot of trouble an all this stuff but in the film was lucky honestly, he was supposed to be killed an then that would of been the end of his story but that's not what happened. its like they didn't have enough time to really get into his character and give him a background story its kind of like, here's this monster, he does a few things, he runs he dies..the end.

		<shortDescription>Quality movie with a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein was a quality monster movie for the time of it's release and was really one of the first original horror films of its time. Boris Karloff played the monster beautifully and his character did not require lines or dialogue because his feelings were conveyed through his actions. The cinematography was strong in some aspects including the scenes where the camera seemed to follow the actor or actress. the characterization, on the other hand, left some to be desired. the main character, Henry Frankenstein, seemed to have a complete change in personality at one point in the film and that made the movie seem not well thought out. I can see why this film has become some what of a classic but i did not feel the movie was one of the best that i have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1931's Frankenstein is probably my personal favorite out of all the Classic Universal Monster Movies. Everything about it is just so on point. The solid script, the eerie atmosphere, the great performances,the well made sets and of course horror legend Boris Karloff as Farnkenestein's Monster. With that said, this movie still has some flaws. Some of it can be slowly paced and of course, the biggest complain is that it isn't accurate enough to the book. Although I never read the book, i can understand why some people might get upset about this. But yeah, as you can see, there's not much to complain about. On top of that, Frankenstein is probably one ore most iconic movies of all time. One of the most memorable and iconic/famous moments is the "It's alive!" scene, and for good reason. It's chilling, suspenseful, atmospheric all topped by an amazing performance by Colin Clive. This scene has been parodied countless times. In cartoons, movies, comics, and even a breakfast cereal! But all and all Frankenstein is a Phenomenal film worth seeing for any monster/horror fan, or hell, just your average viewer.Bottom line, go check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein was released before the Hays code came into the limelight, but was cut, edited, and re-edited many times before it was allowed in many states, and after the institution of the code some few years later. Stunning moments such as the monster mistakenly throwing the little girl into the water, and the doctor shouting "Now I know what it feels like to BE God!" were neutered from it, and that is more frightening to me than any moment within the film. Desensitization and the natural evolution of film technology and experience has made it so that the modern viewer might take old classic horrors and dismiss then at a glance, assuming they failed in their mission to horrify and awe. However, the world still watches Frankenstein not for its "scare value," but for the powerful cinematography, writing, and acting that bring it far beyond its listed horror genre. It might not have the jumpy shock of the modern horror, but it raises hairs on the nape of the neck like few other movies can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply a masterpiece of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic horror story of Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) who makes a monster (Boris Karloff) who is mad and escapes and starts killing people. This is what a good old horror film should be. It moves quickly, is wonderfully directed by James Whale, has incredible sets, some good acting, and is (for its time) pretty violent. This was released on Christmas Eve in California and supposedly the audience was in hysterics by the end. There are accounts of people fainting in the theatre or walking out in utter disgust. The monsters accidental murder of a little girl was cut out completely (it's now back in) due to an angry backlash. It's kind of funny nowadays because this movie is pretty tame stuff. Still it is scary and pretty strong at times. This film understandably made Karloff a star. He's incredible as the creature. He has no lines of course but he has to emote through tons of makeup and a terribly heavy wardrobe. He makes you feel pity for the poor creature while you're still scared about the violence he causes. Quite simply a great film in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is part of the classic Universal Monster films from the 30's and 40's and of course it is an iconic film that gave us one of the longest standing monsters in movie history: Frankenstein's monster. Thanks to Boris Karloff, he brings the Monster to life and helps propel the film to its classic status although I think the movie isn't that great compared to the other Universal Monster Films.Good: Karloff is great as the Monster as he exhibits the murderous tendencies with intimidation thanks to great makeup and of course the vulnerability he displays later in the film. Colin Clive is great as Henry Frankenstein with a right balance of crazy and sense. Frederick Kerr brings some funny comic relief as Henry's father. The movie has that classic look and it is surprisingly short.Bad: Aside from the scenes with the Monster and the beginning, the movie just meanders. When it isn't concentrating on the Monster no matter how short the scene is, the movie just meanders around. The fiancée isn't interesting at all and then it reaches the climax way too quickly. The movie would have benefited from a little more build up instead of just one quick swoop which lessens the impact of the story.Overall, it certainly deserves to be considered a classic due to its influences on the genre, but as a film, I don't consider it to be that great. Certainly good to watch, but not as good as the others in the Universal catalog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror's first real masterpiece of the sound era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Halloween Horror Reviews #10) Frankenstein is one of the most dazzling horror films of the entire 1930's. It is also one of the best films of 1931, a contender for being one of the best years in cinema history (at least in my opinion). It has aged beautifully and remains amongst the most iconic and recognisable horror films ever. So why has it withstood the test of time so much better than 'Dracula' (which came out the same year)? Firstly, the film takes full advantage of the new sound technology at its disposal. The awkward and clunky lack of a score in Dracula is replaced here by an atmospheric and grand orchestral score, which matches the action on the screen perfectly. To me, this helps to show just how ahead of the game director James Whale really was.Next, the film's acting remains strong and has only slightly aged. Boris Karloff gives the performance that would launch one of the greatest careers in horror cinema. His portrayal of the creature is as perfect as Lugosi's Dracula, utterly flawless. Dwight Fry is enjoyable once again (however I will admit that his material is lacking compared to Dracula), as is Colin Clive in one of the most underrated performances in early horror. His demented yet tortured stare and physically involved acting style is totally engrossing, grabbing the audience by the collar and not releasing for 70 minutes. The rest of the cast is strong also and generally their performances hold up stronger than the supporting performances in Dracula.The film's set design is wonderful and is defiantly one of its key draws. From the iconic lab set, as ingrained in our cultural memories as anything else in horror cinema, to the atmospheric graveyard set the film opens on. The film looks gorgeous and I will often find myself pausing the film to drink the ambiance they provide in. Unlike Dracula, the film never loses steam in this department, offering 70 whole minutes of beautiful painted backgrounds and perfectly balanced sets.Overall Frankenstein is a masterpiece. Its ending is one of the most intense sequences in early horror, and James Whales darkly witty signature permeates every layer of the film. Kenneth Branagh's embarrassment does not deserve to share a name with this slice of cinematic wonderment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like The White Zombie, this movie wasn't so much focused on the slasher -action aspect of it, but rather the plot and the emotions felt through the characters. It was impressive for it's time, especially considering the lighting effects. Which, were very well done and I liked how I was able to see everyone decently. Not too dark, not too light, which was fitting for the tone of the movie. Another interesting note was how the monster was misunderstood, but a series of unfortunate things kept occurring which lead to it's sad ending. While some scenes were slow, it was pieced together fairly, and since it did invoke quite a couple of emotions out of me, I'd say it did it's job. The horror genre we all know now is greatly different compared to the stuff from this time, so it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But I enjoy a good story for a horror film, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931) is the quintessential horror movie, full of iconic movie movements like the creation of the monster and his reveal. The mood of this movie is dark and grim. Boris Karloff is great as the monster, he makes you feel sympathetic for him as he is misunderstood and Colin Clive plays the Dr. Frankenstein a man who is heavily dedicated to the creation of the monster, with the help of his hatchback assistant Fritz. The infamous scene where Frankenstein tosses the young girl in the pond seems quite tame by today's standard, but the scene is dark and sad as we know the monster doesn't know what he's doing is wrong.Jack Pierce creates the famous Frankenstein make-up that every Frankenstein movie following tries to copy.Frankenstein (1931) helped launch the career of Boris Karloff and Turing him into a horror icon even though he was not listed in the opening credits and the role of the monster was to be played be Dracula star Bela Lugosi who declined it because the role had no lines, which he regretted after the movie release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's Frankenstein is a superb retelling of the classic novel by Mary Shelley starring Colin Clive as the man who would be God and Boris Karloff as the monster who would emerge from that folly. Jack Pierce's famous make-ups would set the standard and inspire film-makers for decades to come but no less important is the performance by Karloff beneath the mask. He mimes to life his child like monstrosity and in doing so gives one of the most important performances ever captured on film. Frankenstein; along with Dracula the year before gave birth to a wave of Universal horror films which are revered nearly 100 years after their release. Followed by the arguably superior The Bride of Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein was one of the first horror movies that I watched from the 1930's. I found it hard to stay interested in the movie, not sure if it was because I'm not interested into those kind of movies or not. Some scenes within the movie seemed out of place and didn't fit into the "horror" aspect of the movie. When people are just sitting around in living rooms talking etc, it kind of took away from what the movie was actually about. I did find that the lighting in the movie was interesting. How they used lighting to reveal Frankenstein made you feel the horror movie effect. I lighting and sound effects of the lightning and storms was interesting. I was confused because I still didn't get if the individual that invented Frankenstein if he was aware that he used an abnormal brain or not. The one part of the movie that caught my feelings was when Frankenstein was with the little girl by the water. The little girl was throwing the flowers in the water and when Frankenstein threw the little girl in the water, you felt that he didn't think it was wrong because he was just mimicking the behavior of the little girl. When the father was carrying the daughter through the village and the village people where stopping their celebrations in horror of the dead child, it made me feel the hurt the father was experiencing. The way the camera followed the father as he was walking put you in the situation with him and made you feel his pain. Over all it was an okay movie for me. The ending kept you in suspense as well not knowing if Frankenstein actually died in the fire or not.</fullReview>

Once he has assembled all the parts needed to make a whole body, he decides to use electricity from lightening to provide life to this "monster". The monster really doesn't have a name as the title of the movie is based on Dr. Frankenstein himself and the invention he's created.I thought this movie was alright. I can't say that its one of the best films I've seen. The lighting effects were good and some of the special effects were okay considering the time era. However, I think I was looking for more action being that I am so used to the traditional horror films from the 1980's to present day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie because all of the effects involved made it so much easier to stay entertained. It was constantly busy and always kept you on your toes especially when the doctor was first trying out the experiment on getting Frankenstein to come alive. Obviously that was one of the biggest events, and one of my favorites. The effects and the intensity leading up to him just moving his hand showing he was alive was enough to just keep you on the edge of your seat. That's not something I really expected from a movie this old especially because I cant find a lot of movies nowadays that make me feel like that. Towards the end though it started to lose me because I felt bad in a way because you kind of make a connection with Frankenstein even though he is a "monster" and does horrid things to people. So just seeing him being chased by crowds holding fire was kind of upsetting in a way, in my opinion.</fullReview>

I loved King Kong and all those old movies but Frankenstein wasn't for me. The cinematography in parts where really good, but the only good acting was from Frankenstein and the scientist. It was a nice experience because it's a "classic" and I've never seen it before so it was refreshing but it was too slow for me. The best scene was the ending where the building was on fire. That kept me watching the whole time, but that cannot single handedly carry the film. It also wasn't very realistic to have the scientists survive when thrown off the windmill and actually get nailed by the windmill and falls all that distant. It had me chuckling which shouldn't be my first reaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie for the first time recently, I can definitely see why this movie is considered a classic. Dr. Frankenstein worked so incredibly hard and was willing to sacrifice everything in order to recreate a person. I thought it was interesting how he put so much effort into his creation, and then once the creation comes to life, he doesn't seem to put the same amount of effort into caring for his creation. He leaves him often in the care of Fritz, who is shown in the movie hitting him and torturing him with fire. When the creation finally fights back and kills Fritz, from that point on Frankenstein considers him to be a monster and wants to have him killed. The other people in the movie that the monster murders are the doctor thats trying to kill him, and the little girl who he kills by accident. I thought the sad scene of the man carrying his dead little girl was done well in the movie. The camera follows as he's carrying her through the town, and all the townspeople go from celebrating to watching in horror and following the man. When the reach the Frankenstein house, everyone hears of the news of the monster and are ready to take action and keep the plot flowing very smoothly.</fullReview>

The director used good camera tricks to get his point across, for example always having the monster be above the view of the camera. Everyone else in the movie was filmed as a normal person would be, with normal alignment with the camera happening. When it was time for the camera to film the monster, he was treated as a different type of character. From a personal standpoint, I did not really enjoy this movie. I thought that it was slow, almost so much that it made it difficult for me to follow along with the story. The film didn't really pick up for me until the end scene where they are chasing the monster and burn the wind-mill tower that he was in.</fullReview>

Grand sets, expert cinematography and excellent acting courtesy of Boris Karloff have made this a classic monster film that has stood the test of time. Karloff helped make the character of Frankenstein's monster both imposing and sympathetic at the same time. This monster that is capable of such violent actions is also shown to have the basic emotions that make us human leading to mixed emotions regarding the character. I was also impressed by the combination of set construction and camera work that gave the illusion of grand locations such as the abandoned tower and the house of Baron Frankenstein. These locations were visually impressive, especially considering the time period in which they were produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whales, Frankenstien, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece! Its elaborate sets and magnificent lighting set the tone for an eerily dramatic story.The dialog is raw and simple making it easy for the audience to follow along. Colin Clives performance as the mad scientist, Dr. Frankenstien, is eccentric and believable without being over the top. Boris Karloff serves as a perfect monster; his slow lumbering steps and his tall stature make him seem inhuman as if he were really created in a laboratory. The sound is beautifully done with hollow, monotone sounds that echo through the abandon castle. The birth scene is particularly well done; the aesthetics of the lab equipment with the Tesla coils as well as the rain and the flashes of lightning come together to make a magnificent scene. The make-up is consistent throughout the film with little deviation from scene to scene. Overall Frankenstien is a successful film that has paved the way for horror movies to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a classic monster movie from Universal. Everything about it gives it a creepy feeling from the beginning with the imagery with dark gray skies as the backdrop and going into Frankenstein's lab which is the best set piece of the movie and shows how the monster is made. The Monster is iconic from the movies and everyone dressing up as him at least once for Halloween. Boris Karloff plays the monster great and he brings emotion to a character who doesn't talk so well and you can see it in his face and body language throughout the film. The only bad thing about this movie is the scenes without Doctor Frankenstein or The monster the other characters just seem to take up space. With that being said Frankenstein is one of my favorite monster movies and is a classic that is why it get's a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a close adaptation of Mary Shelley's book, but James Whale's film has become more culturally iconic than the book. Unlike some of the other Universal monster movies this one did not strike me as campy. It is full of old-time-y acting perhaps, but that is OK with me. Mae Clarke as Elizabeth, Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé, did a good job in the romantic lead. The character of Victor, Elizabeth's other male friend, is pretty useless hanging around except for providing a little dialog. Edward Van Sloan (Van Helsing in Dracula) as Dr. Waldman is quite dull. Frankenstein's father is an old fuddy-duddy whose English accent really seems out of place in the generic German town where this story is set. Lionel Belmore is the Burgomaster, a small part, but he will pop up again in this series. Dwight Frye, fresh off of his role in Dracula, plays Dr. Frankenstein's humpback assistant Fritz. There is no Igor in this original movie. Colin Clive shows Frankenstein in mad scientist mode and romantic mode and is much better than I expected him to be from clips I had seen. Boris Karloff has a star making turn in this classic! It is amazing the depth he is able to portray in that makeup and only through grunts.The Gothic sets and movement of the cameras are impressive. The laboratory established the look of mad scientists' lairs for decades. James Whale's feeling on the pulse of this franchise made it the best of Universal's classic monsters. Many people may think they know this movie without having seen it from start to finish, but it offers surprises to those who really look. It is still alive!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Frankenstein(1931) was a real staple horror movie. The acting was not the greatest, but it definitely did the job for a movie from the 30's and told the classic story of Frankenstein. For a black and white movie they did a great job with the effects from the lightning in the storm shocking alive the monster or the huge fire in the cabin at the end. The lighting and effects did a great job of helping this movie have a creepy eerie feel. There was a great use of light and dark contrast with the shadows in Dr. Frankenstein's lab to create this effect. This movie is truly a horror classic and one of the first original monster movies. However i felt it could have done a better maybe more elaborate job of explaining the plot. I wanted to see more of the monsters rampage through the town, Blissfully ignorant as it may have been. I wanted more of a build up of the towns peoples rage leading to that great ending. All in all this movie was a trend setter and the one of the first greats of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts off with good speed, but as you get more into the story it slows down. This is mostly because of the meeting with some of the characters. They were important because you get all the information you need to understand what's occurring throughout the film but man they dragged on. Which made it sort of a bore for me.It was interesting because you're thrown right into action in the beginning of the film and it makes you want to continue watching it but the middle drags out then you're thrown right back in when Dr. Frankenstein is ready to marry is beloved and a man's daughter is murdered accidentally and the town goes on a massive man hunt. This film seemed kind of tragic for me. I say this because of what the monster has been put through plus his inability to understand what he is doing and what he has done wrong. You feel for him but then again you don't because he has killed other people in the film. It puts you in a interesting position. You can't decide whether to feel sorry for him or to see him burn.It was great to see the use of light. At some of the "scariest" moments the scenes are shot in dark but with things are joyous its bright as can be. I also loved how the camera man followed the monster around the woods, it made the scene more thrilling and I was curios to see what would happen next. The acting was great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of the most lasting and memorable of the six 1930's horror films that put Universal on the map. Even upon seeing the enormous box office success and critical acclaim the film was able to achieve with its release I can't even imagine a single person involved in the production of the film would ever believe that Henry Frankenstein's lumbering monster would become an absolute genre behemoth, still remaining an unmistakable champion of horror to this day, nearing a century later. But Frankenstein earned the right to his remarkable place in history. Very few monsters have ever been and will ever be so creative and unique, and be able to leave such a lasting impression. Everyone knows Frankenstein. There's no denying that. But for me however, the star of the film wasn't Frankenstein's monster. The most mesmerizing and impressive aspect of the film was it's incredible camera-work. Frankenstein had an excellent atmosphere, that's undeniable, it's what made the film shine, and this was all due to an impeccably fluid camera. The camera swooped across the sets, showing off and boasting about its wonderfully spooky environments. Whenever the film would take you to a new place it made sure it gave the viewer an opportunity to take everything in, and when you have a set as unforgettable as Frankenstein's laboratory or a location as genuine as the village that would fall victim to perils brought on by Frankenstein's monster, it's just so important that you show it off, and the film never failed to do so.Despite all of the praise Frankenstein has earned, like everything else it is not without it's flaws. It has become fairly dated over the years, which is to be expected, but that doesn't help the fact that it's so darn noticeable. Also while the film is so excellent at showing off its sets, it has a tendency to get right in the face of the characters during any dialog. This does work at first to give a sense of the character's expression and the emotions they're trying to convey, but oh man does it get irritating after it flips from person to person the umpteenth time in any given conversation. And perhaps most importantly, this film's monster is just so vastly inferior to Mary Shelly's original creation. While hers was emotionally complex and much more pitiable in the novel, the film's Frankenstein monster has a certain moral ambiguity that makes it just as easy to give up on and dislike him as it is to pity and feel for him. He does much more evil than good, and it seems like his default reaction to a person is to try and strangle them. Sure he has his genuine moments of compassion that work to portray him as a misunderstood creature, but as the film neared it's end I found it too hard to stay on his side. There were numerous instances where he was intentionally violent. Sure he showed he had a tenderness when the little girl gave him some of her flowers, and the film was successful in communicating that his drowning her was completely due to his naivety, but that was the only instance that, for me, was able to convey a positive side to the monster.In the end, Frankenstein is a classic and worthy of anyone's viewership, but it doesn't have what it takes to triumph over its old age like so many other films from Hollywood's infancy. Still, I can't help but have a deep respect for a monster that makes me wonder if it will last either decades or even another century to come. I'll say it again, everyone knows Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein 1931 review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! I think that it was the director's intention for us to feel bad for/ be on the monster's side. Although, he did do terrible things it wasn't necessarily his fault because the Doctor invented this him and "gave him life" with a faulty, criminal, and abnormal brain. I do not think we should feel bad for the Doctor because he didn't care about the ramifications to his actions (putting the wrong brain in the monster). When he first found out that the brain that is in the monster once belonged to a criminal, and obviously the makeup of the brain remains the same, the Doctor kind of just blew it off. I LOVED the scene, although it was very sad, when the dad was carrying his daughter throughout the town. The scene shows the town in full enjoyment and contentment; when the camera pans over their faces (with the dad and daughter also in the shot) you see the town's people face's change from cheerful to worried and concerned. The camera angle here made the entire scene absolutely perfect! I personally thought that the end was a little bit overdone. I think that the director could have shown Frankenstein "dying" another way that would have affected the audience in a more of an emotional way. I think that this way was more awkward that sad. Overall, this movie was verrrrrrrrrrry good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Frankenstein, 1931. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is a brilliant scientist. He has been conducting research on the re-animation of lifeless bodies and their parts. He has conducted experiments on small animals and is now ready to create life in a man that he has assembled from body parts. He has been collecting from various sites such as graveyards or the village gallows. His fiancée Elizabeth and friend Victor Moritz are worried about his health as he spends far too many hours in his laboratory. He's successful and the creature he's made come to life. Henry's father, Baron Von Frankenstein, brings his son to his senses and Henry agrees that the Monster should be humanely destroyed. Before they can do so however, the Monster escapes and in its innocence, kills a little village girl. The villagers rise up intent on destroying the murdering creature for its crime.*Special Stars- Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, Boris Karloff, Lionel Belmore, Edward Van Sloan, Marilyn Harris. *Theme- Playing God is full of many serious decisions and huge mistakes. *Trivia/location/goofs- B &amp; W. LOcation: Lake scenes at Lake Sherwood, Thousand Oaks CA. Boris Karloff is considered a late bloomer in Hollywood. Frankenstein (1931) premiered when he was 44 years old. Boris Karloff was considered as such an anonymous actor by Univrsal that he was not invited to the December 6th premiere. Bela Lugosi, in rejecting the role of the monster in 'Frankenstein' (a decision he came to deeply regret) reportedly claimed the he was a star in his own country, and did not come to America "to be a scarecrow." In one scene, the Monster (Boris Karloff) walks through a forest and comes upon a little girl, Maria, who is throwing flowers into a pond. The monster joins her in the activity but soon runs out of flowers. At a loss for something to throw into the water, he looks at Maria and moves toward to her. In all American prints of the movie, the scene ends here. But as originally filmed, the action continues to show the monster grabbing Maria, hurling her into the lake, then departing in confusion when Maria fails to float as the flowers did. This bit was deleted because the censors objected to the violent end of the little girl. This scene is restored in the DVD re-issue. Boris Karloff's shoes weighed 13 pounds each. The set design of the windmill sequence was inspired by a building in Los Angeles that housed a local bakery, Van de Kamp, which displayed a large windmill as its corporate logo. At the climax, the Monster carries Dr. Frankenstein up the mountain side and through the mill. At the insistence of James Whale, Boris Karloff actually carried Colin Clive in these shots, which were filmed for hours over several days. The 41-year-old Karloff had physical difficulties due to moving in the padding, the back brace that was part of the costume, make-up and 13 pound lifted boots. He badly injured his back during these scenes (and in his 2 subsequent times playing the Monster). Permanent back problems continued to plague Karloff throughout the remainder of his life. *Emotion- Be sure to see the whole original film version. That way you get experience the huge film themes that the director and writer intended to explore. A classic film, must be seen at least once. *Based on- Mary Shelley's novel about science, grave robbers and corpses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is more than one monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein has a very interesting significance. What we see here is a man (Dr. Frankenstein) become so obsessed with his ambition to create humane life, and essentially play god, his monstrous actions result in his own actual creation of a monster. In his attempt to create a human Dr. Frankenstein is introduced at the beginning of the movie as he goes around digging up graves and taking bodies from execution sites. Using these stolen bodies he takes parts of each and creates a "man-made" man, in a literal sense. The doctor is spending so much time and become so obsessed with this project his fiancée and friend begin to worry about him. Prior to bringing the creature to life the doctor appears almost deranged. He embraces the idea that the monster has never lived because he created it despite that it is made of once living humans. The monster is then brought to life and appears seemingly gentle but unsure about its existence. As it twitches for the first time the doctor proclaims he now knows what its like to be god. After convincing the doctor agrees the monster must be killed but before it can be done it escapes. While free the monster is responsible for the death of a young girl and as a result the downs people seek to murder it. The significance we can see here is that when our ambitions are unethical and we go to unethical lengths to pursue them, the end result will be unfavorable not only to us but also everyone in our surroundings. Not only that but such an obsession as the one Dr. Frankenstein has can drive even wise men to act irrationally and not think things through. this significance is perhaps responsible for the subject matter of horror films that is still seen today. A seemingly good person looses sight of morals, rational thinking, and overall reality to pursue a goal that does more harm then good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is what I would call a damn near perfect film. Every scene is memorable. If someone asked you to give them a detailed plot of Frankenstein, you could do it. Every scene is crafted with such careful plotting and detail that you cant help but be sucked in by how well Director James Whale creates such a memorable film.Boris Karloff, do I need to introduce this man, do I?. He is a man who could be captivating spouting lines about life and death (ala The Man They Could Not Hang), but also when saying nothing at all, like when he plays the monster himself, yes the monster, not Frankenstein, the monster. Karloff gives the monster a sad humanity, the fact he just wants to be accepted is such a relatable feeling that we start to feel sympathy for this supposed monster. He isn't evil, he's misunderstood, even the killing of the young child wasn't done in cold blood, it was an accident, when he finds out he panics and runs away, like a young child who never intended to do anything wrong. Karloff is rightly remembered for his role as the monster, one of the greatest silent portrayals of a man who just wants peace, and to be left alone most of all.Colin Clive portrays Dr. Henry Frankenstein, a man who is infatuated with life, obsessed with wanting to create life from parts of the dead. Clives performance is no doubt where the mad scientist trope came from, he is very intense in everything he does, going slightly mad from trying to do something that no man has ever dreamed. He is however a very sympathetic character. His intentions are noble, trying to find the secret of eternal life, to help mankind. Of course he also wants to be respected in his field but unlike others who create monsters, he never intended to use his creation for evil. Once he sees what trying to create life has done, the monster he created and how it has affected him and his relationship with his wife, he repents from ever trying to toy with the natural order of life and death again. Clive really does rival Karloff for best performance of the film.Dwight Fry as Fritz is another performance that could rival Clive and Karloff. He's such a strange character, a character thats motives are never really clear, maybe thats why I like him so much. Dwight Fry never did get the recognition he deserved, his roles in subsequent films were whittled down to cameos, and by the time he died in 1943 I don't believe anyone really remembered him. Shame, he was easily alongside the best when it came to horror films.Overall, Frankenstein is captivating cinema. A film that is still remembered, loved and revered by people around the world, even after more than 80 years. A film that truly deserves the title of classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein (1931)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films? Count me in. A horror film about a misunderstood monster? Absolutely count me in. "Frankenstein" (1931) is the ultimate classic Hollywood horror story. Now, I'll be honest. Watching "Frankenstein" in 2014 is extremely different from what it would be like if I had watched it in 1931. Growing up in a generation of horror films where every monster is your worst nightmare because special effects crews have the ability to digitally make that happen, the monster from "Frankenstein" is nowhere near frightening. But to think back to 1931, I'm sure "Frankenstein" was one of the most horrifying films ever created.In terms of plot: Mad scientist creates monster, mad scientist realizes he made a mistake so he treats his monster like dirt, the monster has the mental equivalency to that of a small child so he doesn't understand his actions and starts throwing kids into rivers...you know, the usual.Honestly the best aspect of this film, is that it's so not scary (at least in the horror sense). Don't get me wrong, it is scary (in an emotionally "i can't believe i can relate to a classic horror film monster" kind of way) but it's not frightening in the sense that you'll end up jumping out of your seats (unless seeing people gang up on someone different than them is physically frightening to you in which case, carry on with the screaming.)Personally I like that in a modern day setting, this film is rather cheesy. It's what makes it so great. You know, the black and white color, the grunting monster, the townspeople with their pitchforks, the creaky/creepy background sounds (i.e. thunder and lightning) all of that is what makes "Frankenstein" such a classic. And not just any horror classic but THE horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Within the first few seconds of this film you know exactly what you are about to walk into, and its completely OK! Frankenstein's story conveys many emotions to the audience, but the dark settings and dynamic characters welcome you into Frankenstien's mansion with a twisted smile. The strong ties with the frame, music, and setting put the story to life in ways that leap over many boundaries other films have faced. The acting is a whole other realm to praise about! All in all fantastic acting and even better makeup art! this is one of the first real monster films made so this helps set the standard quite high for anything after. The dark and lunatic characters, and even the completely sane ones all seem to have a proper place in the plot. This story will take you by the hands and lead you along the trail of villagers to show you the true essence of a monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Impressed by it at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie in my film class, I was left disappointed by the end of the film. I am lost as to how this qualifies as a scary movie. Nothing about this film would make someone jump. In modern days this would be considered almost a high school quality film making. Even at a High School level this movie is a failure in my eyes.The over use of dim lighting made it near impossible at times to determine what was going on. The plot line was boring and very predictable with the exception of the little girl being thrown in the river. The girls death was the scariest part because it showed he did not know right from wrong and if he would kill a little girl who else knows what accidental mistakes he might make.Even with all my dislikes there is something to be said about a film that has lasted the test of time. So what redeeming qualities does this film hold? There is a scene where the girl that was killed is brought through town and the reaction can be seen on all the towns people as she passes and we can see their emotion going from happy partying to disgust and horror. This scene was brilliant and shot beautifully and is one of the most powerful and redeeming qualities in the movie. Overall I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because of its lack of detail and its overall quality of being uninteresting and bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my cup of tea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the original story by Mary Shelley, this movie, being a classic horror film, was a bit of a disappointment for me. I do understand that this is not an actual adaptation of the book, but rather an adaptation of a theater production of the story, but so much of the character development that happened in the book is missing entirely. This black and white was released shortly after Dracula and was Universal's second movie in the horror genre. The film contents themselves are not horrific by any means, perhaps it was the story itself that frightened the society of that time. Dr. Frankenstein claiming to have God's ability to create and give life to an inanimate life form made from bits and pieces of bodies that he had excavated from the cemetery. This is what frightened people and made them even protest when Frankenstein delivers the line where he compares himself to God. Even towards the climax of the film when the creature accidentally kills the little girl by drowning her is a an awful scene that took audiences by surprise by it's brutality. This was unheard of at the time, to kill an innocent in such a manner, despite the fact that the creature did not actually know any better. The film itself is well done and accurately conveys to the audience the tone of the film. The darkness and the isolation of the tower sets the ominous tone that carries out to the end of the film. Even the opening scene helps out this dark theme as it opens up with Frankenstein and his assistant waiting to dig up a freshly buried corpse. There is also no background music, aside from the beginning and end credits, that distract the audience. The lightning is so present in the beginning and up until the creation of the creature that it helps build up to the event and creates the horror of that scenario. The element of fire helps to foreshadow the end of the film and how it would all end in fire because that's the one thing that the creature fears above all else. Perhaps this is not the blood and gore horror that we have to come to expect in today's modern genre, but for the time period that this film was created in it was a novelty and the fear that it created was possibly even genuine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly a classic, but lacking in a few ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931), directed by James Whale, is a classic horror movie meant to frighten the audience with sacrilegious terrors. It's not just used for a rush of adrenaline; its deep moral keeps it from becoming a simple "blood and gore" horror flick. The film it truly made a noticeable effort to be important in its cinematic form. To start off the film, the un-burying of a corpse is already unsettling, but the twilight lighting, the forsaken crucifix in the background and the close-up of Dr. Henry Frankenstein's face bearing his wild eyes make for a very creepy beginning. Dr. Frankenstein's desperate will to play god is the driving force behind the plot, and letting the audience know both how crazy he is about his dream and how far he is willing to go to achieve it. His famous line, "It's alive, it's moving, it's alive! It's alive, it's alive, it's alive! It's ALIVE!" shows his ecstasy as he raves around the room. He has yet to realize the flaws in his creation, the least of which being his phobia of fire. Fire symbolizes The Monster's flaws, which is hinted at through the camera's slow fading of a scene until all that is visible is the burning light, before that also disappears. Examples of this are when Fritz is torturing The Monster with a waving torch, and when the angry group of villagers wave their torches down the trail to the monster. The movie is creepy overall, but a major drawback of the fundamentals of the entire film is the lack of sound. Instead of a thrilling score to sway audience members toward each emotion, the sound throughout every scene lacks depth. Unfortunately, this is a flaw that could have easily been remedied. Frankenstein's moral is indisputably clear. Dr. Henry Frankenstein, played by Colin Clive, is desperate to play god. He is a crazed doctor with a ghastly dream to fulfill: to create man. But he also somehow understands the consequences, as at the last moment before his creation, played by Boris Karloff) is woken, he falters and betrays his recognition of how real his dream is becoming (pushed to this by his fiancée, Elizabeth), and how wrong it is. His creation, however, rises from the grave (or, as he is kind of a quilt of many corpses, the graves) and although the Dr. wishes to be proud of his dream coming true, after only a little while he can no longer bear to see his monster alive. He flees to his home, and prepares to marry Elizabeth, and because of his blatant skirting of his responsibilities as The Monster's rightful killer, it goes on a murderous rampage, but only because it doesn't understand consequence (he must have learned that bit from his creator) and is angry at being not only prodded at but at being left to fend for himself. As the Dr.'s life is now in danger (his life being his loved ones and his reputation) he finally faces the monster he created, but only to let others do his dirty work and kill his dream. After the misunderstood creation dies by the only thing he really fears, the Dr. happily marries Elizabeth, recovers, and everybody raises a toast to the house of Frankenstein. Therein lies the frustration of every audience member. Seeing the injustice of the man who played god live happily ever after despite the blood on his hands is the sole cause for the dissatisfaction of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first read the comment "Young Frankenstein is incredibly close to the original" I did not really want to believe it at first. I was of course proved wrong in watching this film. Honestly compared to the others I have watched for my history of American Film class, this one is the most lack-luster. While I can believe that this movie set the stage (with other films of course) for more horror films, it also does not do anything to push the boundaries of filming itself, and the spots where the story is "streamlined" to make way for the monster itself, it leave the film with not a lot of time to really feel for any of the other characters. Which I suppose is what works for it: It's concise, get to the monster stuff. The most memorable part for me was when the monster throws the small girl into the water to help her "grow" as she was doing with the flowers. It reminds us that the monster is far more simple than we think, given point A "Flowers help pretty things grow" point B just makes sense! In all I can see why this film has withstood the test of time, it was one of the first of a genre and Boris Karloff makes it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's Frankenstein 1931 is a true masterpiece. The iconic story of a mad scientist bent on constructing human life never gets old! The film is a great example of how the movies began to mature as popular techniques were developed. The way the camera bounces around right before Dr. Frankenstein brings his monster to life builds suspense in a great way. All leading up to that famous line, "IT'S ALIVE!". Universal goes all out on this one. The creepy lighthouse, bubbling test tubes and zapping electric coils bring in the right ambiance. Also, horribly violent for its time. I have to admit I love it. They had to cut some material upon the original release. I'm happy it was saved to be restored at a later date. Creativity shouldn't be held back by some censorship agency! Frankenstein is a classic that holds its on today. The performances of Clive And Karloff can't be beat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This early horror film is a classic. Although I did not find it scary, I can see how it could be considered that in the early 30s, when there wasn't many other horror films to be created yet. I think this adds to the greatness of the film. This was one of the first horror films to be created, so to see what people once thought was terrifying, and to see where horror films once started, is cool. Colin Clive and Boris Karloff are both phenomenal actors in this film. Karloff brought the monster alive, and did so in a way where I felt sympathy for "the villain." I was a tad disappointed with the way it ended, but over all, the cinematography was fantastic, and the sound effects used really help portray it as a scary situation.</fullReview>

I think this was a futuristic movie of this time but also had lots of real life scenes. The monster was scary but compassionate and a good combination for this type of movie.

		<fullReview>I have seen this film a number of times, and it has never impressed me. Firstly, it's supposed to be a horror film. I am in no way comparing it to recent horror, but I wouldn't say this film is even slightly unsettling. Of course, I understand that it would probably have been shocking at the time it was released, but after reading a few reviews by others, apparently some still find it scary. Or at least creepy. This ties into the fact that I get no real feelings whatsoever from this film. The message deals with the dangers of playing god, and wielding power over life and death. Plus a concept that's more touched upon in the book (since the monster is educated): should the audience feel sorry for the monster, or for Frankenstein? And who is responsible for innocent deaths-- the monster for committing murder, or Frankenstein for creating him? These moral concepts are there for the viewer to empathize with and to become engaged with the characters. Yet, I have never empathized with either Frankenstein or the Monster. Not having any emotional connection to the characters, and therefore no connection to the film's moral questions, this leaves the film rather bland for me.The one aspect that makes it more bearable is the cinematography, especially the lighting. I definitely consider this movie to be very well shot, and just from an artistic perspective there are some incredibly beautiful scenes. Although most of the camera and lighting work contributes to creating a "dark and stormy night" vibe, formal qualities alone do not constitute an atmosphere of horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All around, Frankenstein was a good movie. Well made and with no real faults in filming, it's definitely earned its status as a classic. As far as a film goes, it's certainly respectable. The problem for me is that I thought it was boring. It didn't meet up to the hype, and not just the overall hype of it being "Frankenstein". In the very beginning of the film a man hyped the movie up before it even started, saying that it might even horrify those who watch it. With only one scene involving the girl, the movie was hardly horrifying, and even that scene was lackluster compared to any movie under the "Horror" genre. Five out of ten for being well made, but I wouldn't give it any more simply because it bored me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad to say that I have finally seen the classic movie Frankenstein! A movie that has inspired so many spin offs and a stepping stone for so many other films. Even though this film is considered a horror movie I wasn't frightened by it however still found it entertaining to watch and I can understand that for it's time the movie being scary to its audience. The film is a great accomplishment for its time, and I was impressed with its use of sound and the images. What really surprised me was that there was no soundtrack for the film, no music to set the tone, which meant that the film makers had to really step it up with the imagery with the film to convey emotion. And that is one thing that was extremely impressive was how beautiful the film was, something you wouldn't expect from a horror movie. Shots like the castle on the hill during the storm, or the scene with the monster and the little girl with the lake as their backdrop were really beautiful and definitely made the movie what it was. For the story line it was interesting to see how influential this movie has been for others. One theme I noticed was the selfishness of man and the misunderstanding of the creature created by man. Frankenstein is no doubt a classic and think it is a film that movie fans should take the time to watch, being that it has inspired and influenced so many other films and continue to inspire to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt this was a great film. Even though it was not exactly scary in my opinion, it still created a gloomy and tense atmosphere and featured relate-able and flawed characters. The shots of Frankenstein's mountainside castle are amazing. This structure alone adds much to the unsettling atmosphere of the film. The monster himself is also great. Although he doesn't have any true dialogue, his groans and grunts allow the viewer to sense his emotions in various scenes. In my opinion, this made the monster a more human character. The final scene of the film in which the monster is cornered into a windmill and is burned alive by the villagers is outstanding. The camera cuts between the ferocious villager outside of the structure and to frantic and helpless monster within it. This is a powerful ending to the film as the demise of the monster is shown through two different perspectives. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the horror genre, or to anyone interested in great films. "Frankenstein" truly stands out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was the first original monster movie that I have ever seen in my life. I really like the way the company (Universal Studios) put in a question mark for the role of the monster. It's a good movie that is about Henry Frankenstein and his monster. Even though there is a dark part to this, it's still likable. I really felt a little suspense in my body when I saw this. It was probably because of the monster doing some horrible things to the people in the village, including Elizabeth. The uses for sound and photography chances were really nice, including the castle on the hill with a lot of thunder booming around it.

		<fullReview>One of the chief things to keep in mind when watching this movie is the time it was made. If I didn't know that it was a scant four years into the age of sound in cinema, I don't know if I would be as impressed. That being said, it WAS made in 1931 and stands as a huge achievement in film history. I was especially impressed with the use of sound. The quiet moments, where the images were allowed to tell the story as well as the moments filled with sound, like when the townspeople are all in a panic, and the church bells can be heard ringing. The visuals are also stunning. I loved the scene where Frankenstein was creating the monster. The severity of the thunderstorm outside matching the emotions of those horrified by what Henry is doing, and Henry himself who is lost in the chaotic joy of his success. As for the story itself, it's one we all by now know in some form. All the same, I felt utter sympathy for Frankenstein's monster who was all but abandoned by his creator. It spoke of the selfishness of humanity, and our ability to completely ignore our responsibilities. Henry's insistence that he could have it all, even as the people around him protested was irritating. I felt so bad for Elizabeth, and the monster alike for being stuck with him.In the end, I'll say this was a quality movie, and one that all horror and cinema fans should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first great sound horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1931 Frankenstein will no doubt come across as primitive to today's audiences who are used to faster pacing and slick CG wizardry, but don't underestimate it. This is a film deserving of its classic status. It is arguably the most influential of all horror films, but that is not the movie's sole merit. We also have some interesting directorial choices by James Whale, great spooky atmosphere reminiscent of 1920s expressionism, and of course, Boris Karloff's beautiful performance as the monster which deserves every bit of praise it has received through the decades.That being said, there are a few shortcomings. The script has multiple plot holes and lapses in logic, and the criminal brain element is problematic. While most of the cast is marvelous, Mae Clarke and John Boles are stiff, though to their credit the roles they were saddled with give them little to do other than be concerned for Henry Frankenstein. (I'm also in the minority who prefers Clarke's Elizabeth to Valerie Hobson's in the sequel; Clarke may be subdued and even wooden at times, but she's never grating like her successor is.)Despite those issues, they are so insubstantial in the long run and some of them even add to the charm of the film. Modern film-goers probably won't like it, but if you're reading this review, it's doubtful you have such a prejudice against pre-1980s cinema anyway. If you have not seen it, then immediately do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have often heard of this movie, it's famous quotes, and seen all the influence it has had upon today's film makers. I myself had not seen it until a few days ago, and now that I have I can absolutely say that it deserves the years of praise it has been afforded. A beautiful work of cinema, at it's time a sheer masterpiece. The cinematography is edgy and progressive lending itself to the fast paced horror theme the plot line includes. While I do think it is an absolute classic, the plot lacks a little in really explaining the monster like he is articulated in the book. Boris Karloff has the perfect structure to fit the monster makeup, being that he is tall and broad-shouldered with a sharp rectangular face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's 1931 adaptation of "Frankenstein" is one of the crown jewels of Universal's legendary lineup of monster movies. Following close on the heels of "Dracula", the studio sought to repeat its earlier success and ended up eclipsing it, both financially and artistically.The story is of course based on the classic novel of the same name by Mary Shelley, though the adaptation is fairly loose. Ironically, the movie's version of the story is now more familiar to the general public than the original story.In a nutshell, that story concerns 'mad scientist' Henry Frankenstein's obsession with creating human life. He succeeds but the results are, in a word, monstrous.Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster made him an instant star (and deservedly so). Without uttering a single word of dialogue, he gave us a monster that masterfully blended both innocence and menace.Apart from Karloff, the movie also benefited from solid work by Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein. His performance could be classed as over the top but that's part of its charm. In supporting roles, "Dracula" returnees Edward Van Sloan &amp; Dwight Frye were a welcome addition.In the director's chair, James Whale shepherded the film with considerable care. What could have been a simple scare-fest instead retained some of the novel's philosophical underpinnings. As a result, Frankenstein's monster emerges as a tragic figure, not just a mindless creature. Special mention should also be made regarding Jack Pierce's makeup for the monster. The iconic look no doubt contributed greatly to Karloff successfully bringing off his performance.While "Frankenstein" may show some signs of its age it nevertheless holds up well even today. It was the first of many Frankenstein feature films and perhaps still the best. While some consider the sequel, "Bride of Frankenstein", to be superior I feel that the original represents an unmatched combination of horror, psychological insight and cinematic prowess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He is Not Born a Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The earliest scenes of "Frankenstein" are haunted by the spectres of death. The opening burial, taken place in a barren, stark graveyard, is watched over by a gruesome grim reaper statue. Colin Clive's Henry Frankenstein literally throws dirt in Death's face in this scene. Another early moment featuring Edward Von Sloan's Dr. Waldman is framed by shelves full of skulls. Fritz' robbery of the brain, his shadow cast huge on the wall, is foiled by a hanging library skeleton. The morbidity of the subject matter extends to the very structure of the film.I can't believe I never noticed the deeply expressionistic sets in this movie before. The pattern on the floor of Frankenstein's laboratory are criss-crossed at conflicting angle, putting the viewer off. The beams and walls in the tower are at askew angles, subtly evoking an otherworldly atmosphere. The Monster's prison are the sets most obviously indebted to "Caligari" and its ilk. The sole window appears in the center of a slouching triangle while the door is tightly squeezed between two encroaching walls. Even the hallways of the ancestral Frankenstein home are slightly in the same style. The film's extensive use of shadows and lightening seals it. "Frankenstein" is the extreme surreal stylings of 1920s German cinema streamlined for an American audience.Colin Clive's performance as the Doctor is sort of underrated. His more manic moments are the most famous but his quieter scenes work well too. In Mary Shelley's novel, the desire to recreate life is born out of a desire to conquer the death in his own life. In a monologue, Clive's Doctor reveals that his experiments steam from what he sees as a natural progression of man's curiosity and science. Even his softer scenes with Elizabeth have a warmest to them. Dwight Fry ultimately isn't given too much to do, due to Fritz' monosyllabic nature, but his body language still sells the character. In the final version of the film, the character of Victor doesn't serve much of a purpose. Originally there to be beside Elizabeth after Henry's demise, the revised, happier ending ultimately leaves the love triangle unresolved. It's a bit of a shame since John Boles makes the usually aggravating third wheel of the obligatory love triangle actually a pretty nice guy.The nature of Karloff's monster has been discussed endlessly. Listening to Ruby Belhmer's informative, if overly studious commentary, it's not surprising to learn that the "criminal brain" aspect of the script was a late addition. It seems to me that James Whale's intention was that the Creature was a pure innocent, totally child-like in nature. His reaction to Maria the flower girl's drowning is one of abject horror. He is not born a monster, but rather transformed into one by the cruelty and rejection of the world. His only truly malicious move is the murder of Dr. Waldman. Even the attempted abduction of Elizabeth could be explained away by a naive curiosity. In the original script, the doctor's laboratory was also the climatic windmill. In light of this, the Monster dragging Henry's limp body back there becomes a frightened, confused creature returning to the only home he's ever known with the only person to show him anything but cruelty in hand. The film is even more a tragedy then ever before.James Whale seems fond of side-way sliding dolly shots. He uses them numerous times, passing through the set's walls as if they were a stage play. Undoubtedly, the most memorable of these types of shot is Maria's father carrying her body through the village. Behind him, the celebrating faces of the villagers transform into frozen faces of terror, their songs dissolving into horrified screams. Though the sequel would make it obvious, "Frankenstein" does contain some of Whale's trademark camp humor. The elder Baron Frankenstein, fed up and disgusted with his son's antics, is the film's primarily comic relief and far more subtle then the era's usual style. The film certainly never suffers from the pacing problems "Dracula" has.Long time readers should know how much this film means to me. I could ramble on for pages. Instead, I'll cut it off here. "Frankenstein" is a great, great movie. If you haven't seen it, you've got no excuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The personification of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One look at Frankenstein's face, complete with his dead eyes, hideous skin, and bolts protruding on opposite signs of his head and you have seen the very personification of horror. After the release of Dracula sparked critical and audience acclaim, Universal had to act fast to assure even longer viability in the slumping U.S. economy. Their knee-jerk reaction to the success of the aforementioned feature led to the creation of James Whale's Frankenstein, a tremendous horror film that functions more like a carefully-pieced together, highly detailed drama that does the impossible - humanize a monster.The film stars Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein, a young scientist who works with his hunchback assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) to create a man out the parts of that have been collected over time. Frankenstein's ultimate goal is to create a human and give him a sustainable life using a variety of electrical devices.And thus, he creates a revolting monster, who is portrayed by the almighty and iconic Boris Karloff (credited as "?" in the opening titles). Karloff, whose entire character relies on grunts, groans, and laborious movement, has the biggest challenge in the film and that's to make his greatly limited monster interesting with very little character traits.It is when we, the audience, realize that the monster Dr. Frankenstein has created may indeed have some humanity buried inside of him. Consider the scene when he bonds with a little girl due to her fascination that she can take small flowers and make their buds/pedals float in a body of water (she refers to the discovery as "boats"). Karloff infuses the lumbering monster with recognizable human traits such as tenderness and empathy, showing a soul exists beneath the rigid exterior.Such a film needs a strong leading man (or monster in this case) in addition to direction that caters to the film in a way that adds rather than basks in ordinariness. Seeing that Whale's scenes are never without significant detail and never conducted ridiculously, the latter trait is met. In addition, Karloff's memorable performance works on a terrific level adding to the film's tonal eeriness.The 1931 adaption of Frankenstein undoubtedly deserves its place among the classic monster films as it's hard to get more iconic than the Mary Shelley character. Its material may be compelling, but its message that humans should never attempt to play or act as God is one of the strongest takeaway points in any monster films I've ever seen.Starring: Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, and Dwight Frye. Directed by: James Whale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff's Signature Role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale directed this loose but landmark adaptation of Mary Shelly's novel. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein, a driven and obsessed surgeon who digs up graves of the recently deceased in order to build his own living being. Dwight Frye plays his loyal assistant Fritz, Mae Clarke his concerned fiancée Elizabeth, John Boles his concerned friend Victor, Frederick Kerr his ailing but stubborn Baron father. It is Boris Karloff who delivers an Academy Award worthy performance as the creature, playing him with such sympathy and humanity despite his horrid appearance, that it is remarkable. His desperate gestures yet frustrated rage is unforgettable, as are many classic lines and the fiery windmill climax. Only negative is that it is sometimes creaky, and the "wrap up" in the castle incongruous, but otherwise this holds up superbly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now I know what if feels like to be God."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Newbies, there were two Scenes that were considered inappropriate and were Censored, initially, thankfully survived and Restored. The first, when Colin Clive's Creation came to Life, He, in a rush of Madness, blurts out..."Now I know what it feels like to be God". Originally Thunderclaps drowned out that Blasphemy. The second Scene, when the Monster is with the Little Girl and She shows Him her Flower Boats that float, when He no longer has any flowers, He picks Her up and tosses Her in the water so She too will Float. Originally, the Movie cuts the Scene just before that, and the resulting Death is implied.This is a Wonderful Gothic Film that was, with its Companion Piece, Dracula (1931), Seminal and Influential in the Genre and to this Day Iconic, both are Indelible Images in Popular Culture. James Whale only made one Better Movie and that was the Sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935) that is a Perfect Picture. The Director also made the Great Film, The Invisible Man (1933) and although that is Fantastic, His two Frankenstein Movies are better.It is Intelligent and at times the Subtlety is Clever. There is a look of utter Despair and Guilt on the Dr.'s Face when His Father, in a Wedding Toast, wishes that His Son will give Him another Generation to carry on the Family Tradition. Henry Frankenstein knows that He has already done that, Illegitimately. Karloff is Sympathetic, Terrifying, and speaks to the Audience with a Portrayal of a Frightened Newborn with Looks and Gestures that are Eerie and Unforgettable.The Cast is Marvelous and its Expressionistic Sets are Impressive. The Story, is of course, Classic for a reason with its enduring Themes the least of which is Man Dabbling in the Depths with the Devil trying to attain the Lofty Heights of "The" Creator.</fullReview>

Clive plays mad scientist, Henry Frankenstein who is determined to re-animate life. He succeeds with his monstrous creation (Karloff) who soon leaves his lab and roams around town learning about love and fear. Clarke plays Henry's girlfriend, Elizabeth, Frye plays Henry's deformed assistant, Fritz and Van Sloan plays Dr. Waldman. Karloff was creepy as the monster and will always be the definitive version in my opinion. Clive was also great as Henry and who can forget his "He's Alive!" quote. Frye and Van Sloan were also good and both featured in "Dracula" the same year. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most influential horror films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to forget that this adaption of the famous Mary Shelley novel was made 113 years after the book was written. It's such an old movie that it's surprising to think that even now in 2013 we are still a lot closer in time to the movie than the movie was to the book when released. It's partially because Frankenstein is a film that seems so old because it created so many of the rules and iconography of the horror genre. It was in fact one of the first sound horror films as well. So much has been already said about it that there isn't a lot more to add. But needless to say it's a film that will always be appreciated and loved.It also made the character actor Boris Karloff into a horror icon. Up until that point, he had starred in many films but it was only here where he became a superstar. His performance is rightly well regarded; he brings so much pathos to the character of The Monster. Director James Whale has to be given a lot of credit here too because he was responsible for the way that the material was presented. In other hands the creature would have been a homicidal killer and no more but here he is a character to sympathise with. The Monster was similar to the later King Kong in that he was both villain but mostly victim. The film is wildly different to Shelley's novel. It had to be really because the book is a very densely written text full of melodrama and poetic prose. It's very exaggerated and unrealistic and needed a different angle in order to work cinematically. Whale achieved this with some success by underpinning the narrative with a very human story. He is also helped considerably by great set design and expressionistic lighting. The latter showed the definite influence of the silent German horror classics such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu. Along with Dracula, which was also released the same year, Frankenstein launched the Universal horror cycle and set the scene for the early 30's horror boom.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, Frankenstein was not totally aware of the responsibility he was creating in doing so. The Monster does not interact like humans do and is unaware of his own strength. When he becomes scared he defends himself, leading Frankenstein to believe that The Monster he has created is dangerous. It is made clear that the monster is not intentionally dangerous when he meets a little girl by the river. He looks at flowers with her and does not try to hurt her, but ends up doing so when he picks her up. The people in the town revolt, all wanting to kill this terrible being who killed the little girl. But the people are not quite quick enough and don't manage to get to him before he kills Elizabeth, Frankenstein's fiancé on their wedding day. The film ends with a chase, but who will win?

What made Frankenstein unique from other horror movies was that it contained a certain level of pathos.

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of the most famous movie monster movies ever and although it was an O.K. movie, it left me wanting more. Perhaps because the movie is so notorious, I was expecting something super scary with many twists and turns but unfortunately it isn't very frightening and the plot is pretty straight forward. Maybe I completely missed the point and there was a much deeper meaning but the story and the characters all felt very shallow. The protagonist in the film, Dr. Henry Frankenstein, is barely even likable. I was actually rooting for the monster to win in the end because I was so unimpressed by Dr. Frankenstein's character. The acting was so-so but Boris Karloff was definitely the stand out. Even though the story could have been better there were certainly many wonderful things about this film. For one, the costume, makeup and set design are absolutely fantastic. The laboratory in the castle is extremely elaborate with many huge metal machines and lots of electric effects. The Monster makeup is great but I think they could have maybe made him a bit scarier. Overall the movie was good but I was definitely expecting something amazing.</fullReview>

What I enjoyed most?...the costumes(as always) and the make-up. The make-up used for "The monster" was so realistic. It did not take away from Karloff's features.What the make-up did do was dramatize his features. This created a more believable character. Being that this movie is black and white, I cant help but speak on the lighting. The lighting in this movie played a huge part in setting the "mood" of certain scenes. I don't want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it yet. However, pay attention to the specific scene where Frankenstein's creation is being lifted onto the roof top. The lighting in this scene is very dramatic. It's dark, chilling and extremely eerie. This is where the genius of movies comes into play. It's amazing how these effects set the tone for the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a many faceted movie. One aspect is the fascination to overcoming death. The other is the aspect of science's tendency to do whatever is possible without considering its implication. Even today, there are many scientific creations that are referred to as the Frankensein's monster. Another aspect is the monster's existence and the pain it goes through for being "alive". The movie brought forth all these aspects along with the new kind of horror that was linked with science. If you count the percentages of horror movies since Frankenstein that has scientific angle to it, it's obvious that this was a ground breaking movie. Mary Shelly called this story "The Modern Prometheus" which was a prophetic statement. Her creation Frankenstein, after a century goes to Hollywood, and becomes one of the best known movie of all times.The impact the movie had on its audience was obvious. Universal received letters saying that after seeing this movie, the sender of the letter had difficulty sleeping at night. There was a plastic model of the monster sold when I was a child, and I was horrified at the cover art of the box. It's a horror movie, so Universal succeeded in what it set out to do. It's still one of the scariest movie made.There's been many Frankenstein movies made since this one, but none has had the same impact as this which attests to its production value. It's the first, and still the best rendition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Dr. Frankenstein was more of a monster than the actual monster himself. The effects used to make Dr. Frankenstein look like a mad man where very well done. Greasy unkempt hair, dark sunken sleep deprived eyes and sharp cheek bones...he truly looked and acted deranged. In the scene where the Monster is brought to life, Colin Clives(Dr.F) acting is great. He looks like he's having some kind of attack/seizer...stiffens up and totally loses control of his body, and by the looks of his face he's losing his mind as well. The lighting and sounds added so much to this movie. The the flashing lightning and booming sounds of thunder create a great scary atmosphere. The low key lighting and different angles of lighting made for much more dramatic scenes. These old horror movies have so much more depth than modern day horror movies. Newer horror movies lack full ranges of emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film does a very good job in every scene at giving off an Erie mood when necessary and the feelings of the characters. When something bad is about to happen or things are about to get worse the lighting of the scene seem to correlate with the mood. The acting in this film is done very well, Dr. Frankenstein is brilliant in the way he portrays his madness for creation. Boris Karloff is brilliant in his role of the monster as well. There are a lot of new camera shots introduced as well that really stand out and just the way it is filmed at some points can be scary. Throughout the film you don't know if you should hate the monster or feel sorry for him. The common question of nature vs. nurture arises at many points and of the film is quite epic to day the least. It is a definant classic that set the bar for future horror films to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a man consumed with the thought of playing god, but not in the traditional sense. Frankenstein desires to create life out of death by using body parts of dead bodies and creating a patchwork human. a Truly appalling idea, but not an idea stemming from malice thought, but from curiosity and intrigue. Overall the film was enjoyable. Due to the quality of movies in this time period it is hard to be "scared" by this film, but I'm sure back in 1931 it was a frightening experience. Interestingly neither the monster or Frankenstein seem to be blamed for the actions of the monster. The film could have done a better job of showing the view of the people of the town and their knowledge of the situation. At one point near the end of the film everyone seems to accept that the monster had killed the girl and we did not know how they knew or what they knew.Overall an enjoyable film considering the time period and a film that paved the way for future monster flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!931's Frankenstein is quite an interesting film that contains both horror and comedy. It has a very important lesson where we, the living, shouldn't mess with the dead. As shown in this movie, it could have bizarre and disastrous effects. There's one shot which I found rather weird: When we first see the monster, they do a close up of his face twice, as if we didn't get all the details the first time. Why do we need to zoom in on his forehead twice? The scene where the monster plays with the girl is rather heartwarming...until he throws her into the lake. The last shot of the monster has him flailing around trapped in a burning windmill, an odd shot. We're supposed to assume he's dead. People sometimes forget that Frankenstein is the name of the doctor, not the monster. A creative film, despite some(really) quirky moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein was one of those movies where you were interested in the beginning, but as the movie went on you started to predict what would happen. The acting was great and very believable. My favorite characters were the Frankenstein and the scientists father, they provided a good balance of horror and humor. The special features were minimal yet played a crucial role in the verisimilitude. The plot again was ehhh okay, probably due to the fact that this is a much older movie and movies have copied the style and basic plot idea. This movie/book idea was of course original back when it was created. If I was from that era I probably would've enjoyed it more. The movie teaches a couple good morals, so cannot hate too much. Would I tell you to run to the computer to watch this...no. However if you're bored and want to see a classic that paved the way for almost every horror story now made, yes go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared to horror films made recently, "Frankenstein" may seem sub-par or lacking, yet for a film made in the 1930's, this horror film was very well done. The interesting thing about this film is that there is no music at all during the actual movie, just in the opening sequence. No music means that the actors have to convey their emotions even more than they normally would, because their is no music in the background to really convince viewers of their current emotions. Karloff does a wonderful job as Frankenstein's monster. Although he may not say anything throughout the entirety of the film, the way he composes himself has a viewer both angry with his actions, but at the same time a tad sympathetic, as he is not sure what to do with himself at all times. Frankenstein's monster is certainly an interesting character because he really just needs someone to help him out, instead everyone is afraid of him. All in all, this movie was very well done, although it could have used a musical score to go along with the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY Frankenstein Experience?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe because I am so into comedies and action movies, I wasn't really interested in this movie. This was the first time I've seen the original Frankenstein and I was somewhat impressed, but at the same time, bored! I liked the story-line, however. And the fact that it was a classic, and my knowledge about the history of cinema, helped ease the boredom just by so much. What I did find interesting though was the movie's SOUNDTRACK! Another thing I found really interesting was the movie score and the angle shots of the whole movie. That was highly interesting. Maybe because it was a classic, and released in the 1931, the hype (back then) was greater than it is now. But although it is a classic, now I KNOW Frankenstein is a reference for a lot of the movies I enjoy watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I really liked about this film, is just the basis of it all. How one man, Henry Frankenstein, wants to create a new life. Unfortunately he creates a bad creature. He's tormented by Frankensteins servant who isn't very pleasant. The monster becomes raged and ends up killing the man who tormented him. This really takes Henry Frankenstein back and makes him truly look at the seriousness of this situation. So him and Dr. Waldman subdue the creature and Henry heads back home for his wedding.Just up until this point alone, i really liked the story and the original concept because of the 'Horror' but yet humor still within it. The shots were well done and i didn't mind the acting that much. I just liked the story most of all. Definitely a must see as its the original and just a classic in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite black &amp; white monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While we in the 21st century are not often impressed by the effects in older movies, Frankenstein makes it easy to see why this was considered a horror film at the time. The electric effects, for both the thunderstorm and lab equipment, worked together in quite an impressive way to frighten and really emphasize Frankenstein's questionable madness. Not only that, but the fact that certain scenes were cut by individual states even pre-code goes to show that images we certainly allow on screen today were too disturbing for the audiences of the day. While I was told Bela Lugosi was originally in the running to play the Monster, I am glad it turned out to be Karloff. He was able to convey emotions through certain gestures and the occasional strong facial expression well, even while keeping the blank "risen dead" look most of the time. The use of lighting was a powerful tool in most black and white classics, and this one is no exception. While it may be an obvious trick, it works to evoke or shift the audience's emotion quite well. This is my favorite classic monster movie so far, though my repertoire is admittedly limited.</fullReview>

I did really enjoy the camera work, and the cool props used in the lab scene with the sparks flying everywhere. I liked the scene as the camera follows the man as he carries the little girl's lifeless body through the town and one by one the smiling citizens turn in horror. It was the perfect build up to the angry mob attack. Overall I was impressed at some moments, but I didn't love it as much as I hoped I could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's "Frankenstein" is today considered a seminal work of horror cinema. At the time it was released, there must have been parts that audiences found truly terrifying. Films at this time were meant to entertain, not to incite panic. The true genius of Whale's film lies in its production value, in how it conveys the story (a story that was, by 1931, already ingrained in the public's mind). Subtle yet intricate camera work accent the film's most emotional scenes. Two scenes that come to mind include a scene set in a town which includes a slow, poignant tracking shot, and the film's infamous ending sequence. I especially enjoyed how Whale used different forms of lighting, especially in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory and the outside scenes. These techniques are primarily what give the film the eerie, brooding atmosphere it is so well-known for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood horror movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a 1931 black and white horror film released by Universal Pictures. Directed by James Whale, the movie started Boris Karloff as the iconic Monster and was huge success. The movie ushered in the 'horror genre' for Universal and spawned several sequels. Following the story written by Mary Shelley, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (portrayed by Colin Clive) is a young scientist obsessed with discovering the secrets to creating life. Shunning his fiancée for his research, Dr. Frankenstein assembles a man from dead body and reanimates the creature. Upon success, Dr. Frankenstein now faces an ethical dilemma ? what are his responsibilities and obligations for this being? Unfortunately for the Doctor, both the monster and his live will remain entwined for the reminder of the story. James Whale effectively uses lighting techniques to bring out the dramatic mood scenes within the movie. While absent of any speaking parts, Boris Karloff portrays a sympathetic creature, who struggles to understand his rebirth in the world. The running time of the movie is 71 minutes, but the movie is fast paced with a modest story line; a classic picture to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to finally be able to watch this movie. I've only ever seen remade scenarios of it in newer movies and TV shows. So I had an idea of what to expect, but I was completely wrong. It was a very different story than what I expected. It wasn't even scary, more like disturbing. At first I found the monster to be unsettling. Then for a brief second, I liked him. I thought that he was charming after all. But then that very quickly changed. I know this is a classic, well-liked movie, so I kind of hate to say that I didn't like it... but I couldn't really get into it. The other part of the story not involving the monster was a little "bland". It was inconsistent in places. None of the characters were very likable at all. Mostly they were all annoying. Perhaps I'd like the other old monster movies, but not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based off of Mary Shelley's story this film is part of the foundation on which modern horror/monster movies are created. James Whale's adaptation of a classic horror story is decent at best. The story is too vague and I feel as if the film is too short for the viewer to become fully engaged in the message. The 1934 sequel "Bride of Frankenstein" does a better job at showing that the "Monster" is not a criminal or a evil abomination but an misinterpreted creature who was cast into a world of arrogance via experiment. Many scenes in the movie are much to dark and I thought half the acting was lousy and they were trying to hard. Nothing is elaborated on enough and many details that get left out make the viewing experience more confusing than enjoyable. I feel as if a lot more detail should have been taken from the book because it would have helped create a more seamless story. Definitely worth a watch for avid horror fans but besides that this movie is dated, dull, and dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good camera angles and content.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I thought the overall content of the movie was very good. During most of it, especially in the beginning when the setting was mostly in the laboratory, I thought the lighting was very dark and it was often hard to see. However the darkness added an eerie feeling as if one knew that it was a horror film and that there would be imminent death and danger. The camera really seemed to focus on the theme or subject of a scene; during most scenes where there was a dramatic conversation taking place the camera focused on the subjects and then zoomed in on their face when they were discussing something serious. Also during the scene on Henry and Elizabeth's wedding day where Elizabeth was confessing to Henry that she felt like something bad was going to happen the camera was angled far away and then slowly zoomed in during the conversation. The thing I really liked most about the movie was that in the beginning and the middle the monster was portrayed as violent and dangerous but during the scene with the little girl offering him flowers the audience could see that he wasn't really a monster but a frightened individual that came to be the way he was because he was abused and tormented by his creators; that scene really shed some light on the true nature of the monster and portrayed him as a kind soul rather than just a monster. Unfortunately I found the ending to be a bit random that was not really necessary.</fullReview>

On Second thought it was an good movie in a bad genre. Many scenes such as the windmill burning to the ground are really beautiful because they are this ray of light that shines through a movie filled with darkness and death. the significance of scenes being taken out of this is the most interesting part seeing as this is an early code ear movie and is an example of the code being enforced. One of the interesting scene that were taken out of this movie is of doctor Frankenstein exclaiming that he now knows what it is like to be god.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will always survive as a cautionary tale about the dangers of runaway technology.Henry Frankenstein created the monster not because civilization required a patchwork humanoid but because he COULD. The universal applicability of this theme makes the 1931 movie as scary today as it must have been when released in the years before WWII.The performances are all wonderful, due in part to inspired casting. Colin Clive excels as the monster's inventor and alter ego -- a man who can convey a suave and urbane exterior while seething, just below the surface, with creative insanity.Though given very little screen time, Mae Clarke does well as love interest Elizabeth. She wears her clothes deliciously in this film and seems so modern in her tendency to look the other way rather than seriously ponder her boyfriend's...er, issues. And Dwight Frye fascinates as the inventor's crazy-eyed and abused sidekick, (on-the-)Fritz. Of course, no review of "Frankenstein" is complete without mention of tragic Little Maria, the one person who interacts with the monster as if he is not a freak, and she ends up paying dearly for it. (Amazingly, I learned on Wikipedia, the troubling drowning scene was cut from this film and not restored until the Eighties!) "Frankenstein" is a work for the ages because technology will always be with us -- but will we survive to be with IT?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the great pleasure for seeing this film for what I am sure was the first time ever on the big screen yesterday on Halloween. I am certain I have seen pieces of it over the years but simply never sat down to watch it. What a moving and deeply dark piece of early horror cinema. I know that Frankenstein, the story has always been heralded for having a very deep empathetic emotion for this monster out of its element and trying to survive and find its place but what surprised me is that this film from the thirties actually captures that sensitive, powerful emotion. Unlike Dracula from the same time Frankenstein is not campy or rely on cheesy special effects. The effects are solid, in fact I think even stand up today when you look at them. The work put into this film was clearly intensive and because of that it is still a classic 7 decades later. There are some good performances followed but an astounding performance in the role of the monster.I will start with that role played by Boris Karloff. He has been stereotyped in this role as the monster but I had no idea he did it so brilliantly well. He does not speak a single word and yet gives such a powerful, deeply moving performance. He is frightening and yet you will feel for him. Colin Clive is our Dr. Frankenstein. He certainly plays the mad scientist role well and the chemistry with Karloff is good. Mae Clarke is good although she doesn't have a lot of reason to be in the film other than the woman that keeps Frankenstein grounded. I'm still not sure the point of the character played by John Boles. Handsome guy but pointless to the film and yet has significant screen time. Really enjoyed the small role by Frederick Kerr as Clive's father. He was a great comic relief but done well with taste to the overall feel for the story.Director James Whale told this story so well, especially give its time. The run time is relatively short and yet he manages to take the story and bring to it every aspect you would expect from the novel. The dark gritty setting of the tower and the village all make for a powerful looking film. Obviously a film so old shows its age and it would be impossible not to see the flaws but for a film like this and for its time it is just really wonderful to watch. If you have not seen this and you love classic film you'll depriving yourself of one of the greats. 8/10</fullReview>

Boris Karloff portrays the reanimated monster and while he does not have any actual lines, his performance was very eerie, almost animalistic. Colin Clive also gives a great performance as Dr. Frankenstein himself; I still get chills when he goes nearly mad exclaiming "it's alive!" Though the movie does alter the story written by Mary Shelley, it encompasses the same notion that man is always trying to play God, which does not always go right.

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a 1931 horror flick that has grown to be a somewhat horror classic. The movie is based on a book adaption of the same name that was written in 1818 by Mary Shelley.The monster Frankenstein was played by Boris Karloff, although at the time of release universal pictures kept the name of the actor who will play the monster secret to make the suspense grow. Many thinking it would be played by Bela Lugosi the Dracula star.The fun thing about this movie's production for me and pardon me please, is the facts behind it, 1. Kenneth Strickfaden who designed the electrical effects used in creating the monster has come to be referred to in fan circles as "Strickfadens." It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one Tesla Coil built by the then-aged Nikola Tesla himself.2. Jack Pierce was the makeup artist who designed the now-iconic "flat head" look for Karloff's monster.3. Many don't know unless you have seen this movie or read the book that Frankenstein was the name of the scientist that created the monster, the monster was not named, but many started calling him Frankenstein and that later became the monster's adopted name.This movie would have been scary in the time it was made as sound only came to the silver screen in 1927, and then a movie about monsters came out four years after, that will scare some.The movie plot is about Henry Frankenstein who wanted to create life, he finally achieved this by using science and dead body parts from different corpses.After all the parts have been bound together to make a full body human like form, Frankenstein passed the body through his equipments and then the famous lines were delivered."It's alive! It's alive!" "Now I know what it feels like to be God!" This movie is a classic true and true; it holds a 100% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.Times have changed CGI is now available to cover up for Makeup and art, so when watching this movie be ready to see true art, this movie is perfect and won't change a thing about it.Frankenstein was followed by enough sequels, and later Bela Lugosi got to play the monster when his career hit the rocks.The movies first sequel Bride of Frankenstein was released in 1935, in which Elsa Lanchester plays the Monster's bride.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

The moral is a great lesson for all humanity and I think the movie was fantastic on getting that point across. This movie was definitely my favorite monster film of that time. It's really hard me to believe that the movie was only mad in 1931 because the effects were really great especially when Dr. Frankenstein had created the monster with the whole set up and the trolley that lifted the body towards the sky to get hit by lighting. Another thing I want to point out is that there were so many great photography moments in the movie that really helped create the atmosphere. The acting was great as well, with how each character had reacted and treated the monster really affected on how he acted towards them. Must see movie that is a great classic monster film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Classic Monster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931)I came in to viewing this movie having only seen Young Frankenstein (1974). This was totally different. Same concept, same story (kind of)...but much more of a fascinating picture. Everyone knows the story of Frankenstein (or at least should) so explaining the plot seems unnecessary. But the film itself - the directing, the cinematography, the acting, the overall mood - was incredible. The low key lighting and gloomy photography make this 1931 classic monster movie a truly eerie picture. It's not a scary movie by any means in todays standards, but back in the early 30s this clearly was a frightening film. And the choice of having no music in it, aside from the opening credits, gives it an even more eerie feeling. Incredible.If you haven't, see this movie. It's a classic in American cinema and the story of Frankenstein has stuck with the American culture ever since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie more than I thought I would. I think the lighting effects and even the technical effects caught me off guard and allowed me to get sucked in. The lighting techniques that the director used were great, they weren't all the same and they allowed the viewers to give a better understanding of what we were suppose to be feeling. I think that the lighting with Frankenstein in the cellar was very bright on his face and really black background, using low key lighting. The low key lighting added to the emotions and the feelings, it shows Frankenstein as this creepy and scary man. The compositions of the scenes were also great, it showed a lot, but it wasn't were it was too much for the viewer. The settings add to the genre of the movie, that creepy and scary type of feeling. Such as the beginning scene where they're at the cementary at a very late time of night, showing black skys and brightened tombstones. As the men are walking with the fire on sticks in their hands the perspective and angle is switched from more of a wide angle shot showing all of the people to just showing one particular person. They try not to get caught up in one angle or perspective, switching up the scenes by showing lower angles or more complex angles. The scene where Frankenstein is peaking in on the little girl playing, showing him as he is like an Innocent child which is the the complete opposite way that he was made to look like. If they spent more time working on him then he would have not caused so much trouble, he did not know any better. The camera angle is switched as the man is walking with his dead daughter, it shows him carrying her across town as people stare at her in disbelief and some what of a shock. The camera is in front of them as the scene starts, but then moves to showing each side of them, showing the people he is walking by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well every one knows the story of Frankenstein. A monster that was created with a "bad brain" that goes on a rampage. There is some great cinematic photography shots in this film, which helped make it seem, at the time (in 1931), almost scary. This is especially so in the scene where the monster has just hung Fritzs by his own whip. If this movie could have been filmed in color I don think it would have helped make the movie any better. I think the black and white film enhances the nightmarish mood the movie is trying to portray. I personally did not enjoy this movie very much. This does not mean that Frankenstein is not a great movie. I give this film a 7 out of 10 mainly because it's not my favorite genre but it is still very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering this film was of the pre-code era, the director was allowed to add scenes that may have been offensive a few years later. For example when the monster throws the young girl into the pond, that would not have been acceptable after 1934. The way they producer decided to add no music was a clever idea, this idea exaggerated the sound of thunder and also the groans of the monster, many other sounds were amplified with this simple idea of no music. With this film, the monster seems a bit slower than the average human, and is suggested to angry tones from his creator causing him to act in a reckless way, but truly he seems to have potential to be a sweet creature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the scenery for this film was amazing from the German town, the campus classroom, the graveyard and especially the the graveyard. Also the complete lack of music in this film was brilliant. It really make you focus on the other sound effects in the movie for example the lighting and the wired electrical equipment in the laboratory. the camera shot from the point of view of the man walking through the town during the celebration was awesome the fact that you could get every footstep rather than the usually smooth movement of the camera going through the scene and in the end you feel bad for the monster he was misunderstood even if he did kill people and its not his fault he was given a bad brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While James Whale's Frankenstein is not nearly frightening by modern horror standards, it is extremely well made and I can easily understand its appeal to audiences in the early 1930s. Colin Clive's varying states of madness as Henry Frankenstein are well acted and enticing, and I can see Boris Karloff's performance as the monster being harrowing to viewers at the time of the film's release. Above all other components, the mise-en-scene of Frankenstein makes the movie what it is. The eerie, gloomy, and often chaotic nature of the sets provide the audience with similar emotions. For example, as the monster comes to life, there are a number of mechanisms wildly working away, various tinkering noises, gasps from the actors, and flashes of lightening necessary to breathe life into an inanimate body. All of these things work together to provoke excitement (and almost uneasiness) from the viewer, and it works well. The scenes in which the monster attacks people were well choreographed, and were much more believable than i had come to expect from films of this time period. All in all, Frankenstein is a well made movie, and is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very intense movie dealing with life and death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film directed by James Whale is a film based off of a classic story written by Mary Shelley. It is about a doctor (Colin Clive) who wants to create life in a man who is already dead. He is assisted by his sidekick (Dwight Frye) as he spends many days working to bring life to the man. Whale uses foreshadowing in the scene where Fritz, the doctors sidekick, drops the jar containing the "good" brain and decides to just replace it labeled the "bad brain". This scene tells you a lot about what is going to happen. Whale also is responsible for one of the most intense and memorable scenes in all of American Cinema. The scene where they are in the laboratory finally making an attempt at bringing the monster to life. It is during the middle of a thunderstorm at night where you can hear the crashing of thunder and flash of lightning. After the monster is created you seem to almost feel bad for this monster as he is essentially a big baby. Whale portrays his innocence in the scene where he is just playing with the girl and then mistakenly throws her into the lake where she drowns. The viewer knows he did not want to harm her but in the film he is seen as a terrifying monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good Universal Monster Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost as if Universal was making a film to make-up for the travesty that is Dracula, they made this gem. It is a story that we have heard a thousand times before. Hell, at the point that this film was made, the novel had already been around for more than a hundred years and there had been several film adaptations too. Fortunately, it uses the source material sparingly and takes on an identity of its own. It really does work to its advantage and creates something iconic, much in the same way that the 1931 film Dracula did for that character and mythos. It had a theme more closely related to life and death and the innocence of life, then it did with horror. It has a driving pace that is absent from most monster movies of the time. This is something that it almost does too well, which brings about one of the very few detriments to the film. It breezes over a lot of things that more time should have been devoted to.This film MADE Frankenstein! Boris Karloff IS Frankenstein! Once you see him dressed in the platform shoes, short-hemmed jacket, and that wonderful make-up that accentuates his grotesque features, you will never be able to think about him any other way, and many people can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I don't mind a few black and white movies in my mix of what I want to watch but this was completely different. The movie was split into two different parts; The first was eerie and the second half was intense. One thing that has me liking this movie is the one scene where the guy is running through the town with his deceased daughter and where the camera follows from the side, catching a glimpse of everyone's face as they are left in terror to the sight of death. This movie also contains forms of Mise-En-Scene through the emotions shown in the beginning burial scene and the obvious fear of fire shown by the monster born of Frankenstein's inhumane desire to be a god. Man, this movie was great in every possible definition!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The face of Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after view this film i wanted to get an idea on how the monster came to be. Not so much the makeup and accessories but more so the though and ideas. When creating a monster most people would aim towards a robot or alien. With Frankenstein you have an abnormal, pitiful looking human witch gives it a more realistic look. This took months of studying research in anatomy, surgery, medicine, criminal history, criminology, ancient and modern burial customs, and electrodynamics for Jack Peirce. Witch eventually lead him to believe the best way for a person like Dr. Frankenstein to replace a humans brain was simply cut off the top and hinge it back on. The ending results came out perfect in my perspective. Very realistic for the time period the movie was set in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Early Monster Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I cannot honestly say this was the best movie ever, there were several very impressive and powerful scenes which catapult it to the upper strata of early movie art. It is especially unfortunate that the scene with Maria by the water was censored for 50 plus years. Without that scene I don't think the same emotions would have been engendered for the monster that were when he seems to realize what he had done.The atmosphere created for the movie was excellent from the opening scene ? very rich and enveloping and mostly believable. The lack of a musical score was not noticeable due to the extensive use of ambient (diegetic) sound. There was a couple of scenes with some fairly well executed smooth camera movement ? notable the scene where the father is carrying Maria through town and when Elizabeth walked from room to room in her wedding gown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows the story of Frankenstein and his creation that he made come to life. Watching this film was really fun, I personally enjoyed it. The use of lighting was really cool, in my opinion, because there were a lot of shadows and many places that left your imagination to wonder what lies there. Certain scenes that were cut out after the original version, for me, made the movie very interesting and it would be a shame to imagine those scenes cut out. I agree on the fact that it was fast paced and the editing was very abrupt but I believe that is what made the movie seem so unreal and horrifying to people of that time period. Horror today is completely different than the way it was perceived and I believe it was more suspense and thrilling to watch than a horror movie. My interpretation of the film was a man simply misunderstood by society and created to prove a point that violence and crime is made by the surroundings of the world around us, not because of a simple person.</fullReview>

The only way that makes me see this as somewhat of a horror film is the Monster. If you don't jump with blood and gore it's not a horror film. It start off kind of boring it don't really start to pick up to like the middle I think but it's not like boring to the point you'll feeling asleep. The acting was on point the monster was very believable and body language he use to express and to get his point across was very clear and convening, and his height really added to feel of him being the monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein has been such a big hit throughout the years. There have been so many remakes and "sequals" to it that it is a very well known movie. With all the talk, I had never seen it before. After seeing it I was in some sorts amazed with it because I didn't think that the plot was going to be as good as it was. I learned that Frankenstein is not the name of the monster, but it is the name of the scientist who created him. Throughout the movie, the viewer in some ways learns to feel bad for this monster who in terms, has no control over what he does. One would think that Frankenstein is a monster who loves to be evil, but in fact, he is a monster who is just trying to live. The acting was phenomenal by Boris Karloff ( the monster ). All in all, it is a classic movie that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when one thinks of the classic universal monster movies 3 most common to come up are Dracula wolfman and frankenstein... frankenstein is a terrific example of the growth of sophistication in horror.. elaborate set pieces laden with special effects and believable makeup... these are things that will eventually become paramount in the future of horror... a lot about this movie is small subtleties that really sell what is going on... the electrical effects an storm sounds build to a climax like a strange score of noise... everything in and around the monsters creation seems crooked and off kilter as if to suggest something is strange and wrong... the lighting is very high contrast further separating the dark from the light and by extension good from evil... the lack of actual score for most of the film leaving some of the action in odd discomforting silence... and of course boris karloff as the monster whos odd and stiff movements combined with an undefinable deranged humanity makes him a horrific yet sympathetic character... sometimes more human and sane that dr frankenstein who at all times seems to have an overshadowing madness and hunger in his eyes... the overall look of the film is great the scenery is well done... though the set backdrops appear to have wrinkles every now and then everything is flawless right to the firey finale... an excellent horror classic and a good guide for filmmakers highly recommended along with the rest of the universal horror lineup</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a great movie. Put aside the early date and primitive technology, and you truly do have a great movie. The creation of the monster is primitive with the random instruments strewn about, but it works and that's the great thing about it. You may think it's corny but remember the time period it was made and you'll appreciate it more. The monster was well done with the make up and costume etc. The story is awesome, and we actually feel for the monster in the end, as far as he was concerned he was just playing and doing good, not killing people or causing trouble. The Mise-en-scene was well done in the opening scene with graveyard, skeleton hanging, the dark gray sky, actors wearing all block, and the metal bar fence. The whole movie is filled with excellent mise-en-scene, this is just one example. Must see this movie, you'll appreciate it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" may not be loyal to the book it was a adapted from, but it certainly gave us something very enjoyable. The only knowledge I had of Frankenstein's monster was through Mary Shelley's book, but watching this movie at long last, I feel like I just discovered Frankenstein again. Boris Karloff was a phenomenal monster and really sold the film for me. I can't even imagine what it's like to feel in the monster's position; being constantly unaware of the world around you with no way of communication or knowledge of common sense. It's easy to feel pity for this big brute, and it almost makes me regret laughing to comical characters designed to parody him, such as Herman Munster from "The Munsters." The shadows worked wonderfully in every shot, the reveal of the monster was spectacular, and the characters seemed were either likable, believable, or both. I also love how actors Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye return to the screen straight after filming "Dracula" in the same year. I'm almost wish Frye would act as silly as he was as when he played Mr. Renfeild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to see how older horror movies differ from the current gory horror films of today. I can't say I was the biggest fan of this movie, but I do respect the work that went into it. I never knew until I was told/ read the book that Frankenstein was in fact the doctor and not the monster! For a long time I always thought otherwise. I enjoyed certain parts of this film. One of my absolute favorite parts was when the monster escapes the windmill and finds the little girl. It was lovely to see the interaction. The girl represented a sign of innocents to me and even with his stature she still took his hand. Even though you know the monster has the evil brain you still get to see him act civil to the girl and even smile. When throwing the flowers into the water the joy is clear across the girl and monsters face. At first I laughed when the monster picked up the girl and throw her in like the flower, but unfortunately she did not float or swim, so she died. For some reason I kept waiting for the monster to pull her out, but that never happened. One part that I did not like was the ending. I didn't like the fact that you never find out what became of Frankenstein or the monster for that matter. Overall I thought the movie was good, but I wouldn't qualify it as out standing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff was of course the best part of the movie. He was really good and I like how stiff he made the monster seem while walking and whatnot. I liked the very angular dimensions of the windmill because it made the scene always seem uneasy and irregular, even creepy. What I didn't like though was that I don't think the movie went deep enough into the monster's character. It did a little with the scene with the little girl but I think they could've done more. The ending was OK and I like how you didn't see the monster die, but I think Frankenstein should've died by his monster's hands. I also didn't like the whole side story with Frankenstein and his wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" novel has been adapted to the big screen many times, but none better than this. Boris Karloff's performance as the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein is perhaps unparalleled in film history. Karloff brings to life the lost and hopeless feelings the monster is experiencing as he tries to understand the life he was given, but did not ask for. Although the film is slow, the sense of menace and danger are palpable. Frankenstein's monster experiences a brief and confused life after his creation. The characters are all well written and expertly acted. The film is short, but that is a benefit as no scenes are wasted to fill time. Each scene serves a purpose and progresses the story to its sad end. The monster is chased to an old mill by the town's people after he unwittingly kills a young girl that had befriended him. The mill is set ablaze with the monster inside left to a horrible death by the thing he feared most in the world, fire. The film tells an excellent story and leaves viewers with a sense of compassion and sorrow for the monster. An excellent all around movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can one say about this horror movie classic? It is absolutely a must watch. Boris Karloff does a wonderful job in his non-speaking monster role. There is plenty of dark shadows, and human skulls and body parts abound to make this film all that more macabre and thus, a joy to experience. Dr. Frankenstein's father also jokes in such a deadpan manner about his son's marriage (or lack thereof), it seems to lighten the movie up a bit, but that certainly does not deter from the thrill of watching the monster go on his killing rampage. I think everyone should be aware of this, either the story by Mary Shelley, or this movie adaption, it is an essential to any movie collection. I should also mention that Frankenstein was the doctor, the main character in the movie (hence the title for my review), and not the monster as most people incorrectly refer to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with Universal Studios' Monsters and watching their films, but It had been a while since I'd watched this version of Frankenstein. Now that I am seeing it again with fresh eyes, I have a better appreciation for it.Among the factors that worked together to make this such a classic horror film was the acting. Boris Karloff did a great job as the monster. He portrayed the monster as a sympatheic character you could feel sorry for because he was an innocent creature with no understanding of morality or even simple cause and effect, as we see in the horrifying scene with little Maria. At the same time, he conveyed that the monster was a dangerous and frightening creature. What I found especially impressive was that he did all of this without any dialogue, relying on gestures, menacing looks, and grunting. I thought Colin Clive also added to the good acting because his portrayal of a mad scientist was very believable. I think he showed how anyone would act if they had just created something so advanced in the field of science. He also showed regret soon after he realized what the monster was capable of and that he couldn't control it.I think what also contributed to making this a scary horror movie was the effective use of mise-en-scene, including the setting, lighting, camera angles, sounds, costumes, and make-up. Overall, these elements combined to create a feeling of creepiness and dread. The setting seemed dungeon-like and perfect for a horror movie. The monster's makeup was probably horrifying when audiences first saw it because they could see he was made out of human parts. Both lighting and sound were used very well through out the film, but especially in the creation scene, with thunder, lightning, and electrical discharges contrasted against the dark, shadowy background of the castle.</fullReview>

Karloff plays the monster so believably that it is frightening.The only problem I had with this movie were the scenes where neither the monster or Doctor Frankenstein were in them.

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, before seeing this movie you have to understand that it debuted in 1931 and the entire movie industry was very young and simple compared to what it is now. That being said, Frankenstein is without a doubt the original scary horror flick. While it does not inflict terror and deep fear, the groundwork for many many more horror films in the future was laid. What Frankenstein lacks in terms of shock factor and frightening images and so forth, it makes up with in story and emotion.The first chunk of the film creates a deep sense of foreboding, darkness, and eerie sensations through the use of heavy black shadows. Even though Frankenstein was filmed black and white the presence of shadows is so prevalent in some scenes that parts of the screen are hardly visible. The pervasive darkness really creates a sense for the viewer that something morally and terribly wrong is happening. We are emotionally confronted by the events. From the start one can clearly see Dr. Frankenstein is crazy, and it is that development of mystery and (for most) disgust of what is happening that makes this movie so successful. Like reading a book, it leaves some of the imagery up to you, playing on the idea of what is happening to instill fear rather than using scary images and loud noises like many of today's horror flicks. Frankenstein gives the viewer a base of a frightening situation and allows the mind to fill in some of the details as the story progresses. I think that is what makes Frankenstein so successful even today, and for that I applaud it because it is not seen much today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, where to begin? I viewed this film for a history of cinema class, and i have to admit that while I am certainly a fan of horror movies, I did not initially think that this film would be that good. I was clearly wrong. Karloff truly does play a good monster, albeit a monster with a good heart that is continuously misunderstood. But nonetheless, the performance is both captivating and a bit eerie. it is odd to think that the tale of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster has been around for almost two centuries, since Mary Shelley first published her novel in 1817. That being said, after viewing this film, it is clear why this story or tale has had such seemingly endless staying power with generations of viewers. This film touches on several key ideas that I believe must people can relate to: the feeling of wanting to be GOD, or more correctly, to have total control of life and death, as well as the notion that sometimes once something has been done, it can not be undone. The latter idea is really what keeps the film going, as at anytime the good doctor could have simply put his horrid creation out to pasture, so to speak. But he can not, which further reinforces my point that some things are so deplorable and vile that once they are done, they are done forever. Secondly, this idea is again recognized in the fact that the monster does not die at the end of the movie, and obviously for Hollywood's monetary purposes this makes sense, but it just goes to strengthen my point. On the former point that I made earlier, in an often anarchistic, and at times lawless world, who would not want to be in control? I think that is one of the key things that resonates with viewers. But I digress; everything about the film was top notch. Often when viewing older films, I am left with a sense of wanting, or I wished that more could have happened. however, with this film, I was left with no such feeling. The movie runs smoothly, with bits of really funny material from Henry's father that help to detract from the overall seriousness of the picture, and the cast is obviously first rate. Additionally, the overall feel of the picture is extremely well done. The camera does not to be intruding upon performances when doing close ups, and the scenery, music ( or lack of), and minute details all help complete a truly great viewing experience. This is especially so in the scene where Maria's father carries her limp body through the village, and the camera pans to all the womens faces in their respective windows as the pop out to see what all the commotion is about. As the camera goes from face to face it helps to give the viewer the feeling that he or she could really be apart of this small village and the tragedy that has befallen it. Overall, this film was very well done with standout performances, a great setting and story, and I would definitely recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie even though old and short didn't seem dated at all. The camera work through the village of the father carrying the girl was shot well in one continuous scene. The wedding and marriage wasn't really necessary but it distracted and took some moments away from the up coming raids or tragedy. When in the windmill at the end I felt sad for the monster because even though he was truly a monster he was doing everything out of not knowing any better since he was created by man. It was a good first horror movie to watch and looking forward to watching my second one. I would recommend that any horror film lovers start watching the old ones first and then the remakes, because I haven't seen any of the remakes but am now going to keep my eyes open and find them to see how different or similar they are to each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In addition to being a true classic in every technical sense of the word, Frankenstein is also surprisingly entertaining for a film made about 8 decades ago. Yes, there are certain aspects to it that haven't aged well, but you can say that about most everything that's been around longer than 2 or 3 generations. There are also aspects to this movie as good or better than anything made today, earning Frankenstein its standing as one of the progenitors of the entire horror genre.I'm not sure it's possible for anyone much over the age of 6 to be unfamiliar with this story. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is the obsessed scientist seeking to usurp the place of God and bestow life onto unliving tissue. He and his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) stitch together an awful creature (Boris Karloff) out of a collection of corpses and the abnormal brain of a criminal. But though Frankenstein succeeds in his experiment, his monster proves to be more than he can handle. It escapes into the countryside and arouses a mob of torch bearing villagers that traps both creator and creation in an old windmill, with terrible results.Just about everyone who's ever watched any film has probably seen part of the famous scene where Henry Frankenstein proclaims "It's alive. It's alive!". That's somewhat unfortunate, because taken out of context it likely strikes most as over-the-top histrionics. If you actually watch Frankenstein, you can recognize it as a definitely brilliant bit of acting that highlights an electrifying performance by Colin Clive. Few actors in the history of cinema have ever embodied obsession more powerfully than Clive does here, up to and including Frankenstein's almost orgasmic sense of relief when his obsession is finally realized. Clive creates THE archetypal mad scientist; a man who is not evil but whose pursuit of discovery renders him morally insensate and incapable of appreciating any ethical limitations.It is Boris Karloff's work as the creature that gets most of the popular praise instead of Clive, which I don't think is fair, but Karloff is certainly remarkable on his own terms. He's as much mime as thespian in this role and conveys a real mix of humanity and the unnatural. Those fundamental human dimensions are what distinguish the creature from the increasingly inhuman monsters that would follow him in horror films.This is also a beautiful film to look at. Modern technology allows filmmakers to stick a camera anywhere and do anything with it. Director James Whale had much less sophisticated technology to work with, yet was inspired by the things he couldn't do to produce some completely captivating images. With moving the camera being a challenge, Whale had huge, great looking sets created and filmed his actors largely in full figure as they went back and forth, up and down through those sets. It is a joy to watch Clive, Boris Karloff and Dwight Frye act with their whole bodies, not just their faces and parts of their torsos. If anything, the passage of time that had led to the relentless use of frenetic camera movement and extreme close ups makes Frankenstein look even better today than it did in 1931.Whale brings an interesting take on mob violence to this movie as well. In the story, the villagers represent the forces of law and society rising up to deal with the terrifying threat of Frankenstein's monster. However, Whale doesn't shy away from showing the ugly, irrational face of the mob. In Whale's hands, their actions may be justified but he makes the audience very aware of the uncontrolled danger that's ready to erupt from these men.As I mentioned, some of this movie is quite dated. The profoundly non-Germanic nature of this cast of Germanic characters is fairly ridiculous. Frederick Kerr as Baron Frankenstein, Henry's father, is a rather bizarre character. He's like a crotchety old man from a vaudeville routine and plays far too prominent a role in the story. Mae Clarke as Henry's fiancée and John Boles as their friend are also fine examples of the somewhat mannered acting styles of their era. However, Edward Van Sloan as Henry's mentor and Dwight Frye as his hunchbacked assistant are much livelier and more direct in their performances.If Frankenstein were 2 hours long or more, the dated elements of the production might have overwhelmed it. At just about 70 minutes long, the outstanding components of the story and its presentation are still able to shine. Even though you've probably absorbed most of this movie through cultural osmosis, Frankenstein remains a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's STILL alive and kicking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYNOPSIS: Man creates monster by stitching together body parts of the recently deceased and giving it the brain of a criminal.James Whale's original film version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein story is an undisputed classic of the horror genre. While lacking in the scares and gore of more contemporary entries into the genre, the ideas and themes played out here are smarter than many a modern day science fiction/horror mash-up. The film is unlikely to make a young audience of today scream with terror but it still manages to muster sympathy for the hopeless story of the victimized monster. Watching the film now conjures memories of many films it has influenced. Sympathetic, misunderstood monsters, crazed arrogant scientists and a screaming damsel in distress all feel overly familiar now but this film would have served up a powerful and original telling of an original tale back in the 1930s. More modern films that spring to mind while watching Frankenstein included '28 Days Later' with its chained monster being provoked by an unsympathetic captor, 'Edward Scissorhands' with its misunderstood protagonist chased out of town by angry villagers/suburbanites and 'The Terminator' with its unstoppable man-made monster on the rampage (to name just a few!) The influence of this film on contemporary cinema is immeasurable. The less said about recent rip-off 'Splice', the better.The story is tightly structured and the script has its faults but keeps the action rattling along at a brusque pace. The opening scenes of body-snatching are intriguing and followed by some grating scenes of exposition. However this is soon forgotten as the creation of the monster becomes a great set-piece that builds suspense and climaxes with the iconic cry of 'It's Alive!' The supporting cast is lumbered with a fair share of exposition-spouting, theatrically-staged scenes and the tone of the film veers wildly between moments of dread and horror and moments of comic relief with Frankenstein's father but the progression of the narrative is overall logical, well-crafted and fast-paced (particularly for a film of this age).Frederick Kerr plays the Baron Frankenstein with an easy comic touch, mumbling and bumbling like a grumpy but amiable old git. Colin Clive delivers a performance that is far from subtle and contains far too much of the familiar theatrical style of acting from so many classic old movies where the character stares just off camera into the distance when thinking. However the award for really over doing this has to go to Mae Clarke playing Elizabeth whose performance would be ridiculed if it was in a modern film. Karloff plays the monster perfectly, inviting sympathy with his tragic mix of innocence and rage.The actors work well together and despite some overly theatrical thesping, the cast is generally believable and carry the narrative convincingly. Whale never allows the pace to slow and there are some moments of interesting cinematography. However the majority of the camera-work is simple and functional, restricted as they were with the technology of the time. There is a distinct lack of musical soundtrack and this is a blessing as overly powerful orchestral scores can be a distraction in many classics from the thirties.The special effects and set design are also worth mentioning as the interior of the windmill is an iconic construction filled with convincing contraptions that create memorable, iconic moments of the (re)birth of the monster. Karloff's scars and screws add to this to ensure the monster is one of the most enduring and recognizable images of horror cinema.The idea that God must not be challenged and that scientific progress will KILL US ALL is persistent but not forced down throats with quotes from the Bible. The arrogance and madness of the scientist is punished. However the innocence of the monster and the guilt of the aristocratic protagonists are not fully explored. The manipulation of the masses by the aristocrats is touched on but not overtly dealt with as a major theme At barely over an hour long the film is over before anyone could possibly have a chance to get bored of it. In fact the climax feels rushed and could have been more drawn out. More sympathy could have been created for the monster and the connection between creator and creation could have been explored further with a longer third act. Frankenstein is very enjoyable and clearly a hugely influential work in the cinematic horror genre. It is an easy watch even for viewers raised on blood, guts, slashers and torture porn. Iconic, sympathetic and deserving of its classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different Time Period, Different Horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course horror today has changed from horror in the 1930s, and with that in mind James Whale's Frankenstein successfully established a certain creepy feel that is still felt when watched today. Adapted from "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley, the film offers a very simplified version of the book while still touching on some of its themes, specifically that of God and man, and man playing the role of God.I felt the mise-en-sc?ne, or the efforts to make the film appear as convincing as possible, such as the lighting, set design, film location, costumes, make-up, sound effects, and the actors themselves, proved effective in this movie (for its time period).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein (1931)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was immediately drawn in when I began watching Frankenstein (1931). The eerie lighting and set in the scene where Frankenstein and his assistant are digging up the body was very well done, it set the mood for the film with no delay. I was satisfied by the depth of the story. When the monster encounters the little girl by the water, there is a short time where he appears to fit in and not be a threat, then by his own ignorance takes the girl's life. This is symbolic of him wanting to belong even though it is proving impossible. Also, I would like to know what would have happened if the brain that was stolen in the beginning actually was of a normal person and not a murderer. In the ending, I think it is great how the scene of the burning windmill was shot on an actual burning set. It must have been difficult for the actors to concentrate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An historical masterpiece, though now dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen this film since I was a kid, way back in the early 1960s, on television (a neighborhood tradition of a horror movie on Saturday afternoons). One reason I hadn't watched it in so long was that I remembered how bad the prints were that they showed on t.v. then. So I was very pleased at how pristine the print TCM has been showing is. Quite impressive. Of course, the quality of the print also made the cheap background paintings vividly obvious.I was particularly interested in seeing the film, because just a few days before I had seen another film with John Boles, whom I didn't recognize at all.Like many old films, the directors weren't always very logical about assuring that certain things "made sense". For example, why would a university simply leave preserved brains in a classroom overnight? And why does Dr. Frankenstein lock his fiancé in the bedroom on the day of their marriage BEFORE he knows that his doctor/teacher has been killed and that the monster is loose? Despite such mistakes, and considering that this film was released in 1931...it's a masterpiece, and worth watching if only for its historical value. Compared to modern films, it does drag a bit (perhaps all the more because there is virtually no musical score), but this is history. I wondered what the actors thought when they were making the film. Little did they know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1931 version was shown on Turner Classic Movies. The initial scenes of grave robbing and removing a body that had been hanged were frightening and gruesome. "It's alive, it's alive!", Dr. Frankenstein's famous quote, is chilling as one realizes what he has done. Excessive time on screen is devoted to the love interest, which should have remained secondary to the horror plot. The classic, touching scene between the monster and the little girl, first holding flowers and smiling, then resulting in her accidental drowning, is tragic. Boris Karloff's touching facial expressions and perfectly controlled body movements put everyone else's overdone performances to shame. Unexamined in this early version of Shelley's novel were the themes of man vs. god, the ethics and morality of trying to create life, and the ultimate responsibility of the creator for the "monster," who by comparison to his creator, seemed less a criminal than a victim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an incredible movie! Frankenstein is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and so matter how many times the story is retold or how much money and technology Hollywood throws at it they will never out do the original.The character of "The Monster", or "The Creature", or "Frankensteins Monster"(Karloff) or whatever you choose to call it is a dark, disturbing, and intimidating being but almost from the time it is re-animated you feel sorry for it because it seems to be confused. Even though the Monster has no lines in the movie you can tell it is struggling internally.The darkness and camera motion are what really make this movie creepy. When you add this with the sound effects, costume and set design, and the make-up you have everything need to make movie perfection. As I said James Whale made this movie right the first time and any attempt to out do it is futile!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of scary movies but do not get scared very easily. This was a movie made "precode" which didn't come into effect until 1934. This was before they had rules set on the things they could show or do. I feel like todays scary movies are a lot scarier because back then they were not really that inappropriate and now today they will show bodies torn up and murdered or something happening to someone. It seems like today they have a lot "dirtier" minds then they did back then, or they were just nervous at what to show on the film, which is very understandable. For scary movies I personally would stick to the ones we have today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very excellent film but a bad adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this film varies drastically from its source material (Frankenstein (Book, 1818)) it still manages to be both frightening and entertaining. The movie follows Henry Frankenstein who is engaged to a girl named Elizabeth. He leaves his fiancée for four months to work on an experiment with his assistant Fritz. His experiment is to revive a dead corpse but since he is unable to find a perfectly healthy human corpse (they had to have had something wrong with them if they died after all) he ends up grave digging and putting all of the pieces together to create "The Monster". When he succeeds in giving it life the Monster manages to escape and cause trouble throughout the entire countryside, killing at will. Will anyone be able to stop the monster? So basically the story is very good although it hardly follows the novel at all, even changing the main characters name from Victor to Henry (yet they named a minor character Victor to add to the confusion). The Monster's intelligence is also drastically brought down to the point where he can't even speak. The main loss though is the fact that the good guy/bad guy relationship is much more black and white. In the original novel it was open to interpretation but here the Monster is clearly bad with Henry being good. So the story is very entertaining, but also a missed opportunity.When it comes to the acting in this film I truly feel that all of the actors did a great job in their roles. Colin Clive plays Henry Frankenstein and really pulls off the mad scientist vibe really well. Then there is Mae Clarke who plays Elizabeth but the script doesn't give her very much room as it makes her out as the damsel in distress. Keeping that in mind though she pulls it off well. And next up is Dwight Frye as Fritz, often incorrectly called Igor by viewers. Frye is great as the crazy and stupid hunchbacked character. Most importantly we have Boris Karloff in the film that raised him into star dome. Even though he is covered in makeup and doesn't have a single line of dialogue he manages to be the best actor in this film. He really helps the audience sympathize with his character but at the same time manages to be the angry evil monster. So overall there is some great acting here.All of the makeup and special effects are excellent here with some realistic looking wounds and decomposition on the corpse of the Monster. In addition there are some great sets in the film which truly set the mood with the exception of the final scenes where the Monster is being chased on a mountain which looks somewhat fake. And as for the musical score it complements the picture tremendously. Frankenstein is a very technically sound film overall.As a classic of the horror genre at the time and one of the most famous monster movies ever made I was slightly disappointed with the film. I am a huge fan of the original novel and was disappointed that so few elements transferred over to the movie but nevertheless it is still an excellent monster movie and one that is worth your time. It is very good technically with excellent special effects, sets, and music plus it has some great acting especially from Boris Karloff as the Monster. So give this film a try if you have any interest whatsoever in monster movies, horror, or Frankenstein. But don't expect it to be anything like the book. Score: 8/10</fullReview>

They implied horror into the film so easily. With the setting being creepy woods, and the old broken down buildings. Also Frankensteins creature also having an amazed look on his faced, but he did not use words the entire film and he kept his stiff form. A part of the movie that made me laugh a little was actually when the little girl was tossed into the lake because it was just so random, frankenstein seemed happy one moment and then he toss's the girl. A good film of this time period, just not something that really kept me entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than A Monster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed 1931 version of Frankenstein. What makes Frankenstein special, beyond its iconic monster movie status, is that it contains social commentary. After watching the film, I realized that the true monster in the movie is not Frankenstein, but the people that surround him. He is misunderstood by society, alienated and treated as less than human which is ironic because he is made from their parts. I found it particularly painful to watch when Frankenstein is locked up and Fritz is tormenting him with the torch.Another sad scene is when Frankenstein is playing with the little girl. The only person that treats him with kindness he accidentally kills while trying to make her float. You can see in this scene that Frankenstein is not evil or a monster, he just doesn't understand the world he lives in nor does the world understand him.Frankenstein is a great film on multiple levels and is a must watch.</fullReview>

It spawned many spin offs and sequels such as "Bride of Frankenstein", "Son of Frankenstein", and "Ghost of Frankenstein" which showed the demand for more movies in this genera. By todays standards for horror movies "Frankenstein" is not that scary, but it really set the standard for horror movies of that era. This film solidified Boris Karloff as an acting legend. When he appeared in the movie "Scarface"(1932) he was credited as Boris "Frankenstein" Karloff. Along side great performances like Karloff's, the film featured state of the art special effects such as Frankensteins "creation" machine which featured a Tesla coil built by Nikola Tesla himself."

		<fullReview>A tragic tale of an overly ambitious scientist and his creation. The 1931 Frankenstein is a classic in my eyes. It was the first film of many of its kind, used as a sort of template. James Whale (the director) creates an amazing atmosphere that grabs your attention using detailed sets and spooky effects. Although a categorized as a scary movie the protagonist or "killer" in the movie (Frankenstein) is quite mild in the sense that you never really see him kill. that could be due to the code era in which it was shot during. Frankenstein is a creation of the doctor and from his rebirth to his death is misunderstood by everyone. He is seen as a monster yet has the mentality of a child, unfamiliar with the world around him. Not ever being given the chance to be seen as an equal, Frankenstein revolts by killing which ends up leading to his destruction. I enjoyed watching this 1931 classic. IT has suspense, good acting and a decent story. The only downfall would have to be the lack of "action" one is used to in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was supposed to be a horror movie, it did have it's suspenseful moments, but was more sad. Frankenstein's creation was made up to be this big monster and was originally just to prove to make human life, of course things go wrong during the process. When he came to life he was anything but a monster, he was just a large man who didn't understand the world around him. As the audience, you feel sorry for him because he just wants to try to communicate and have an understanding of this new life but everyone that sees him is frightened by him. Unfortunately, everyone feels the need to destroy him because he is a menace, and when he is destroyed it is bittersweet for the doctor but unfortunately no one is supposed to play the "higher power" but himself.I was expecting a little more horror or suspense to this movie but was surprised and impressed by the twist to this story. It was also better than I expected this to be. When I heard early horror and I just expected it to be almost silly. Like I had stated earlier, there was not too much horror but it was not what I expected and it was very enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't hate this movie, I didn't enjoy it either though. Frankenstein is not at the top of my list. Just not my kind of movie i think. Its elements kind of got a little confusing for me at times to. Like there's a scene where Frankenstein is interacting with a little girl that is funny, but then quickly turns tragic, emotional and upsetting. From there we go to the emotionally gripping scene of the father carrying his dead daughter through the street. It sort of went from one to another, and It kind of got lost on me. Great sound effects, especially in the lab, and at the end where we see Frankenstein's demise. The feeling is very dark through out the whole movie. Kind of gross with people grabbing abnormal brains and so on. The plot didn't really hold my attention at all. Although there was a time when I almost felt bad for Frankenstein. The only social message that I could find to take away from this movie, is that "playing god" can be extremely dangerous. I know its a classic horror film, but just not for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More of a philosophical question than a horror film in my eyes, this film beautifully weaves suspense and intrigue with creepy darkness. The film is constantly setting the perfect visual mood for all of it's situations, like Dr. Frankensteins hermit like madness, or the monsters raw ignorance and aggression. I felt the greatest depth of character came surprisingly from the monster, who had no speaking lines. Karloff brilliantly plays the monster with a confusing and tragic sense of humanity. I felt the scene where the monster is first introduced to light to be very metaphoric. After being kept in complete darkness and knowing nothing else he is teased with light and desperately wants it back, but he is denied and is exposed to fire. This theme holds true for the monster throughout the film, he is constantly subject to abuses and misunderstanding and is then punished after the obvious ill consequence.</fullReview>

It is, however, a really interesting movie. The very first scene peaks your curiosity, and the movie only gets more interesting from there. Everything on screen really comes together to create a creepy, ominous atmosphere. Such as the decor in Frankenstein's house and in other scenes; and the turbulent weather and dark lighting. The choice of actors for the film was perfect. I thought that Colin Clive had a really edgy face and sharp voice, which made him perfect for a twisted, obsessed scientist. Boris Karloff was also a perfect choice. I thought Karloff had a really intense looking face and eyes, and his portrayal of a witless beast was spot on.</fullReview>

What I actually found was a suspenseful movie with the monster being somewhat compassionate and confused. The most touching part of the movie was the scene where the man was carrying his dead daughter down the street. The camera followed next to him so you could see the reactions of the town people. The walk felt like it took forever and everyone's reaction was somewhat different from the last. I felt bad for the monster because unless he was provoked by somebody else, he was not mean spirited. The ending was ironic because the thing that he feared the most, fire, was how he ended up dying.</fullReview>

He was this human being who didn't ask to be created yet he was and all he wanted was some compassion and love. The fact that they showed him burning to death in the end was extremely disturbing and almost sickly. Something more ironic was how they Hays Codes weren't far from coming after this movie an yet the movie had such disturbing scenes.

		<fullReview>I know they're almost altogether different things, but I still have to mention that "Frankenstein" the 1931 film doesn't match the book. Regardless, Frankenstein is still a fantastic movie that vaguely retains the powerful themes of the book. The Creature is still a misunderstood and unfortunate victim who ultimately just wants freedom and peace. Regardless of whatever its original intention may have been, I liked how the brain that Fritz nabs is labeled as "abnormal". It's exactly what The Creature is, but it's their prejudice toward him that makes him a threat. The scene with the little girl is the obvious choice, at least to me, as the movie's pinnacle. It's powerful. But what's perhaps equally as impressive was the chillingly disturbing(and brilliantly directed) scene where the father carries his dead daughter through the town. It surprised me when I saw it, as it wasn't something I expected to see. Those two scenes in particular will remain clearly in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely not the most scary movie in the world, but it was still good nonetheless. Frankenstein did remind me of Herman Munster at first, but then I got past it. The acting in the movie was good, but the best acting job came from Boris Karloff for having to act part human and part monster. Though there was a lot of special affects and special lighting to make the movie much more scarier, it didn't appear as scary to people today compared to people who watch it in the 1930s. Since most of today's horror movies have superior special affects, this movie comes off as dated and unrealistic.When watching the movie, I felt sad for the monster. The monster reminded me of Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Lenny being so big he didn't realize he was hurting anyone until it was too late. I think the monster was the same way. If people were nice to him, he would be nice back, and he knew when he did something wrong. I think that the monster, if treated like like a human being, could've lived in the normal world, but with people being so judge mental no one gave the monster a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionist Horror USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie holds a fond place in my heart. I used to watch it all the time as a kid, I have the worn out VHS to prove it. I haven't watched this movie since I was a kid though so it was interesting to revisit it in class. This is not a horror movie, not in the sense where it's supposed to make you jump. This is more of a tragedy, a man decides to play god and reanimates a corpse. The creation only really seems to want affection and acceptance but it is shunned, it kills only because its afraid or doesn't understand. The creation is basically a giant baby with neck bolts. Boris Karloffs face captures this beautifully, he has a certain worldly quality to his face that really expresses the sorrow and tragedy that the creation is going though. The lighting and set design really set the mood here. It has a lot in common with German expressionism, giant sets that dwarf the actors and dark lighting which cast ominous shadows. The only complaints I have with this movie are a few unintentionally funny moments involving the monster or the Igor character, you'll probably be reminded of Young Frankenstein with one scene in particular. That being said this is a really good movie, I would highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The role that got Boris Karloff famous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day when I was on the internet and was looking at some horror movies on Google, I spotted this great title. Then when I saw the 75th Anniversiry Edition DVD in a store, I just knew I had to have this marvelous movie. I got to say it was well worth my time, because the performances were superb- especially the famous line "It's Alive! It's Alive!". At first the director, James Whale, didn't want to direct this, because he thought it would be a joke. But then he thought of the possibilities of Frankenstien- creating something that audience had never seen on the big-screen. While the movie is no longer scary and frightening, because the horror in it is what is in G-rated pictures on Television today, it still is great, because it seems more like a drama. Boris Karloff's performance is what really makes this film worth watching, because you just feel sorry for him and makes you want to watch this film again and again. If you have never seen this movie, check it out as soon as possible, it's well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Frankenstein" Is A Classic Horror Chiller!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Waterloo Bridge" director James Whale's landmark horror classic "Frankenstein" came out in November 1931, about nine months after Universal Studios had released "Dracula" in February of 1931. Clearly, "Frankenstein" surpasses Tod Browning's "Dracula" in virtually every respect, except for Bela Lugosi's performance and its black &amp; white photography. Despite having no dialogue other than grunts and snarls, Boris Karloff delivers an extraordinary performance that relies on eloquent body language and costuming to create a character that is both monstrous and sympathetic. Towering about seven feet in height, the monster possesses an imposing physical presence. No sooner has the monster been given life than he finds himself in an inhospitable world that it neither knows nor understands. Mind you, Dracula behaved like a predator from the start because he survived on the blood of others. On the contrary, the Frankenstein monster lacks any of Dracula's mental capacity for evil. Sadly, the monster behaves monstrously but it lacks an awareness of what it does. In some ways, the monster is an insane asylum inmate who has no moral understanding about life. Whereas "Dracula" emerged as a more literal film set in an actual moment of history, "Frankenstein" qualifies as a fantasy with minor elements of authenticity. Moreover, Whale and scenarists Garrett Fort of "Dracula" and Francis Edward Faragoh of "Little Caesar" never establish the actual year during which their events transpire. Although the people in "Frankenstein" have electricity and contemporary attire, they have no telephones, motor cars, buses, and other Twentieth century accouterments. Similarly, while "Dracula" takes place in actual settings, such a Transylvania and London, "Frankenstein" occurs somewhere in Central Europe without any specific location revealed, aside from the Goldstadt Medical University. Basically, Whale and his writers have shaped a film that has little to do with the real world. Their world is a world where people can dig up coffins and appropriate the dead on the gallows. "Dracula" required a real world setting to differentiate the vampire from humans. Since nobody believed in vampires, setting "Dracula" in an actual place at actual time gave the eponymous predator an element of mystery. According to one character in "Dracula," vampires don't exist and their lack of credibility is their strongest weapon against humanity. The Frankenstein monster is a product of a fantasy and the filmmakers have no wish to try and make it real. Nevertheless, it is the fantasy of "Frankenstein" that makes it a more interesting movie than the literalness of "Dracula." Furthermore, the vampire dies in "Dracula, but the monster and his creator survive "Frankenstein" and reappear in "The Bride of Frankenstein." The depth of the plot, the complications that creator and monster encounter, and the bits and pieces of comic relief that Whale and his writes insinuate in the narrative make "Frankenstein" a far more interesting film. Remember, the evil of "Dracula" is intentional, but the evil of the "Frankenstein" monster is accidental. Frankenstein is sympathetic, whereas Dracula lacks sympathy. "Frankenstein" is like "The Wolfman." The Wolfman is evil, but it is a curse on a man who is transformed on a full moon against its will into a monster. Similarly, Frankenstein?the product of many dissections and corpses?is a monster who never asked to be created but once created becomes the spawn of evil. Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive of "Journey's End") is engaged to Elizabeth (Mae Clarke of "The Public Enemy"), but he is so absorbed in his work that he ignores Elizabeth. Elizabeth and one of Henry's friends, Victor Moritz (John Boles of "The Desert Song"), visit Henry's mentor, Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan of "Dracula"), at the Goldstadt Medical University, which Henry had been attending. Dr. Waldman explains that Henry's experiments required things that were not available to him at the university, so he left to conduct his research without limits. During one of the conversations together, Frankenstein explains to Waldman that he began his experiments by reviving dead animals. At one point he managed to keep a human heart beating for three weeks. Henry and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye of "Dracula") have scoured the graveyards and the gibbet for bodies, and Frankenstein has cherry picked from these human remains to construct an individual. Elizabeth, Victor and Dr. Waldman find their way to the watchtower where Henry has built a laboratory and is about to harness the power of electricity by means of lightning to give his creation life. Indeed, Elizabeth, Victor and Dr. Waldman watch in fascination as Frankenstein raises a stretcher with a body on it up about twenty feet to a platform atop the watchtower so bolts of lightning can make contact with the electrodes on either side of the monster's neck. Unlike "Dracula" who makes his appearance after the opening credits, the "Frankenstein" monster doesn't make its appearance until half way through its 70 minute running time. Dr. Waldman and Frankenstein are discussing the monster when it backs into their room and turns to look at the camera. Whereas Tod Browning was a literal, prosaic director, Whale is a visually oriented director with theatricality to his films that Browning lacks because Whale ranks as the more imaginative of the two. Critics and film historians have made much of Whale's fondness for going in one direction and then reversing into another direction. No sooner has Frankenstein made the monster than Fritz torments it with a flaming torch and a bull whip. Eventually, the monster refuses to tolerate Fritz's antics and kills him. When Frankenstein and Waldman discover Fritz's body, they lure the monster out of his room and Waldman thrust a hypodermic needle into its back and incapacitates the creature. Later, Waldman tries to dissect the monster, but it surprises and kills him. The monster escapes and kills a child by accident and everybody grabs a torch and corners it in a windmill. The monster throws its creator from the windmill and the villages burn the windmill. Frankenstein survives with no sight of the monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale directed Frankenstein in 1931. This film was a classic horror film. Compared to horror films of today where the suspense and horror typically includes a masked face, knife- wielding character, and lots of uses of blood, this was a good movie. For the time, the sound and lighting affects gave the movie the creepy "realistic" feel. The scene notable scene where Colin Clive (Dr. Henry Frankenstein) goes mad and brings the monster of Frankenstein to life was well done. I could see how at the time as The Monster is hoisted up to the sky- opening of the roof during the thunderstorm and then slowly brought down, "coming to life" would have frightened movie-goers at the time. The special affects were really just the flashes of lightening. The make-up artist that created Boris Karloff's character of the Monster did an outstanding job.The scene of The Monster with the little girl at the pond was incredibly creepy though. The initial scenes where the Monster has a moment of befriending the little girl was sweet an innocent. Symbolically, the Monster may have imagined like the delicate flowers that floated on the water, the young girl would as well ? as he lifted her into his arms and threw her into the water. The follow-up scenes with the angry crowd searching for The Monster had fake, unreal looking scenery. But, then again, they had to do that within the 1930's budget and technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's actually kind of surprising that I've never taken the time to sit down and watch this classic since I'm such a huge fan of the genre. I'm also a fan of Boris Karloff. I've seen 1994's Frankenstein (with Robert Deniro playing the role of the Monster) years ago and thought it was superb, but this is coming from a person who has never read the novel that was first published in 1818 by Mary Shelley. Look, I'm almost finished Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by Gaston Leroux ? give me some time to improve my culture!Dr. Henry Frankenstein is an ex-medical student who creates and re- animates a monster ? everything from old body parts dug up in a cemetery to the brain of a criminal he stole from the laboratory of his old mentor, Dr. Waldman. Henry's fiancée is worried about his reclusive behavior and seeks to intervene in his affairs at the tower in which the experiment takes place. After the monster is brought to life (It's alive!), it escapes and causes panic among the local villagers. The ending of the tale is tragic, but one that is still recreated within horror movies today. It's worth mentioning that before the film begins, a gentleman comes out on stage and warns the audience of the horror to ensure. I know for a fact that this was parodied twice ? once, on an old Halloween episode of The Simpsons back in the early/mid 90's, and again serving as the intro to Rob Zombie's dark and sexually-exploitative cartoon, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto (2009).This movie, along with 1931's Dracula, are widely recognized as classics brought to you by Universal Studios. Depending on your level of patience, however, movies like this might have a difficult time relating to the audiences of today. I've heard critiques of this film claiming it to be "boring," "overrated," and "not scary." I don't accept the latter as a valid objection to the film's importance. It's simple to admit that not everyone prefers to exercise a strong insight when dealing with films, and it is for this reason that horror movies especially have a difficult time withstanding the test of time. Unless you are appreciative of the era and the courageous innovations of the time, the question of it being "scary" is unfounded. To speak realistically, older films like Frankenstein lose part of their effectiveness when dealing with the mainstream viewer. What about the advancements in makeup that were discovered by talented artists in the '30's? What about the set design? Does anyone mention the acting? If people aren't willing to accept that it took a tremendous amount of talent to make this film possible, then that's fine ? just don't come crying to me when the recent summer blockbuster is worthless tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Monster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of todays horror films and this movie is one that inspired a lot of the monster movies that came after it. The whole setting is very creepy with Fritz and Frankenstein stealing the casket then getting the brain at the college. One thing I didn't know before watching this film was that the brain that was put inside of the monster body was one that was from a criminal. That makes a lot more sense to me now that I know why the monster killed the little girl. The film is very short, only 70 minutes long and not many films today are less than an hour and a half. Watching it goes by very fast because you are so curious as to what is going to happen with the monster. This is the original in a long collection of the Frankenstein series, I am looking forward to watching the next one, even though it probably isn't as good. Some memorable scenes are when he says "It's Alive" and when he throws the little girl into the water. I was not expecting that to happen I thought it was going to show that he has changed and had feelings. When the dad of the little girl walks while holding the dead body it is disturbing and everyone who sees it is shocked. I recommend this film for any fan of todays monster or horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An iconic classic and Universal's first great horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit to not being a fan of the Frankenstein story or Shelley's novel. I'm more a "Dracula" person. From my perspective, being biased against "Frankenstein", this is a fantastic, hugely entertaining film and a big improvement over Universal's previous effort "Dracula". Peggy Webling's play, like most of the source material for these early Universal horror efforts, is not very faithful to the original novel so the die-hard Shelley fans may be disappointed.James Whale is one of the most unjustly neglected directors of this time period and unfortunately rarely discussed outside of limited circles, but he made a lot out of what he had and didn't waste his resources as many other studio directors at the time did. "Frankenstein" is blessed with spectacular, atmospheric sets, and a quality cast none of whom are bad and many of whom are quite excellent. Whale's work here keeps the film consistently exciting and at times quite eerie."Frankenstein" is seen by many as a masterpiece. I'm not quite sure it's that good, but it does have a magical, iconic quality and nothing is more proof of that than the fact that it remains one of the most remembered and respected films of the thirties, and is one that the general public is still more or less interested in 77 years after its release.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better as science fiction than horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this out of the way. The most enjoyable part of "Frankenstein" was when The Monster killed Edward Van Sloan's character. In all his movies ("Dracula," "The Mummy"), he plays a smug, all-knowing, plot-killer. "Frankenstein" would have been better without him. There, I said it.In all seriousness, I found the first half of the movie inventive, intriguing, mysterious, foreboding, suspenseful, and provocative. It worked as a science fiction movie. As a citizen, I would never approve of a Dr. Frankenstein conducting bizarre experiments on humans. As a movie viewer, I was gung-ho in support of the Colin Clive character being an anti-establishment renegade.In addition, watching The Monster adjust to life as a newborn was very interesting. He was very gentle, obeying his creator's commands like a puppy while walking harmlessly around the laboratory. Later, he fearfully reacts to his first sight of light while Dr. F. seeks to comfort him.I looked forward to 40 more minutes of watching the world from The Monster's perspective. (OK, I knew what was going to happen, but I try to block my knowledge so my review is fairer.) Unfortunately, the Van Sloan character, Dr. Waldman, stepped in and stuck a dagger into the story.The turning point of the movie was when Frankenstein's assistant scared The Monster by holding a torch a few feet from his head. Of course, he reacted negatively and throws a temper tantrum. Dr. Waldman urges Dr. F to "shoot it" and the creator makes the boneheaded decision of tying up The Monster and giving up on his experiment after one negative experience.This turnaround ruined the movie ? and makes no sense. Instantaneously, Frankenstein changes from a bold, imaginative rulebreaker into his mentor's sycophant and a conformist. His goal changes from creating life to getting married. This plot turn can't be more unoriginal. Boooring!!!!A large part of the second half of the movie is set in a castle where Dr. F's father has six, count them six, servants. I couldn't be less interested in Dr. F's private life. And somehow villagers who are determined to rid the world of The Monster become worshipers of the very scientist who created that Monster and anoint him as the leader of the anti-Monster group. Stuuupid!!!The story would have been far more interesting if Frankenstein told Waldman to shove it and the movie becomes a confrontation between Frankenstein and The Monster on the one side and the staid establishment on the other. The audience should have been rooting for Dr. F and The Monster.Given the story's turn, The Monster should have been much scarier. He kills two people who were trying to harm him and innocently and accidentally kills a little girl. In other words, the movie doesn't work as a horror story after having succeeded splendidly as science fiction until the plot turn.The plot turn also directs attention away from The Monster and toward the now boring doctor. This is devastating because the best post-turn scenes focus on The Monster trying to learn about life.Halfway through the movie, I was considering making it my first 10. Unfortunately, the transition from science fiction to predictable romance/weak horror compels me to award it a 7.ZWrite</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff creates the King of Monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always a treat to see James Whale's "Frankenstein," mostly for the thrill of Boris Karloff's classic performance, the one that made him "King of the Monsters" for all time. It's also a beautifully photographed film with distinctive Germanic-styled sets that make a strong bass counterpoint to the linear contours of the actors' faces and the scientific equipment that makes up Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory where he hopes to produce synthetic life out of the bodies of the dead. The film-makers have combined material from Mary Shelley's brilliant novel with elements of the popular theatrical version by John Balderston and the story of 19th Century grave-robbers Burke and Hare to create a film story full of grotesque details colored by powerful pathos.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive; the name was changed from the book's "Victor" to "Henry" for no discernible reason, and the fiancé's friend is now named "Victor") is the one doing the collecting, along with his deformed assistant Fritz (cult favorite Dwight David Frye). Mae Clarke is his fiancé Elizabeth and John Boles plays a humorously straight Victor. It's one of those old melodramatic conventions, reproduced from Shelly's novel, where the "good girl" has a "good guy" but unfortunately is in love with the "bad guy", in this case Herr Doctor. There's got to be about a million stories with this set-up (I just saw one last week in "Jesse James", with Tyrone Power as the villainous lover and Randolph Scott as the "more good than the good guy" protector dude), and I find it one of the film's more conventional and weaker aspects. Also objectionable to some extent is Frederick Kerr's Baron Frankenstein, who's supposed to be the source of the film's humor but just does not amuse modern audiences ? Whale improved at this type of humor in the second Frankenstein film and "The Old Dark House." The audience's sympathy of the monster is handled more forcefully and directly in "Bride", but one could argue it's actually stronger in the original film because of the relative subtlety. On an explicit level the film depicts Henry as a hero and the monster as a villain, but it's hard to imagine anyone hard-hearted enough to watch the film without pitying the monster. And a lot of this is particularly effective because of Karloff's profoundly dignified performance as much as it is the director's understated way of eliciting sympathy. First he's depicted in a horrific way, with 3 very effective close-ups of his face edited so that we get progressively closer to the monster. As long as the monster is captive in Frankenstein's castle he's frightening and dangerous, but as soon as he achieves freedom we start to see that he's only hurtful when confused or scared (something Dr. Pretorius makes explicit through dialog in "Bride"). The scene with the little girl, which was edited in a particularly unfortunate way in the original film's release (cutting off the scene before he throws her in the water leaves the scene open to sexual interpretations not intended by the film-makers), is particularly heartbreaking in its restored version. Karloff does use some noises that emphasize the animalistic aspects of the monster, but his face shows so much of the humanity that the contrast between the two is both pathetic and vaguely majestic. He truly is the King of Monsters, because he has so much dignity and yet everyone treats him as an animal. It does remind me of "The Elephant Man", actually ? the monster's plight connects with us much more than Henry or certainly his emotionally remote fiancé because there's a universal human element there. Physicality and mentality are odd bedfellows; rarely do they march strictly in synch. Unfortunately the story has, on the explicit level, watered down Shelley's contemplation in this regard by giving him an "abnormal" criminal brain, suggesting a physical determinism behind his more immoral actions. But the story's strength is only mildly diluted by this token explanation for a situation that is truly inexplicable; that is to say the fact that we seem to be angels (or devils) placed in the bodies of dogs, that our physical existence with all its associated bodily functions and dysfunctions provides the absurd counterpoint to our intellectual and moral facilities. And this really is the central problem in Shelley's "Modern Prometheus" fable ? the question of man "usurping the proper place of God" is only a small part of this larger question. Since Whale and the writers have made the decision to make the monster incapable of speech in this first film, this theme is conveyed through Karloff's physical performance, one that rises to the level of the great artistry of Lon Chaney from the silent era. It's one of those rare performances where the effect is so powerful and iconic that it's near impossible to imagine another actor in the role. And it's something that every person should see, and not just absorb through the osmosis of public opinion and highlight scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film that launched Boris Karloff as the King of Horror Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the second attempt to film "Frankenstein." (The earlier version filmed in 1910 by the Edison studio and featuring Charles Ogle as the creature, which looked more like a demented mummy.) But after the success of "Dracula" Universal Studios knew they were onto something. After Lugosi turned down the role as the creature, a little known extra on the Universal lot was chosen. William Henry Pratt adopted the more exotic sounding name of Boris Karloff, and it was as Karloff that he became a household word in "Frankenstein.With James Whale (earlier known for a version of the musical "Showboat") came on board motion picture history was made. With Mae Clark, Colin Clive, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye they created a film that will forever stand out among horror movies. Some people laugh at the film today, but this film will long remain a classic. Whale would also later go on and direct "The Bride of Frankenstein," regarded by many as an even better film, but this one set the tone for horror movies to come for almost four decades. Mel Brooks would later pay tribute to this film with his "Young Frankenstein," which also used the original lab equipment from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff's monster is still very much alive, even after seventy-six years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boris Karloff's first lumber as the monster still packs a lot of pathos. The way he uses his voice and his face is still stunning. The monster never speaks in this movie, yet he is by far the most interesting character. That is owed to Karloff's subtle performance which has been copied, and paid homage to, in countless movies. A close second is Colin Clive's Dr. Victor Frankenstein whose passion for science blinds him to the danger of creating life. Edward Van Slaon, who would play Van Helsing in Dracula, and Dwight Frye, who is in several Frankenstein movies as a different character, offer support. James Whale is forced to put some typical touches, like Victor's annoying wife and friend that date this movie and keep it from remaining great. The lack of music is also odd and doesn't do the movie any favors. It's effective, as it would be anyway, when it shouldn't be there; but in the scenes where the lack of music is noticeable, the film is hurt. All in all, still a very good movie, but it doesn't hold a torch to the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein.*Dr. Victor Frankenstein: "Alive. It's alive. It's alive!

		<shortDescription>Good monster movie, even though strictly speaking it isn't an adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first screen rendition, with sound, of the classic book by Mary Shelley. A determined scientist creates life artificially only to face the consequences.As far as this film is as an adaptation, it could very well qualify as Hollywood heresy. There is a RIDICULOUS simplification of the metaphorical and complex original story. Really only the simplest themes presented in a rather simple way, all in what is today a meager 71 minutes. Even the names of characters and places have been altered.That said, it WAS 1931 when this film was made - that's 76 years ago in 2007! For being 76 years old this film is pretty good looking and the elaborate laboratory set practically gave rise to the mad scientist cliché. The camera work is pretty good and there are plenty of classic shots with shadows, fire, and many different types of sets. The windmill set is particularly intriguing and the fiery climax on that very location has become one of the most influential climaxes in horror cinema. And deservedly so. Stephen Sommers had an homage to it in his 2004 mega-budget monster bash "Van Helsing." Interestingly so, it is this Hollywood magic that has given this movie an aura that is just as if not more influential than the book. With the right state of mind when you watch this movie - the fact that it is from 1931 - you can really see and appreciate the rise of the Hollywood monster (movie).Also try to catch the uncut version which contains a "shocking" scene by a tranquil lakeside that was cut for the initial release. It's completely tame by today's buckets-o-gore horror standard, but adds some depth and perspective to how much "horror" has changed over the years. --- 8/10Not rated, but would probably get a PG for some tense scenes. Also if you want to get your kid into horror flicks this is a good place to start.</fullReview>

This film is creepy beyond most films.Karloff does fine service as the monster. The rest of the cast in this serious film does great too. In fact, this one is good enough that the second film , The BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is well set up.One of the things that makes this film really scary is the sections where there is no background music or sounds. This is the cinema equivalent of scratching across a blackboard. The lack of sound makes what is really scary even worse as you mind tries to fill in the blankness with the events on the film.This film established UNIVERSAL as the monster film master for many years. Because of this franchise, the studio used the rights to these to make money for many years, &amp; Frankenstsin's likeness was used so often that the process of make-up was actually patented.The film is starting to suffer the ravages of old age, but the plot itself is ageless as recent remakes prove, but none of the remakes gets any eerier than the original.

Now he's just about ready to do it, all he needs is a brain with Fritz send out by Henry to the local medical collage to fetch one.Breaking into the medical school that night Fritz grabs the jar containing a normal human brain but as the bell tolled at midnight he, startled by the sound, dropped it and took in his haste a jar containing the brain of a just executed murderer. The brain being the last piece of the puzzle in Henry's experiment everything was ready for the big night, which was a predicted thunderstorm, for the body made up of different peoples body parts to get a jolt of lighting, or what Henry called the Great Ray, to bring it back to life. Being interrupted by his fiancée Elizabeth, Mae Clarke, and his two friends his professor in collage Dr. Waldman, Edward Von Slone, and Victor Moritz, John Boles,Henry allows them into his watchtower, or laboratory, and out of the rain to be in attendance and see history in the making; The Creation of LIFE!The thing that Henry had put together is lifted up on some kind of pulley and immediately struck by a lighting bolt and withing seconds it amazingly starts to move it's hand! This has Henry go into an hysterical fit screaming with satisfaction, to himself and all those who took him to be an insane lunatic. It Alive! It's Alive! and again It's Alive! Yes it,???, was alive all right and before the movie is finally over It will turn the peaceful and quiet little German village of Goldstadt into a house of horrors.Meek and harmless at first It, the Frankenstein monster, got very pi**ed at Fritz for constantly sticking a flaming torch in It's face. Taking pleasure at pestering the much bigger and stronger monster Fritz is later caught off guard by It who ends up breaking his neck and hanging him up in the watchtower dungeon. Sick and tired of being locked up It takes off, after murdering Dr. Waldman, and goes out into the light terrorizing the countryside. With one of It's victims being little Maria, Marilyn Harris, whom It accidentally killed by throwing her into the lake when It ran out of daisy peddles. Poor Maria was playing a game of daises with the big lug who, in his excitement, just got carried away with it and thus instinctively carried and dumped Maria into the lake where she drowned.The townspeople up in arms over what It did gather together and form a number of posses to get It before It gets them. The mob then chase It into a nearby windmill where It, after confronting and knocking him out, takes It's creator Dr. Henry Frankenstein along with It.Unforgeatable climax with It frantically holding off the good people of Goldstadt who are out to get It dead or alive and ending up trapped in the windmill as It threw Henry, who survived, out of it. With the windmill set on fire by the angry townspeople it was only a matter of time before It would be history. To everyones fear as well as delight It was come back over and over again in films and on the TV, that wasn't around back then in 1931. As the years went by with It becoming new and more improved, due to the evolution of movie special effects, It was to scare the hell out of future generations of moviegoers and TV watchers who were yet to be born when It was supposedly burned to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best of the original movie monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein, and this does not include the sequel Bride of Frankenstein, is probably the best made movie of the three big ones which include Dracula and The Wolf Man.All three of these movies are classics in their own right, but the one I seemed to like the most would have to be Frankenstein. Boris Karloff brings something to the role of the creature that makes one see that he was just a misunderstood victim in a cold world. Colin Clive was also very good as Henry Frankenstein, the man who created the monster, as were all the others. Not one of the characters is really made out to be evil, and I kind of liked seeing that in a movie.I also enjoyed the Gothic settings and scenery. This movie carried the right mood and lighting to create a wonderful atmosphere which is just the way it should be. When I think of Frankenstein, or even the other two films, I can easily pick up on why the scenery was so important to all three films. It is the type of scenery that should be a part of any movie which involves the three biggest monsters of all time.Frankenstein was probably the most thrilling of the three movies as well. When I compare the three I would say that Dracula faded near the end and The Wolf Man was just a little too much talk, but Frankenstein seemed to find the right amount of storytelling and character development to make it the most beloved of all the universal monsters. I haven't seen Bride of Frankenstein yet, but I've been told it's even better than Frankenstein. I guess I'll have to watch it and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, yet flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale's classic 'Frankenstein' is probably the single most influential horror film ever made. Certainly it set the course for 'talky' horror, and all monster-themed films succeeding it.Not much of Mary Shelley's classic Gothic novel remains in the film. I can't recall any of the original dialogue being used, actually. This film is actually based on a hit stage version of 'Frankenstein', so we can't be too critical. Unfortunately, valuable and fascinating elements of the novel are blatantly missing here, such as the Promethean motif, the exploration of scientific theory and the class-divide that exists between Frankenstein and his creation.But why did they change Frankenstein's first name to Henry in the film? In the book, Henry Clerval is the name of Frankenstein's dear murdered friend. Here, we have a 'Victor Moritz' as Frankenstein's buddy. It's a head-scratching idea, as Victor was a significant name for Shelley's overreaching male protagonist. Also the addition of the brainless Fritz will leave most fans of the novel giggling with amusement.Let's look at what we've got here instead of focusing on what we don't have. We have Karloff, extraordinary in the role as the tortured creation. His performance is not just shock value. Karloff oversteps the gruesome make-up to create a sympathetic portrayal of a 'freak' that did not wish to be created. His incoherent mumbling and reaching hands say a lot more than any 'profound' speeches. Karloff would be known for this for all his working life.Colin Clive is camp and over-the-top as the scientist obsessed with creating new life. The lovely and unfortunately forgotten Mae Clarke, best known for taking a faceful of grapefruit from James Cagney in 'The Public Enemy', plays Elizabeth, the object of Frankenstein's affections. But the cast member(who only occupies the screen for about 5 minutes) that impressed me most was Marilyn Harris as Little Maria.In probably the best scene of the film, Little Maria befriends the monster at a lake near her house. She is the only one who can look past his ghoulish appearance and treat him with respect. We even see a smile from Karloff's creature as he engages with the little girl in her game of tossing flowers in the water. Sadly, he is untrained in the acts of man, so when the flowers run out he simply (and naturally for him) tosses Maria in too. She drowns.The impact of the viewer is pronounced. We are actually sympathetic for the monster here. He commits murder, but he does show remorse for his actions, and how was he to know what was right and wrong in the first place? Tragic.This isn't scary by today's standards, it's more atmospheric than anything else. The graveyard scenes at the start are a little spooky though. The film has no score, a device used to distinguish this early 'talkie' from the silent era. The lack of a score adds to this film. We don't need screeching music to tell us when we should be shocked.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>masterpiece of Gothic horror and the best of the classic Universal horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a near masterpiece of Gothic horror and the best of the classic Universal horror movies. The first 30 minutes of this film are near perfection and some of the most memorable moments caught on film. If there is any weakness in the film, it comes in the middle. We have such a tremendous opening and a climax at the thirty minute point. The pace of the film slows down in the middle as Dr. Frankenstein tires to train his creation. It then picks up again at the end to the wonderful conclusion and second climax of the film.The movie does a wonderful job in creating sympathy for the Monster. The Monster is a victim of misunderstanding in the movie. The theme of man's obsession to play God and fact that man shouldn't is wonderfully done also.Like many movies of the early 1930's there was no score. This was done to distinguish them from the silent era. The lack of a score adds tremendously to the mood, atmosphere, and tension of the movie. The movie has a lot of inspiration from German expressionist horror and the Gothic horror movie, The Man Who Laughs (1928).Colin Clive is outstanding as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. His performance is a bit over the top, but that just adds to the surreal atmosphere of this film. Karloff is the perfect choice for the Monster. He is almost larger than life in the role. The supporting cast also does a very solid job.This is a must see movies of the early 1930's for all fans of classic films or classic horror. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" certainly is among the better monster movies ever, and quite possibly among the better movies of all time. It has a strong message about horror and innocence, and it delivers it very well.It is, however, flawed. Like many early sound films, the transition from acting in silent movies to talkies hasn't quite settled on many of the actors, and there are a number of exaggerated facial expressions and staccato and clumsy line readings. The make up is also a bit over the top, and not all of the characters, especially the extras, seem to care too much. The German language is horrible, and the depiction of Switzerland (at least that's where it is supposed to be in the book, despite the Bavarian look) is that of an anachronistic village, where 30's suits and sophisticated headphones exist, but guns don't. I also think that Henry Frankenstein's reflections on what he has created and what he must do is too quick and his decision too relentless.What does make it brilliant is that it has a very good cast in some of the characters. Boris Karloff steals the show from his entrance to his exit. He is simply brilliant as a misunderstood monster. While Edward van Sloan (dr. Waldman) and Dwight Frye (Fritz) are good, the second best performance is that of Michael Mark, the father of the unfortunate little girl. The adaptation of the story is also good. One is reminded of Nietzsche's "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster", for surely the villagers are out of control, lusting for the blood of an innocent. The end is also wonderfully enigmatic.In conclusion, this film is great for four simple reasons: Boris Karloff, a handful of other actors, great scenography and the end. The minor faults I have blown out of proportions are easy enough to ignore. I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Original Horror Greats!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein from 1931 is definitely one of the great original horror films. Though not exactly considered to be real scary by today's standards, it was probably the first talkie to be considered a very scary picture during the time of The Great Depression.Even though movies didn't have soundtracks back in the early '30's, this was still a well made film, with very fabulous acting. Boris Karloff was and will always be the definitive Frankenstein Monster. It's a shame he only portrayed the monster in only 3 films. Colin Clive's is truly sensational as the brilliant, but obviously obsessed scientist Dr. Frankenstein. Another standout actor that we have is Edward Van Sloan, who portrayed Van Helsing in Dracula which came out the same year as Frankenstein. Here here also plays a scientist who was Henry's mentor at one time. However, Dr Waldman would not defeat the Frankenstein monster as he did with Dracula. He unfortunately would be one of the monster's victims. The main story revolves around Dr. Frankenstein's determination to create a human being from dead corpses, but for good causes. However, while constructing his new creation he is completely unaware that the brain he inserted is a criminal brain that his deformed assistant Fritz seemed to take by mistake. Fritz is portrayed by character actor Dwight Frye who like Van Sloan, also appeared in Dracula. Once the doctor realizes his creation is a monstrous fiend he asks his mentor to try and destroy it. However, the monster murders him and then escapes the laboratory and starts to run amok around the village.After his escape we come upon perhaps the most famous of the Frankenstein scenes where the monster comes across a little girl tossing flower petals in the lake, and watching them float. The monsterthinking she will float, too decides to throw her in the lake, but has no idea that she drowns to death. The whole village which includes Henry decides to form a mob to hunt down the creature before he kills more innocent people. Then we come to the climax where it's creator vs. creation, as the doctor meets the monster face to face. The monster will carry the unfortunate scientist into a windmill pursued by the entire village. Henry attempting to escape the clutches of his creation, is thrown from the top of the windmill and almost meets his demise. Then all of the angry villagers burn down the mill with their torches assuming they actually destroyed him. However, long before Michael, Jason, and Freddy were even thought of Frankenstein is probably the first horror anit-hero the audience realizes doesn't die very easy. We will eventually discover that in the Bride of Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Frankenstein"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real chiller. Directed by James Whale, it's a bold adaptation of the Mary Shelley story, and has Boris Karloff in the role as the iconic monster constructed from human body parts by a mad scientist (Colin Clive). As I'm sure with most conscious viewers, they could walk away from "Frankenstein" with tears in their eyes. Not tears of fear or joy, but sympathy. Because that is what Frankenstein is, an object of sympathy, not horror. He knows not what he is or why, and in the story, not the film, the mad scientist rejects his creation instead of embracing it. But you don't hold something as big as that against it, do you? Of course not, otherwise this 1931 film wouldn't remain a horror classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal Monster Classics: Frankenstein...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931) was one of the first monster movie classics to come from the Hollywood film studios. The was adapted "loosely" from the original Mary Shelley Gothic classic. A lot of this film was based upon several other earlier German expressionism films and a play. But this film was a landmark. It spawned several official sequels, scores of knock-offs and it made Boris Karloff a horror film legend.The movie is about Dr. Frankenstein and his stooge Igor. One day, the good doctor discovers that he can bring life to a mix-and-match body. All he needs is the perfect brain for his specimen. Will Igor find a "perfect" cranium? Can Dr. Frankenstein really create life? How does his wife cope with his "eccentric" husband? You'll find out the answers to all of these questions when you watch James Whale's Frankenstein!!A classic film that has held up pretty well over the years. I have to strongly recommend this movie! Followed by The Bride of Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic That Will Never Go Out Of Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the monster that stars in this film, FRANKENSTEIN (1931) will never die. Films like this are great without big special effects and without the latest stars, therefore it is impossible for them to go out of style.So we have this doctor, Victor Frankenstein, who is a very ambitious scientist. He wants to do the ultimate science experiment: 'BRINGING THE DEAD, BACK TO LIFE' or as it is in his mind: 'CREATING HIS OWN HUMAN BEING'So he and his deformed helper Fritz go into the graveyard and dig up a dead body. But the brain inside the head of the body is useless, so Fritz goes to a school for science and steals a brain. But what Fritz doesn't realize, is that the brain he steals is the brain of a killer.So when Fritz returns to the lab with this evil brain, they go they're experiment, and end up bringing a dead body back to life. Little do they know, that because of they're project, all hell will soon break loose.I have a warning for some of you people. I have not read the book yet, but from what I hear, the book and FRANKENSTEIN (1931) are two very different films. From what I hear, the film MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN starring Robert DeNiro is the closest movie to the book.But other then that small fact, I think that any fan of Classic Horror will be able to enjoy FRANKENSTEIN (1931). It has a very strong story, very strong performances, and one of the best endings in film history.There is currently a box set out which contains the classic FRANKENSTEIN SERIES, Dracula SERIES, AND WOLF MAN SERIES. I recommend that box set to anybody who loves the old universal horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Alive!....It's Alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" is the classic gothic tale from the pen of Mary Shelley that spawned a whole series of films based on the character of Frankenstein's monster. This film together with "Dracula", both produced by Universal, launched the popular horror cycle of the 30s. The film opens in a graveyard during a funeral. Laying in wait to rob the grave are the ambitious young doctor Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunchbacked assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye). Frankenstein is experimenting with the creation of life. He has assembled a body from the body parts of recently deceased persons. All that is needed is a brain to enable him to achieve his goal. Fritz is sent to the university to steal a brain. Unfortunately he steals an abnormal criminal brain. Meanwhile, Henry's fiance Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his father Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) and his friend Victor Moritz (John Boles) have concerns over Henry's mysterious experiments. Elizabeth and Victor enlist the aid of Henry's mentor Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) to go to Henry's laboratory and try to bring him to his senses. Henry claims not to be a madman and decides to allow them to see his creature brought to life. The creature (Boris Karloff) is at first docile and kept in the dark. He is gaining knowledge and strength but is being tormented by Fritz. Finally the monster's criminal brain comes to the fore and...... This film is memorable for its tall elaborate set pieces and laboratory sequences. Director James Whale has most of the action take place at night so that the shadows and mystery are heightened. He keeps us in suspense by not showing the monster until well into the film. And even then the monster backs into the picture before turning around and revealing the now famous Jack Pierce makeup created for Karloff. Karloff in his first major role, plays the monster convincingly. At first he is a little bewildered at the happenings, turns nasty, invokes pathos in the scene with Little Maria (Marilyn Harris) and finally shows fear and panic in the final scenes. No mean feat with all of that makeup. Actually the part of the monster was first offered to Bela Lugosi in the wake of his success in "Dracula", but to his everlasting regret, he turned it down. Karloff got the role and the rest as they say is history. In an interesting opening, Edward Van Sloan talks to the audience, preparing them for what they are about to see. Van Sloan and Dwight Frye had also appeared in "Dracula". Frye again steals the scenes in which he appears. It has always been a mystery to me as to why this great character actor didn't have more success. Followed by several sequels, the first of which, "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935) is considered by many to be the best of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film which introduced 'Karloff' to the movie audiences as the monster created by Dr Frankenstein, the monster which does have some human feelings, is still powerful when viewed today.Edward Van Sloan, Mae Clarke, and John Boles are memorable foils to the more wacky performances - Colin Clive is extremely effective as the scientist who starts with what he sees as a good idea, but is quickly pulled into madness; while Dwight Frye is good value as Fritz, the freak who takes the brain of a criminal to be used in the assembly of Frankenstein's creation.The full version of the film was not seen until the 1980s, and was well worth it - the scene with Little Maria being put back in full - while the sinister prologue is retained ('we warned you!'). This is a prime example of the horror classics Universal put out in its heyday, when its emblem was still the plane circling the globe. It didn't need gore or an over-abundance of special effects, and remains one of the best of the James Whale films.</fullReview>

He builds a man,out of dead body parts,but his hunchback assitant Fritz,gives Frankenstein an abnormal brain,and he puts it in his man. Once reanimated the man becomes a child like monster,and runs a havoc on the village of Frankenstein. The villagers do not understand and go to kill him.James Whale's Frankenstein is a classic monster film,though not very scary,it makes you think,and still has the power to fascinate me every time I watch it. Karloff is the monster Period. The role was made for him,and no one else! Jack Pierce did a terrific job with the life like make-up. Whale's directing is perfect! A Great tribute to the silent horror films,and a new beginning of the talkie horror films. The acting by Colin Clive and crew is also excellent. Edward Van Sloan is my particular favorite besides Karloff. See it for a classic which it is. A very high 4/4!</fullReview>

I really enjoyed this film and through all that make-up, Boris Karloff showed the monster was more than just a rampaging beast. Even though it is briefly shown in the tragic "Maria" scene, the monster showed that he did have a gentler side, but because of his immature nature this quality would have tragic consequences. This would later be shown with greater effect in the follow-up, Bride of Frankenstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's few relevant things left to say about this one, except that you have to see it for yourself. Many will encourage you to endure it so you can move on to Part II, Bride of Frankenstein. I put it to you that they could not be more wrong.Frankenstein kick-started a short but unparalleled and incredibly successful run of monster movies for Universal, many of them based on classic literature. Mary Shelly's imperfect novel nevertheless contained an incredibly original monster and some powerful themes, and the creative team behind this effort have streamlined and adapted them with surprising sophistication. The monster design has long become a staple of popular culture, a fact not helped by Mel Brooks' spot-on parody. It is to the credit of all involved that the original remains so powerful, a fact in no small part aided by James Wale's expert direction and a star-making turn from Boris Karloff - here cheekily credited as a question mark. It is both Gothic in its aesthetic and minimalistic in its construction, yet surprisingly fluent for an early talking feature.The horror film has evolved a lot since, and not necessarily in a positive way. Frankenstein remains one of the most effective, precise and affecting monster films ever made. See it and marvel at the complete mastery on display.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film at an age when I would naturally dislike black and white films, but I was hooked with the way it introduced the monster and the famous cries of "It's Alive, It's Alive" by Colin Clive. Boris Karloff even though an excellent and only choice was not director Whales first choice. Bela Lugosi who had recently made Dracula for Universal was asked to play the monster but declined. The reason for refusing the part according to AMC and Tim Burton's Ed Wood is that he wouldn't be recognized as an actor, also he didn't like to play mute. Well back to the review, Karloff is excellent as the Monster, and Mae Clarke is agreeable as Elizabeth (I like the Bride's Elizabeth more).I recommend this film only to those who can appreciate the way film is shown and to those who consider themselves as movie buffs.

		<fullReview>A mad scientist becomes consumed with the thought of creating life by using body parts from corpses. He succeeds, but what he doesn't realize is that he's created a monster. Every horror fan has to see this movie at least once. It's a bit creaky at times! New horror fans might feel bored by it, but people who appreciate genuine horror should love it. It's loaded with eerie atmosphere, making sure you never feel fully comfortable. There is always a sense of dread and misery. The black and white adds to the atmosphere. It's tragic, beautiful, even romantic. There is also some potent cruelty as well. A little girl drowns (Ouch!) that scene is powerful in many ways. The Monster didn't try to murder her, he just wanted to play. That's one of the things that makes it so heartbreaking. That's just one of the many memorable scenes. Some of the acting is uneven, but it features two legendary performances. Boris Karloff gives one of the greatest performances in the history of horror. He manages to make the monster humane, vulnerable, even sympathetic at times. That's not an easy feat! Colin Clive is just as good! Arrogance, insanity, brilliance, madness, are just some words to describe his character. We get an in-depth look into the demented mind of Henry Frankenstein. Colin manages to convey all his emotions perfectly. He becomes a damaged and reluctant hero. He may not have murdered the people, but he may as well be one. He created the monster! It was a dynamic performance. Edward Van Sloan gives a fun performance as Henry's mentor. I've always enjoyed his work. Mae Clark is plastic in her role, but much better than Valerie Hobson was in Bride of Frankenstein. This movie may seem dated these days, but it was very daring for its time. I think it holds up beautifully myself. It's a beautiful horror movie! An essential viewing for horror buffs. I think it's better than the slightly overpraised, Bride of Frankenstein. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein - My Overall Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, to be honest, was expecting to really like this film but I couldn't find myself getting into it. It had nothing to do with the atmosphere or its "creepy", gloomy mood, but mainly with how it was executed. I'm mot sure what put me off about it but it didn't really thrill me at all. Maybe it was because I've already been surrounded by the culture of Frankenstein and was bored by it? I can't really say which came first, but whatever I didn't like in this film had nothing to do with how it is as a movie in general and it's mostly my personal preferences.One thing that I really liked was its similarities to Noir film, with all the darkness and attention to shadow as a means to expression. Things like that are always fun to watch, and despite its campy acting everything seemed well put together.I wasn't too thrilled with Frankenstein, however, because his character just came off as simplistic as it can get. If I had to go for a Frankenstein, it would be the version that Glen Wilder played in Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks, because his interpretation, while humorous, managed to make him intriguing. The original Frankenstein character, of all things, was unlikable. Nothing to do with the actor, mind you, but I could not attach myself to him.I enjoyed the monster, however, because it was portrayed in a light that didn't play him off as completely innocent yet managed to show that he was a thoughtful person with emotions and feelings. I believe their portrayal of this message towards the audience was good, but it could have been better. Maybe I've been spoiled by other films that managed to fill in a broader concept of Frankenstein's monster, but for the first adaption I can see where others grasped it from.I also HATED the ending. Very anti-climatic and unresolved. It felt like the director got sick of working on the film and went on a permanent coffee break. It felt very lazy and I wish they added more to it, or at least show how Frakenstein reacted to this, or even give him some character development upon realizing the implications of what his monster really was capable of.In general, though, I wish I liked this movie more than I do, but I appreciate it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein has got to be one of my favourite books of all time, so when I found out that I would have to watch the movie for a class, I was overjoyed. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed when watching the actual movie. While the film is good technically, with a very mobile camera, great balance and compositions and fair editing; as well as great actors (Even I will admit that Boris Karloff played the Frankenstein monster marvelously well), and very interesting character (Which, in my opinion, makes up for the so-so plot), it deviates so far from the original plot of the book that I was soured to the whole film. A great movie by itself, but it pales in comparison with the book, obviously. One really amazing technical/cinema graphic element that I will note is the long shot of the little girl's father walking into town with her body. Truly outstanding, if only for the technical elements</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not one of my favorite movies that I recently watched. Frankenstein was nothing like the book but I know they filmed the movie more off the play. During the movie, in many spots it would go to fast or to slow. It was almost like they couldn't keep the speed consistent because they were trying to go with the film. Films should stay at one pace, if you want it to be slow and have action it is fine. I feel they just couldn't get it right. Also the camera angles were not as spectacular as some other movies made within this time frame. I think what really hurt this film was it had to much going on, one minute Dr, Frankenstein is create the monster and next thing you know he is getting married. Overall I do have some respect for this movie because it was one of the first monster movies made and the later movies really fixed that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people are gonna hate me for saying this, but I honestly don't like this movie that much. I know Frankenstein is the most famous monster of all time, but as the most famous monster, I think Frankenstein should follow the original source that inspired it to become famous! The book! Like most people, I don't like it when movies based on books are nothing like the book, but this is FAR from that. This doesn't even have the same characters! (I mean it does, but the characters don't have the right names, they are switched around). And in this movie, the characters aren't likable! Dr. Frankenstein is just a nut-ball mad scientist who robs graves. In the book, he was an interesting man who had a likable personality. I do dislike this movie for being nothing at all, AT ALL like the book, But its still a great movie! It has approved some of the things from the book (While the book is still far superior) like for example, in the book, Dr. Frankenstein's goal was to create life. Which he succeeds at doing completely! But he doesn't care that it was a mission success, he regrets doing it JUST BECAUSE its ugly. Thats it! While in the movie, he doesn't really care if its ugly or not, hes just happy that its alive. So yeah, even though I hate that its nothing like the book, its still a great movie. And i'm glad I saw it. (I just wish I saw it before I read the book).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that a film can never totally live up to the depth and detail of it's source novel but as a fan of Mary Shelley's masterpiece Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus, John Whale's film Frankenstein(1931) was a great disappointment from a story perspective. The novel is populated by rich and deep characters and emotions while the film lacks all of the complexity and humanity of the novel and replaces it with flat cartoon characters. I can certainly see how the over-the-top performances and easy to understand story are easily accessible to audiences but I just have a hard time giving a favorable rating to such a shallow film. It is indeed a visually arresting picture with very striking style of lighting and incredibly interesting and evocative sets and locations but without a compelling and meaningful story the wonderful mise en sc?ne of the film is wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have viewed James Whale's "Frankenstein" twice for academic purposes, and once for pure cinematic pleasure. And while many critics and fans will leap at the opportunity to hail the film's genius (or even champion it as the greatest horror movie ever made), I can't say I've ever been particularly impressed with it--there are good things to be said about it, certainly (most notably Boris Karloff's absolutely tragic portrayal of the Monster), but nearly as many distractions and miscalculations. The most notable flaw (which also afflicts Universal's "Dracula") is wandering too far afield of Mary Shelley's source novel, which took a more meditative dramatic approach to things (and free of extravagant setpieces like the lightning-storm "birth"); here, the screenplay is derived from a stage production, and it shows--a lot of the soap-opera styled dramatics over Henry Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) marriage to Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) seem present to make the material palatable to a wide audience, rather than capitalize on the tense dramatic moments of Shelley's text. Also distracting is the character of the Baron (Frederick Kerr), who plays Henry's father as an endlessly drunk, nattering wino thrown into an expensive suit (the film's syrupy epilogue is made that much worse by his participation). All that aside, Whale has an excellent visual eye, cribbing from the German expressionists ornate, dream-like sets (conveyed through eerie long shots) and images that can be quite profound (the dazed father carrying his drowned daughter past celebrating townsfolk) and tragic (the extreme long shot of the burning windmill). There is also much strength in the performances of Clive and Karloff, their respective roles chipping away at the dramatic density of the script and winding up closer to Shelley's insights on human nature--when Whale seamlessly cuts from the Monster's face to Henry's at the climax, it is quite clear that "the greater evil" isn't so clear-cut. "Frankenstein" is a film worth watching, but I don't think I am alone in favoring the Hammer versions, which made the human dramatics synchronous with the over-arching storyline, and took themselves seriously enough to eliminate clownish roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deserved Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" is really nothing like the Mary Shelley book on which it is based, but it instead takes the story and makes it something all its own. Gone are the philosophical and allegorical qualities of the novel, and in its place is a much simpler tale about man's responsibility to the things he creates and the dangers inherent when Mankind tries to play God.Like "King Kong" two years later, "Frankenstein" manages to create an incredible amount of sympathy for its villain. Like Kong, Frankenstein's monster doesn't ask to be unleashed on the civilized world; it's not really his fault that he doesn't know how to function in it. There are gorgeous moments in this film, like the scene when the monster communicates with a little girl by the side of a lake, all the more effective because the scene quickly transitions to one of horror.And as is typical for films released in the very early days of the 30s, this movie looks better and more technologically advanced than many films that came out in the succeeding decade. The camera is more fluid, there's a more imaginative use of light and shadow, and the effects, especially in the scenes where Dr. Frankenstein brings his creation to life, and later when the angry mob has trapped the monster in a windmill and is burning it to the ground, are quite good."Frankenstein" is considered one of the great all-time monster movies, but it's not scary so much as it is sad and fairly moving.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not the unfaithfulness to the book that bothers me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, the filmmakers weren't at all interested in being faithful to the novel if they were going to make a movie only 71 minutes long; why even point it out? The problem I have with the movie is the story; particularly a very large hole in the plot (among other lesser faults). I'm speaking specifically of the fact that the villagers immediately seem to know all about Frankenstein's monster and that he's killed a little girl, when it's never established that he's been seen by anyone outside Frankenstein's inner circle (except the girl that he kills). Maybe I missed something, but I don't think so. This might be a small point, but would it have been too much to add some more running time to the movie to round out the story a little more? Also disappointing is the fact that nobody seems to blame Frankenstein for the monster's existence. He essentially gets off scott free, except for any lingering guilt he might suffer, but this, as well as any character development, is not sufficiently explored. The movie gets the mood and the visuals right, but nothing else. I hate to say it, but if this film wasn't considered a groundbreaking classic with an iconic figure it might almost've been a prime candidate for MSTK treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly, it's not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bottom line is that the 1931 version of Frankenstein isn't for everyone. However, it's completely silly to compare it to something it isn't. Whale made a version in 1931, Branagh made a version in 1994. The former's only kinship to the novel is in name, the latter is far more faithful to the original text. The original in black and white, the new film in color. The first, filled with Hollywood clunk and bang, the second, with a stronger cast, but less charm for those familiar with the original. I like them both for different reasons. As for comparisons of Frankenstein with films made in that same period, another straw man. Certainly the Hollywood of 1931 couldn't compare to the German film makers of the same period, there's no comparison. Frankenstein isn't as good a film as "M", Karloff was not the actor Peter Lorre was. And that's coming from someone who loves Boris Karloff. But all of this is beside the point.The point is that, with every viewing, those of us who like this film see all the flaws in the work. We're not blind. But despite the flaws in the script, despite the shortcomings of the cast and the Hollywood studio system, a group of stock actors with a largely unknown leading actor created a work that became a piece of art . The work is a legend, like it or not, and deserving of the respect granted all legends. Even Frida Kahlo-who was never a person enamored with American pop culture- considered it one of her favorite films. The monster created by Karloff has become an archetype. The film represents something that belongs to an earlier generation of horror film enthusiasts, and has entered the realm of mass consciousness, as any powerful work of magic will. Moreover, it is an archetype film students will be looking at for a long time, and this, I think, is the thing that galls the film's detractors. There are only a handful of horror films that may safely be called classic, and this little fact is likely to remain the status quo. Frankenstein is going to be on this very short list for a long time to come. Pigeons in the grass, alas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frankenstein," based on the novel by Mary Shelley, really helped define what horror films are today. It contributed to society. It has spawned countless sequels and re-makes, including Kenneth Branaugh's 1994 gothic thriller "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." It is, in all sense of the word, a classic. Colin Clive plays Dr. Henry Frankenstein: a man scientist who has been isolated for a long time, and has been trying to regenerate human life. Boris Karloff expertly plays the monster, who is so often today confused as Frankenstein himself, when Frankenstein is really Dr. Henry Frankenstein -- the mad scientist. Henry Frankenstein really created the "mad scientist" of today, that we see recreated all the time, and spoofed even more in such films as "Young Frankenstein."  This film, regardless of what others say oor where it is on IMDb, is on my top 250. 5/5 stars -- that goes for all the MGM classics.John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale's Frankenstein is a VERY loose adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel. The spirit of the film is preserved in its most basic sense, but the vast majority of the story has been entirely left out, which is unfortunate. The monster, for example, who possesses tremendous intellect in the novel and who goes on an epic quest seeking acceptance into the world in which he was created, has been reduced to little more than a lumbering klutz whose communication is limited to unearthly shrieks and grunts. Boris Karloff was understandably branded with the performance after the film was released, because it was undeniably a spectacular performance, but the monster's character was severely diminished from the novel. James Whale's adaptation of the story of Frankenstein, while it is clearly and deservedly a horror classic, is tremendously less than it could have and SHOULD have been. There are unexplainable deviations from the novel, such as the fact that Dr. Frankenstein's name was, for some reason, changed from Victor in the novel to Henry in the film, and the film itself really only covers about a quarter to a third of one chapter in the book ? that's how much has been left out. There was probably only about 5% or 6% of the full story included in this film, and I am willing to guess that the sheer magnitude of ignored material in the original story is at least as much of a reason that there were so many subsequent Frankenstein films (and Re-Animators and whatnot) as was the film's commercial success. This may, in fact, be one of those rare cases where the imitators may have just wanted to do it right, or at least tell the REST of the story. Despite the fact that there was such a huge amount of material that was sadly left out of the film, it is still to be praised for many different reasons. Boris Karloff, for example, delivered a wonderful performance as Frankenstein's monster, and Colin Clive was absolutely amazing as Dr. Frankenstein. The make-up, especially (and obviously) on the part of the monster, was wonderfully disturbing, and even though so much was left out of the original story, it was clear that the monster was not inherently evil. The entire portion of the novel that is told from the monster's point of view is left out, the vast majority of his unfortunate experiences and his responses to them are removed at the expense of his character, his attempt to get Dr. Frankenstein to make him a female monster so that he will have companionship is left out, and his fascination with the world he found himself in was left out as well (he read Paradise Lost just because it was interesting to him and to learn about that world!). I was also slightly bothered by the way the `criminal brain' was so often mentioned, because the monster was really a good creature that was driven to commit bad deeds because he was so badly treated because of his appearance. The book had so much to say about the way people treat people who are different, and that entire message is lost when we're constantly reminded that it's a criminal brain. The monster was reduced in that way to little more than a mindless villain, and the movie itself was reduced to nothing more than a typical horror movie. (spoilers) The scene where the monster is playing with the little girl near the end of the film was one of the few where it is actually made clear that he is just a creature that is unfamiliar with the world around him, and that he does have a heart inside him, regardless of the fact that it may have been dead for a while. This little girl was throwing daisies into the water, and she gave some to the monster to throw in, too. He was thrilled to no end, and when he ran out of daisies, he threw the girl in. He didn't know that she couldn't swim or even that she would NEED to swim, he just got such a kick out of throwing things out of the water that he didn't see the difference between a flower and a little girl. The rage that followed his unintentional act was one of the closest moments in the film where the misunderstanding of the world towards him was captured. Of course, I tend to doubt that Shelley intended the searches for the monster in her novel to be conducted by gigantic mobs of angry people all carrying torches and screaming at the top of their voices. This is not something that would be entirely difficult to avoid. At any rate, the whole movie has already begun to wind down at this point, and a death for the monster at the hands of the angry mob is invented for the film at the expense of the story. It is tragic that the amazing ending of Shelley's novel was left entirely out of the film, but it is also easy to understand because of budget and production limitations. This is an ironic and unfortunate example of a film that would have really been considered a lot better than it is if it were not for the book upon which it is based. It is clear that the film is strong and that it is well made, but when compared to Shelley's novel, it's really a pretty sad mess. The film by itself is more than able to captivate and impress, but to someone who knows the original story, it is a weak attempt to bring the story of Frankenstein and his monster to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the original Frankenstein movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1910 the famous father of the electric light bulb and inventor extraordinary, Thomas Alva Edison in association with J. Searle Dawley are credited with directing the 16 minute short version of "Frankenstein." There were only three actors, The Monster, Dr. Frankenstein, and Elizabeth. According to the review for that movie, there is only one print still in existence owned by a private collector.Thus, this 1931 version has become known as the "original" Frankenstein movie put to film from Mary Shelly's book. Although I have viewed this movie many times over the past 50 years, I didn't realize that it had many "campy" parts to it until I watched it for this review. The opening credits are silly with the many "eyes" revolving around a face. The American Movie Classics host stated that Bela Lugosi was originally offered the part of the "Monster" but because there were no speaking lines (other than monster grunts) and it required the monster character to wear 40 pounds of makeup and props/shoes, neck bolts, etc., Mr. Lugosi turned down the part. All the better. Mr. Lugosi made a premiere Dracula in that same year and Boris Karloff was of a taller stature to better play "The Monster."Colin Clive is not believable as a German Baron's son, Henry Frankenstein. He acts too British. Henry is too British a name. I prefer the character to be called Victor von Frankenstein. I think he became famous for his almost hysterical fanatical cry of "It's alive!" As, Gene Wilder makes fun of this in the comedy version of "Young Frankenstein." The hunchback lab assistant is misnamed. Although called "Fritz" which passes for German, the name "Igor" better fits the role! Dwight Frye is the tormentor of the monster by whipping him with a bull whip and teasing him with fire. The monster hangs him for these acts. Dwight Frye gave a better and more rememberable performance in the more important role of the lunatic and fly-eating Renfield in the movie Dracula! "We're here, Master! (maniacal laugh coming from the ship's hold)."Dr. Waldman, Dr. Frankenstein's university professor is played by Edward van Sloan. The monster strangles him! Mr. van Sloan is also remembered for his critical portrayal of Professor Van Helsing as Dracula's nemesis.Fredrick Kerr as Baron von Frankenstein is also too British in his demeanor. His character is too self-centered and thinks that the towns people are like little "pets" when they all show up for the wedding of young Henry Frankenstein to Elizabeth.Elizabeth, (Mae Clarke) also is too British. Of course, it's easier for her to get away with it because she could be British and not having any other family there for the wedding. Maybe she's an orphan or a liberated woman of the times! We can tell that John Boles as Victor Moritz loves Elizabeth. In fact, Elizabeth knows it and brushes off his attempt at showing his affection when he fawns all over her while they are sitting on the sofa. He hangs on her every breath. Henry von Frankenstein, however, knows that his friend Victor has amorous feelings for Elizabeth. When Henry leaves to kill the monster he entrusts Victor to take care of Elizabeth with a look to suggest that "if I get killed you marry her!"We all remember the scene of Ludwig carrying his dead little Maria into the village during the wedding celebration. Michael Mark received no screen credits for his vivid but short appearance so we now credit him for all to know. Marilyn Harris played little Maria. The monster threw her into the lake where she drowned and not down a well as some may think!Let's not forget the righteous indignation of Herr Burgomaster played by Lionel Belmore. By the time he organizes the search/lynching party it's nightfall and they all take off into the woods and mountains with torches and hounds to find the monster. Really bright, huh!Somehow, we tend to believe that medical school dropout Frankenstein created his monster in an old castle. It was a run down and abandoned "watch tower" (look-out) on top of a mountain.No, the Monster did not die in the fire at the windmill. Otherwise we would not have 89 more "Frankenstein" movies made about the same story!Somehow, the casting of characters did not come to fruition until the beautiful Teri Garr (Inga) teams up with the comedy genius of Gene Wilder as Herr Baron Victor von Frankenstein and his legendary assistant "Igor" (pronounced "eye-gor") Marty Feldman and Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn). Peter Boyle is a sympathetic monster. Now, this is a real Frankenstein worthy of a 10!I gave the 1931 version an "8" because of it's being too British-y! Mr. Karloff, of course, deserves a "10."</fullReview>

I was not entertained the entire time and found myself bored. Everything was predictable, I always found myself guessing what would happen next, and was always correct. (Even the scene in which the monster kills the young girl, I saw that coming the minute she entered the storyline). I have enjoyed every film from the 1930s that I have viewed thus far and this is one I would never watch again. I can appreciate Boris Karloff's acting as it was very impressive for the difficult non-speaking part he had to play. And I did like the underlying sympathy that I found myself feeling for the monster and his odd relation to a newborn discovering the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are aspects of this classic horror which which may be termed as 'dated' and are poor quality. I am afraid this does detract from the viewing experience. These faults are mostly explained by it being an early talkie where the required film style of speaking did not come easily to many stage actors/silent film stars or to some of the new faces trying their hand as film actors. As a result some of the acting is truly and hilariously bad. The dialogue too is hilariously awful, providing some really great unintentional laughs! This combination would make for a film only to be shown to give people a cheap laugh at film making of this period if it weren't for the many plus points. There is a lot of good stuff in this film which lift it to a degree where it can still thrill and interest new viewers to this day.The story is compelling thanks to the incredible novel on which the film is based. Some sequences magically bring the story to life with wonderful art direction/cinematography which gives an atmospheric, eerie feel and are candy to the eye. Some scenes, particularly where it is pure cinema without dialogue are great and a few of the characters are very well played, especially the monster. Frankenstein's monster is magnificently and movingly depicted by Boris Karloff. Overall still a deservedly famous classic but with flaws that cannot easily be ignored.</fullReview>

But still, you should read Mary Shelley's novel just to know what the original story was (I recommend the novel over Kenneth Branagh's dry 1994 movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein (1931) **** (out of 4)Universal masterpiece about a scientist (Colin Clive) who tries to bring a dead body back to life and succeeds but the monster (Boris Karloff) turns out to go on a rampage. While I think BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is the much better movie, this one here might deserve the title of the greatest pure horror film. It's rather amazing to see how well this thing still holds up and how effective the movie is even though we've got countless versions of this story over the years. There are several key ingredients in making this film work but the majority of them belong to Whale's marvelous direction and the brilliant performances of the cast. We can start with Karloff but he brings so much life and emotions to the role that you really can look at him as a person and not simply as some monster with face paint. The masterful scene of him raising his arms towards the sun is so touching while he also manages to be quite scary and in the end makes us feel sympathy for the creature. Another cast member that quite often gets overlooked is Clive who is perfect and nearly steals the film. The sequence of the creation where he has that famous breakdown is some of the best acting in horror film history. Throughout the scene you can just see and feel his character go through the roof before eventually collapsing. The way Clive brings this character to life is without question the best anyone has done in the role. Edward Van Sloan, Mae Clarke and Dwight Frye are all very good as well. Then we have the brilliant and now legendary make up work by Jack Pierce. I love the way Karloff's face can slight be seen through the make up but it doesn't take away from the creature look and it's also flexible enough to give the actor the full range to bring the monster to life. Whale's direction is perfect from start to finish as he knows how to effectively move the camera, build up a scene and eventually pay it off. Just look at how marvelous this movie look and how fresh it still holds up and especially compared to Dracula, which was released earlier in the year. Again, I think the next film was the perfect fantasy/black comedy but this one here, pure horror, is brilliant and deserves its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing achievement for horror cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Tod Browning's Dracula, Frankenstein was one of the films that launched Universal as a major horror studio; and even now, over seven decades since its release; James Whale's cinematic interpretation of Mary Shelly's classic novel is still an outstanding expose of horror. The film is famous for several things; the image of Boris Karloff (credited as '?') in the role of Frankenstein's Monster being the most famous of them. This is the role that announced the great Boris Karloff to the world of cinema, and he justifies that with an outstanding portrayal of the monster. Karloff takes what could have been a cold, lifeless role and gives it warmth - so much, in fact, that it's actually very easy to believe that '?' really is Frankenstein's Monster. The plot will be familiar to anyone who's ever heard the name 'Frankenstein' and follows a mad genius with the idea of creating a corpse and giving it life. Before long, he's harnessed the power and lightning and is screaming "it's alive!" But when the monster escapes its creator, Frankenstein's position in high society, his marriage and even his life comes under threat.The fact that the story is so well known harms the film in a way, as you pretty much always know what's coming next. Director James Whale combats this with a constantly foreboding atmosphere, from which he springs high amounts of tension - and even though we know what's coming, Whale makes us want to see it come. The story is rich with moral themes, most notably a parable about the ills of man playing God. This comes across well in Whale's film adaptation, and by the time the stunning climax appears on screen; we are left with no doubt that Dr Frankenstein was wrong to push the limits of science. Some of the acting is a bit wooden; but this is made up for by Colin Clive's energetic performance as the title character. He revels in this role, and that is always obvious as he commands every scene that he's in. If I had to nitpick to find negative elements, I'd highlight the fact that despite the morbid themes on display; the film is largely too pleasant. Maybe it's because of the time it was made; but a darker tone would have fit the tale better. It's a small criticism, however, and overall, Whale's classic tale of horror is still an amazing achievement and will always be a must see for fans of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is obviously a classic and a well made movie technically and it is highly reviewed by movie critics but that does not mean it is a movie for everyone. Personally I am not a big fan of horror movies in general because most of them made today are cheaply made and bad but I also don't really like the ones most people call good ones either. That is mostly just personal preference though and not really justification on why a movie is good or bad. I gave this movie a 5 not because it is a horror movie but because I did not really like it at all. There was some parts I enjoyed but most of it I was not a big fan of and if it wasn't for the fact that this was a classic movie that was well made and historically important I probably would have gave it an even lower score then a 5. My honest opinion on it is that if you are a fan of horror or classic movies you will definitely have to check this movie if not I wouldn't really recommend this and I will most likely never watch it again myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character Development Didn't Make Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had high expectations, having enjoyed seeing one of its remakes, I figured that the original would be just as good if not better. But sadly it wasn't what I thought it would be. I found the story to be a bit boring and the development Dr. Frankenstein to be flawed, which made it hard for me to really get into the film and its story. In the beginning, Dr. Frankenstein cared only about bringing life back to a dead body. He didn't care much for his fiancé or what people thought of him. But when his monster came to life and wasn't what he expected, the doctor completely forgot about it and went back to his fiancé, now only caring about her. He's starts off only caring about his project and being completely passionate about it, to completely losing interest in it and redirecting that passion right to his fiancé, not to mention in such a short period of time. He doesn't even seem to care about fixing the problem that he had created; he just let the monster run free. Another part of the film that I wasn't too fond of was the ending because I didn't think it had much of a resolution. No one held the doctor responsible, they were just happy that the monster ended up dead. After that they made it seem as if everything was just going to go back to normal. But I do have to say that I found the filming of the movie to be very good. I really enjoyed the use of high and low angled shots, and the various close up shots of the actors who were speaking. Along with that I really enjoyed the continuous shots that were used during some of the city scenes. Overall, I found the movie to be well filmed, but I believe the story wasn't as smooth or realistic as it could've been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Frankenstein has been conducting experiments on the re-animation of lifeless bodies, and is now ready to create life in a man he has assembled from body parts he has been collecting. His fiancée Elizabeth and friend Victor are worried about his health, he spends far too long in his laboratory. But he's successful and the creature he's made come to life is gentle, but simple. Henry's father brings his son to his senses and he agrees that the monster should be destroyed. Before they can do so however, the monster escapes and in its innocence, kills a little girl. The villagers rise to destroy the creature........Out of all the Universal Monster classics of the thirties, this is the ultimate one. This is the one that still shocks and endears you at the same time, and that is due to the brilliant portrayal of the creature by Karloff.His body language and his movements say so much about the pain and the anguish that the creature is feeling, and the scene with the little girl still is one of the most shocking scenes to ever feature in a pre 'Gornography' horror world.But even though he doe a what he does, you still feel so much empathy for the creature, and the fact that you know he will get no reprieve for his actions, just makes the film that more harrowing to watch.The rest of the cast are fine, in that thirties acting class way they all appear to have, and again, the sets and the matte paintings only add compliment to the film.Compared to other Monster movies of that era, this is definitely one of the best, and its essential to any horror fan.</fullReview>

That wimpy doctor just assumed I'd get right back in the swing of living and attending posh parties, perhaps puttin' on a little ritz. Bah! Little did he know, he hired a remarkably incompetent assistant who found a lame brain for my noggin. I'm so glad I killed that twerp.As for that little girl, I swear I didn't drown her! That was an accident. I mean, geez, who would have thought she couldn't get out of water that was only a foot deep? Where were her survival instincts? Maybe this is what they call "thinning the herd". Somebody should bring HER back to life and make her throw plants in a pond all day long...although that would be torture. That flower game looks like it would get old awfully fast.Okay, it's time to confess something, Dearest Diary. I'd really like to throw my maker off something high, maybe a castle or a mountain. I'd even settle for a windmill. What's he ever done for me? He did this for his own glory. I heard him bragging that night while I was lying flat on my back with a rag on my face.

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is one of the original horror movies. Although it can't compare to the horror movies of today for its time it was deemed one of the great horror of it time and was a big box office hit and I can see how that is. It had great cinematography with great lighting and set designs.The camera man should have received an award for the work he did there are a couple scenes were remarkable. The sound was OK the sounds of Frankenstein were OK but could have been a little bit louder and dramatic in my eyes. Boris Karloff was great acting as the Monster and Colin Clive did a great job as Dr. Frankenstein. The set has a feel of Transylvania and reminds me of a show took from this idea called the Munsters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand how a lot of people don't find this movie scary. It's not the typical horror film we are used to today but it doesn't mean it is still not a great movie. I believe this is a complete movie with every aspect better then the next. There is no question the storyline is great, if you have read the novel you know this before even seeing the film. As for the acting, I thought Colin Clive plays a compelling Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff plays The Monster to perfection. I love the sets the different scenes are shot in. The background with the lighting makes the scene up in the mountain look so neat and artistic. You can tell the people behind the movie put so much effort in making the mise-en-scene just right for every shot. Some of my peers thought the movie was too faced paced and scenes cut in and out quickly; throwing them off. But I understand they based this movie off the play and if you have every seen a play it has that feel to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankenstein is a very visual and a very stylistic film. The mise-en-scene was very well thought out and executed with great detail. The scenery was decked out with Gothic architecture and costume and the laboratory of Dr. Frankenstein contained many elaborate props and scientific equipment. The special effects used with the laboratory equipment was very impressive for the time and added to the suspense of the experiment scenes. At least one actual Tesla Coil built by Nikola Tesla himself was used in the film. The timing of the thunder claps enhanced the fear and suspense of the reanimation scenes. The makeup was also very impressive for the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film revolves around Dr. Frankenstein and his quest to recreate life and play the role of god. He reaches his dream and realizes that he's created a terrible epidemic that the town has to face. The only thing is that the monster he has created does not know any better as his brain was that of a criminal. Many frightful events take place but overall nothing that will make the viewer cringe, except maybe the scene with the little girl and the lake. The ending is pretty clear. Overall I pictured this film to be completely different and was actually really disappointed when I saw that it really wasn't as scary as the disclaimer at the beginning says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of terror? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's funny, I don't consider this film minimally scary. Or maybe it's just me forgetting than the standards of "terror" were quite different in the generation of our grandparents. Anyway, considering the standards of the early 1930's, it must have been scary.It's not a bad movie. However, it lacks atmosphere and it could definitely use more suspense, to make it more intense and scarier. Even Frankenstein's monster (greatly portrayed by Boris Karloff), despite his appearance and the things he does, is not really scary. The things he does, he does them not because he likes to but due to a human error upon his creation which resulted in an unpredictable brain and character. I also expected the monster to appear more than he did, considering he's a pivotal character in the film.The disturbing scene when the monster picks up the little girl and throws her into the near lake causing her to drown is perhaps the most famous scene of the film. It has had a long story of controversy. The title "Frankenstein" always generates confusion, making many (including me) think it's about the monster when in reality it is the name of its creator. I can see where the 1984 short 'Frankenweenie' (which I adore) got its inspiration from. It was from this film in many ways: the electricity used to revive/create life, the whole mill sequence, half of the title ("Franken")...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Frankenstein" released in 1931 is one of the greatest horror films of its time. It is about a now mad scientist that is hiding from his normal life, his assistant Fritz and the monster they choose to create with their own hands. Doctor Frankenstein is a smart man that was raised with money in what seems to be a well respected family of the community. But by this point in his life however, he is stricken with a sense of god like power. Dr.Frankenstein feels that because he has found a way to create life, he is going to do just that no matter how wrong his friends and family around him feel his idea is. The monster is stitched together with parts of random deceased humans from the nearby graveyard and a psychopaths brain. The monsters life is sparked by a lightening storm and continues down the wrong path from there. From the beginning of his life you first feel that he truly is just that, a monster with no feelings at all. By the end your perception of him has changed completely where now you feel a sense of compassion for him. He never asked to be created much less left alone in a cold world with no guidance at all. He lived a tortured short life that was brought to an abrupt end by his greatest fear, fire.This film is nothing like a horror film of present day, but definitely pushed the limits of its time. It is one of the first to push the dark side of ones mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first and best Frankenstein Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frankenstein" is indeed a scary film. Just watch the scene where Boris Karloff(the Monster)enters into the room backwards,then seeing a close-up of his face! Jack Pierce(make-up) did a great job. He also created the make-up for "The Wolfman" among other Universal Studios monster sequels. The story is a Gothic tale of how a mad scientist creates a monster. His creation understands only violence, the victim of having an abnormal brain inserted into a body comprised of body parts from several corpses. Colin Clive is outstanding in his role of Dr. Frankenstein. He is a genius,misunderstood and eccentric. Edward Van Sloan is equally fine as Dr. Waldman. Mae Clarke plays Elizabeth, Dr. Frankenstein's understanding bride to be. James Whale's direction is right on the money. A true horror classic.</fullReview>

However it also has a criminal brain stolen by mistake by the scientist's hunch back assistant YGOR, when brought to life, the monster escapes after a short while in captivity where it rebels against it's creator &amp; terrorizes his fiancée, as well as killing as it goes along, can Victor stop the creature or will he to fall prey to his own creation? It's remarkable that close to eighty years later (at the time of my writing this review) that FRANKENSTEIN still retains the power to scare an audience, it's still very well known &amp; is still a powerful work of art that is never boring &amp; is always a joy to watch, which is more than can be said for a lot of horror films, the acting is powerful by all those involved, including Karloff's performance as the monster, in my eyes he always will be the best actor to have ever played the monster, he's scary &amp; sympathetic all at the same time, despite it's scariness however, the film may have faltered had another actor taken the role, Karloff was seemed to have been born to play the role. The direction &amp; atmosphere is fantastic &amp; there's plenty of suspense in this very good though very short classic. Highly recommended to horror fans, though it's hard to believe any horror fan who hasn't seen it yet! Followed by eight remakes, several spoofs &amp; seven sequels, starting with BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.**** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a handful of performances in over a century of cinema that, in one word, conjure worlds. Swanson. "Sunset Boulevard." Gish. "Way Down East." Cheney. "He Who Gets Slapped." Chaplin. "The Kid." Welles. "Citizen Kane." Others? No doubt.Yet only one performance segued, perfectly, magnificently, from silent films to sound.Boris Karloff's "Monster" is perhaps the ultimate realization of "silent" acting ever filmed. Over 70 years later, it is difficult to discuss without emotions and tears overwhelming one.Nothing else in "Frankenstein" matters, finally, but Karloff.Not the hand-sewn cyclorama "sky" in the opening sequence; not the superlative but dated supporting performances; not the magnificent (and dated) sets. Not James Whale's piercing direction.Nothing matters, but Karloff.I cannot help but cry, now, recalling his amazing achievement.Yes, I've seen the stills of Karloff smoking and joking between takes, in full makeup. Yes, I know the anecdotes about his being banned from Universal's commissary during lunch because of Jack Pierce's horrific makeup.Yes, I'm familiar with "Bill" Pratt, born in England in 1887: a stunningly handsome man with a lisp who wanted to be an actor: orphaned early: moved to Canada: jolted the world at 43 in "Frankenstein" after a couple of decades in Hollywood.But here's what matters.The performance. The hands. The body. The eyes. The incoherent sounds. The heart.Certainly, "Frankenstein" the film is not the astonishing work of fiction as originally written, in which the "monster" is fully articulate.Churned out of Universal's "fright factory" after "Dracula," the film exists today as an artifact of its era.Except for Karloff's incredible portrayal.He far surpasses Lugosi and every other "horror" actor in presenting the heart of a man-made "monster." Wordlessly, Karloff conveys the heart-rending soul of the novel's "Prometheus." His anguished cries in the fiery climax are almost unbearable. A sub-human born of a "human" scientist, hounded and tormented throughout his brief existence, his only moment of child-like joy resulting in the innocent drowning of a little girl, confused, terrified, rageful -- Karloff gave us everything.Frankly, Karloff surpassed Cheney, in this one role. Certainly not in Cheney's cumulative career: no one could approach Cheney's scope.As years go by, and upon repeated viewings, Karloff's heartbreaking rendition of the "monster" must rank among the finest performances in history.Still, today.Amazing.Holy.Thank you, Mr. Pratt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth Of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strictly speaking, this film isn't the birth of horror because there were scary films made at the same time and also before this movie. However, I labelled it the birth of horror because I do think this movie deserves credit for being an inspiration to subsequent sci-fi and horror movies that followed.Frankenstein is an intriguing character. In my opinion, he is not a villainous and evil monster at all. He is no different to tragic figures such as The Phantom of the Opera or The Hunchback of Notre Dame, he just wants to be left alone in peace but he can never find peace being a freak of nature and all.Boris Karloff does a wonderful job as the tragic monster. There are some tragic and scary scenes in this movie. In one scene, Frankenstein kills a young girl-albeit accidentally-and his realization of what he has done makes for essential viewing. At the end, Frankenstein is pursued by humans fearful of someone different to them.The story of Frankenstein has a good moral message for all mankind-never judge a person by appearance. Frankenstein is not an evil creature, no more evil than a grizzly bear in the wild. He is a freak of nature who can't understand why he is here yet tries to find a place in the world. He doesn't wish to harm anyone yet humans-distrustful of anyone or anything that is different to them-pursue him with a vengeance and in effect, make him into the very monster they wrongly thought he was. I mentioned The Phantom of the Opera and The Hunchback of Notre Dame earlier but I think a comparison can also be made between Frankenstein and King Kong, another creature whose only desire was to be left alone in peace and only lashed out when provoked by a hateful world.All in all, Frankenstein is a masterpiece which has stood the test of time and contains a powerful message. No serious horror fan (or movie fan) can miss it.</fullReview>

The lighting in a lot of the laboratory scenes gave you a true sense of doom and gloom. The wooden floors and the sound they projected, the chains, the thunder and lightning, all added elements of spook there are now considered to be classic. Didn't care for the plot. interesting to know that Frankenstein is actually the wacky scientist, and NOT the monster. I think that this film paved the way for how horror films should be portrayed.

		<fullReview>The movie its strength is not in the horror but in the characters. The Frankenstein creature is a great tragic character and the emotions in this movie are really powerful.The Frankenstein monster is the most classic horror monster in my opinion. Yes, I'm a bigger fan of the Dracula character and movies but there is no denying that the Frankenstein monster is the most intriguing and tragic classic horror movie character. The make-up for the character is fantastic and although Boris Karloff is of course heavily overacting, he's perfect for the role, mainly because of his typical face and eyes.It also was wonderful to see Edward Van Sloan in this. Van Sloan is also known for playing Van Helsing in the classic "Dracula" movie and one of its sequels; "Dracula's Daughter" and the other classic and well known movie "The Mummy", also with Boris Karloff in it. So this guy has basically played in the three best, most influential and most well known horror classics of the '30's. He's a wonderful and great actor, certainly among my favorite of the '30's period along with Bela Lugosi.In my opinion the movie is better as a drama than as an horror movie. It's not necessarily scary but more emotional and tragic.A perfect classic masterpiece that simply is a must see.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

That is it though, other than that I could barely keep my eyes open. After creating Frankenstein they spend a lot of time with him in the castle and not a whole lot happens. The only part that made me laugh was when the monster ran across the little girl and threw her in the lake to see if she would float. The absolute best part was the end when the towns people got a posy to track down the monster and burn the tower he was in. If the intent of the director was to make you feel said for the monster while he was burned alive he failed miserably. The only feeling I had while watching him burned was joy because I knew the movie was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm curious to how people found this to be scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm curious as to how the bone chilling tale of Mary Shelly's "Frankenstein" got turned into this? What I found so freighting of the original Frankenstein's Monster was that he was capable of complex thought and emotions ;he also had enhanced agility not just strength. I mean he threatens Victor to make another monster because he is lonely for companionship! This Frankenstein was nothing more than an over sized 4 year old with down syndrome! I was more frightened of Chunk from "The Goonies"! Now I know this was the 1930's and they really haven't seen much like this before but once you got past the fact he was raised from the dead wouldn't you think, "Hey this monster moves slower than my grandmother. I could just side step him, get the heck out of there, and come after him with a mob!" I'm quite aware that people of today are spoiled with fear from modern horror movies and so maybe that's why all of this just looked silly to me. Now if people found this to be scary in the 1930's could you imagine going back and showing "The Exorcist" to them; they'd literally pee their pants! The movie It's self was well made and there's a wonderful performance by Colin Clive as Doctor Frankenstein. I would trash Boris Karloff's performance but he worked well with what they gave him. I don't think it was his idea to turn the monster into a bumbling idiot. The reason I rate this film so low even though it was well made because when I watch a "Horror" movie I expect it to be at least some what scary and during this film I only laughed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To see where all the later version come from, you need to see this one. Stripped of color and special effects, this is a masterpiece of film-craft.Director James Whale manages to give us a film that is creepy and possesses horror in an old school way.The acting by Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Boris Karloff as The Monster will astound you with their brilliance.I always enjoy these old horror films not only for the horror story, but also for a glimpse of the villages at the time.

		<shortDescription>The Granddaddy of all Monster Movies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRANKENSTEIN (1931) **** Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Bowles, Edward Von Sloan, Dwight Frye. The grandaddy of all monster movies! The classic interpretation of Mary Shelley's Gothic chiller about a demented scientist named Frankenstein who's playing God creates a monster with an unexpected violent streak and dire circumstance. Karloff became an icon with his flat-topped child-like creature with exuding sympathy and terror. Excellent direction by James Whale and stunning production design still stands the test of time with scores of sequels, remakes and rip-offs for generations to come. Restored sequence of the little girl's accidental drowning is perhaps one of cinema's most visceral moments; watch Karloff's slow panic. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*1931's Frankenstein holds up surprisingly well against such modern horror fare as Ashton Kutcher's (scary) Just Married, Hilary Duff's (terrifying) Lizzie McGuire Movie and anything starring those (just plain petrifying) Olsen twins. In this relatively short film (the shorter the better, I say, eh, James Cameron!), we witness a kooky 'young doctor-slash-necrophiliac', Dr Henry Frankenstein (Clive) and his right hand man, a hunchbacked midget named Fritz (Frye), scouring the countryside for dead bodies for some strange experiment that could change the face of science as we...er, then knew it. The doctor's intentions seem fairly sound, you know, he desperately needs the bodies for scientific purposes and all that jazz. The same, however, cannot be said about weirdo Fritz (a tired old deviant from way back), whose primary motive for helping the doctor with the dead bodies just ain't explained. It seems Fritz is prepared to go to any length to please, including stealing a brain-in-a-jar from a local medical university-kinda-place for the doctor's experiment. No Questions Asked. (And Fritz does go through with it, too, though the stupid fool inadvertently steals the brain of a killer, which subsequently really stuffs things up!)We also soon discover that Dr F - fully stocked with smelly old corpse bits (and a killer brain to boot!) - is soooo busy up in his hilltop laboratory-slash-windmill he can't even get it on with his bride-to-be, urbane and refined Elizabeth (Clarke). She feigns concern - she's actually just tired of waiting for her lover to consummate the passion that constantly threatens to erupt from within her - and cons poor old sods, hanger-on nobody Victor (Boles), and experienced head of medicine Dr Waldman (Van Sloan), into accompanying her on a search-and-destroy (her pent-up urges) mission.On arrival at the dark and dusty windmill on the hill, the threesome discovers that Dr F and dorky Fritz don't got no time to see y'all. Feisty Elizabeth chucks a hissy fit about being given the brush off by her fiancé; Dr Waldman bangs on the door until his head starts to bleed (?); and resourceful Victor spices it up by calling Dr F "a crazy sonofa...." On hearing them fightin' words, Dr F decides enough is enough and admits the threesome, all the while informing (or should that be, warning) them that what they are about to see is something marvelous, something outrageous, something unbelievable (and, no, I don't mean a Chevy Chase post-Vacation box office hit!). They are going to see history being made: Dr Frankenstein's lil fella (Karloff) (you know, the collection of mismatched body parts all sewn together) brunged back to life! At this point in time (in the film, not now), you can just imagine the many thoughts running through young Elizabeth's mind on witnessing firsthand her fiancé's delusions of power and prestige. Thoughts such as: "Elizabeth, what the hell are you doing?" and "Well, he is a doctor..." and "He'd better not try anything on the wedding night. I'm in this for the money, and that's all!" and "What a dork! Look at that lousy haircut!" and "I know, I'll poison his tea and collect the insurance money!"Now, IMDbphiles, an exclusive run through Dr F's oft-rehearsed procedure: Cue the storms, thunder and lightning - check; Uncover the body so the audience gets a thrill - check; Tell Fritz off for being a dim, sycophantic layabout - check; Keep an eye on the body as it goes up in a cage-like contraption through the ceiling towards the sky - check; Act all weird and decidedly manic in order to appease studio heads - check; Let the body be zapped a few (hundred) times before bringing it down for inspection - check; Gasp and cry out "It's alive! It's alive!" when the once-lifeless body starts to move - check.It certainly is alive! And quite a sight to behold. I mean, with all the makeup and hair products, one could be excused for mistaking him for J.Lo in drag. And as the towering monster saunters around the countryside, looking for friends (or foes) one gets the feeling that Karloff's characterisation of the monster included some unambiguous reference to TV travel program hosts. See Dr F's monster making his way through a gorgeous bushy meadow; see Dr F's monster taking in the views of a breathtaking lake set against a beautiful alpine mountain; and see Dr F's monster interacting with a sweet-faced local child playing with her kitty. It's all very Channel Nine's 'Getaway'.In conclusion, I must comment on the acting prowess of not only Clive, but that of Clarke, that saucy vixen of yesteryear. The two really light up the screen, bringing passion to their characters. Van Sloan is equally adept in his role as the concerned doctor, while Kerr brings a bit of good old English sense and sensibility to the role of the old German Baron Frankenstein (?). Minor players Boles and Frye have little screen time (the latter is killed off halfway through the film). Finally, Karloff impresses as Frankenstein's creation, exuding feelings of angst, anger ... and amoral grunting noises better suited to porn flicks.After seeing Frankenstein, I think it deserves to be the movie of the moment. I mean, any film that features a mute sexually ambiguous killer in dire need of some blond highlights and a head-to-toe fashion makeover, deserves the attention of Queer Eye! I can see it now, the new and improved Frankie on the TV chat show circuit, promoting the benefits of facial cream (to hide those sunken cheeks), hair products (to disguise that squarish head) and cosmetic surgery (to fix those droopy eyelids).If you don't have a copy of this film classic, run, run, run up to the windmill-slash-video store on the hill and grab a copy. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein... The brain is useless. We must find another brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankenstein: 5 out of 10: Frankenstein is a hard film to review. So much that was shocking in the film when it first came out is muted today. (Desecration of the grave etc.) As a standalone film rather than an &#x201c;American Classic&#x201d; Frankenstein leaves much to be desired.The film is very stagy with people exiting stage left and posing theatrically. The fight scene between the monster and the bride on her wedding day is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. The movie is quite short (running about an hour) and character development is minimal. If you real Shelly&#x2019;s original work you are likely to be appalled by some of the changes.The brain is in the film is one of a criminal (Abby Normal) as opposed to an everyman. This changes a major component of the novel. In the book, Frankenstein became evil because he was rejected by man not because of some predestined nature. The destruction of Frankenstein&#x2019;s family by his experiment that goes against God&#x2019;s will is barely touched upon and the romance between Victor (excuse me Henry; they changed the name to Victor&#x2019;s younger deader brother) and his fiancée is barely touched upon.While the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein surprised with its effectiveness and advanced film techniques Frankenstein surprises with its brevity and staginess. But in its defense it is a classic and Boris Karloff is great as the monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Frankenstein, the idea that a man can pick apart bits and pieces of dead bodies and assemble them into a working, functioning man is ludicrous. However, the movie takes this idea, creates an acceptable explanation, and the monster springs to life. It works because it takes something that is true- the existence of light waves- and extends it one step further to describe the properties of a newly discovered frequency. The message of the film, that God is the only one who should create life, is very convincing. The Monster was intended to be human, but is a murderer by nature. The Monster's temperament and actions are Dr. Frankenstein's punishment for his transgression against God.</fullReview>

I liked this movie, although I wasn't very scared by it. I liked the use of dark and light and the use of shadow. I also noticed a few characters looking off into the horizon when they spoke (Elizabeth) which was a bit campy and a tad foreboding. An interesting point was made about the doctor playing with creating life. Someone told me they cried at the end of this, but I couldn't understand really understand why until the mob appeared and destroyed the monster, who, after all, didn't ask to be created.

The book is about man and his arrogance to want to write his own book of genesis. To all the negative folks who think that no faithful version exists, then you need to go to your local Blockbuster and look again. Because there are versions which are faithful to the book (believe it or not). This film doesn't reach the moral which Mary Shelley was trying to get at in her book. This movie is simply a good Friday night camp flick to watch with friends. That is if they don't mind black and white movies. Besides this is a 1930's horror flick, where you actually looking for an intellectual film? If so I know a few other films that were shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 which you would find pretty intelligent as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff Brings Human Quality to Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film and novel of this Mary Shelley story differ from each other in a couple of ways. In the novel the creation is named Adam while in film he has no name. Also, the creation is the tragic hero of the novel where Henry Frankenstein is hero in film version. FRANKENSTEIN, the novel is the most famous literary work of Mary Shelley whose creative life was surrounded by famous writers such as her cousin, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and husband, Lord Byron. Only half of novel is used in film and other half was used for Bride of Frankenstein(1935).Excellent adaptation of an engrossing gothic novel. Any film that is based on literature is capable of being good without being totally faithful if its able to capture the spirit. Frankenstein(1931) does not faithfully hold true to its original source but succeeds in retaining the novel's essential qualities. James Whale does a good job in adapting the main ideas of the novel to fit in with his own cinematic themes. Frankenstein(1931) and Curse of Frankenstein(1957) are the best film versions of the Mary Shelley novel.Frankenstein(1931) contains a mode and taste that is indebted to the German Expressionist movement. German Expressionism was tremendously weightly on American horrop films of early 1930s. Frankenstein(1931) is a sound picture with silent film characteristics. Castle setting in Frankenstein(1931) recalls the gothic imagery of many German Expressionist films of the 1920s. Frankenstein(1931) was in essence an American Expressionist horror film.An old fashion horror film that relies on atmosphere, implicit horror, mood, and gothic settings. Black and white photography is a good look for cinema because the composition of images come out naturally. Black and white horror has the flavor and tone of a lot of early gothic literature. Frankenstein(1931) is the quintessential black and white horror picture that is driven by the human feelings of fear and superstitution. Since color is now the dominating photography style in cinema, there has been recently few horror films that have been done in black and white.Dracula(1931) and Frankenstein(1931) were the catalysts for Universal horror which is the first important long period in horror cinema. Universal horror gave audienences memorable film monsters that would become cinema icons. Movies like the two mentioned above in first sentence gave birth to many sequals and ensured a two decade dominance in horror cinema by Universal Studios. After Universal horror died out, a new face in horror known as Hammer horror in the late 1950s began its own long run of brilliantly done horror films. Frankenstein(1931) epiomizes what was good about Universal horror and the visionary minds behind these kinds of films.Evolution of Frankenstein creation from novel to film is ever changing considering how different he is presented in each film about him. Actually he has gone from being presented as a misunderstood tragic hero(novel) to being depicted as a mindless monster(cinema). Adam(creation) is a sympathetic character who's full of emotions which he cannot express via lack of articulate voice. He is childlike in his behavior and manners who is frustrated by the lack of human love. In later films, Adam(creation) is shown as an evil monster which is not the way the author of the novel intended to portray him.Frankenstein(1931) made Boris Karloff as a big horror icon. He is the actor that best personifies the tragic qualities of Adam(creation). Boris Karloff although does not have a speaking role expresses thoughts that speak in images which wouldn't have the same effect in words. When he was given a good role to work with, Boris Karloff was nothing less than superb. The Essence of the Frankenstein creation is given a complex form as a result of the excellent acting from Boris Karloff.Henry Frankenstein creates Adam out of a quest to master the secrets of life and death. His goal is to equal or replace God by using science as a way of knowing how to make life out of scretch. Frankenstein's attempt to equal or replace God is the underlining theme of both the novel and film because it raises interesting notions on the continuous conflict between religion and science. In human history there has always been friction between religion and science and Frankenstein(1931) plays on this idea with moral intellegence. Attempt by Henry Frankenstein to equal or replace God is not entirely successful and ends with the creator shunning his creation because of imperfections.Part of the Frankenstein story was inspired by the Golem legend. The Golem was a created man made out of clay who was to protect Jews from prosection in a foreign country. The Golem unfortuately was hard to control and had to be distroyed. The idea of a creation that the creator had trouble controlling must have been an intriguing idea for Mary Shelley when she began to write the novel. FRANKENSTEIN, the novel was done as a contest betweel Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron to who would do the best gothic story.Frankenstein(1931) was made immortal in the hearts of filmgoers by the famous "Its alive" cries of Henry Frankenstein. The scene with little Maria did not sit well with censors at the time and was cut because it was deemed too scary for a portion of the audience. Eventually it was restored years later which is good since it depicts the misunderstood nature of Adam the best. Bela Lugosi was offered the role of the creation before Boris Karloff but turned it down. Frankenstein(1931) has aged well and continues to chill the spines of viewers whether at home or at a movie theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale's Frankenstein was not all that impressive. I viewed the movie Frankenstein for the first time the other day and I must say it will be the last time I will be watching any Frankenstein movie. From the beginning with the dark and dreary set to the end with melodramatic music there was no enjoyment while being forced to watch this movie. The story itself just doesn't fascinate me; I find it very stupid (I apologize for the lack of a better word) that a "mad scientist" attempts to bring a human back to life and in the process creates a monster. It's very unrealistic causing my attention to be lost. I suppose back in the 1930's this is what interested the audience, but in today's world this does not rank with the current horror films. Despite the terrible story line the movie did display some impressive acting along with some important messages. Boris Karloff did an amazing job playing the monster. I can only imagine how hard his role could have been; he was a very convincing monster and did not lose his character at any point in the film. I do believe the movie's portrayal of the ideas "man was not to play God" and "free will- people will be what they want to be regardless" was excellent also. James Whale knew how to create a film filled with emotion and significant themes, but I just don't think he applied his skills to the right story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most people Frankenstein was a Classic horror movie and still is, but for me it was a plain movie which lacked lots of good thrill in my opinion. To someone else they may say, for a 20s horror flick everything was executed just fine, as for me and growing up in a different era it lacked everything that makes a horror movie in my understanding. A horror movie to me is more intense, more off screen gut twisting scenes. I felt because Frankenstein didn't have the qualities of a Jason movie or a van helsing movie it didn't reach my interest. Now, if I had to think of a part that was interesting it will be when the man walked down the street with his lifeless daughter in his hand. That part there was interesting because you felt for the guy, other than that everything else could have put me to sleep.</fullReview>

All the bizarre clumsy charm of this modern legend was lost?all the morbid decadent poetry of the doom. They were replaced by a domestic intrigue, deprived of all interest, and of the grim nihilism and cruelty of the 19th. century junk novel.Yet is leaves an agreeable aftertaste. If compared to his set colleagues, Karloff seems indeed a giant of the composition. He puts, indeed, a certain enthusiasm in performing his role. All the other actors are extremely clumsy and displeasing. I confess that I wanted to see the English novel, or novella, adapted; this is not the film to offer that. But it is interesting and even thrilling in its bourgeois domestic frame of mind; it begins more chillingly, it goes on rather tamed and blandly conciliatory. It doesn't seem plenty aware that it treats of one of the major legends (like the Golem, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, Fu Manchu, Vautrin, etc.).For my taste, the Jewish Golem is far more offering; yet Frankenstein's monster could of been fine enough.The (literary) great scene of the creature's coming to life is completely wrecked and hackneyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am tired of this idea that because a movie is old, and one of the first of its time it must be praised. I read Mary Shelly's novel and then decided I should see this film, a film that was praised by many, but would not be praised by me. Yes, their was some interesting scenes, I love the use of lighting in this film, the grayish color gave it an errie feeling and who could forget the scene when the father, of the little girl that drowned, carries her dead body through the city. However after these few cool scenes the film is a failure. It didn't bring out any of the characterstics of Shelly's novel with the exception of a monster killing people. The whole Idea of Shelly's novel was to show sympathy for someone who is different in this film how can we have sympathy for the evil monster. I felt that the dialogue in this film was just horrible, their was no character development and the whole purpose of the dialogue in this film was to advance the plot. A good film knows how to show, not by telling through words. All this film did was tell. Lets just be realistic with these reviews just because somehting is older than you are and its in black and white and your grandfather and your 75 year old film proffessor said this is a good film, doesn't make it so. This was a waste of my time and I would tell anyone to never watch this film unless you want to see a comedy, and how not to make a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the story by Mary Shelley, this is probably the most well known of all the film adaptations, from director James Whale. Basically Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) wants to build a man made of dead bodies, so he and assistant Fritz (Dracula's Dwight Frye) steal a couple of bodies, and Fritz also steals an abnormal criminal brain (after dropping the normal one) from Frankenstein's former teacher Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan). Frankenstein has completed his construction, and he is ready to bring his creation to life, with the help of electrodes and the incoming storm (lightning). Worried for him, Henry's fiancée Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), along with best man Victor Moritz (John Boles) and Dr. Waldman go to see Frankenstein, and they too witness the experiment completion. There is movement from this creature, and a few minutes later, you see The Monster (Boris Karloff) in person. At first, it seems very slow and obedient, but it becomes apparent that it is very aggressive, and they have to lock in a cell, which after killing Fritz, he does manage to escape from. While Frankenstein tries to proceed with his wedding, the Monster is "playing" with a little girl, who he throws in the water thinking she will float, but in fact he drowns her, and her father joins the villagers to get the Monster. Frankenstein finds it, and it takes him to the near windmill, where Henry is thrown over the side - lucky to be alive - and it appears that the Monster is burned alive in the tower. Even with its simplicity, it is still a creepy and influential horror film, and Karloff's image is still as iconic as ever, one of the great classics of cinema. It was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("It's alive! It's alive!"), it was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 100 Years, 100 Movies. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankinstein is good. Don't get me wrong. Take it from me. As a kid, I LOVED the classic monster movies. The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Draclula..all of them. Now that I see Frankinstein years later, it is not as scary as it used to be. The sound is "chopped" up, the monster isn't really a monster. It's a man, but with makeup on his face. Boris Karloff does a great job of acting as the monster. He is the movie. The only "real" problem with this film is that it really that dark of a monster movie. Draclula is the darkest of all the classic films. Frankinstein has heart, a misguiding, but good natured heart. If we all look at the movies made back then to now..you would say," Frankinstein looks so stupid!". But think of it. Back in the 1930's this film was The Exorcist to the people. Frankinstein was so scary, so freighting..some children couldn't even sleep. I think everyone should at least give this classic a try. I mean..what do you have to lose? Hopefully you can see behind the black and white and see a really good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is campy and ridiculous. The only resemblance to Mary Shelley's novel can be found in the character's names, and even then it isn't accurate! Dr. Frankenstein's first name in the novel is Victor, while his friend's name is Henry. This film inexplicably switches the two names, and this is only one of several bizarre distortions. The monster is nothing like he should be - Shelley wanted us to have sympathy for him, as an emotional, intellectual being. Boris Karloff is a cartoon, and the rest of the cast does no better. Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version is far more faithful to the novel, and though I hesitate to call it a good movie, it at least tries to give the characters real depth. Don't fall prey to that annoying habit of calling a "classic" movie like this one brilliant, simply because it is old, and in black and white. I appreciate the limitations of that film era, and the different audience it was directed for, but it simply doesn't hold up today, unless you want a good laugh (in all the wrong parts of the movie).</fullReview>

In the film the creature gains the brain of a murderer, and demonstrates a demented personality. In the book it is very smart and articulate, interested in literature and becomes smarter than Victor Frankenstein himself. The film shows the creature have at most 6 feet tall. In the book it has 8 feet tall. In the film the creature has a big head with boring hair licked touching the forehead, and bolts (or metal plates) strung around his neck. In the book it has longs hair, many scars by stitches (reminiscent of a patchwork mat), yellow skin, but no metal parts. There are so many glaring differences between the film and the book that if I make note of fidelity to the film would be a note below zero. But after seeing that there are about 200 films about Frankenstein, and the only faithful adaptation is a production made for TV by Hallmark in 2004, I decided not to tear the film because of loyalty. But watching the film as film. And honestly ... there is no way to praise this garbage. Well, I saw many reviews saying that despite all the difference between book and film, the film maintains the concept of the original work. You really sure that read the same book as me? The concept of the book is not the "insanity of the human being," but the old quarrel between science and religion about what we are. Religion says that God made &#x200b;&#x200b;us perfect, and with scientific advances in the late nineteenth century, Mary Shelley was horrified to see that things like galvanism could incite the mind to believe that science would be approaching the secrets of God. Despite coming from an atheist family, including her own husband Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley put the book details of her own personal life, which included a modest belief in God. The main concept of the book is to show that even with all the scientific advances, venturing into the unknown and "play" God may have a painful price. About the movie, the acting is basically what they were in the '30s, more theatrical than realistic, and this is not a problem. The problem is the way James Whale as rough guides the story. With moments that could very well be in a film of black humor, and others that could be basically a horror movie of its generation. It suggests that all this was done without intent. Boris Karloff's acting is good, but in the final scene in the windmill where the creature screams because of the flames, he seems a little girl (with all due respect). Now tell me, a monster with a mind deranged and murderous screaming like a girl? And the "happy ending"? What's that? Excuse me, but if James Whale did something really great in his career, this thing was the sequel of Frankenstein: "The Bride of Frankenstein." I can not say more because I maxing out characters, but is more or less the impression I got to see this piece of crap! PS: Although the Branagh version is not faithful to the book (although some parts are faithful) it's very better than James Whale version in movie aspect. And yes, the version of Branagh manages to retain the concept of the book, even changing several things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early reviewers on IMDb had it right, before the revisionists came along and said, "Great Film!" "Classic," etc, etc. Even if you ignore the lack of faithfulness to the novel (by the way, Mary Shelley isn't even given her proper due in the credits. It says based on the novel by "Mrs. Percy B. Shelley". What a blow to the feminist Shelley, and her feminist mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, to be listed under her husband's name!), you still have a shallow, badly acted, badly written film that lacks suspense or, even horror -- especially badly written: "based upon the composition by"; "from the novel by"; "adapted from the play by"; and "screen play by" two more names. (That's five people total, if you're keeping track).There's no motivation or logic to what the characters do. (Examples: Why do Dr. Frankenstein and Igor, uhhhhh, I mean Fritz, cut down the hanging dead body after doing a spot of grave robbing? Presumably the body they just dug up has a brain? How does the father know his little girl was murdered? He wasn't there when it happened. Why are the leaders of the other two groups hunting the monster suddenly together in the mountains? They had been searching for the monster elsewhere). The lack of score also hurts the film's mood.Oh yeah, we're supposed to believe that Dr. F has set up shop in an old windmill (per what his father, Baron Frankenstein says)? Doesn't look like any windmill I've seen.And, speaking of windmills, the doctor falls from the top of the one at the film's end, hits a windmill blade, slides off, falls to the ground, and survives??? Yeah, right.I'd say, watch this with a grain of salt (as well as with tequila and lime). It's not quite the masterpiece that others may proclaim it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Book is a Whole Lot Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie totally changed the story and the charatcters, and thus diminishing and almost destroying the themes and meaning to the story. The movie could be worse, for it does a good job of the giving the horror feel to it. However, the book has a whole lot more to say. The ending of the movie was the total opposite of Mary Shelley's intentions about how one should feel about Dr. Frankenstein's actions.I can't say the movie was horrible, but it wasn't good either. If you want pure entertainment without thinking too much, the movie is fine. However, if you want the real version of the Frankenstein story with quality themes and meaning, definately choose the book.Rating of the movie: 5/10 Rating of the book: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good scenes, poor whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no reason to complain about the special effects. What special effects are required in a story about a stitched-together animated corpse, anyway? Put some make-up on an actor, make him stumble around, and you've got it. Boris Karloff did in 1931 exactly what Robert DeNiro did in 1994 - it's just that the monsters are in very different styles. Oh, and there's also the fact that the 1994 film is much better.For all the striking images and scenes Whale comes up with I don't think he's really stitched together a film. When and where is it set? Parts of it seem to take place in Old Transylvania (perhaps Ruritania); but then other parts are set in the modern world (c.1931). These two worlds can, of course, exist side by side; but I don't like the way Whale simply flits between them as strikes his fancy, confusing us for no good reason.Then there's the question of what the Frankenstein myth (forget Shelly's novel) is really about. Branagh gets the answer to this question right: if we take the story seriously, it's about a single person's obsession with means rather than ends. It's about Frankenstein. Whale, like most people, think the myth is about two things: the plight of the monster, and science over-reaching itself. His film does not (I was thankful to discover) contain the line, `There are some things Man was not meant to know,' but it easily might have. Sorry - this version of the myth is simply risible. Ignore the personal tragedy of Frankenstein, and you ignore the most interesting part. The day after watching Whale's version, I couldn't even remember if his Frankentein had survived or not. (Does anyone know where I can look this up?)His fiancé, by the way, is a wan, floppy and irritating cipher; and we see as much of her as we do of him.The 1930s was NOT Hollywood's golden age, and many a film from that decade is exactly like this one: a pleasant, watchable dud with one or two classic scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely dreadful. The idea that people can raise someone from the dead from a series of different corpses is preposterous. The movie is the story of an ambitious man who decides he will play with the forces of nature and create a living creature. It starts in the Goldstadt town of?? he devotes all his time away from his soon to be wife and from his rather rich father. While collecting parts, his assistant fritz went to the university to retrieve a brain. A crucial error created a setback that would set the stage for all the unfortunate events that will occur in this movie. See the assistant dropped the brain that was labeled normal and it got brain ooze on the nice floor. Either way he ended up grabbing the brain marked as "CRIMINAL" and returned to the good doctor. Now the monster was given a criminals brain and was unleashed on the world. The monster doesn't seem inherently evil he just almost seems like someone of little to no mental functions. He has the mentality of a 9 year old this can be shown when he meets the little girl then throws her into the water because they were throwing in flowers. Also because of his hideous looks he scares people which end up shooting at him. In the end a mob chases them into a mill that is burnt to the ground. The movie had a few starch differences than the book. See in the book the monster was given the ability to learn reason in the movie the monster was a slow learning half wit that couldn't function at all by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've actually read Frankenstein, you'll hate this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the worst film adaptation of a novel. Most people haven't actually read Mary Shelly's classic (probably because they think the story is as ridiculous as this movie), but to those 0.03% who have, I say RUN AWAY.Mrs. Shelly's vision was a profound allegory that entered on the themes of theosophy and the human condition. Her creature was never intended to be seen as a lumbering, mindless brute; he actually possessed superior intelligence, a love of the arts and literature, and above all, the simple desire to understand "why was I created?" But unfairly despised by his creator, he decides to seek justice. In the novel, the CREATURE is the protagonist. The ending is as unforgettable and poignant (to our own lives) as anything I've ever read.The movie ignores everything I've just told you about. Instead we get a stumbling, mindless beast who kills without reason, we get a dopey contrived love story thrown into the mix, we get an even more dopey contrived climax (the town suddenly goes wild!), and thus the entire point of the novel is mocked. Folks, it's as if I made a porno flick based on Romeo and Juliet. There are limits to how far you can corrupt an intellectual idea with carnal elements.The shameless corruption of Mary Shelley's novel is only the beginning. The acting is horribly overdone, the plot is predictably linear, and the dialogue is out of a comic book. And don't tell me that all old movies were that way. Haven't you ever seen M by Fritz Lang? People were NOT all idiots back then, and to say that this movie was an outstanding effort is an insult to the movies of the era which actually did hit the mark. FAUST by Murnau (1926) is another benchmark by which we see this film to be little more than an cheesy horror flick. How this movie got an 8.0 rating on IMDb is as baffling as how Lord of the Rings is IMDb's #14 of all time.On the plus side, the sets were quite magnificent. (Heh, that's all I have good to say about Lord of the Rings, too. Hmmm... maybe IMDb voters are mindlessly hypnotized by big sets. I must investigate this theory.)For some reason, the Frankenstein story has never been accurately translated to the screen. Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version was a step in the right direction, but... well... it's Kenneth Branagh (he should really be doing Broadway musicals, not movies). If any of you are familiar with the novel and can tell me of a good movie adaptation, please drop me a message. C'mon people, 200 years and no one has been able to get it right?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid movie watcher (u could say a film buff) and as i was about to watch the 1931 version of Frankenstein i was expecting to see some of cinema history unfold before my eyes, instead what i received was a bad excuse for a horror film even by 1931 standards. Editing and camera techniques are not revolutionary, actually they're even far from standard skill. Acting was not too great and writing was horrendous if compared to the novel by Mary Shelley. Overall this was not a great moment in cinema this was just another film that i think could be easily locked up in the studio vault and not watched for a long time. If anyone really wants to go see a good movie from 1931 go see "M", there's a classic. In Summation "Frankesntein BADDD"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, if you are going to create a movie that is based on a book, then actually use the book as a reference when making the film. When watching the 1931 version of "Frankenstein", I can easily see that the only things the movie shares with the book are the characters' names and what the scientist's experiments were. There is no one named "Fritz" in the book, the man that works on the experiments is Victor, not Henry. (Henry is Victor's little brother that is killed by the creature at a very young age). The way that the creature is made evil (by giving him a "criminal" brain) is completely inaccurate. The creature has a normal brain and begins his life as a benevolent, while grotesque, human being. In short, there is NOTHING that this pitiful film has in common with the novel. This is an awful representation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein", which is an excellent book. If you want the story, read Shelley's novel, and forget this inaccurate and dim-witted, (not to mention untalented) movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I saw besides the movie had no entertainment value and it threw away Mary Shelley's classic novel that dealt with feelings so intimately-Guilt for instance. This movie destroyed everything emotional of the characters and really gave Frankenstein a SUCKY name. The effects of the film were a bore, and I can't say the black and white helped much to the excitement. As for the characters, the bride and family members of Victor(titled George in this film) were completely throwaways..who cares if they die. As for all the talk about Borois Karloff, he mumbles and groans threw the entire film. How could someone think he was a classic actor. Why didn't they just get a dummy, put some fabric , and throw an old mans voice that just woke from his grave for fun. Is this acting? It was pitiful, I didn't care for the monster at all. The experience was completely unenjoyable and I'm sure my classmates(yes I watched this in school after the beautiful novel) would agree. As for the AFI list of great movies, it was only put there because it is an old classic, it means nothing it's just a way for people to stick up for it. This is just a really SUCKY movie with deteriorated and careless emotion.</fullReview>

But by any modern standards, this movie is simply unbearable!I am not complaining about the movie's not being faithful to the book at all. But aside from the points mentioned above, this movie 'sucks' in every respect - as a previous reviewer has so eloquently put it. The (over-)acting is ridiculous. Even Karloff's grunting, stumbling around, and waving his hands around theatrically is pathetic. The script is terrible (what script?). The plot is thin and predictable. The dialog is highly artificial and annoying. Some of the sets are pitiful (skies with wrinkles are really 'interesting').How can anybody with a 'normal' brain call this cheesy B-movie a 'masterpiece'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie, although a great example of Hollywood Depression Escapism film, was terrible. Of course i am speaking as someone who has read the book and believe that it was an insult to change so much. This movie simply wanted to let the people of the America Depression escape from whats going on around them by making the characters as simple as possible. The do not give the monster a voice, because if you give something a voice, it might explain itself, and the creators obviously wanted this monster to be hated with no regard to the unfair treatment it was given. But wait! That unfair treatment was only really evident in the book itself, Victor Frankenstein (or Henry Frankenstein as he is called in this film) treats him kindly in the beginning of the film and it is instead this mystery assistant that treats him unfairly.This movie, although a great example of Hollywood Depression Escapism, was an insult to the original novel and had Mary Shelly seen this film, she would have been offended. Had i not read the book first, my thoughts may be different, but i have read the book and loved it.</fullReview>

I'm not saying the 1994 version is a Excellent film, and this is Awful - I'm saying the 1931 version gave me a head-ache.There are better Frankenstin versions out there, start off with the 1994 version and go from there.1.5/5 (3/10). 1994 Version - 2.5/5 (5/10). Novel - 4/5 (8/10)If you see it for $3 on DVD, get it. But it's not worth more than $5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie. Ruined a Classic Novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very bad movie. Not only is it a horrible adaptation of the book, it itself is overall just a very bad movie. First off, even for the 1930's this is pathetic, the movie is just over an hour long. The movie changes absolutely everything that happens in the book, the acting is mediocre, the in the short time this movie plays, a lot of it is devoted to a bunch of scenes of a mob hunting after the monster. For those of you who read the book, you know that Frankenstein built the monster himself and then he woke up by himself. Here they made it that he shocked him with lighting during a storm. OK, so they wanted to add a little cooler twist, no prob. However, instead of building on the story that the monster became evil because he was rejected by humanity, he is supposedly innately evil because they accidentally use a criminal's brain. The problem is that after that, they go back to the original story of him becoming evil by bad treatment from Frankenstein's assistant. Then, later in the movie, he is having fun with a little girl and, through, stupidity, throws her into a lake and accidentally kills her. After that, the people in a the village go hunting for the monster, and he eventually faces off with Frankenstein in some windmill that get's burnt down with the monster inside. In the book, the monster learns how to speak and becomes very smart, and he hates Frankenstein because he made him so ugly etc. They made no attempt to build on the story of the monster having a personal vendetta against Frankenstein or how he wanted a female companion. In addition, the part where Frankenstein screams "its alive!", his movements make him look like he's having an orgasm, seriously, it looks dumb. Bottomline, this movie sucks. It's the longest hour you'll spend watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this was scary back in the day, but now it barely registers. The monster is more of a murderous drunk stumbling around the movie, and then he only kills 2 people. He ain't Jason. Plot contrivances, plot lapses, melodrama and lack of any character development make this a difficult movie to watch. Our introduction to the monster is especially humorous. He comes out of his stupor and proceeds to walk up the stairs (lucky guess?)to the living quarters of Dr. Frankenstein - backwards! This is clearly so we can be "shocked" when we see his face upon his turning round. We then get 2 cuts to close ups of his face. The action is pretty laughable too - blows are obviously missing their targets and the monster can be seen holding back to avoid actually hurting anyone.Nice historical artifact, but not sure its really watchable today.</fullReview>
