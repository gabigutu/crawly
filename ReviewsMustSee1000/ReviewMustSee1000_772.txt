		<shortDescription>Why do Woody Allen films have to be funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable. "Interiors" gets slammed as a forced, awkward, heavy-handed and cheapened imitation of Bergman (most noticeably "Cries and Whispers") and usually discussed in context of "Annie Hall" that preceded it and "Manhattan" that followed.Well, "Annie Hall" was funny as hell and I love "Manhattan" - it's directed with an authority that I don't think was matched in another Woody Allen film ("Crimes and Misdemeanors" had touches of such visual elegance). With the exception, of course, of "Interiors" which preceded it."Interiors" is Woody Allen putting aside his neuroses and directing with unshakable confidence. Granted, Bergman has already cleared the path for him to some degree, but "Interiors" stands on its own. Visually and aurally it's a quiet film, permeated with silences, dark off-white colors, beige and grays mostly, despair and sadness. It's the existential hell and it's a lot quieter than the descriptive terms make it seem.Narratively, "Interiors" has the fluidity and grace of any other of Allen's more successful films. Like the multi-character "Hannah and Her Sisters" or the parallelism of "Crimes and Misdemeanors" the stories, relationships and situations rise and build naturally."Interiors" is, essentially, the story of an upper-class family shattered, if not exposed and tested, by the divorce of the parents and the ensuing collapse of the mother. The title, of course, refers not only to the profession of the mother who is arguably the central character and definitely the emotional and psychological catalyst for the events of "Interiors," but also works on a metaphorical level. Interiors that Allen implies are those that shatter when the mother, phenomenally played by Geraldine Page, is forced to face the separation from her husband. The neat world constructed by her starts to crumble revealing not only the painful truth to her, but also to her daughters who are greatly affected by this as well. The truth, of course, is that nothing was perfect in the first place - the interiors were simply created to shelter from the reality of family crisis, bottled-up emotion, undue expectations, selfishness, synthetic love and conflict.The conflicts that arise, or rather expose themselves, bring to light themes that are quite frankly very Allenesque. Allen explores the burdens of existence, namely the inevitability of death (and the question of the immortality of art), loneliness, the failure of relationships (and thus violation of trust), and the search for meaning in life. "Interiors," however, differs from his other films in that it takes a distinctly psychological approach to these problems. It does so by not exposing its themes through "situations" (like Woody Allen finding out that he might be dying in "Hannah and her Sisters" and attempting suicide), but rather through realistic psychological observation of familial relations - particularly mother-daughter ones.Like many Bergman films, "Interiors" is psychological to the core, even though I don't recall a single shrink in the film. It's also dramatic and quieter than all other Allen films. Finally, it would be a shame not to mention that, while obviously very Bergmanesque, the film is seeped in the atmosphere of many Chekhov plays, bordering on the psychological darkness of Ibsen. "Interiors" is the American film version of early-20th century European theatrical drama - the problems of the well-off, upper-class families not being able to survive social, emotional and psychological instability that they themselves contributed to creating. We are talking of people with intellectual and monetary resources - resources that we treat as essential to happiness. "Interiors" like many of the darker of Allen's comedies, is a quietly terrifying question-mark - it is directed at our lives and our values. And the answers are nothing, but perturbing. Little to laugh about really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another anthropological glimpse of our times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Woody Allen's strong and quite films that, like most, is multi-layered. On the surface layer it presents an inside look at a dysfunctional family that is coming to terms with themselves, the divorce of their parents, and finally the death of their mother. Under this quite, but strikingly sorrowful first layer is a second layer of insight of considerably more importance. The underlayer is about the interaction of the principal characters and how they attempt to manipulate each other in generally destructive patterns that are even now becoming more and more prevalent in our socioeconomic culture. Not surprisingly, after a second or third look, this film should be included as part of the curriculum for medical residents working towards the specialty of Psychiatry. It is definitely a film about the destructive and continuing decaying family structure with which we are becoming more and more aware. It is not a film about morality, so important an issue in the 1990's, but about the simple misunderstanding of parenting in families that leave so many in our society emotionally crippled. The result is seen in the three daughters, representing the generations of bored and depressed young and middle aged, middle class people that spend great amounts of time and money trying to prove to themselves that they are happy and cope with the idea of real happiness that has eluded them. Of the films that will survive as anthropological glimpses of the 20th and possibly 21st Centuries in the United States, this film will be on the short list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not praise films simply because other people or critics love it; I also don't praise films simply because other people or critics hate it. I really do think for myself, so you can take it as an assured commendation when I say that this is one of the best melodramas ever put on film. I'm not a pseudo-intellectual; I don't think Woody Allen is perfect, and I'm not out to impress anyone with my taste. I simply loved the movie - the script, the visuals, the acting... all touched me deeply and moved me nearly to tears, which happens to me only about once for every hundred movies I see. People have complained that the movie is morbid, self-indulgent, that the characters are shallow; but I think that all three of these elements actually contribute to the film. Morbidity is a part of life, and this film is not an attempt to cover up the sad truths of existence with cheap laughs or explosions; self-indulgence does not preclude quality, and many of the best films ever made have been self-indulgent. And the characters exhibit both shallowness and depth, just like real people... I think that mostly people who criticize this film either don't have the attention span to relate to a slower movie, or they lack a certain empathy with those who suffer, or they simply expect every Allen film to be a comedy. If you can get past those hangups, though, you might just find that you love this movie too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Waters said that if this film was made under a Swedish pseudonym, they would of called it a masterpiece. Woody Allen was only able to get a film like this made after he won all those Oscars for Annie Hall. Everyone is great in here and it's nice that there's no soundtrack. This is one of Woody Allen's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's best drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allen's first really serious film plays like an Bergman film. It's a dead serious study of a very dysfunctional family.The father (E.G. Marshall) wants a trial separation from his wife (Geraldine Page). This totally destroys her life but her grown children try to help. One daughter (Diane Keaton) keeps giving her false hope that her husband will return. Meanwhile she has issues with her husband (Richard Jordan)--he finds her very condescending about his writing and she reacts with anger. Another daughter (Mary Beth Hurt) tries to get her mother to face reality. She has no direction in life herself and her husband (Sam Waterston) wants a child. A third daughter (Kristin Griffith) barely figures in this.Somber, bleak, quiet and stark. Full of angry, unsatisfied people--the only humor is provided by Maureen Stapleton who shows up late in the movie. This film contains many emotionally vicious moments. It's unpleasant sometimes but you can't stop watching. The dialogue is great--full of fascinating insights into what the characters are feeling. Occasionally the actors sound like they're giving speeches instead of talking but that's rare. Marshall seems ill at ease in his role but everyone else is dead on target. Especially good are Page who is frightening--you can see her trying not to feel and control everything at the same time. Keaton is just superb--one of her best ever dramatic performances. A highlight is the last sequence between Hurt and Page.The film sometimes seems over-directed--everything is so precise and ordered but it fits the tone of the movie. Also the ending is a little too pat and Griffith is given nothing to do--I often wonder what she was doing in this.Still this is an exceptional drama. It's not for everyone--it may be too bleak for most people but I think it's Allen's best drama. A 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A large ensemble cast, written, filmed, and directed with quiet force....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors (1978)This is one of those dark, serious, realistic personal dramas that critics shook their heads at in 1978. It wasn't because it wasn't good--it's frankly a brilliant combination of the big three: acting, writing, photography. It was because it was directed (and written) by Woody Allen. And Woody Allen is funny, right? Critics at the time, however, to their credit, gave the film a fair reading, and for three brilliant excerpt of period reviews, I recommend the Wikipedia entry on the movie.So watch this film thinking it's by someone else, if you have to. take it in on its own subtle terms as three sisters watch their own deficiencies bloom when their parents abruptly separate. There is some familiar territory here, actors Allen has turned to many times (including Diane Keaton, of course, who he was once, in 1970, involved with). The world is one that might actually be parallel to his own, not Jewish New York but rather a highly educated literary set with money and ambitions, but deeply steeped in the arts. In short, "Interiors" was and is appreciated but always with a feeling that it isn't quite complete, that it isn't what it could have been. It's easy to see that it is unremittingly dour, almost to perversion. And you might say that it plays the Bergman card too hard without overt appropriation (which makes it merely derivative, that worst of echoes). It is fair, I suppose, to say that Allen really has succeeded, but not in the remarkable ways he had succeeded so clearly in his earlier films, including his previous nugget, "Annie Hall," which is in my view his first true drama, but which has the benefit of also being funny.Or you can just sit back and take it in for what it does do so well, letting the interior lives of these people seem as shattered and pathetic as they really seem. The photography by Gordon Willis is admirable for being beautiful and inventive without being distracting. Allen and Willis make clear this intention with opening shots, a series of fixed camera views of rooms, and then views out windows, all framed with classic proportions, but sequenced to pull you in. But look how often the camera follows two people as they walk and talk, either up close in front of them, or along the beach through an irregular snow fence. Its pace and "tastefulness" of the photography almost seems designed by one of the main characters, the troubled interior decorator mother played with uncanny effectiveness by Geraldine Page.Expect nothing in particular here except a tour-de-force that works on its own depressing terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The three adult daughters of a quiet attorney and an imperious matriarch are alternately offended and benumbed by their parents' divorce and their father's "hasty" decision to remarry (leaving mama to fend for herself, probably something she needs but does not enjoy--there's no one to boss around). Bergmanesque drama from writer-director Woody Allen, who does not appear or even feel present (Pauline Kael of the New Yorker claims his neuroses have been transposed to the mother-character, but I never felt like I was watching something created by Woody Allen). All the actors are quite fine playing characters who are high-strung, uptight, woebegone (yet oddly, never intentionally comical), yet the flatness of the dialogue and the listlessness of Mary Beth Hurt's frequent narration may strain some viewers' patience. Some of the wordy sequences tend to ramble, and what words! Allen has a fixation with non-textbook terms for multiple abnormal psychoses; and no matter how educated Hurt's character is supposed to be, I had trouble swallowing some of the high-brow talk in her third-act put-down of Geraldine Page. The movie--seriously well-scrubbed, sterile and somber--has many conflicts and personality quirks which feel real and intricate, and Page's high society dementia is riveting (alternately, Maureen Stapleton's gaudy low-class is also superb). The three sisters remain enigmas that confound and confuse (each other and the viewer) but Diane Keaton's gritty reserve as the eldest daughter is the one I gravitated towards. Not a masterpiece (as some critics claimed), but certainly not a dud. It's Woody's art-house gambol, a dark one, and it leaves behind a fascinating imprint. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Dark as it Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that when you recommend, you should also warn.It is a very mature work about a very sick and warped family. It is also a very beautifully realized piece of filmmaking. The only real complaint I have about it is that it wasn't recorded in stereo or surround. Since Woody Allen is deaf in one ear, I guess he doesn't care. Thank God, he isn't color blind. Geraldine Page is absolutely devastating as the suffocating wife as she creates the woman of limited imagination and total self importance who strangles the joy of living out of her immediate family. She is a pathetic villain whose sick arrogance is the bane of every one she touches with her sterile iciness. This is a cautionary tale about what mental illness can do if left unchecked and untreated. It is also Woody Allen doing Bergman like Stanley Donen doing Hitchcock in Charade, not a lesser film than Bergman, just an American take on the same kind of situation. Bergman is not as good as Bergman. Every Good filmmaker gets elevated to such outrageous levels of hype in this disturbingly stupid era of 100 best lists that a lot of very good movies get ignored and filmmakers of previous eras are treated like trash, so that a self promoting cretin like Tarantino whose films are all style and absolutely zero substance can be lionized by a bunch of film school educated idiotic critics. This is not a must see, but it is an important film for the film scholar. As much as Enchanted April is life affirming, this one is life threatening. Talked to death has never been done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody Allen's most underrated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors is one of the most divisive films of one of the most love-it-hate-it directors. For me Interiors is not one of Allen's best films(Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Manhatten, Hannah and Her Sisters, Husbands and Wives) with some dialogue monologues that ramble on a bit too much, but when it comes to his most underrated films Interiors is very high on the list. It is very easy to see why people wouldn't like it with how bleak it is and how it's different from much of what Allen has done, but those are hardly reasons to dismiss Interiors because apart from the occasional rambling it is a great film. It is very stylishly shot with good use of locations, probably Allen's second most visually striking 70s film after Manhattan. Like Annie Hall, there's no music score and that's not a bad thing at all, Interiors is a very intimate and intricate film and having no music added to that quality. Much of the dialogue is full of insight and pathos, to me it did have dramatic weight and it is one of Allen's most honest films along with Husbands and Wives. The screenplay is not "funny" as such and is not as quotable as Annie Hall, but it wasn't ever meant to be. The story is paced deliberately but how Interiors was written and performed ensures that it isn't dull, it was very moving(personally it didn't topple into melodrama) and layered storytelling- didn't notice any convolutions- deftly handled. Allen directs assuredly in one of his more restrained directing jobs. The characters are neurotic and not the most likable, but are written and performed with such compelling realism that in the end there is some sympathy felt for them. The cast was a talented one in the first place, and none of them disappoint. Especially good are Geraldine Page, in one of her best performances, in very frightening and heart-breakingly tormented form and Mary Beth Hurt, the centrepiece of the story and is very affecting. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as the most lively character- an anti thesis to the rest of the characters but not an out of place one- and E.G. Marshall brings a great deal of quiet dignity. Diane Keaton when it comes to Woody Allen films is better in Annie Hall and Manhattan but plays a purposefully shrill character with gusto. Richard Jordan and Sam Waterson are fine. Kristin Griffith is good too but her part seemed underwritten. All in all, won't be for everybody but a great film from personal perspective and one of Woody Allen's most underrated. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SUPERLATIVES FAIL THIS EXTRAORDINARY FILM FROM WOODY ALLEN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe 'Interiors' is Woody Allens finest hour: it is his masterpiece. The best film of 1978 and one of the finest American films ever.The acting by the entire cast is superb. If any one film derserved an academy award for ensemble acting, it's this one. Geraldine Page is chilling in her cool intensity; Mary Beth Hurt is astounding and Maureen Stapleton is a revelation. Diane Keaton; E.G. Marshall; Sam Waterston; Richard Jordan and Kristin Griffith are equally great.When I get down on myself and question my intellect, thinking of my appreciation of 'Interiors', reminds me of my own potential and love of the cinema. 11 out of 10.Darren Cunningham</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstandingly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - the first being Susan Sontag's "Brother Carl" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell." Pretty much the same thing here. "Interiors" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking into the middle distance: "I don't like who I'm becoming.") The directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker." "Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it.") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity").The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light," the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.Allen's later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I'll take "Interiors." Woody's rarely made a funnier movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All these women cry and whisper on Long Island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Interiors" (1978) ? is the first Woody Allen's attempt to create a straight drama film after the series of hilarious comedies ("Bananas", "Everything you always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask", "Sleeper") and one of his most famous dramedies, "Annie Hall". "Interiors" is Allen's dissection of an upper middle class family in crisis. The story is not original. Arthur (E.G. Marshall), the husband of a Long Island interior designer Eve (Geraldine Page), demanding and imperious, and father of their three grown daughters (Diane Keaton, Marybeth Hurt and Kristin Griffith), informs his wife that he wanted a trial separation. She hopes that it is temporary but soon learns that there is another woman involved, (Maureen Stapleton), twice a widow, "a vulgarian" who does not belong to the upper class but is full of life, humor, and warmth and whom Arthur wants to marry. More than anything, this movie reminds the famous shot in Bergman's "Persona" - two faces combined in one. You are not sure which features are Liv's and which - Bibi's. With "Interiors", it is difficult to say where Bergman ends and Allen begins. I would also compare Allen's first exercise in creating a serious drama to Bergman's attempt in comedy, "All these women". Both masters tried to do something different from what they were expected by the critics and their audience and both did not achieve a success. I respect Allen's homage to Bergman's work but I think he is much more interesting when he combines drama and comedy in his films. I admire his ability to create the movies that are subtle and cruel, darker than dark and self-ironic, profound and touchingly poignant, deadly serious and incredibly funny ? at the same time. Not this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interior Surfaces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a Laraine Newman Saturday Night Live skit in which she plays a ditzy stewardess who bakes a peach cobbler for her Beverly Hills boyfriend. "Look," the boyfriend's mother remarks, "The shiksa's baked us a Presbyterian Pie!" Ladies and Gents, this is Woody Allen's Presbyterian Pie. In Interiors, we see (but only through his direction, for once) Allen on stilts attempting to reach the stature of a truly great director, Ingmar Bergman. It's interesting to think that, while Bergman is said to be one of Allen's favorite directors, so much of the Swede's influence, at least in this movie, seems to have proved indigestible, or incomprehensible, to Woody. At least that's the only way I can explain the clumsy, aping, pastiche-like quality to the to the long, drawn-out silences, and the improbable intellibabble dialogue. I live in a college town, and I never sat through a dinner like that. Geraldine Page makes what was, at that time, a rare appearance as an ice-grey-clad snow queen in her "ice palace:" in Allen's sex-obsessed, Freudian universe, her problems stem from this frigidity first, and the same lack of any real feeling extends to her daughters. I would suggest that not only has this character lost her life-it seems to have been stolen from her in some mysterious way by her husband and daughters-but the character itself, down to mannerisms and hairstyle, is simply a late Bibi Andersson impersonation, and as such is enough to throw even the most avid student of films into a tailspin, since the character doesn't derive so much from the plot, such as it is, as from the director/writer's idea of what a Bergmanesque matriarch should look and sound like. So there is no real explanation for her actions, or her character. Ms. Page's Oscar nomination for the role can be traced to the rarity of her film roles, and her stage reputation, coupled with Hollywood's obsessive need to legitimize itself as Real Theater. Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt, and Sam Waterston give delectably pained and studied performances. There is much sighing, clenching of jaws and twisting of heads, as if the characters' neuroses had somehow translated themselves into virulent forms of neuralgic palsy. They can't think the cricks out of their necks, however, just as they can't make the dialogue sound real. This movie was a step forward for Allen, in that normally his characters did little more than talk, copulate, think about it, and talk some more. Here they cut out the sex part and simply think, think, and talk and talk. About nothing you or I would be the least bit interested in. Since Allen, in long view, seems to be something of an anomaly, a deep thinker inside a basically shallow person, the characters say things like (of someone's cologne): "It permeates the house." Honestly, has anyone ever sat in your presence and used the word "permeates" in conversation? But what can you expect of characters who show more emotion over the breaking of a vase than they do while fending off being raped, attending their father's wedding, or their mother's funeral? And, notice: every single review of this film you'll ever read mentions that vase: it's almost the only thing that happens in this film. Maureen Stapleton, as others have mentioned, is the salvation of this movie, and as a "vulgarian," is completely outdone (probably unintentionally) by Page: what could be more vulgar than smashing the prayer candles in a church, or appearing at the scene of your ex-husband's wedding in order to commit suicide? I have to admit, I was really rooting for the old girl to catch that undertow, since the gaspipe hadn't done the job. I vote for typing this movie as a kind of fantasy, one where a New York comic is transformed into a Northern European auteur, making yet another memorable film-which this film, some 20 years after the buzz has worn off, simply is not. Keep trying, Woody, but try to be more like yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring convoluted drivel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no excuses for this trite and excruciating examination into the lives of a mentally and emotionally imbalanced family, poorly served up as a "serious film".Watching "Interiors" is like watching a painful therapy session of the disintegration of a dysfunctional family behind one-way glass. You as the viewer, have no say about the things that they do. At times, the film goes at such slow pace, it's like watching paint dry.There really isn't much of a plot here. Critics and 'high intellects' may try and dress this up in praise and fancy words, but when you remove all the frills and fancy wrapping, there's not much left but an empty dusty room with a few dead flies.The plot (or what there is of it), concerns a recently separated wealthy couple (E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page), their three spoilt brat daughters who are now grown up (Mary Beth Hurt, Diane Keaton and Kristin Griffith), their spouses (Richard Jordan and Sam Waterson) and their father's new lover and wife-to-be (Maureen Stapleton).That's the plot. Geraldine Page, in her most boring and one-dimensional role throughout her elegant film history, parades around on the screen in New York socialite fashions, murmuring constantly like a blithering idiot about designs and colors while clinging to a false and rather stupid hope that E.G. Marshall will return to her.E.G. Marshall on the other hand has been driven away by her psychotic isolation and crumbling dementia, into the arms of a 'lower class' lady, portrayed by the always dependable and talented Maureen Stapleton. Why Stapleton has always shone in 'supporting roles' and never a main one is beyond me. She totally stole the movie here.She appears in one scene wearing a striking red dress, clashing against the sterile, antiseptic and clinical tones that Page applied to the beach house where she once lived. As artistic Woody Allen may have intended this vision to be, it was the only scene in this entire trash that actually made me appreciate anything about this movie.The daughters themselves are on an entirely different page altogether. Not one of them were worth feeling any bit sympathetic for. They were all self-indulged, spoilt, egotistical vile brats that made you wish very bad things upon them. Mary Beth Hurt's character was the worst. She was just a very disgusting and ugly being, revolting on the inside and not very attractive on the out. She spends most of her time pacing back and forth spouting wit and wisdom like she were quoting from the book of high intellect itself (seriously, as someone else pointed out, I have never heard ANYONE talk like she does in this movie).Diane Keaton is surprisingly wasted in an unsympathetic role where she feels that Mary Beth Hurt is the favorite daughter and that she herself is just a foil to absorb all of her mother's misfortunes and bad luck. Whenever her mother suffers a nervous breakdown, Diane Keaton receives the brunt of it. Whenever her mother needs to complain about whether or not their father will be driven back into her arms, Diane Keaton receives the brunt of it. It never ends. Keaton herself, is supposed to be some sort of a struggling poet with a one-hit-wonder author for a spouse. Between the two of them, they sit around waxing fancy words and witty dialect, you're not sure whether you've just stumbled upon a re-enactment of the last days of Socrates.The third daughter (Kristin Griffith) is the youngest. She is a struggling actress relegated to third-rate television shows. She is barely around, hence the reason why Keaton and Hurt receive most of their mother's anguish. When she does make an appearance, she doesn't offer anything to the film, other than to appear in a ridiculous scene where she is nearly raped by Richard Jordan's character during a drunken confrontation.For about an hour and a half, Keaton, Hurt and Page spend most of the time talking out of their behinds concerning their feelings and anguish, about why they are the way they are and how screwed up their lives are. Hurt's character especially is the most grating, as an unemployed no-hoper who takes out all of her misfortunes on her poor deranged mother and anyone else who has the misfortune of being around to listen to her whine and whine and whine.My hopes were brightened when Maureen Stapleton enters the picture. She is a kind lady caught in the middle of this psychotic mess, along with E.G. Marshall who is rather clueless to his children's unbalanced emotions and their despise towards both him and their mother. I actually never grasped why they were so angry. They didn't have a poor upbringing, their parents gave them everything they ever wanted (except maybe a hug?), and yet they're convinced that it's the end of the world and that their lives have been screwed up forever. Give me a break!The worst part about all of this is the fact that despite all the anger, anguish, hopeless despair and sadness, Woody Allen manages to drag it out for nearly two hours (and it feels like it too, every second of every minute). But between every over-exaggerated emotion that is acted out, there is at least a 10 minute boring part in the middle that you have to sit through.That is how the DVD should have been made. Each chapter could be skipped via 'scene of emotion' (ie. Chapter 1 - When Mary Beth Hurt screams. Chapter 2 - When Diane Keaton wails about why she's got it so bad. Chapter 3 - When Mary Beth Hurt whines about, etc.)There is small satisfaction in the final scenes where Geraldine Page's character expires by taking a walk into the ocean, but other than that - I was so glad when the closing credits appeared. The movie just never seems to stop. There really is no pleasure in watching "Interiors", unless you get your kicks out of watching rich dysfunctional families cry about why the world is so unfair.Please. It may be the year 2004, but I can guarantee you that times weren't THAT different in 1978. This movie is an exercise in patience. The acting is overdone and the direction is just cheesy. Woody overdoes the 'artsy fartsy' crap by trying to see how many times he can artfully shoot a scene with the heads of the three sisters in the one scene. It's laughable really, and that's the only slightly amusing thing about this boring drivel.How this film got all those Oscar nominations and critical applause is beyond me. It's almost like the critics felt that if they didn't praise this movie, they would be thought of as either "un-hip" or they "just didn't get it". Sad really.My Rating - 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not irrevocable .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Allen's Stardust Memories, he lifted from Fellini and did it well by applying his own coat of comic absurdity which he always feels comfortable with. Here, the opening is reminiscent of Bergman, with its icy silence, the harsh, despairing voice-over and the bleak sparsity of nature reflected back at our character. This was Allen's first attempt at a drama after the hugely successful Annie Hall, and it shows. It is also his first film not to feature himself, which I think is crucial. Allen seems a little pained when he needed to diverge from that comedic archetype and can't quite let go. Crimes and Misdemeanors is brilliantly constructed but seems to flit in and out of a morbid moral dilemma and a lighter hearted Allen type who doesn't get all that he wants. In Interiors, the characters speak at length like they were in an Allen comedy, but continue with a darker, psychological edge about them. A decade later Allen would make the full fledged comedy version of this film in Hannah and Her Sisters, revolving not around the mother but the perfect sister. In that film, Allen seems again to be tacked on. The title refers to the mother hen of the family, Eve, who is an interior decorator. It is immediately obvious that this is less a career of passion than obsession; while she fields the questions of her children and their partners, she rearranges the room and muses that this shade is too strong and that this vase should belong in the bathroom. Many people would share this mania for control. But then we slowly discover that her preferences are not just directed towards furniture and decor; her children have long been pigeon-holed into their own neat little categories, and when her husband Arthur announces a trail separation, she reacts with the same speechless shock as if she was seeing a vase out of place or awkwardly clashing with the colour scheme. The precise rigidity of her life has been marred. The three sisters each have their own lives and troubles. Middle child Joey, traditionally the one with the less attention, has a terrible sort of curse on her life, being an intuitive and thoughtful thinker but not having the artistic talents or gifts her siblings have to express them. She is therefore the object of least affection, or at least until Eve has something to complain or vent about. The youngest is Flynn, who is the most beautiful and the most free of the family, relatively. It is obvious that time spent away from their toxicity has given her new life and license to pursue her dreams without her mother vicariously living through her every achievement. Naturally, they talk and snidely insult her behind her back. Keaton's Renata is the weakest of the trio - she comes off a little whiny, as the designated Allen intellectual probing with the issues of death and immortality. She has discovered that no matter how revered her poetry is, or how much it will be recited beyond her grave, it is of little meaning. She has the sort of gift that Joey would kill for, but endlessly agonises over other issues. The film's strengths lie in these characters and their dynamics which bounce off each other, and reveal bruises and long forgotten scars. Their dialogue is as heavy as Allen has ever written, although his detractors will once again question the sincerity of these issues on the backdrop of such a wealthy high-class lifestyle. They drown each other out in their arguments, and fling their own insecurities at one another in hopes of getting a tiny bit of recognition and sympathy. It becomes clear that this trait is inherited from none other than Eve herself, and suggests that it may be passed on in time. And then there is Pearl, the bright and exotic house-wrecker type that turns a trail separation into a permanent divorce. But it isn't during the children's youth, and although the family seem baffled by Arthur's decision, it does not seem unreasonable. He has provided for the family for a long time and feels as if he should be free to chase his own desires. Maureen Stapleton enters in a flashy red dress that no doubt would disgust Eve (and wreck the colour palette of the interiors). She's sensible, she's compassionate, she talks freely of her past loves without a hint of emotional baggage or resentment. She doesn't quite feel like discussing the nuances of the play they just saw. And there's the remarkably well-handled scene where she shows off her 'magic' and offers to read fortunes, except she is just turning over cards until she gets to the right one. What seems to be something that is set up for ridicule by the high-class intellectual family becomes a bit of harmless fun. And in resuscitating Joey, she breathes new life and sets herself up as the newer, more capable mother candidate, the complete antithesis of Eve. This is not as complex or confident in its dramatic depth as some of Allen's later films, but it remains an important step for his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone else get this from the movie like me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, and I just watched this movie for the first time. I can totally understand why many people hate it, or do not like it. It is depressing, and there's no real "finish" or arc for the characters.That being said, the one thing that stood out for me that nobody has mentioned, is that even Woody Allen didn't like the characters. I think that was his point. As some have pointed out, the characters are pretentious, self absorbed upper middle class yuppies with no real problems. I think what Woody Allen was doing, as was the case in Manhattan, was giving us a glimpse into that sort of liberal elitist upper crest society, where these characters in particular are pseudo-intellectuals and wannabe artists, who create their own problems that really don't mean anything.This would explain the introduction of Pearl, the fathers new fiancé. Pearl is great. Amidst all the self absorbed, elitist syrup the characters espouse relentlessly, Pearl emerges as almost a down to earth, working class gal.The family goes out to a play with their father and Pearl, and later while eating dinner, they are discussing this play. The daughters and their yuppy husbands are over analyzing the play to literally a puke inducing pretentiousness...and Pearl just chimes in "One character was a squealer, the other wasn't. I liked the character who wasn't a squealer. Thats all there is to it!" They try to argue with her with more pretentious drivel, and Pearl simply states again "The message I got was "dont Squeal." Later, Pearl is dancing to dixieland music with everybody, and knocks over a vase on accident, and the one daughter calls her an animal. Towards the end of the movie, Pearl ends up saving the daughters life with CPR after she nearly drowns. She seems almost ungrateful. Its as if this fmaily is so elitist, they look down on Pearl as some sort of "inferior".Pearl is a down to earth, normal, lovable older woman with some spunk, which is why the father fell in love with her. Throughout the movie, we see how dominating and obnoxious their mother is. She is pretty much the reason the family is dysfunctional, with her delusional, relentless whining, and quiet yet aggressive behavior. On top of that, she was a successful interior designer, and her 3 daughters are all "artsy" intellectuals...and you can see why a character like the father is just overwhelmed with them all, and falls in love with a very grounded, relatively simple woman, Pearl.I think it was Woodys purpose to make you feel burdened or overwhelmed by the characters, the mother...hell, almost feel completely alienated, only to suddenly find yourself relating to Pearl when she arrives.Another scene that kind of highlights the pretentiousness of the characters, one of the girls husbands is speaking into a tape recorder about marxism and communism, hinting that he is a supporter of such ideology. Which, again, is woody making a small point. Because here you have this wealthy, yuppy guy, embracing the concept of marxism.For anyone who grew up or lived around New York in the 60's and 70's, that was always one of those ironies...wealthy yuppy types preaching about marxism and communism. Its sort of a hypocrisy Woody Allen often points out in many of his movies.To summarize, this was a serious movie that essentially criticizes the upper class liberal crowd, as Woody has done in many of his movies. In Manhattan, Woody narrates in the film at the end about how its full of people with no real problems, so they create them. That is essentially the characters in this film. They want for nothing...so they began creating these "existential dilemmas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Turn For The Serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three sisters find their lives spinning out of control in the wake of their parents' sudden, unexpected divorce.What do we have here? A Woody Allen film with no comedy, and no Woody. We have Joel Schumacher as the costume designer (before his years as director) and something that amounts to a Bergmanesque family drama, though without the full Scandinavian despair.Vincent Canby wrote, "My problem with Interiors is that although I admire the performances and isolated moments, as well as the techniques and the sheer, headlong courage of this great, comic, film-making philosopher, I haven't any real idea what the film is up to." The criticism aside, Canby calls Allen out for being heavy on the philosophy references, with the dense writing of Allen that he is known for and makes his films his own. Is this Bergman? No. Is it Allen trying to be Bergman? Maybe. But it has Allen all over it, in the dialogue, and that has some value in and of itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely absorbing, but also extremely studied in its humorlessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the very least, "Interiors" is fascinating viewing because it's so damn hard to believe it was written and directed by the same person who had made "Sleeper" just five years earlier, in which he also acted, and spent his first five minutes making weird faces at the camera. With "Interiors", Woody Allen goes out of his way to eliminate every trace of humor or happiness out of the picture, and nearly every trace of warmth as well. It's a moody film dripping with misery. There are scenes and lines that cry out for a comic spin ("I want to express something but I don't know what to express or how to express it" or "An enormous abyss between us" - reminded me of the "empty void" that Allen's character was feeling in "Love And Death"), but Allen is determined to play it all deadly straight. In later films such as "Hanna And Her Sisters", he would temper the heavy drama and the psychoanalysis with sarcastic observations and memorable one-liners, and the results would be both more balanced and more enjoyable. But if you accept "Interiors" for what it is, it really is extremely well made. Though most of the characters are clichés, they are so perfectly acted that they become real persons. And Allen's choice not to include a music score is as brilliant as when Alfred Hitchcock did it for "The Birds". *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Powerful Allegory of an Artist's Mind Questioning his Own Inspiration ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this review with one simple question : what's with this Bergmanian obsession? Everything has been said and re-said about "Interiors" and the word 'Bergman' regularly filled the accolades, I myself labeled "Interiors" as Allen's homage to Bergman. Yet what I have just figured after a second and third viewing (both in a row) is that "Interiors" stands alone as a classic psychological and introspective drama. I'm not ignoring Allen's new stylistic licenses, yes, there is the trademark static shots, the sight of people contemplating a still nature mirroring the desert of their own lives, yes, the antagonism between Joey and Eve is a reminiscent of "Autumn Sonata"'s emotional core,. But "Interiors" has the merit to go deeper in the comprehension of one notion that takes all its significance when it's associated with Woody Allen: accomplishment.Let's have a quick look on the poster. It shows three sisters' faces, they don't look at each other but they still look in the same direction, with peaceful and determined expressions. The image conveys both the feeling of reconciliation and independence while the film's opening shot shows the protagonists at different places, staring through the window at different horizons. They might live separately but they're all shackled together and never have family ties been so synonyms of curses.The oldest is Renata, a successful poet writer who became disillusioned about the value of her own creations, she's stuck in a sort of mental block, questioning the purpose of leaving stuff for posterity. The youngest is Flyn (Krystin Griffith), a seductive and flirtatious TV actress, whose roles are nonetheless limited to B-movies. In between, Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) is insecure, incapable to find the right path to work upon, she doesn't want a child and a useless job, she wants to create but hasn't still figured what. What do these three different personalities have in common?The answer relies on the central character: Eve (Geraldine Page), the mother who gives its very meaning to the title. She was an interior designer, very perfectionist, she was more attracted by cool and sophisticated arrangements, her choices of color are very austere but to a certain extent, all her Family trusted her to design the "interiors" of their lives. But human hearts are not furniture, and the whole foundations rapidly started to collapse when the three daughters realized how futile it was, as it never provided them the capability to lead lives on their own. All their choices of life interact with a cruel irony. But interestingly, it's the father who seals the Family's fate. Arthur, a wealthy lawyer, (E.G. Marshall) reveals his intentions to leave the house. The declaration he makes is a masterstroke of writing, as we can hardly find his motives unreasonable. He paid all the bills, did his best to ensure his daughters a good education, so why wouldn't he be allowed to think for himself. The scene echoes the opening lines when he relates the way Eve changed from a beautiful and classy lady to a total stranger. The tragedy of all the protagonists in "Interiors" is that the awareness isn't enough; grieves and hurts that inhabit their hearts are so heavy that it continues to work as obstacles to live their lives without being governed by the others. However as bleak and sinister as the film apparently gets, it is not pessimistic, but it invites us to question what kind of lives we desire for ourselves. And the clues are given by the peripheral characters, Mike (Sam Waterston), Joey's husband is a filmmaker who believes that a child could cure Joey from her existential torments. Frederick (Richard Jordan) can't dissociate mediocrity from the peers' recognition, no matter how sincerely Renata compliments him; he'll feel inferior to her as long as he doesn't win a single award. And then there's Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), the "vulgarian", the woman who conquered Arthur's heart, a down-to-earth nature who prefers beaches to Greek temples, eating, dancing, drinking, rather than getting caught in some intellectual masturbation about the meaning of life. She epitomizes the polar opposition from the values the three daughters grew in. With her dress, in the bleak almost monochromatic setting Eve painted to her Family, Pearl is like a bright and flashy red stain. She feels things rather than intellectually distorting them. She doesn't see her previous marriages as failures at all since life is about new sensations to live and live again while, for Eve, the separation was a failure that irremediably damaged her health. Is feeling the solution?I read in a recent article that Allen was never satisfied by his films and never watched them twice, he even disregarded "Hannah and her Sisters" one of his most acclaimed creations. This attitude says a lot about the intelligent humility of a creator questioning his own creation, like so many geniuses do, and he's one. He's Renata who wonders what the purpose of pursuing a creative process is, and whether it works or not is futile because one satisfaction is not a key to plain happiness. He's Flyn, who's constantly associated to the same standards.But more than anyone, he's Joey, a woman who lives in the adoration of superior talents, aware of her lack of potential, trying to imitate but never equaling her idols. The film is Allen first full-alleged drama, and in my opinion, the characters are only multiple facets that highlight Allen's own insecurities, as if he was trying to design himself the emptiness of his own creation, or to reorganize it before taking a new creative start, which he'll ultimately do in the 80's.Maybe Bergman have something to do, after all?. But the conflicts driving the film's rich plot line say more about Allen vs. Allen than Allen vs. Bergman, as if the titular "Interiors" were only the intellectual metaphor of his own personal, artistic, inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema's 1978 Cult-Classic 'Interiors' is among the finest films of all-times. A Terrific, Heartbreaking, Drama, that is so well-done, that it's stunning in it's own way.'Interiors' Synopsis: Three sisters find their lives spinning out of control in the wake of their parents' sudden, unexpected divorce.'Interiors' is unsettling &amp; VERY depressing, but that's the power of this masterful drama. It's about a family reaching breaking-point, it's about their downfall, a fall, so deep, that it can cause them to never get up from it. It's too heartbreaking to see this family break into pieces scene-by-scene, but Allen's Writing as well as his Direction, are so captivating &amp; pulverizing, that it leaves a stunning impact.Allen has delivered many remarkable films in his illustrious career, but 'Interiors' is among his Great Works. Here's a film that defines fine-writing &amp; remarkable complexity. I was awed by the way Allen has handled this film &amp; how well he has come out of it.'Interiors' is embellished with magnificent performances. Geraldine Page is absolutely riveting, while Diane Keaton &amp; Kristin Griffith are brilliant. Mary Beth Hurt is extremely natural in her part. Maureen Stapleton is fantastic, as always. E.G. Marshall is superbly controlled &amp; Sam Waterston is efficient.On the whole, 'Interiors' is a GREAT Cinematic Achievement! Woody Allen is at the top of his game in here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interiors is Woody Allen's first straight drama, and while most compare the film to Ingmar Bergman (one of Allen's favorite directors), the film's examination of a dysfunctional family struggling for normalcy is a forerunner to such '80s films as Ordinary People and Shoot the Moon, and acclaimed '90s films The Ice Storm, Happiness and American Beauty. The film focuses on three sisters (not the first time Woody Allen would do this), and their reaction to their parents' sudden divorce and then their father's affair with a less glamorous, but very REAL, woman.Maureen Stapleton plays the new woman and has what I feel is the most heartbreaking scene in the movie. One of the sisters (played by Mary Beth Hurt) inexplicably lashes out at Stapleton after she accidentally breaks a vase. Stapleton's reaction to this is so touching that I remembered it long after the other events faded away. The film is good but stagy; I prefer Woody Allen's later serious dramas because they seem less confined or more stylish (the various Manhattan settings in "Another Woman" and the sudden blackout in the Vermont house in "September"). Still, fans of the '90s films should seek this one out, and since Woody Allen doesn't appear, movie fans should invite Woody bashers over to their homes and start the movie right after the opening credits. The reactions may be interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bleak and Scandinavian , as Keaton said in Manhattan, but still a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, Woody Allen reached new heights with his academy award winning hit, Annie Hall, and was rewarded with 2 Oscars. He followed it up with Interiors, a dark, melodramatic film with virtually no comedy without Woody Allen in front of the camera. It was rewarded with 5 academy award nominations, but received ultimately terrible reviews and flopped.But the reputation Interiors has earned through the years doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece of sprawling proportions. The movie Interiors is certainly the most uncompromising drama I have ever witnessed from any American director. It's honest, dark, characters randomly stare into oblivion, and it's just bluntly realistic without any remorse. This all came from the same guy that had Gene Wilder having sexual relationships with a sheep 5 years prior, and a reputation as a pure comedic director.It's hard to recommend a film like this, even to Allen fanatics. If you don't admire ART, it could resemble paint drying. Allen takes an uncompromising route with these characters, never letting an ounce of remorse drip from his story. But it works quite well as a study on Human behavior, and what can happen to families with materialistic possessions, without love. The scene with Diane Keaton's character, in the analyst, is one of the finest scenes from an Allen film. She confesses her own obsession with immortality through her work, a huge theme in Interiors. Characters to genius to enjoy the simple things in life. They're all way too concerned with immortality. Interiors is not really a classic, but it is one of the best dramas ever made. It's so bleak and melodramatic, but I loved every minute of it. Allen's a genius when it comes to analyzing his characters. Unlike Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, etc, Interiors doesn't contain enough mixture of comedy and drama to keep you interested in the characters development. The pure melodrama dooms these characters from the beginning leaving you without any hope in them changing. I still give Interiors 9 stars for the blunt honestly, but I refuse to give it classic status on account of the relentless melodrama. I'd recommend Hannah and Her sisters for a more optimistic view on family life, and immortality. Still an underrrated masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent cast in a psychological drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen assembled one of the most brilliant casts ever for his first serious film, "Interiors," made in 1978. The stars are Geraldine Page, Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt, E.G. Marshall, Maureen Stapleton, Sam Waterston, Richard Jordan, and Kristin Griffith. There's great acting and there's great acting. This was GREAT acting.The story concerns basically two young women, Renata (Diane Keaton) and Joey (Mary Beth Hurt), who must cope with the separation and ultimate divorce of their parents Arthur and Eve (Geraldine Page and E.G. Marshall), their mother's emotional and mental instability, and their father's remarriage to a very different woman (Maureen Stapleton). They also must deal with their feelings toward each other and toward their spouses (Richard Jordan and Sam Waterston).Arthur and Eve's marriage was a cold one, and one can clearly see that any happiness Eve brought Arthur had ended long ago. She's a rigid, domineering woman who raised her children in an icy atmosphere where everything was in its place and perfect. As is normal in dysfunctional families, the children escaped by using their imaginations - Renata is a successful poet and Joey dabbles in painting and writing, unable to find her way. Guilt-ridden over her feelings of anger toward her mother, she has tied herself to her and become responsible for her care. As is also typical of dysfunctional families, there is the family member who escaped - in this case, it's Flyn, who lives on the other side of the country, in California, and is a marginally successful actress. But she hasn't escaped, she's just put some distance between herself and her family. She is unhappy with her career; she snorts coke.Eve lives in a delusional world where she and Arthur will reconcile; she never fully accepted the separation. An interior designer, she furnishes Joey's home with furnishings that are much too expensive for Joey and her husband to afford. She continually works to create a sterile, tasteful, perfect atmosphere, dressing in the same earthy tones she uses in her designs.When Arthur introduces his new girlfriend, Pearl, to his daughters, she is completely unlike their mother. She's a round, fun-loving, fast-talking, simple, down to earth woman who has buried two husbands. Renata thinks her father should be happy. Joey is furious and afraid her mother can't handle it. When Arthur asks Eve for a divorce, it's in a church, and Eve, so quiet and measured as they talk, at last goes ballistic, destroying the votive candles.The end of the film is extremely powerful, as Joey fights for her life - literally as well as figuratively - and is given life by her new stepmother. Perhaps now Joey can really live.This film would have made a magnificent play - in fact, it still would - with its intelligent dialogue and character studies. It is a purely character-driven script. Geraldine Page, one of the greatest actresses who ever lived, delivers a tremendous performance as Eve, a woman who can't face reality - the death of her marriage and the anger and resentment of her children. Her disturbed character has very rapid mood swings, and Page flips in and out of these peaks and valleys with ease. Everything about her is held in - her jaw is clenched, her hair is tight and neat, her smile is forced - you can't imagine her ever being a loving mother, as indeed, she wasn't.Maureen Stapleton is great as the outgoing Pearl, a loving woman who can give Arthur the happiness he has long missed. She listens to a highly intellectual conversation not understanding what the heck they're talking about - Arthur's daughters can only relate on an intellectual level; they know nothing else. She is incredibly out of place in the family, but as the earth mother, she might actually make this family a real one at last.Diane Keaton, always excellent, is no less excellent as the shining star Renata, who must cope with an alcoholic novelist husband who believes his talent is less than hers. At the wedding reception, he drunkenly attempts to rape Flyn, who has been doing coke when he approaches her.Mary Beth Hurt (whose last name is Hurt because she was married to William) is a long-time stage actress. As Joey, she is very nondescript, unable to find an identity, let alone a "look." She is stuck in a dull marriage to a dull political scientist (Waterston). It's not what she wants; she seems to want Renata's creative life, but with her identity so tied to her mother, she can't break free. Finding out she's pregnant, she becomes angry and terrified, determined to "get rid of it." Hurt gives a wonderful performance, her big moment at the end of the film when she confronts her mother.As much as I love Woody Allen's comedy, his dramas always seem to strike the right chord - Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point come to mind immediately. Interiors is brilliant, made at a time when special effects were just starting to rule. Leave it to Allen. Not one to follow trends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dysfunctional Family Wrapped in Frigid Austerity Makes for Allen's So-Serious Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty obvious that Woody Allen was so resistant in being confined as a comedy filmmaker that in the throes of his success with the wondrous "Annie Hall", he felt a need to make an über-serious drama in the Ingmar Bergman mode. This 1978 Chekhovian family drama is the result, and it is alternately affecting and exasperating. The key problem is that Allen presents such a hermetically sealed world of intellectuals and artistic souls that the interactions among the characters feel pointed and self-conscious. He has obviously since learned that his best films ("Manhattan", "Hannah and Her Sisters") are served most by his particular balance between comedy and drama.The story concerns an upscale New York family reacting to the news that patriarch Arthur wants to leave his psychologically unstable wife Eve just released from a sanitarium. They have three daughters, all of whom are grappling with their own problems. Eldest sister Renata is a successful poet stuck in a volatile marriage to Frederick, a fellow writer whose lack of commercial success has merely heightened his jealousy and paranoia. Middle daughter Joey is Arthur's favorite, but she is unable to figure out what to do with her life, and her constant flailing frustrates everyone around her in spite of the patience of her boyfriend Michael. Youngest daughter Flyn is the beautiful, emotionally isolated one who moved to Hollywood to become a semi-successful actress.They all respond to their mother Eve's neediness in different ways, and the inevitable turning point comes when Arthur finalizes the divorce and remarries, this time to a passionate, fun-loving widow named Pearl. Even though Gordon Willis' beige-dominated cinematography and the frigid, almost-too-perfect art direction by Mel Bourne and Daniel Robert lend the extreme austerity for which Allen seems to be striving, the acting is what makes this film dramatically effective. Mary Beth Hurt gives a brave performance as Joey, capturing all the inadequacy and wounded rejection her character feels. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as Pearl, lending an amusing earthiness and colorful indifference when she arrives late in the story.With her severe look, Geraldine Page effectively lends unrelenting, humorless intensity to her heavily mannered portrayal of Eve and turns her character into a hopelessly desperate victim as the story moves toward its conclusion. As Renata, Diane Keaton removes all traces of the lovable Annie Hall but unfortunately comes across as the most contrived, especially when her character cannot help but be patronizing to Frederick and Joey. Richard Jordan plays Frederick in broad strokes that make it difficult to empathize with his plight. Making lesser impressions are Sam Waterson as Michael, Kristin Griffith as Flyn and a surprisingly understated E.G. Marshall as Arthur. Just the original trailer is included as an extra on the 2000 DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>to me more than just a Bergman homage, it's deeply felt, and superbly acted, tragic theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been an easy observation &amp;/or criticism of Interiors, Woody Allen's first break from acting and comedy as a filmmaker, is an homage of the bleak, spellbinding films of despair of Ingmar Bergman's films. It's not without a point that critics note this; homages of Bergman have shown in many of his films (Love &amp; Death, Husbands &amp; Wives, Deconstructing Harry, etc). But one must not neglect that if Woody connects to Bergman, Bergman connects with the masters of naturalistic drama like Ibsen and Strindberg, and that as a writer Woody has been influenced by dozens and dozens of authors of literature and theater. With Interiors his script and direction is is observant, and is able to get under the skin of a viewer by giving the characters (under the upper-class veneer) attributes that aren't too oblique or cold. It is definitely not one of the Woody films I would recommend to someone first getting into his films- the comedies are best for that- but it is a great start to the sort of section of films that Woody does (there are two I consider- his entertaining, sophisticated comedies, which he often is the star of, being one, and the other being his dramas).One thing is hard to dispute, the cast that is assembled is all pro, who physically look the parts and emotionally sink into them as real people, not caricatures. Flyn, Joey, and Renata are daughters of a wealthy (would-be) lawyer (EG Marshall) and her perfectionist, needy, and mentally troubled homemaker Eve (Geraldine Page, perhaps her best). After their separation, Eve tries to make it on her own, still controlling, still clinging to the children who will stay around her (which is Joey), but has a breakdown and attempted suicide. Soon after this, Marshall's character finds love elsewhere (played by Maureen Stapleton, also a very good performance, a fascinating outsider in the midst of the family's reaching for real love and happiness). This brings even more turmoil on the sisters, who each deal with their own emotional/psychological problems with themselves and their significant others.It's hard to point out who's performances are the 'best' in the film, as each contribute something different and intense. Keaton is particularly interesting as a writer with a drunken writer husband, who can't seem to come to grips with herself amid the looming presence of her mother. Hurt's character is similar in this vein, but dealing with something a little more existential, I think. Most of the characters- curiously not Eva (who, for this reason, is a little more affecting and arresting in her quiet, disturbed qualities)- talk out what they are thinking or feeling, and because of this the audience gets clear ideas of who these people are and their struggles, but also leaves room for interpretation, for analysis. Even Stapleton's character is hard to judge or classify outright- she is the quasi-intruder, but she doesn't mean to be, she's just fallen for the Marshall's character. And, like the best of Bergman and other naturalistic theater greats, Woody gives long, striking, extremely well-written passages/monologues of dialog.Lest I forget to mention the incalculable contribution of Gordon Willis. Responsible for the cinematography of all of Woody's late 70's/early 80's films, he helps to bring out the intricate, detailed, and sometimes obvious angles and prolonged shots of the rooms of the houses and apartments, giving minimal or next-to-no light in the darker-themed scenes, and really giving a boost to the subject matter. Some may see this and almost take it for parody, and it could have been if the actors played it just a step wrong or if the writing wasn't as honest. But by the last shot of the film, the three sisters in profile and in complete mourning/contemplation, one senses Willis bringing out the full-on artist of Woody. It's a beautiful shot, a little self-aware, but engaging after a film that has done that just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I collect the action figures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it. What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a "more pronounced depth of meaning and truth". But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. The film is painfully slow and dull. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. Everyone is "lost" and "struggling", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise, let's just pretend this film never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive bleak and austere drama from Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immediately after he made his big breakthrough with the Oscar winning Annie Hall (1977), Woody Allen decided to make a film that was anything but a follow-up in the same vein. Instead he made Interiors, which was not only the first of his films that he didn't star in but it was also his first attempt at a drama. It wasn't just a drama though, it was a bleak, serious film with almost no humour to be found anywhere. Needless to say, it was a very divisive film on release but one which has achieved respect with the benefit of hindsight. It is essentially about a dysfunctional family. There are three grown daughters who have a wealthy father and emotionally disturbed mother. The father leaves his mentally unstable wife and it is the fall-out of this decision in which the film takes place. The separation is a catalyst for all manner of insecurities and jealousies rising to the surface.This is a pretty intimate family drama. There are only eight characters in the entire film, aside from the inner family there are two partners of the older daughters and an older woman called Pearl who the father wishes to marry. This is a family of intellectuals, who seem to be very self-absorbed and egotistical. It's only when the unpretentious Pearl comes into their orbit that we in the audience have a true identification figure. Even her clothing marks her out as different, wearing a red dress she contrasts with all the other characters in their drab coloured clothing. She is the only person with real life to her in this gathering and they don't like her for it, dismissing her as a 'vulgarian'. She is a good character and this movie as a whole showcases Allen's ability to write well-rounded female roles. The women drive the piece and all seem realistic, which is part due to the great acting from the entire cast. Admittedly there is some over-written dialogue in here, with some awkward lines that don't ring true but on the whole the writing is mostly good. Stylistically, it's very austere with no musical score to alleviate matters, while the pale colour scheme also emphasises the tone also. Much of the drama takes place in a house by a beach front so we have the roaring ocean waves crashing repeatedly on the shore under a heavy grey sky to add further ominous atmosphere to the dark psychological interactions. On the whole, this is a film that maybe takes a couple of viewings to appreciate and you definitely have to be in the right mood for it. But it's a bold and depressing film from Allen but one with many good things about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen at his most depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a very dysfunctional family and what happens when the parents divorce. Eve (Geraldine Page) and Arthur (EG Marshall) are a 60-something couple, recently separated. They have three adult daughters - Renata (Diane Keaton), Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) and Flyn (Kristin Griffith). Renata is a poet and is married to Frederick (Richard Jordan). Joey is (reluctantly) in advertising and is married to Mike (Sam Waterston). Joey is a film and TV actress. Eve is an incredibly negative woman and this has had a toxic effect on her children. This results in stifling, unsupportive relationships and joyless lives.Woody Allen at his most introspective and negative. A very well made film, with Allen demonstrating his prowess behind the camera to full effect. Some great camera angles, fixed angle shots and lingering shots. Great performances too from all concerned. However, for the first 90% of the movie there is hardly a cheerful moment (this is clearly not one of the "funny ones"). Negativity is piled upon negativity. This is largely led by the mother, Eve, who is one of the most irritating, depressing characters in all of cinema. Equally depressing is how this has rubbed off on her children.The pain of watching the first 90% does pay off in the end, as the final few scenes tie the movie together and provide the closure and relief. The contrast is stark, like a release valve being opened, and make the movie worth watching.It is really a matter of gritting your teeth and getting through the first 90%...</fullReview>

The film is a masterpiece and obviously was influenced and inspired by Bergman's films.

Woody Allen offered the role to Ingrid but she had to decline it because she was already committed to shoot Höstsonaten (Autumn Sonata) with Ingmar Bergman.There is no music in the film (with the exception of the two pieces played in the scene where everybody but Joey and Renata are dancing and the tacky Pearl breaks the vase).The best: Geraldine Page and Maureen Stapleton.The worst: Renata's weird and "fake" motherhood.

		<shortDescription>An excellent and very depressing depiction of a highly dysfunctional family defined by resentment and strained relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's first drama film, this is an excellent and very depressing depiction of a highly dysfunctional family defined by resentment and strained relationships. Coming as it did after his "early, funny ones" and "Annie Hall", this was a huge and risky departure for Allen, who stayed behind the camera for the first time on this occasion. However, it was an experiment that worked brilliantly. His script is extremely strong and often heart-wrenching, even though the characters are not always sympathetic, and he directed it with a great deal of sensitivity. The film has a very interesting look with its grey, pale blue and light green interior decoration, which emphasises the relative lack of warmth and vitality that exists in the family dynamic.The film stars Geraldine Page in an excellent performance as Eve, a once extremely successful interior decorator who has never recovered from a terrible breakdown some years earlier and is consequently severely depressed. In her work, she strives for a degree of perfectionism that has eluded her in her personal live and finds solace or at least distraction in continually redesigning rooms. The exact cause of her breakdown is never expressly stated but, in a sense, it does not particularly matter since the film is about her and her family's reaction to it than the event itself. Eve is separated from her husband of many years Arthur, played in a wonderful performance by E.G. Marshall, with whom she has three daughters named Renata, Joey and Flyn. She entertains the belief that they will eventually get back together and this is the only area of her personal life in which she finds any reason for hope. There is a fantastic scene in which he tells Eve that he wants a trial separation. Arthur is a lawyer and he delivers the clearly prepared and rehearsed speech with no passion or emotion whatsoever. It is nothing more than a very cold and clinical statement of the facts. He later admits that he never had any intention of resuming his marriage with Eve and this is perhaps the only trace of respect or regard that he displays for her throughout the entire film. However, it backfired badly as the realisation that it was never anything more than a false hope has a profoundly deleterious effect on her.Diane Keaton is wonderful as Renata, a critically acclaimed poet who feels as if she was and is neglected by her father at the expense of her sister Joey. As a result, she resents both Joey and Arthur and finds it difficult to even have a conversation with them without it turning into an argument. However, she is certainly justified in criticising Arthur for being more concerned about Joey's lack of direction in life than with Eve's condition only hours after she attempted to commit suicide. Renata's relationship with her husband Frederick, played very well by the underrated Richard Jordan, is also very tempestuous. He is a brooding, struggling writer who, as Renata points out, does not have any trouble living up to the drinking heavily stereotype. In contrast to his wife, Frederick's work has found little in the way of critical success and he feels that he will always live in her shadow. Mary Beth Hurt gives a great performance as the even more emotionally vulnerable Joey, who is trying desperately to find a purpose in life. She regularly leaves jobs if she does not find them fulfilling and longs to do something creative. She is extremely competitive when it comes to Renata and always finds herself wanting. Their very tense relationship is not helped by Joey's perception that Eve always favoured Renata over her since Renata was the talented one in the family.Kristin Griffith does not have a huge amount of screen time as the third sister Joey, an actress who is frequently seen in dreadful TV movies who fears that she will not have a career by the time that she hits 30, but is nevertheless very good in the role. Joey seems to be the best adjusted of the sisters as she does not appear to harbour any sort of lasting resentment towards any of the other members of her immediate family. Although Frederick initially dislikes her, he develops an attraction to her. While it started off as a little bit of flirting while Renata wasn't looking, his lust manifests itself in the form of attempted rape in the most disturbing and upsetting scene that I have yet come across in one of Allen's films. It is never subsequently mentioned and I took this as being representative of the fact that such cases often go unreported in real life. Sam Waterston is very strong as Joey's live-in boyfriend Michael, a political activist / documentary filmmaker who puts up with a great deal from Joey because he loves her. As Michael is about as normal as characters in this film get, it could have easily been a thankless role but Allen was careful to humanise him with respect to his poor relationship with Eve. Maureen Stapleton makes a fantastic impression as Pearl, a twice widowed woman whom Arthur met in Greece and wants to marry after only knowing her for a month. Joey disapproves of their relationship as she considers Pearl a "vulgarian" and knows that it will be incredibly upsetting to their mother. As it stands, Pearl seems uncultured compared to the other characters and clearly does not think about things too deeply. However, since she is far better adjusted than most of them, there is something to be said for that attitude. This is emphasised by the fact that she wears a bright red dress, which is a very effective contrast to the pale decor of most of the film's settings.Overall, this is a thought-provoking film which showed Allen's great versatility as a writer and an artist, which is not a word that I ever use lightly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen might be famous for some other movies, but this one is, for sure, something else. Quite unique possibly in his opus especially regarding the tempo and the atmosphere (dialogues not so much), it is much more reminiscent of Bergman's movies. Whenever you engage in such a complex subject such as relations between now grownup daughter and their emotionally inadequate mother, you are on a terrain where staying on the right course is a very subtle art. To me, Interiors primary call to mind Michael Haneke's remarkable Love. The ending of Interiors is perhaps one of the most amazing endings I have ever seen. Uncompromising, brave and precise. Casting is remarkable, to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody Allen's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Interiors years ago and the impression that it left me was one of a bleakly brilliant film. I managed to watch it again and found that my love of this film has not diminished at all.Woody Allen is an admirer of Ingmar Bergman and in Interiors it show. This is his homage to Bergman and a fine homage it is.Allen is better known for his comedies such as the excellent Annie Hall and What's New Pussycat. Interiors is a change of pace for him. Restrained, serious and at times quite dark, this is a film for people who want depth in their films.Three sister, all who have problems of their own are suddenly having to deal with their parents divorce. E.G. Marshall as Arthur, their father and Geraldine Page as their mother Eve, a cold repressed and mentally unstable woman.The sisters have to face the fact that not only are their parents divorce final but their father has met another woman Maureen Stapleton as the fun loving Pearl.The eldest daughter, Diane Keaton as Renata the middle daughter, Mary Beth Hurt as Joey and the youngest daughter, Kristin Griffith as Flyn all deal with it in their own ways. Renata is a successful writer married to a one hit writer, Sam Waterston as Mike.Joey is trying to find a creative outlet but she is not as talented as her older sister and Flyn is an actress in second rate TV shows and movies.Joey is the one who ends up having to care for her mentally ill mother and is filled with frustration and resentment. Flyn is rarely around and Renata is the one who has to cope with the backlash of all of it.Then things reach a crisis point when their father remarries a cheerful and likable woman who the daughters do not approve of and refer to her as a vulgarian.This is the perfect study of a family who despite being wealthy well educated people, are dysfunctional and in their various ways, selfish and at times rather petty. These people are not always likable, except for Pearl. But there are times when the viewer can feel sympathy for them.I don't understand why this film garnered so many negative reviews. I know that this is not the usual Woody Allen fare, but this film is intelligent and thoughtful. A quiet piece, beautifully shot and acted, it deserves a place in history as a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddest Woody Allen Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Woody Allen movies were compared to weather, most would be mostly sunny days with a few black clouds and a slight chance of rain. Interiors on the other hand would be like Portland (Oregon) in the middle of February; wet, dark, and utterly depressing.Like most Woody Allen movies, Interiors had some (mostly dark) humor, amazing dialogue, therapists, NYC scenery, deception, and unhappiness. However, there was something about the attitudes, the dialogue which made this movie stand out from the others of Allen's jacket that I have seen. While it always takes me a few minutes post movie to digest everything that just happened, never has a Woody Allen movie produced such a feeling of dismay as Interiors.Despite the obvious darkness, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what made this movie so much more depressing than the rest. The ending was by far the saddest scene I have witnessed (again, in Woody Allen movies), but we were already brought into a world of utter sadness.The movie features three sisters (although one sister plays a small role), two significant others, and a couple parents. The father, at the age of 60something seems to be going through a mid-life crises. After a lifetime of supporting his three daughters financially and his slowly losing her mind wife both financially and emotionally, he is ready to movie on. He breaks it to the family over a somber dinner in quite a monotone monologue. We're shown over the next hour or so, how much the mother relied on the father for almost everything.At the same time, we're shown the relationships of the two older sisters with their respective significant others. The older sister is a somewhat successful (and trust funded) poet, who appears loving and thoughtful. Her husband, a novelist, cannot stand the fact that she is more known than he and takes it out on her in all sorts of ways. He is a bit emotionally abusive and on a drunken evening attempts to rape the youngest sister. The middle sister is a nerdy artist on the inside, helpless middle aged woman on the outside. She is a relationship with a quiet, not too noticeable man.By the end of the film, there isn't much hope for any of the characters, except maybe for the father who has remarried a bit of an idiotic woman whom the family dislikes. After a crazy life, he just wants to see a pretty face in the mornings and not have to think about too much. This wasn't the best Woody Allen movie I've seen to date, but it is by far the most depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contains a master piece scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standing back from the time of the 70s as we all do now, Allen's 'Interiors' does appear to fill a void by an unexpected style of turning inwards upon American representation, a particularly European intellectual sense of reality and successfully inhabiting along side the usual forms of representation, a deep, alternative yet compatible contribution to the received images of America.The foreignness of the faux-style which was so criticised in it's day, it is fair to say, does resonate with the experience of loss and evocation which forms part of the language of the settled European immigrants who have made the landscape of New York, if not indeed the whole of America their own for generations.The piece, therefore, and it's European influence as well as it's 'weakness' of fauxness proves to be an utterly authentic representation of the Euro-descendant American condition. It is precisely through this authentic synthesis, the piece becomes elevated to something Great.Aside from the debate about the film's standing as a whole, It can be argued that the wedding dancing scene in the last third of the film is one of the greatest character portrayals of cinematic awkwardness ever produced. It is a mini but major triumph of agony, tragedy, and denouement and stands out as one of Allen's best from his Canon.I think this film will continue to receive the revisionism it needs in proportion to the degree to which it has been overlooked and in the end could well be judged as one of the greatest of Allen's films rather than the one that just got through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent departure for Allen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the roaring success (including an Academy Award for Best Picture) of Annie Hall, Woody Allen decided to take his career in a sharp turn, or rather a giant leap to a new field. After a decade of dealing in comedy for his first decade as a filmmaker, Allen presented the world with a new side of him by giving them Interiors. A lot of fans and critics of his met the film with a sharp tongue, seemingly offended by him not offering up another charming, easy-to-swallow comedy as they had come to expect. I, for one, am delighted that he challenged himself in such a way, and the result is anything but delightful. After the wonderful comedic work of Annie Hall, his Interiors is a delicately observed exploration of a trio of sisters who are impacted deeply by their mother.It's true that he takes a lot of inspiration from Ingmar Bergman in his style here, but it also has that unique touch that only Woody can give a film. He strips it of the enjoyable charm that most of his films contain, but you can still very much tell that this is a Woody Allen film. Allen made some very interesting choices in casting the film, combining regulars of his such as Diane Keaton with newcomers like Mary Beth Hurt and heavy dramatic hitters like E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page, but the end result is a fluid and fully realized portrait of this family. The family of intellectuals is fractured by their own fragile egos, a discord which is only further cemented when patriarch Arthur (Marshall) announces his plans to move out of the house to live alone for a while, separating from wife Eve (Page). The decision practically cripples Eve, who insists that she can't be left alone and as a result spends her time butting into the lives of her three daughters, played by Keaton, Hurt and Kristin Griffith.Allen, in a lean 90-minute running time, is able to give the audience his usual league of well-rounded and layered characters, all crafted to work out these themes of familial bonds and conflicts. Allen's ability to write strong, developed female characters has always impressed me and this is perhaps the finest display of his talent for it. These women are honest, aggressive and loaded with faults. He isn't afraid to show the bitter, angry and resentful side of women and he casts his films with actors who are able to properly display that facet of them without turning them into the one-note bitches that often litter mainstream cinema.Women are often written either as the sexy slut, the adorable girl-next-door, or the annoying bitch, but Allen is able to write them so true. It's long been a shame that females aren't given more opportunities in cinema, but at least there's some small consolation in a male writer like Woody Allen being able to present them so honestly. He's working at the top of his game here as a writer, made even more impressive by the fact that there isn't a drop of humor in the thing at all. He doesn't let you take a pause for a laugh every so often but instead brings you deeper and deeper into the melancholy of these broken lives. The cast is one of his finest ensembles, particularly when it comes to Page and Hurt.Page, as the incredibly overbearing Eve, is given a character who could have easily been unbearable (and was, for me, at first) but she brings this vulnerability to the role that I found heartbreaking. You can feel the influence of this character in every moment of the film, every tick and emotion that her daughters have, yet she herself is so fragile and alone. It's an absolutely devastating work that resonates deep. Hurt and Keaton play off each other so well, bringing out the faults of each character, the bitter sisterly resentments and attempts at loving that are distracted by their own egos. In a family of intellectuals, it takes the smallest word to break a heart, and this entire cast pulls off that atmosphere with remarkable skill. Interiors is surely one of Woody Allen's best films and such a strong departure for him as a filmmaker. I'm glad that he didn't let the backlash dissuade him from making more films like this in the future, I think this is an excellent display of his range and talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to Bergman, and a very strong drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not easy to compare Interiors to other Woody Allen films because it has so little in common with them, especially with his early work (other than Diane Keaton, obviously); which is why a lot of people refer to it as a 'bridge' between Annie Hall and Manhattan. If anything, it's more of a culmination of Allen's two preceding works - Love &amp; Death and Annie Hall; an intentionally comedic Ingmar Bergman homage with dark undertones, and an intentionally dark comedy with dramatic undertones and Ingmar Bergman references. Interiors is a direct Bergman homage without the slightest bit of a sense of humor, which is something that cannot be said of any other Allen film in the 70's, not even Manhattan. And other than that important placement in Allen's career - first straight drama, and of course first film without a starring role - it's a strong film by its own right.It's not a masterpiece, no. Just like some of the dramas Woody directed in the 00's - Cassandra's Dream or Vicky Cristina Barcelona - his influences are a bit too transparent in Interiors, and the film is not self-aware enough for that to be a good thing. That is to say, it feels more like Allen shadowing Bergman than Allen saying something original and personal while referencing Bergman. And yet, at its best moments, Interiors does feel personal and quite poignant. Even when the script turns needlessly brainy in a way that makes the dialog feel unrealistic, every scene is shot beautifully - more beautifully than any Allen film before, and in that way the bridge to Manhattan is important - and the acting is so fantastic that the dialog somehow works, most of all Geraldine Page in one of the last and best performances in her career.Interiors is essential to Allen fans, and not just for biographical context, though they may be disappointed by not finding any of his trademarks. And it's a good film on any measure, if you're looking for a strong, touching family drama that can really touch a nerve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen will always be known primarily as a stand-up comedian who went on to become the writer/director of some of the zaniest and most sophisticated comedies of American cinema, most notably Love and Death, Annie Hall and Manhattan. Yet, Interiors is nothing of the sort. Rather, it is a methodical, quiet and intense character study of a family that is not to unlike your own in more ways than one. The fact that there is no jokes or one-liners and yet is so captivating makes it all the more impressive.The film opens with a series of breathtaking shots of an empty home; sparse furniture, pale colors and outlines and a dark, crashing ocean just outside. Immediately, Allen makes it known he is going the Ingmar Bergman route here. He dives right into introducing all these characters: the three sisters, their parents and the two older sister's significant others. One of the great things about the film is how Allen makes all a player in this plot. There are no characters simply there for no rhyme or reason; each lends something to the overall story and atmosphere. This makes the acting all the more impressive. Every single actor gives their full gusto and it is amazing to watch people actually talk and talk as if they exist in this world we actually inhabit ourselves. There isn't one scene that feels phony or unreal. The standouts are Diane Keaton as the eldest, a successful poet who can't find the meaning and purpose in her own work, Geraldine Page as the mother who keeps up a positive and hopeful facade but truly lacks almost any kind of hope, and Maureen Stapleton as a lively, energetic and honest type who invades the family by way of the father and tries to fit in but can't seem to do so.I have already praised the film for being brilliant, but I feel its brilliance lies in Allen's ability not only to reinvent himself as a writer and director but also to tackle material that has been covered so many times before and still put a fresh spin on it. Despite the obvious comparisons to Bergman or Eugene O'Neill, this is still a Woody Allen movie. The dialogue has a natural and melodic rhythm, the acting is totally involving and hypnotic and the cinematography of legend Gordon Willis perfectly captures the interiors of the sisters, the parents and the family. A great exploration of serious interaction, one of Woody's very best and absolutely worth seeing multiple times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, if flawed, first drama from Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pleased to see so many positive comments here about Woody Allen's underrated first drama. A totally serious, almost theatrical examination of the meltdown of a rich, WASPy family might seem worlds away from anything Allen's earlier films prepared us for, but for the most part he's very up to the task, creating a gallery of disturbing and unforgettable moments and characters. Yes, it's derivative of Bergman, but it's also pretty damn good. Beautifully photographed by Gordon Willis, with amazing performances (Geraldine Page, Mary Beth Hurt, Maureen Stapleton in particular are brilliant, but everyone is good). The script does border on cliché at moments, and some specific dialogue is clunky, but there's something deeply moving and hard to shake in it's overall final effect. Under appreciated in its time, it's faults now seem very forgivable, and there's excitement in watching a great filmmaker stretch his talent in a new direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody gives us his first serious Swede 'n' low picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay then, I haven't actually seen any Bergman movies (to date) except The Seventh Seal so why does it feel like I just have? This movie, Woody Allen's first non-comedy directorial feature, would seem to be the very epitome of the word "Bergman-esque" as he shows us the lives of three sisters affected in varying ways by the separation of their parents and the way that brings them into strained contact with one another as they deal with the recent happiness of their father and the misery of their mother.It's hard to imagine how people took this movie when it was initially released as it is, obviously, quite a departure from all of Allen's previous work (even though nods to Bergman's work were already there). This is heavy stuff, there's not even any real incidental laughs here as the movie draws you into a situation that starts off quite badly and just gets bleaker and bleaker.The acting is all pretty good - Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt and Kristin Griffith are all fine as the sisters, Geraldine Page is excellent playing a character difficult to connect to but easy to see why she is acting in such a way, E.G. Marshall is as good as ever and the likes of Sam Waterston and Richard Jordan do well with their screen time.Everything here was done rather well but the whole thing left me cold, I thought it was a bit too bleak and watching it felt like I was just wasting my time as opposed to enjoying a piece of cinema or art or whatever I usually glean from a variety of movies.It's an interesting movie and a difficult one, something that feels like a cross between Robert Redford's work and Stanley Kubrick's. Perhaps that is the essence of Bergman's movies. Sadly, at this moment in time, I am not informed enough to know whether or not that's a valid comparison.See this if you like: Scenes From A Marriage, Stroszek, September.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interiors and Exteriors and the Real Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1978 was the year that Woody Allen was recognized as a important figure in cinema. He won the Oscar for "Annie Hall" which was a great film and became a name to be added along with the great film directors of all time. But he wanted to escape comedies and wanted to do a deep, complex and serious movie. And once again a movie about relationships. Most of all he had to make a homage to the one of the greatest influence in his career, the director Ingmar Bergman ("Wild Strawberries", "The Seventh Seal" and "Fanny and Alexander"). The result was "Interiors" a depressing, thoughtful and excellent movie about a troubled family.Allen presents us the sisters Joey (Mary Beth Hurt), Flyn (Kristin Griffith) and Renata (Diane Keaton). They are very different of each other but one thing almost unites both: the sudden end of their parents's marriage. Everything seems to fall apart when Arthur(E.G.Marshall) wants to divorce Eve (Geraldine Page) and get married with the lovely Pearl (Maureen Stapleton). Eve pretends everything's fine, even though her daughters thinks that Arthur shouldn't do that, because they know Eve is not OK, she's started to get depressive and doesn't seem to find a meaning to live. The story follows the lives of each characters (the daughters mostly). The sisters lives seems to only follow what's happening with their mother and father, they even forget, sometimes, that they are married with husbands concerned about what they're doing. The husbands are played by Sam Waterston (Joey's husband)and Richard Jordan (Renata's husband). Flyn is the prettiest, not married with anyone (although we've seen Renata's husband, Frederick flirting with her)."Interiors" is a patient study over the human condition. Here Allen reflects what people really are in their interiors and exteriors. Eve most of the time shows a image of happiness (exterior) but inside she's pure sadness, and the only who sees the real Eve is Arthur when they are discussing about why he's leaving her (scary and powerful scene). Everybody is quite sad in the movie, except for Pearl. She's a widower that finds happiness again along with Eve's husband and she always seems to be a displaced figure in this repressive and Grey scenery. Great examples of that is in scenes like the first dinner with Arthur's daughters and the tense marriage party (to the public is tense, because the daughters aren't liking Pearl's happy dance and then she accidentally breaks a jar, infuriating Joey and embarrassing everybody). We hide many things, our expression goes to one direction but our mind and heart may follow the other, many times we're fooling people but there are times that one of the sides wins and the consequences can be tragic. Allen also points his finger towards our dependence on others almost as a weakness. Eve needs Arthur who doesn't need her anymore and their daughters needs that they be together because that's what they know as family, everything was shattered and their lives are not the same anymore. Sometimes we put people on pedestal and we don't see that we have the power to choose things and to change things. The jealous between sisters are also present here (the most cliché part of the movie but it works).I must say that the first time I tried to watch "Interiors" I walked out after ten minutes finding a very boring movie. Last year I had the chance to see many Ingmar Bergman's films and realized many great things (his use of silence, his deep feelings and thoughts, the colors etc). On the same day I watched "Cries and Whisers" and "Wild Strawberries" I went to watch this and turn out to be an excellent film. Bergman's influence over this film is very remarkable. It's not for everyone I know but those who can watch will like it. All the actors are tremendous great, perfect in their roles. The most interesting performances are from Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton and Mary Beth Hurt. Those three made the film an incredible acting duel in which we have to find who's best. Page performance moves me so much, and it's such a shame she didn't won the Oscar for it; Stapleton gives a charming and sweet presence in "Interiors", and she's my favorite character in the movie; Mary Beth Hurt surprised me much. She wasn't a known name by the time but she really dominates as the artist daughter whose jealous towards her other sisters makes her a very sad person, who can't forget any facts about her childhood. All the actors were great (although I have a total dislike over Richard Jordan's character). Gordon Willis's cinematography is fascinating. He wasn't nominated for the Oscar for his work here but received an special award at this Oscar's year (unfortunately the Academy changed many rules this year and we the speeches of the special awards were cut from the show. Sad because people would know in how many films Gordon was the cinematography and many times he even wasn't nominated for his great work).Woody Allen shows with "Interiors" that he really can make good and hard dramas, and show his concerns about relationships, depression, religion views and many other life aspects. Wonderful! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of note to me is Woody's treatment of women in this film. We got a glimpse of it in Annie Hall, but, this being his first "serious" movie, there's a real dissection of the female persona. Woody is preoccupied with sex, but more so with feminine intellect. In this film he sets a template that would inform almost all of his future movies: the struggle between two basic prototypes: the demanding, sometimes callous, intellectual; and the warm, lighthearted philistine (who at times appears as the nascent intellect). Here they're broken into three types, as in "Hannah," but the basic struggle is between the two:Landau in "Crimes"; Pollack in "Husbands"; Woody in "Annie Hall"; Woody in "Manhattan"It can also be seen to represent Woody's struggle between comedy and tragedy, which I think he also grapples with. He made this film to prove that he could, which implies that there's a sense of guilt over making a pure comedy. This is exemplified in "Melinda," but to the point of caricature. It's more effective when dealing with his understanding of women, since that's the central driving force of his existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Woody Allen, in the style of Ingmar Bergman, "Interiors" catches Mr. Allen being far too imitative. And, the movie is devoid of humor, unless you count either the inwardly chuckling affirmation, or the derisive laughter you may feel when witnessing some of the more obvious Bergman techniques. The story involves the dissolution of a marriage, and the life it represents; and, how the change effects eight principal players. The performances are excellent.Although everyone plays their part well, two characters really stand out: Geraldine Page (as Eve) is frightening and neurotic as the matriarch being replaced by the earthy and vibrant Maureen Stapleton (as Pearl). In the end, these are the best pieces of Allen's puzzle. Of secondary concern are the lives of the divorcing couple's three relatively uninteresting daughters, played by Diane Keaton, Marybeth Hurt, and Kristin Griffith. Dramatic possibilities are missed by not having Ms. Page and Ms. Stapleton share some explosive, confrontational screen time.******* Interiors (1978) Woody Allen ~ Geraldine Page, Diane Keaton, Maureen Stapleton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoy viewing Woody Allen films, however, this film portrayed a mother and three daughters who were all frustrated in life because of the way their mother dominated them from Birth. The three daughters had no idea just what control their mother had over them and even their husbands and dictated when a vase was suppose to go here or there or a painting. E. G. Marshall went to work and acted very content with his wife and family life, but all of a sudden things seem to change and then the entire family goes into a very dark and dangerous depression. All the actors gave outstanding performances and there were plenty of Hollywood awards for this film, but this is definitely not one of my favorite Wood Allen Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself oddly drawn to this film. In a huge departure for Allen at the time, who had gone from slapstick to urban comedy, he makes an Ingmar Bergman film, and a fairly good one at that.The acting is first-rate, especially Paige. I disagree with the comments further down that felt she was sterile. I think she managed, in a role that was very rigid and minimalist, to give us a glimpse of a woman in absolute agony, trying to hold it together with iron control until she just can't do it anymore and snaps into a suicidal rage.The problem for me with "Interiors" is that the characterizations are so rigid that each role becomes a parody of itself. The monologues come across as something highly intelligent people might WRITE, but not what they would SAY, and the metaphors are dropped like lead. In the opening sequences, Eve (Geraldine Paige) talks about the 'slick surfaces,' and as the movie progresses, we discover that the family she created with her husband was wonderful on the surface...but was emotionally rotten at its core.It goes on and on like this. But as I said, this movie is, to me, a BRILLIANT film even though it ultimately fails. Check it out, it kind of grows on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interiors is not your typical Woody Allen movie. It is a look at family life virtually without comic relief. Allen's introspection is there, but it is stark and detached. There is an analytical, third-person feel to most of the dialogue in the film that makes it feel like Allen was uncomfortable with his subject-matter. As he meanders from one tenuously connected scene to another he loses focus and impact. Interiors winds up feeling like it had much potential that went unrealized because Allen was unwilling to dig deeper. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen's most disturbing character analysis to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his dramatic directorial debut, Woody Allen comes away quite nicely with this story of three sisters (Diane Keaton, Mary Beth Hurt and Kristen Griffith) whose lives take very different turns, due largely in part to the separation of their parents (E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page) and their mother's subsequent dependency on them, esp. after a harrowing suicide attempt. One would think that the breakup of the marriage would be the focal point of the movie and the problems of their daughters would form the subplots, but it is actually vice versa: Renata (Keaton) is a passionately intellectual woman who feels that she has never had the complete love and attention of her mother, Eve (Page) and father, Arthur (Marshall). Joey (Hurt) suffers from a problematic case of middle child syndrome. Coupled with the overwhelming task of being a pillar of support for her mother, she often throws moody signals of indifference towards her boyfriend, Mike (played by Sam Waterston). Flyn (Griffith) is a budding young actress whose cocaine habit she successfully hides from her family during her visit home. Her performance, along with Marshall's role as Arthur, were really the onty two underdeveloped leads. Had as much attention been paid to the cultivation of their characters as everyone else's, the movie would have been better rounded. An auteur like Allen should've known better, but he compensates for these small "flaws" with an interesting contrast by Maureen Stapleton as Pearl, Arthur's second wife. Immediately, the viewer can tell the difference between her and the rest of the characters. While Renata, Joey, Mike, etc.. wear plain colors such as puce, grey, and brown, Pearl wears a deep crimson dress (perhaps a throwback to Bette Davis' shocking moment in Jezebel?) to symbolize her vivacity and vigor. Her stint gives the movie a most appropriate shot of 'color', and the finale completes the film's theme of angst and disillusionment, bringing the viewer 'back to earth', so to speak. Overall, a brilliant, Bergmanesque effort from Allen that works, thanks to a first-rate cast and thought-provoking performances. "Interiors" Oscar nominations included Best Director, Best Actress (Page), and Best Supporting Actress (Stapleton).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's Salute to Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen has in many of his films made references to Ingmar Bergman. It was not until 1978's dark, haunting "Interiors" however that Woody pulled out all the stops. The film posters featured the Bergmanesque profiles of Diane Keaton and the other main players (whose names escape me). The textures were reminiscent of Bergman films such as "Cries and Whispers." Since I was sadly too young to see "Interiors" when it was released, I can only wonder if people might have been quick to call it a Bergman ripoff?Well, I dont know what people said of the film during its release, but I do know that it is far from a ripoff. "Interiors" was at once a salute to Bergman and his art, and proof that Woody Allen was far from a one-joke man. "Interiors" is more-than-ample evidence to naysayers that Woody Allen is a filmmaker of depth and range; i.e., a serious filmmaker."Interiors" is to be sure a bleak film. Self-obsessed, yes. Some would say that these chilly characters inspire little or no sympathy.This is however the very point of "Interiors." It is a story about isolation and despair; about people who dont see, or feel no desire to be a part of, an outside world. Geraldine Page, so brilliant in this film, tapes the outside world out.Yes, it is very hard to sympathize with these chilly characters; that is the point. Woody Allen has never made it his job to paint characters who are saints. He is always critical of the characters that populate his films.The film is also a great commentary on the society (&amp; times) in which we live. We are a self-obsessed, destructive people. "Interiors," like "Crimes and Misdemeanors," shows us just how close we all are in this society to walking off an edge from which there can be no return.We are also left asking ourselves the chilly, frightening question: Can we care that there is no return?Rent this film, if you want to see Woody do something other than comedy. It's disturbing; but most Art should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1977, Woody Allen was the "King of the World" (to quote James Cameron) following the massive success of the justly-famous, multiple-Oscar-winning ANNIE HALL. ANNIE HALL - unlike most Woody Allen films - was also a box-office hit across the country (despite his international reputation, most Allen films just don't "play" in the USA outside the coastal cities, but they are usually so inexpensive to produce that Allen easily makes back his costs nevertheless). Being in such a position, Allen could do anything he wanted as a follow-up, so he chose a project which was very dear to his heart and which wound up disappointing just about everyone and became something of a joke for a long time afterward - a phenomenon so widespread it was referenced by Allen himself in 1980's STARDUST MEMORIES when a character says to the "Allen" stand-in - "I liked your early, funny, movies! INTERIORS violated audience expectations because it is not a comedy and Allen isn't in it (thank God), both of which were "firsts" in Allen's long career. Believe me, there is nevertheless a lot of humour in INTERIORS - but it is of the unintentionally funny kind, as we will see later...The film in fact slipped through something of a crack in UA's production schedule - preoccupied at the time with Cimino's out-of-control epic HEAVEN'S GATE, the money men trusted Allen and allowed him to do as he wished, but the box-office failure of INTERIORS was in its day thought to be just another example of a self-indulgent director getting his comeuppance and the film became another nail in the financial coffin which destroyed the only remaining major independent studio in Hollywood. Thirty years later, INTERIORS has perhaps finally gained the public recognition it deserves as one of Allen's richest, most rewarding and beautiful films. Derivative of Ingmar Bergman it may be, but a disaster it is not. The plot is simple - one day at breakfast in the Hamptons, WASPy lawyer Arthur (EG Marshall), coolly informs his elegant-but-domineering wife, Eve (Geraldine Page), that he wishes to separate. Eve - a controlling and perfectionistic decorator (hence the title) - promptly suffers an emotional decline which her children feel helpless to stop and which eventually leads her to suicide after her ex-husband remarries. This soap-opera material is lifted above the banal by three things - fantastic performances all around, a complex and demanding non-linear cinematic structure, and stunning photography and production design. INTERIORS is a perfect example of Allen's ongoing fascination with the psychological terrorism, physical restraint, and emotional coldness which he (rightly) sees as basic features of WASP society. Although portrayed in the story as the cause of everyone's problems, Eve is in fact the most sympathetic character. Only two of her three daughters - Renata (Diane Keaton) and Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) play a major role in the story, and both of these younger women are partially responsible for their mother's death due to their own problems - Renata is a frigid, neurotic woman whose success as a poet and author bring her no happiness, and who constantly competes with her sister for the attention of their father, while Joey is a highly-strung, perpetually unsatisfied individual who envies the talents of her sisters despite her own successful marriage. Neither one of them can stand their mother or each another, and Joey goes so far as to tear Eve to shreds psychologically in a devastating monologue at the climax which at last pushes Eve over the edge, causing her to walk into the open ocean just outside the family's Long Island residence. Joey frantically tries to save her mother, only to nearly drown herself. She is brought back to life by Arthur's new wife, Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), whose knowledge of CPR proves critical. Pearl is a slightly trashy yenta whose lack of intellectual refinement and sensuality charm Arthur (and the rest of the male characters!) but repulse the uptight daughters. Despite this, Pearl without hesitation saves the life of a girl who publicly insulted her at her own wedding just hours earlier! Photographed superbly by Gordon Willis, the drowning sequence is one of the most perfect in 1970's film-making. On the negative side, it has to be said that Allen's dialogue is often both pretentious and unintentionally funny - nobody actually talks like these people (the title of this review is one of the movie's funniest lines - watch for it), and their claim to the status of "intellectuals" is undercut by a lot of needlessly arch and senseless statements which reveal that Allen himself is far from the "intellectual" he is generally thought to be. Also, no one seems to have had a happy moment in their lives despite their money, talent and expensive real estate. Renata treats her husband like a fashion accessory, while Joey is an unrelenting nag and complainer ("Why do you stay with me! I give you nothing but grief!" she says to her grad-student husband - and she's right!). Nevertheless, the superb performances and fine photography give this film an emotional power - even a grandeur - which make it unique among Woody Allen works. You may not "like" this film, but you MUST SEE IT nevertheless, as few American films have ever even attempted to do what INTERIORS does. For his guts in making a movie which he knew would probably be rejected by the masses at the height of his own popularity, Allen deserves a great deal of credit. Within certain limitations, this reviewer regards INTERIORS as Allen's most personal masterpiece - it is an unforgettable and compulsively watchable film despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like the title of the film "Interiors" is as much about the psychology of the characters as it is about the mother who decorated the inside of homes. Fantastic, scorching drama by Woody Allen, his best. The film centers around the lives of one family, they each have issues to work out and they interact with each other based on personalities that are in strong opposition to one another. As the film unravels it resembles something close to a Bergman film, dark, brooding and deeply subconscious. Allen definitely was influenced by Bergman while making this film.Allen, who is typically known as a comedic writer and director shatters the his own mold with this one and demonstrates his range and insight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen Loses Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will begin with saying that I am very passionate about Woody Allen's work and that I admire his highly individual films, impervious to the bullying standards of the American mainstream. Interiors is a part of the last batch of Woody Allen films that I'm taking care of not having yet seen. It's a complicated film to analyze. The high points are Gordon Willis's beautiful cinematography that gives the film the roots of its inherent emotion, and the cast is riveting and very much in tune, especially the haunting Geraldine Page, fascinating Diane Keaton whose presence never fails, the very convincingly unaware performance of Maureen Stapleton, Mary Beth Hurt who plays her character's angrily repressed realist with a tremendous personal correspondence that sparks her performance, and the becomingly frustrating Richard Jordan.However, the film is a mystery in an unfulfilling way. Allen, as many thought, especially himself, was influenced by Ingmar Bergman's work and felt great hero worship for him, and thus compelled to make a film entirely with Bergman's style in mind, he lost himself in what is innately an exercise. This doesn't mean that the story doesn't work and that the film does not reach the viewer, because it does. Interiors is simply a movie with a dramatic plot that seems to say something when it really doesn't. Like all Woody Allen films, and also like all by Ingmar Bergman, the characters are pawns in the filmmakers' occupations with human psychology, which is what makes their films so interesting and profound.Despite how well-made the film is, it only seems as if what Allen set out to was to imitate his idol. The reason other serious works of his are better, like Match Point, Sweet and Lowdown, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and Melinda and Melinda, is because he was saying something as his own unique voice. Here, he is basically dabbling in a voice that isn't entirely his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Lies in Ruins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the moment Woody Allen strays from his trademark quirky, nervous humor, people in the know and in the appreciation of his work tend to do a Linda Blair, throw their hands up in the air, and exclaim to the skies, "Why, God, Why???" before jumping off a Manhattan skyscraper and on their way down, slitting their throats in sheer devastation because the Master Allen had failed them. It seems rather shallow to pigeon-hole someone who after almost ten years of making wacky comedies (and winning an Oscar in the process a year earlier for ANNIE HALL, groundbreaking in every aspect) only wanted to tell the stories he wanted to -- it's the equivalent of the horror writer who gets lambasted when he attempts to write a straight-forward drama, or the dramatic actor who all but gets ruined in the process of effectively conveying comedy.But not to digress: INTERIORS is Woody Allen's finest drama which gets better with every subsequent viewing. It's hard not to appreciate the tragedy being played out within its characters nearly thirty years after its first release. It could, as a matter of fact, represent the essential family mechanics without the overwhelming violence that some families enact -- but still inflicting severe wounds of a deeper, mental and emotional nature, the type that years of therapy cannot erase. Three daughters come together to face the burden of their parents' separation (although unlike subsequent movies in which Allen would involve three sisters, i. e. HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, INTERIORS only focuses on two of the three daughters and the third, Flyn, gets an underdeveloped treatment).The aptly named Eve (Geraldine Page) is at the center of this separation. She is the mother who is silently going mad, if she has not been for a while now. It's rather disturbing to see the damage she's inflicted on Renata (Diane Keaton) who herself is involved in a very unsatisfying relationship with a man who cannot appreciate her work as a writer, but more so when we focus on how she treats Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) and imposes her will on her. Joey, the most hurt of the three, has to carry the brunt of this dysfunction, seeing her father's wife-to-be (Maureen Stapelton) who has a natural attitude towards life and could care less about the intellectual pretentiousness these people have.Where Allen really brings forth his forte as a director is right at the moment when everything festering below the surface comes to light, literally. Page's character appears for the first and only time dressed in black, already a ghost, to her daughter Joey who is still clinging onto some hope. As the entire household sleeps (seen in quick inserts), Page decides to walk into the ocean. Joey tries to go after her mother, possibly to save her, possibly to join her. Stapelton, the only one truly awake in the house, runs after Joey and into the water, breathing life into her lungs. It's a powerful, moving scene -- one of the most emotionally satisfying I've ever seen in a Woody Allen movie, since his pictures tend towards the intellectual, and it just shows that a director is much, much more than the sum of his apparent parts, Bergmanesque and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviews of this film typically include the word "Bergmanesque," and mine is now no exception. However, while the opening and closing scenes clearly are an homage to Bergman's style of staging, the remainder of the film is anything but derivative. The opening credits roll in silence, setting the tone for an extended opening (also silent) in which the editor takes us quickly through a vacant house; that it is vacant is indicative of the entire feel of the film. Diane Keaton presses her hand to the window glass and stares out at the open sea in dramatic, nay, melodramatic fashion in one stylized moment, but the movie is otherwise a genuine portrayal of real intrafamilial interactions. One can easily imagine the previous tiffs and blow-ups that form the backstory for the strained conversations we are shown. The character of the father's new love interest, the only one who is new to the family fray, is unabashedly simple in the midst of the sometimes forced intellectualism that characterizes the mother, her two oldest daughters, and their respective husbands. Not to say that she is unintelligent; it is not so much that she is missing something the others possess, but that she has something they do not, a willingness to appreciate simple or even low-brow pleasures. (Maureen Stapleton's performance is delightful. She provides us the funniest moments in the film, moments that are funny not by being ridiculous but by being so incisive a depiction of an archetype.) The father himself is intellectual only insofar as it would serve a white-collar professional; i.e., very little. The youngest daughter, a television actress (and a perfect metaphor at that) takes after her father in this respect. Yet it is clear that the two of them are perfectly intelligent people. The acting, without exception, is excellent and the dialogue, superb. Allen the director, for the first time in this vehicle, succeeds where his earlier films dared not tread; he shows restraint, nuance, and subtlety. We appreciate the sadness of these characters without once feeling whacked about the head by the legerdemain of a typical Hollywood tearjerker. Allen the writer is clearly an astute observer of human behavior and individual differences. He shows us hopelessness, and it is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Dark, So Sullen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Annie Hall, Love and Death, and Bananas, you think that Woody Allen is the funniest filmmaker of all time right? He also has a very dark side and it is shown in Interiors. I seen this movie the other day and I thought hey, it's Woddy Allen classic, time for some laughs. It turned out that I was almost crying like a baby. I bet everyone in 1978 thought the same thing too. It's all because of Geraldine Page. She did a fabulous job as the mentally disturbed mother Eve. Her appearance in that movie also sent a big chill down my back. She really looked like a pshycotic woman. Her hair tied up in a bun and all, it just kind of creeped me out. Diane Keaton with another amazing performance right after Annie Hall. Finally Maureen Stapelton as Pearl, great job. I gotta say that was f**ked up what the father did to Geraldine Page. Lying to her face like that, talking about it's an experimental separation. At the end, a teardrop came from my eye when Geraldine disappeared into the beach to kill herself. Plus she had that crazy look on her face too. Matter of fact, happy or sad, she had that look throughout the entire movie. It kind of scared me a little bit. If you can hear me up there Geraldine, awesome performance! I know Woddy Allen has done some dark movies in the past. I think this one is his darkest movie, dark but brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's very peaceful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was a brave move by Allen. The film has no music, is written around unsympathetic, self obsessed characters who don't talk like real people do (even intellectuals don't navel gaze like this) and the plot (such as it is) is stilted and almost non existent in places.Yet I liked it. First off, it's nearer what Allen has described as the 'real' him. All the comedy stuff is just there to mask difficult, unresolvable issues that thinking people struggle over and then can't resolve. Watching this film will not give you any answers folks, but if you like films that will challenge you and are by definition a 'thinking' person, you will empathise with people who are unhappy with their lot, don't know what to do, feel they have missed out etc etc.There's plenty of this here. People say it's gloomy, miserable, self indulgent. True, but surely that's what life's about most of the time isn't it? You want escapism, watch Vin Diesel in something. If you want a challenge, you could do worse than look here.I have to single out Geraldine Page for the acting honours, up against stiff competition. Subtleties are what differentiates great acting from the merely good - the 'very strong cologne' sequence, and the bit where she's lying in bed watching a God show on TV, help get across the island like, repressed nature of this character. She simply cannot express feelings, yet the despair and loneliness are there for all to see. They must manifest themselves somehow, and do, with tragic consequences.So folks, this is not a comedy. There are no laughs, though Maureen Stapleton is funny and adds a much needed fillip to proceedings mid way through. There's lots to carp about, but the pluses outweigh the minuses and I urge you to take a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I discovered this movie by accident in 1986 on cable television I recorded it onto tape and watch it occasionally. Today it was on the Sundance Channel and I watched it again. I've always loved it and not because I'm supposed to like it for any specific reason.I find it an excellent treatment of a family system where they are in constant unresolved conflict, they make awkward attempts to improve, but most of their pain is kept inside. The symbolism of the "interior" is used to show this more than the dialogue. I don't see that the characters actually talk to each other very often. Almost everything they feel is kept "inside". The audience sees the rare occasions the family gathers and speaks, but those are clearly exceptions in their lives.I understood and sympathized with the struggle of the children and children-in-laws to find a meaningful path, to try to feel accomplished, to even understand the point of having children. It does become a dramatic exercise in futility if your interior has been arranged for you and suffocated into non-existence. Contrary to the other reviews, to me it all resonates as realistic.I love the way Geraldine Page carries herself beautifully, arranges objects beautifully, arranges rooms beautifully, and yet allows her face to disintegrate into ugliness right before she loses it. As negatives, there are lines that Diane Keaton and Mary Beth Hurt delivers that make me cringe. I'm on the fence between whether it's poor delivery or poor writing. There are about 10 lines in the whole movie that sound like a play. Also, it isn't quite Bergman. But I hear Woody Allen shining through clearly in a number of lines, so that doesn't seem entirely negative.</fullReview>

I've even read that Woody himself had to compose himself watching Page in this movie, cause she really is devastating.

		<shortDescription>Suffocating Interiors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Interiors' is perhaps Woody Allen's darkest films. Even though his 'Match Point' is more recognized as such, 'Interiors' is a more subtle, intense and complex in comparison. The situations here are more recognizable than in 'Match Point'.Allen tones down the colour. The costumes, sets and locations are all of less colour that adds to the gloomy and depressive atmosphere. He uses a lot of silence. There is no background score. The cinematography gives a feel of claustrophobia into the suffocating lives of the characters.Allen is clearly influenced by Bergman and his intentions seem genuine. 'Interiors' is a very un-Woody Allen film. It doesn't have those quirky characters, relationships or situations that one would normally encounter in his films (such as, 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'). Nor does Allen make an appearance. However, he does use many of the familiar themes such as dysfunctional relationships, loneliness etc.Geraldine Page delivers a phenomenal performance as the mother and wife who's falling apart as a result of her divorce. Diane Keaton and Kristin Griffith are remarkable in their understated roles as two sisters struggling for affection and success.'Interiors' is Allen's quietest film and it very psychological in nature. Due to its disturbing content, it may not be an easy watch for everyone but it is a brilliantly crafter piece and one of Allen's best.</fullReview>

Instead, it's that one Woody Allen that almost never leaves the rental rack. Very Bergmanesque, it's a slow and quiet film. It's also devastating in its impact. Allen uses the less-is-more motif to its fullest extent; that which is not said carries more weight than that which is shouted. Mareen Stapleton's character seems at first an odd choice considering the somber tone of the film, but adds an incredible dose of life in the scene. It is a very simple film in some ways, but very effective. The trick is to think of it before you find yourself in front of the Woody Allen rack at the video shop; otherwise, you run the risk of breaking down and renting "What's Up, Tiger Lily?"</fullReview>

What I don't get is this: why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for "ripping off" Hitchcock in his suspense/horror films? In Robin Wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree with that.</fullReview>

No soundtrack except the dancing music she brings and the occasional loud, grinding sounds of duct tape being pulled off a roll, broken glass and crumpled paper. Mother Geraldine Page and two lost daughters Diane Keaton and Mary Beth Hurt just suck all the joy out of everybody, especially their spouses. Father EG Marshall breaks free and is skewered for it; trying to be a decent man but totally bled dry emotionally and sexually, Keaton's husband Richard Jordan sinks into liquor to feel something but only finds rage, foreshadowing what is going to happen to younger Hurt's husband Sam Waterston, who still carries some life but is rapidly losing it. A third daughter Kristin Griffith tries to escape to Hollywood, but the life is gone from her too and she can only get meaningless TV roles. Sounds like an awful way to spend your movie night, but the performances are so good and the script and direction so marvelous that if you like character in your characters you'll really wish it hadn't ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good drama from the usually comedic Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors is Woody Allen's first non-comedic feature and while that takes away a lot of what was associated with Allen so far, the film remains decidedly Allen-esquire, especially in terms of character, dialog and direction.One of the first things I noticed while watching Interiors is just how much more heavy the camera appeared to be in contrast with Allen's more comedic works. There are lots of still shots and a lot of space is given to each set up. However, there still remains a sort of rambling nature to the way that the scenes are composed and shot. Certainly, the dialog helps with that, as Allen's style of talking around subjects and not-listening, as well as banter, are all very present.What surprised me was how effective all of this was. Allen draws some very broken characters, puts them through life's hardships and watches them react. The story centers on a family, beginning after the two parents had divorced. The eldest child, a poetic prodigy lives a not-quite idyllic marriage; the second child, a lost wanderer has a wonderful companion to whom she doesn't commit, like much else in her life, but is yet stuck with primary care responsibility for her mother, the third child is mostly absent, off as an actress. The father is mostly absent as well, so the drama really focuses in on the icy-cold mother and her two eldest daughters.Allen draws the tension so well that it's palpable, even before the players appear and channels the angst and frustrations well, thanks to the actors, all performing their roles well. All in all, this is an effective tragic drama, but is certainly nothing like Allen's other known work. It's not a happy work, but works very well to its purpose of telling the story of a family falling apart. Or perhaps a family that needs to come back together in some way. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of the early funny ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscillating somewhere between the works of Woody Allen that are rubbished for their pretensions to being 'high art' and failing, and being admired, perhaps unduly, for successfully 'breaking the mold', so to speak, and coming up trumps in the non-comedic stakes, "Interiors" is, perhaps, Allen's most misunderstood film. It remains superior to the 'serious' films that followed it, ("Another Woman", "September"), while never being quite as good as "Annie Hall" or "The Purple Rose of Cairo", films which posited serious themes while being very funny at the same time.Maybe it came too soon in Allen's career: maybe the Oscars he won for "Annie Hall" went to his head, turning him briefly into his mentor, Ingmar Bergman. You don't have to have a PhD in detection to figure out the connections. This is Allen's "Cries and Whispers" and, naturally, he plays it fairly straight. I say 'fairly straight' because I am not convinced either by those who see the film solely as a work of unmitigated seriousness, (and therefore 'automatically' a masterpiece), and those dissenters who dismiss the film for its lack of humour and for Allen taking seriously those 'pretentions' he was famous for lampooning. For me the film falls between the two stools and quite successfully. Yes, it is serious; suicide and the emotional retardation of people who have failed to develop a life of their own are serious themes, but isn't there just a touch of self-parody here as well? When Arthur brings Pearl home to meet his daughters, isn't Allen introducing a character who, to all intents and purposes, would be a comic foil anywhere else? In "Interiors" Pearl's role is both 'Mother Courage' and Margaret Dumont. She's the breath of fresh air both the family and the film needs and she's the stop gap between the high-toned earnestness of many of the films which followed "Interiors" and the early funny ones.But has "Interiors" any lasting value? It doesn't qualify as 'light entertainment'; you don't go back to it for the gags but cold and pretentious as the film might appear to be it does have an intellectual rigor about it. The people may be shallow but Allen taps into their pain; their shallowness doesn't disqualify them from hurting. Allen may be brushed off as the clown who wants to play Hamlet but he's just as akin to Shylock, (a fellow Jew): 'If you cut us, do we not bleed?' Bleeding primarily at the centre of the film is Eve, the ice-maiden mother, deserted by her husband very late in their marriage. Eve's life has been lived in 'interiors', locked away in a world of her own making from the harsh realities of life, (as a lawyer we must assume Arthur visits the 'real' world from time to time), so when the exterior world of divorce and separation intrude Eve can no longer cope and she tries to kill herself.Her pain is tangibly real in Geraldine Page's great performance. Her face distorted like a Kabuki mask Eve at first appears as though incapable of feeling but as the film progresses we see just how deep her feelings go; (in one stunning sequence she 'trashes' a church, more in pain than in anger, at her husband's rejection, an act which she might have thought herself incapable of). But if Eve represents the 'interiors' of the title then it is Pearl who represents the film's 'exteriors': Pearl, the woman brought in to replace Eve; Pearl, the woman who wears red in a world of pale beige's; Pearl, who cracks jokes she doesn't even know she's cracking when discussing an intellectual play about the morality or otherwise of informing. And as Pearl the performance of Maureen Stapelton is quite the equal of Page's. These are two great performances by two great actresses at the height of their powers.So what is the lasting value of "Interiors" and where does it stand in the Allen canon? Well, certainly as an actor's piece it holds up to repeated viewings, (as well as Page and Stapelton, Diane Keaton and Mary Beth Hurt are also superb as the daughters who have inherited their mother's chill). But it is that chill which holds us back. We feel for Eve but we don't really want to get to know her. Finally, her tragedy and the film's is that everything is on the surface. Consequently, the film lacks the depths of, say, "Hannah and Her Sisters" or "Crimes and Misdemeanours". Even the characters in "Bullets over Broadway" feel more fully developed. Still, it won Allen Oscar nominations for Direction and Screenplay and was chosen as the year's best film from any source by the magazine Films and Filming, allowing its director to go even further down the road of aping Bergman, (and Fellini and Dostoyevsky et al), something he is still doing to this day.</fullReview>

Just one of Woody's best films ever, solidifying him back then as one of the greatest Directors/Filmmakers of our time.This one goes along with my other personal favorites of his: Deconstructing Harry, Bullets Over Broadway, Husbands and Wives, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Hannah and HerSisters, Manhattan, Annie Hall...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a melodramatic review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors is not a film that is going to save cinema, nor is it the essence of cinema. In fact it's not particularly cinematic. What it is, is an honest stab at a story that explores the intricacy and honesty of relationships, in a family that is falling apart largely because they were never really that together to begin with. I think the title of the film is apt, and Joey's monologue there in the dark speaking to her mother is the strongest scene in the film. Allen's work suffers somewhat from being too cerebral. Even characters who are cerebral don't come right out and say what they're thinking, but I'm a big believer in subtext. I admire this film in the sense that it is digging for something deeper, that it is more about the characters, and is not a plot centered film, but the actors lend strength and depth to an otherwise obvious script. There's not enough there in the writing and so there is a limit to how far the actors can take it. The photography is masterful from an aesthetic standpoint and I suppose it suits the subject matter, but here I have to get personal. I truly feel that Gordon Willis overdoes it with his cinematography. Everything is underexposed and there are times when I feel certain scenes would be strengthened by more straightforward photography. I feel that Willis' personal stamp that is obviously reminiscent of old masters like Rembrant is self-imposing. It's too much, and it's not right for every scene. No one questions whether Willis is technically sound or aesthetically masterful, sure he's an artist, but since we hold him in such high esteem let's be honest and say that his lighting is not always about the subject matter, it does not always seek to tell the story in the best manner possible or if it does it fails. Gordon Willis is great, but I feel this film would have benefited from employing a much more practical and humble dp. Overall the film is good, but not great. It's time to stop embellishing. Just because a film has integrity and sets out to accomplish something doesn't make it a great film. Just as lighting a scene beautifully and distinctly doesn't necessarily make it great cinematography. I'm for a film looking outright hideous if it's the best way to tell a story. As James Wong Howe once said, "We can try to get our own ideas in there, but we shouldn't try to get our personalities in the film." Howe's point being that everything and everyone is subservient to telling the story. Alone this film is a competent piece, but there is nothing so extraordinary about it as a whole. In the context of great films this film should not even receive as much as a whisper. Worth watching, but not nearly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Allen's Ten Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I would call "Interiors" the finest film of Woody Allen's career. After my personal favorites, "Annie Hall" and "The Purple Rose of Cairo", it becomes nealy impossible for me to rank Woody Allen films. How exactly do you say that one movie is more perfect than another? Even in this league of sky-high standards, "Interiors" certainly ranks near the top.The story is simple enough: In the twilight of his life, Arthur (EG Marshall) decides to seek independence from his domineering wife, Eve (Geraldine Page). Eve becomes unstable and suicidal, and the couple's three grown daughters-Renata (Diane Keaton), Joey (Marybeth Hurt), and Flynn (Kristin Griffith)-must deal with this radical life change in their own ways.Interiors, like Woody Allen's subsequent (and extraordinary) dramas, is not a plot driven film. Rather it is a movie in which we have a beautifully illustrated ensemble of characters whose rich complexity is veiled by a guise of stability and contentment. Allen then throws an intriguing, somewhat melodramatic trauma into their lives, and the rest of the movie is seeing how they react and evolve. As such, the effectiveness of each individual performance is crucial to the film, and thus the power of the film lay largely in its perfect cast.There is not a bad performance to be found in Interiors. In fact, there is not even a "good" performance: everyone here is pitch perfect, lending sympathy and empathy to characters who are not the most intrinsically likeable people. No one in Interiors is particularly pure; for every good point we see early on, there is a much darker, often selfish side to be revealed. And this is where the beauty of the film lies: these are not the cookie cutter "good guys" of your average American family drama. They are three dimensional, multi-layered human beings who are sympathetic for their flaws and weaknesses and naievete, not because they represent "who I'd like to be". Especially good here are Marybeth Hurt, Diane Keaton, and Geraldine Page. All of them are Oscar worthy here (especially Page, who is almost frighteningly good), but it's better that none of them were nominated; instead, for the rest of history, we can argue about how they were better than any of the nominated actresses anyway!Of course, the real "winner" in Interiors is Woody Allen. Say what you will about his personal decisions, as an artist he is simply impeccable. It's so great that MGM's wonderfuly "Woody Allen Collection" Box Sets are letting us reappraise his illustrious career. A lot of people have called Interiors "Bergmanesque", but like a previous reviewer, I feel that this is a bit insulting. Although I am not an especially big fan of Mr. Bergman (I appreciate his genius, but am personally not especially moved by his films), this is indisputably a Woody Allen Film, period. From his unique screen compositions to his long, uninterupted takes to his use of flashback/flashforward/confessionals, this has all the energy of a great Woody Allen Upper East Side comedy (Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah And Her Sisters, et al), only it is sent in a new direction. It marked an even greater watershed for Woody Allen than Annie Hall did, for it proved that he was as capable of great dramatic films as he was of extraordinarily entertaining and textured comedies. Subsequent efforts like September, Another Woman, and of course Crimes and Misdemeanors would prove this, but Interiors might just be the best of the lot (again...I can't decide!).Interiors has all the marks of a "boring" film: lack of music, heavy handed treatment of tragic subject matter, dark cinematography and a muted color palette, etc. So perhaps the greatest testament to its power is that the film is EXCITING. Not in a car chase/explosion sort of way, but rather in the sense that it is constantly engaging from beginning to end. It MIGHT not be perfect...but if it isn't, it sure comes close.My Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film With Outstanding Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors is a great film and superbly done. This movie centers on the actors and the story, it has no special affects, no extras, no background music except the reception after Arthur and Pearl are married. So the actors had to carry this movie and it was them that made this movie a huge success. And Woody Allen couldn't have asked for a better cast. Everyone of them was perfect in their roles. I am a huge fan of Richard Jordan and he gave a great performance as Frederick and the scenes with him and Diane Keaton are very well acted. You can feel the tension between them. And the story itself is timeless and there are probably a lot of families that can relate to something in this movie. And I for one am glad I have this movie because we have lost three talented actors that will always be remembered for their outstanding contribution to the acting world and they are Richard Jordan, E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page. May they never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's direction of this drama is remarkable. Allen establishes a tone and control over this material that never wavers. Geraldine Page gives an amazing performance in this film. She has several unforgettable moments. One involves a breakdown in a church, and another is a scene in her apartment. Allen's staging of these scenes is shocking. Maureen Stapleton has several great scenes, as does Diane Keaton, and E.G. Marshall. All of the actors in this film give impeccably detailed performances that never falter in their excellence.  Woody Allen received an Oscar nomination for best director for his work on this film and he deserved it, just a year before he directed the hilarious "Annie Hall", which swept the Academy Awards. "Interiors" is a truly remarkable film, that is one of Woody Allen's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's INTERIORS (1978) pre-dated and, in most understated ways, dealt with most of the issues that would later surface in THE BIG CHILL (1983). The latter film explained itself, which facilities comprehension (and success, usually) by American audiences, Allen's film never did this. In a true poetic manner, the viewer had to intrude and interpolate himself/herself into the film (not a literate story, as film is largely disclosed graphically) and therefore INTERIORS was not "entertaining" and commercially successful. Critics viewed the film as "Chekhovian" [there are allusions to "Three Sisters" and "The Seagull"] but it was not, as Mr Chekhov always presented hopeful and unrealistic exteriors for his characters which Mr Allen did not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interiors is a fragile, dry and masterful portrait of the anguish and pain that goes through a family. Although highly criticized, when looked at within itself, the movie is absolutely brilliant. Geraldine Page was so poised and precise in her role as Eve. How she didn't win an Oscar for the scene in which she uses her organizational skills to attempt suicide is a shock within itself. Diane Keaton gave a perfectly nuanced performance as Renata. The contrasting personalities of the characters is used to create some of the most perfectly staged scenes in any Woody Allen film. Maureen Stapleton gave the intended out-of-place feel to her character, Pearl. The title itself notes the different internal crises within each character. Subtle references into the inner pains that elaborate until the pain becomes searing to even the viewer. The cinematography is brilliant as Gordon Willis creates a cold, isolated New York, full of literature, criticism, bleak skies and icy cold days. The significance Eve places on perfection within each of her daughter's apartments is really her attempt at achieving happiness within her family. E.G. Marshall's performance as the maritally restrained Arthur was heartbreaking, he was so controlled by Eve, that his pain become nonexistent until he felt free of obligations. As these characters reflect onto themselves, they allow the pain to free itself. The several layers he places onto each character and plot merge to become a collaboration of time, place and emotion. The only weakness of the film is that it was made in 1978, an homage to Ingmar Bergman, that, made when Bergman was still working almost became an imitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen succeeds in his imitation of an Ingmar Bergman film with "Interiors."Imagine poor E.G. Marshall. Rarely seen in films, he shows up in this one as is the husband of a cold, selfish, Geraldine Page at her neurotic best. Remember the entire house in white? Remember her taping up the windows in her suicide attempt? Remember her knocking over the church candles, in a frenzy tirade, when she exclaims how humiliating it is that Marshall is leaving her. I can't fathom how he stayed with her as long as he did. Marshall goes to the exact opposite spectrum by next marrying live wire Maureen Stapleton.Stapleton shines as the fast-talking second wife who proudly claims that her last husband went from a massive coronary.Page's suicide scene was a definite take off when James Mason went down those waters in "A Star is Born."A memorable excursion down the path of opposites attract. ***'/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interiors is interesting and unusual...you must see it;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out, much comparison was made with Bergman's films; "Scenes from a Marriage", etc. The photography and tone of the film are consistent, moody, and true to life.Geraldine Page is excellent, as the estranged wife, whose husband, E.G. Marshall, has decided to leave after many years of marriage. Diane Keaton is also good, as Renate, and Mary Beth Hurt, who I loved in this movie (I did not like her in "The World According to Garp"; too predictable) she is so much better when given real roles.Maureen Stapleton portrays the new wife, as E.G. Marshall says:..." I'm 69 years old....for God sakes I want to have some fun"... Basically he wants to travel and enjoy his final years. His first wife, Fitzgerald has been deluding herself that their marriage will work; they will reconcile; apparently she has had nervous breakdowns before.Woody Allen was right on the mark, portraying alienation within families. There is not a lot of screaming and verbalization, just as in many dysfunctional families. Control and denial play active roles. The facade was ostensibly perpetuated by the Page character, who uses art, and controlled color themes throughout the entire movie. As Sam Waterston says..."I can't stand her beiges...everywhere"...; when Page brings Joey (Hurt) a vase for her NY apartment. The stark cold reality of their life is evident, as Joey says..."why do you even stay with me?"...and she gets yet another job in advertising..."thank God it's temporary"... I thought the character of Joey was the most developed; she is confused and angry, unhappy with work, and guilty about her mother's emotional disorder. Renate(Keaton) is the true talent, the writer; the third daughter, Flyn, is an actress in Hollywood (..."I know what I am"...she says, discounting her starlet career).The Stapleton character is also an integral part of the story, and there are some beautiful scenes on the beach, in monochrome, where her costume is the only touch of red. Quite good subconscious imagery.I sincerely wish Woody Allen would do more of these movies. This was a serious character study which shows his real talent. There are not many movies of this calibre, which can touch a person, and portray real and damaged people. While some of his later movies were enjoyable "Crimes and Misdemeanors", "Alice"; few had the resonance and sensitivity of this film. Watch it; you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often intriguing drama that just lacks something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, but it's always the comedy side of his oeuvre that gets more plaudits from me. Allen is simply better at comedy, and while his dramatic films are often good - he was made to do comedy, and that's what he does best. Interiors is definitely not a funny film, but Allen still manages to make it work courtesy of some good writing and a ensemble of great actors which give life to the characters in his bergmanesque view of a family torn apart by the parents' divorce. As you would expect from a film of this nature, it is the characters that make the film what it is, and through them; Allen is able to show a range of emotions that aptly portrays the characters feelings on the event that has torn them apart. We pick up the story in the aftermath of the father announcing that he is to take leave from the family. This has the hardest effect on the mother, who is still in love with the father and is afraid of being left alone, but also feeling the strain are the couple's three grown up daughters.The acting is great, and Allen's stalwart muse Diane Keaton stands out the most among them. There are times when you forget that she is an actress playing a part and her dark and brooding performance brilliantly offsets everything else she had done with Allen up to this point and shows that she is able to get her teeth into a part, as well as make the audience laugh; a la Annie Hall. Mary Beth Hurt and Kristin Griffith make up the trio of sisters, and both put in similarly heartfelt performances, which work well in the context of the movie. Woody Allen is a very talented writer, and he shows this by the way that he builds an infrastructure of emotions for the characters to exist in, and the way that they populate it works brilliantly. My only major gripe with the film is the fact that, intellectually, to me it appeared somewhat underdone. It almost seems like the film has some deeper meaning, but never shows it. This annoyed me because the fact that the film never shows it leads me to believe that it isn't actually there. Still, what we do have here is an intriguing and well-rounded drama that fans of Allen will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vey controlled movie doesn't have one wasted scene to it. Makes you wonder how the characters survived as long as they have with all the baggage and pain they're carrying around. Symbolism is everywhere: Especially when Pearl breathes life into Joey. She becomes the new, less severe mother here. The family will slowly be healed by her presence, if only because she's the only one in the story who isn't afraid to feel. My favorite visual moment is Page's Eve applying black duct tape to the white walls right before she turns on the gas for her suicide attempt. (she runs out of duct tape too and has to apply white gauze...) Interiors is a perfect title to call this piece. The apartments are all designed and put together with more care than the people in them. The movie opens right away with discomfort. Eve interrupting Mike and Joey to force her taste on a room she doesn't live in herself. Much has been said about the whiny nature of the dialogue, but it's the end result of years being under the thumb of a harsh judgemental woman, who is so tightly coiled, she can't even stand to see a lamp in the wrong place. Page gives a strong performance here of a mother and wife gradually losing the last thread of her sanity. The 2 writer characters in Jordan and Keaton are a very well drawn balance. Conflict and competition: the male feels threatened by the woman's success and succumbs to his own failed brutality. He wants praise for his work more than an actual great book. Even his wife's flattery makes him angry. Note: most of the characters never really say what they want to, except at the end, when Joey finally does, it's such a big epiphany, it changes everything forever... Keen and disturbing writing. With sentences so stark, you almost wish they had been tempered a little. But that would make this something different. Things have to be painful here so the characters can eventually overcome them. It takes a "vulgarian" to end the perverse cycle of malicious glee Eve began decades ago, while choosing taste and art over emotion. She's left scars on everyone in the family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody's first drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Woody Allen's first attempt to break into straight drama after a string of successful comedies, culminating in his Best Picture winning Annie Hall the previous year. Interiors is a good film, owing a lot to Bergman. But, like many of his subsequent dramas, it doesn't feel so much like Bergman as Bergman-lite. Compare Interiors with Bergman's contemporaneous film, Autumn Sonata, and Allen's film barely holds up. Still, there is a lot of power to be found in Interiors. The story concerns three adult women whose parents have split up. It was their father's decision, and their mother feels utterly rejected. At first, I felt like the characters with whom Allen wanted me to sympathize were the least sympathetic, not to mention the most whiny. I found myself sympathizing with the characters whom I thought Allen was showing us in the most negative light, such as Flyn, the daughter who was now a shallow Hollywood actress, and Pearl, the straightforward woman whom the father was going to marry. Thankfully, Allen steers away from judging these characters too harshly, if only at the very end of the film. Allen is very talented at creating moods, and the emotional ambiguity of the final moments worked very well. He would grow more talented at this type of film as he moved on in his career, but Interiors is a very good start. 8/10.</fullReview>

The 3 girls are finding it difficult to deal with there parents splitting up and they are also going through there own personal problems in there own relationships. There mother seems to take the "Out of the blue" divorce, extremely hard, but she's convinced that she will get back with the husband until he announces that he has found another woman. It's quite a heavy drama with some emotional scenes, but the acting was brilliant by all of the cast who made the movie very believable. It does seem a bit one toned and every character is depressed through most of the movie, so you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. Watchable!Round-Up: This really doesn't feel like a Woody Allen movie. In most of the movies that he has written, you can see a bit of his personality in the script, but this film really doesn't have any of his persona. There isn't any wit or any of his quirky lines all the way through the movie so it feels like there is someone else behind the camera. The really young Diane Keaton, impressed me with her deep performance, which reminded me lot of her amazing contribution to the Godfather franchise. Anyway, I personally found it a watchable movie which will touch many hearts, especially those who also have family issues.Budget: $10million Domestic Gross: $10.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a dysfunctional family, with 3 girls who are trying to hold it together during the break up of there parents. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filled with angst and written seriously, I had to put aside my anticipation that at some point a Woody Allen moment would move in. This is an homage to Bergman. The characters are serious in their presences. They are consumed by guilt as they watch their parents move on with their lives. When we see Geraldine Page, suffering, we know why things are as they are. The girls have tried to make their lives go and have run into the depth of despair. At times it seems so maudlin and I can muster no sympathy for their pathetic beings. Throw in the flamboyant Jean Stapleton who adds color to this dirge and by contrast everyone is lost. E. G. Marshall is to be complimented for getting out of this black hole. Still, there is some growth. This sort of set the stage for future "serious" movies, but it is drained of charm, as Allen would use these themes later in better movies. I personally believe had this not been made by Wood Allen, it would have been treated with much less respect by the critics as pretty ordinary and overly artsy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly watchable drama from Woody Allen. Control freak Geraldine Page is a wife and mother on the verge of complete psychosis after her husband leaves her. She insinuates herself into the lives of her daughters, especially underachiever MaryBeth Hurt and makes life unbearable for everyone around her. Things go from bad to worse when dad E.G. Marshall announces he's re-marrying. Things go from worse to REALLY worse when his new wife turns out to be Maureen Stapleton. Stapleton is as warm and open as Page is cold and uptight.It's full of some fairly obvious symbolism --- Page is an interior decorator so of course she wants things perfect and Stapleton wears a red dress so we know she's free-spirited. Still, INTERIORS is less infuriating than Allen's later dramas. It's a bit on the antiseptic side, but it's still very watchable. The acting is terrific, especially Page, who dominates the movie even though she's not on screen for long stretches at a time. Stapleton is fine and Hurt is great as one of those untalented people who longs to be an artist of some kind! Diane Keaton and Kristin Griffith play Hurt's sisters. Keaton has a dreadful scene with a psychiatrist in which she laments her talent. Sam Waterston and the great Richard Jordan are in it too. With brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's INTERIORS is like taking a forced high school field trip through a high-toned art museum. Everybody talks in hushed whispers and all the decor is designed to lull you into passivity. Everything on display is meant to be viewed with awed respect, because it is "art," no matter how ugly or silly or uninspired it might all seem. You feel the pressure to endure it all with smiling politeness because it is all so achingly good for you -- even though you are bored out of your little teenaged mind. The only real pleasure you feel is when an exhibit inadvertently reminds you of some pop culture reference, like a TV commercial or a MAD magazine satire. Indeed, the only part of this edifying experience you can really enjoy is when the solemn, self-important atmosphere is abruptly broken by an uncouth display of genuine emotion such as a little-too-loud laugh by some stranger who doesn't get just how edifying the experience is supposed to be.In the case of INTERIORS, that mood breaking blessing would be Maureen Stapleton who breezes into the film as "life" to let us know just how lifeless the rest of the undead characters have been. In a much more subtle fashion, Stapleton plays the Jerry Lewis character whose bumbling dashes the sanctimonious tone of some important event. Her character, Pearl, is a cliche, a refugee from a Neil Simon play invading Ingmar Bergmanland, but you are grateful she showed up, but resentful that Allen waited so long to let her in. But it is Bergman that Allen is desperately trying to embracing here, not Simon; though it may be Woody's little joke that a broadly draw comedy character ultimately elbows her way into such pomposity. Indeed, it has been argued that the entire film is a put on, that Allen's first "serious" film is really a straight-faced parody of Bergman. I doubt that; Allen takes his Bergman far too seriously to be mocking him. And that is the also the problem: Allen takes his Bergman far too seriously. Period.It seems mean-spirited to criticize a filmmaker for trying too hard to be perfect, but perfection is what is wrong with the film. It is perfect to the point of being cold, clinical and lifeless. And as such it is about characters who seek perfection to the point of distraction, to the point of not enjoying the blessings and talents that they do have, simply because they are not exactly what they expect them to be. None of the characters truly know what they do expect, they just know those expectations haven't been met. The family in question seems to be upper-middle class WASPS, though Pauline Kael in her review insisted they had to be Jewish. I don't think it matters: they could be Amish for all that religious or ethnic identity is important in their lives. Whatever the case, part of their drive for perfection seems to include purging themselves of any trait or characteristic that would clash with some vague notion of quiet good taste. In a way, INTERIORS is as much a tale of conformity and assimilation as Allen's ZELIG. But here the characters seek to hide their identities in intellectualism or gracious living. Things that should enhance their lives, dominate them.The irony is that the main characters, three sisters, incessantly whine about not achieving greatness -- as a poet, an actress, a scholar -- yet, it seems that doing so would violate their compulsion to blend into the decor. Their mother, played by Geraldine Page, is an interior designer who sees the world in shades of beige. The quiet good taste she insist upon in her home and her work results in rooms that have the impersonal, inoffensive emptiness of hotel rooms, doctor's waiting rooms and, yes, art museums. They are environments made to be looked at, perhaps walked through, but not lived in. As such, she encourages her daughters, as long as their success doesn't clash with the drapes. Curiously, INTERIORS doesn't remind me of any film directed by Ingmar Bergman. Rather, to me, it brings to mind THE SHOOTIST, Don Siegel's reverential hommage/eulogy to John Wayne. Both films were conceived as attempts to honor screen legends, but both come off as cold and mechanical; undeniably well constructed and sincere, but strangely forced and overly rehearsed. THE SHOOTIST tries so hard to honor Wayne, who was obviously near the end of his career and life, that the parade of costars and western archetypes begin to take on the appearance of speakers at a lifetime achievement ceremony. Likewise, the guest stars in Allen's film are Bergman regulars: despair, self-pity, pretentiousness and facile symbolism.You have to give Allen credit though for making a stunningly handsome film, with rich cinematography, precise editing and consistency of tone. Some individual scenes are striking; but they are still life studies. Likewise the cast is extraordinary, but in a theatrical way. Their dialogue is eloquent, but never realistic. The characters are like the film itself, intelligent, attractive and articulate, but standoffish and indifferent. The film's subtitle could be "Look, but don't touch." The irony of INTERIORS is that it is all exteriors; there seems to be no interior for you to get into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Allen's films often deal with heavy issues but in a comedic light. INTERIORS is a devastating portrait of a family in crisis. GERALDINE PAGE is the mother and she's magnificent as the troubled, perfectionist mother--but whether you connect with the story will depend on acceptance of this sort of grim material from Woody Allen, of all people.The film is well titled "Interiors" because much of the script gives internal monologues to various characters, most particularly DIANE KEATON as a writer with conflicted feelings about her mother and her illness and a disintegrating marriage to RICHARD JORDAN. Another daughter, MARY BETH HURT, is having trouble in her marriage to a man interested in politics (SAM WATERSTON). The father who wants to keep his distance from his wife and three daughters is E.G. MARHSALL, who plays his role with quiet dignity.The decision by writer Allen to keep the story devoid of any humor (or any one-liners at all) appears to me to be a serious flaw. His story is much too depressing and there's a downbeat quirkiness to all of the characters. Not being a particular fan of any of the actors (except for Miss Page), I may be too biased to give this a fair enough review--but I remain unimpressed by DIANE KEATON as either an actress or a screen personality. I found her the weakest link in the story.Summing up: You have to be in a certain mood to respond to this kind of dreariness. The doom and gloom factor was too much for me. The Ingmar Bergman crowd will undoubtedly love it as much as the Academy did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd and Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been following Allen's work for forty years now, and generally enjoy him. This was Allen stripped of his Shtick, his comic routines, his one liners. It is the same world that he always explores, upper middle class N.Y. professionals, usually Jewish.When I compare it to "Crimes and Misdemeanors" Interiors comes up empty. In C&amp;M the successful Doctor with the easy sociability that comes with professional and financial success is perfectly portrayed. There was profound wisdom, when getting away with murder challenged the Doctor's belief in God, in meaning itself. That, was the philosophical exploration that Allen was attempting in this film.The E.G. Marshall character was a stick figure, no intellect, no humor, no passion, no empathy....just another rich guy who was dumping his long time wife. Woody Allen will certainly be an important figure in cinema history of the late twentieth century, and as such he earned the right to experiment.But this screenplay would never have gotten a second reading by any studio based on it's merits. It was a waste of some pretty fine actors talents. As an example, when Marshall was giving the oath of marriage, reciting the words "until death do you part" surely that was worth at least a snicker, given it was the same oath he gave to the woman he was now divorcing.The thing about being an "auteur" is there is no one around who can say, "Woody, this thing needs some serious rewrites." And that's a damn shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 10 as a comedy, a 1 as serious drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have rated this film a 10 if it was a satire of self-obsessed neurotic upper middle class bores. Unfortuantely, it was supposed to be serious. If anyone thinks this is an American verison of Ingmar Bergman, check out Bergman. Bergman is always aware of the outside world, whether political or social. Persona isn't merely about an actress who loses her inability to speak and the relationship she has with the nurse who takes care of her. It is about class, and most of all, it is an anti-war film. The characters in Interiors are boring and have no relationship with anything outside of themselves. When I meet people like this in real life, I run in the opposite direction. However, as a satire of really selfish people, this movie works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an Ingmar Bergman fan this disgusts me. If Woody Allen wanted to put some dedication to him, fine but this man basically copies everything!!! Its like giving a famous sculptor a piece of stone and when he's done, he's copied Michaelangelo!!! What also disturbed me was that throughout the film he has no music and when the music plays at the party your ears literally screech in pain! I loved Annie Hall but basically I'm not a Woody Allen fan but I'm surprised this movie didn't throw his critical acclaim down the toilet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen's only decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A screening of Interiors was shown during a class at my film school. We were supposed to pay attention to the use of sound and music. There's actually no music soundtrack whatsoever. But it's great for adding to the drama. The acting is great and Gordon Willis's cinematography is amazing. I can't believe this is a Woody Allen film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete 180 for Woody Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some claim that "Interiors" is sensational proof that Woody Allen is as comfortable directing stark drama as he is intellectual comedies; others say it's nothing more than a cheap imitation of Ingmar Bergman, a film class exercise. I see the merit of both opinions. Ultimately, I think Allen is a more satisfying film maker when he at least injects some humour into his drama (a la "Crimes and Misdemeanors," "Husbands and Wives," "Hannah and Her Sisters"). Not one single moment of levity is to be found in "Interiors." This is as dark and morbidly suffocating as the darkest Bergman. Yet I can't deny that this film had a tremendous effect on me when I first saw it. Yes, at times it does seem to be aping Bergman almost to the point of parody, but it manages to have a blistering impact regardless.That impact is due in large part to the acting, and particularly to the devastating performance of Geraldine Page as the family matriarch, who is slowly unraveling under the weight of her family's airless dysfunction. Some may be turned off by Page's mannered performance, but I wasn't one of them. And all of the actors do just as well with their parts. It was refreshing to see Diane Keaton play a role so different from the ding bat character she played in "Annie Hall" and which has so defined her career. Maureen Stapleton probably suffers the most from Allen's at times heavy-handed treatment of the material. Her character is a walking symbol and Allen wastes no opportunity to make that painfully obvious. She doesn't have a very large role, so her part of the story isn't a huge detriment to the film, but it could have been handled much better.Overall though, "Interiors" is a very good movie and deserves to be seen not simply as an homage to Bergman, or as a noble effort from a beloved director, but on its own merits as a powerful family drama.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Interiors' is making the rounds on cable again so I've had the opportunity to see it once again. Even upon my first viewing back in 1986, I found certain elements of the film over simplistic. First is Maureen Stapleton's persona a LIFE FORCE. Yes, Ms. Stapleton is more than fine in her performance. She's so natural and nice, that you know that if you were stuck hanging around this rather creepy, morbid over intellectual family, you would be delighted to have her company. But to overstate this fact by having her dress in bright red dresses and then to emphatically state things like how she thinks E.G. Marshall's house is `so pale' and then bring out a tray of hot dog franks and meat balls, everything about the role positively screams `FUN, LIFE AFFIRMING! VIBRANT!'. Ok, ok?we get it. And to top it all off, SHE is the one who literally, LITERALLY breathes life back into Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) at the end. Oye. Couldn't Allen have given his audience the credit for being able to use their brains? The second thing I found is not really over simplistic but rather underwritten. It's the character of Flynn played by Kristin Griffith. To say her role is underwritten is an understatement. It's hard to determine exactly why her character is even in the movie to begin with. She's not on screen much at all and her character really doesn't do much in terms of establishing anything related to how the family dynamic works (or doesn't work, actually) as the other two sisters, Joey and Renata, do. And worst of all is the incomprehensible scene near the end where she's nearly raped by Frederick. The whole scene is out of place. Is this the reason why her character was created? It's not a titillating scene or anything but it doesn't make much sense except to make the character of Frederick appear even more reprehensible than he already is.Despite these two flaws, overall, `Interiors' is a fine film. It's not great but there are moments that have emotional power. It doesn't really ever draw the viewer in enough for us to feel enough sympathy for most of the characters. And though this chilliness is most likely intended, it's not necessary. I don't think Allen's film would've suffered even the slightest if just one scene of comfort and `semi' joy was seen. The closest we get is some tenderness between Hurt's Joey and Waterston's Mike in bed after she's told him she's pregnant. There's a scene between Renata and Frederick after she's had a moment that can best be described as realization of her body and soul that I feel should've been played with more tenderness. Instead the characters are forced apart by their dialogue and their supposed disdain for each other that is driving their marriage apart.The two elements that hold the film together are the performances of Mary Beth Hurt and, most especially, Geraldine Page.First Ms. Hurt. You could feel how pitiful she was. But more importantly, you could see how pitiful SHE thought she was. This is a person who is all too aware of their faults and failings but feels helpless to change them. As a character, Joey can be infuriating but I think most people have known someone like her: the over intellectualized person who is brainy but incapable of making any choices at all for fear of making the `wrong' choice. Ms. Hurt is very fine here because she doesn't try and make Joey easier to take. There's no softening of the character and in the end, despite it all, you feel sympathy for her. She's trapped and all too aware of it.Secondly, there is Ms. Page. Possibly her performance is the sole reason to even see this film. Her portrayal of the deeply troubled matron of the family is staggering. Like Ms. Hurt's Joey, you might feel some contempt for her but in the end, she has your sympathies. This is a woman who through her troubled actions has kept her family in a state of turmoil for years. There is nothing more heartbreaking than realizing that someone you love is also the reason (or at least part of the reason) why you are so miserable. Ms. Pages and the film's finest moment comes in the pivotal scene where her husband, Arthur (E.G. Marshall, adequate and capable in another underwritten role) goes to a church with her and there, tells her of his desire to finalize their divorce. Ms. Page slowly allows Eve's reaction to simmer and eventually boil up to the surface. You can see her trying her best to control and conceal her emotions. As she sits in pew and he's trying to gently explain the situation, Eve's eyes dart all over the place. It's in the eyes where Ms. Page's performance lies. Her eyes look dead but it's there where you can see everything she's feeling: the hope when Arthur sends a dozen white roses on her birthday, the despair when he visits her and he gives her only a small kiss on her forehead or the torment in that church scene. The scene in the church is so well played that I wished Allen hadn't cut it off when he did. It would have been interesting to see how the whole scene played out. But, this being a `tasteful' film, Allen ends it too soon.`Interiors' is far from perfect but it is memorable and does have moments of real power and emotion underneath all the more shallow trappings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a series of great comedies Woody gives drama a try. Some of the expressed ideas (especially the thoughts about death) have already appeared in his comedies before. The film is talky and the idea that actors have other ways to express feelings doesn't seem to come to Woody's mind. I have hardly seen a bore like this one before. Even the weak "Celebrity" is more appealing for me.</fullReview>
