		<shortDescription>Take the "Day Off"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before all the slapstick, before re-writing "Home Alone" umpteen times and before selling his soul to "Disney Pictures Inc.", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst. He wrote eloquently of it in "Sixteen Candles", "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty in Pink". And with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris' own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the "trouser-snake". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s teendom at its best? Seize this "Day"!Ten stars for "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just one of the best comedies of all time, but one of the best movies PERIOD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends knowing that I'm a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time, when it came down to number one, there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of: Ferris Bueller's Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you've pulled a Ferris Beuller's day off too, it's like a law here, lol, if you haven't, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it's outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be: Ferris Bueller.Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I'm not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris's life than her own and just wants to prove that he's faking it.Even though, you have to admit that it's a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is "dying" and no one notices that he's singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting "snootie" with a waiter at Chicago's finest restaurant, and catching the Cub's home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn't make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don't know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because "?life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it"; my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a classic of the 80s, but of any decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick looked so brilliant in those days. While this film single handedly made him Ferris Bueller forever, at least this is a film that can be seen all throughout the years without dating too badly. Sure, the music and props will signify a time of discontent and bad hairdos, but the idealistic look of a man simply wanting to ditch school has never been made more daringly and charmingly. Everything about this film was gold, from the postmodern "conversations" with the audience to the little back stories which seem to shape the overall canvas of the film. While Alan Ruck was way too old to play in this movie, at least he proved to be a great opposite to the cool and nonchalant Ferris. Gross-out comedies may now be the norm, at least we can look back to this film and enjoy a good, genuine laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much.1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him!2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good.3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8. The most memorable scene was "Twist and Shout" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching.9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own!Overall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is only fitting that I dedicate my first movie review to my favorite movie, Ferris Beuler's Day Off.This movie got me through High School.. and much of my adult life as well. That is, until Office Space came along, but that is another review.Ferris Beuller (Matthew Broderick) was the kid in High School who never got caught, had fun doing whatever it was and was popular with everybody. On this particular day in the movie, Ferris decides he is taking the day off. After all, "How can anyone be expected to handle school on a day like this?" Ferris calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (a young Alan Ruck), who is always sick, and tells him to pick him up. After all, Ferris does not have a car. He wants to show Cameron a good time before High School is all over and wants him to have something good to remember about it. Also, Cameron is Ferris's phony caller voice. Whenever Ferris needs a call made, such as from a police officer or another parent, Cameron is the man.Eventually, Ferris and Cameron gets Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) excused, by using the dead grandmother excuse. Ferris is always one step ahead of his adversary, Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). Rooney is portrayed as a hard ass principal who does not let anything get by him. He sets off to catch Beuller in the act and put a permanent mark in his record and hold him back another year, so as not to have other Ferris Beuller wannabes for years after Ferris's departure. Jones was perfect for his role as Rooney and I do not think that role will ever be surpassed for him.Most of the movie is spent with Rooney looking for Ferris and, as mentioned earlier, is about one or two steps behind him. He comes very close to catching him but never gets the job done. Rooney is the stooge in the movie that every teen and even the adults enjoy seeing him beaten and outsmarted by his young student. I don't think anyone has expected otherwise.All throughout the movie, it pokes fun at the boring and tedious high school classroom. Ferris will say something like, "If we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym class" and then it cuts to an exaggerated look at a gym class, which more resembles a boot camp. Ben Stein will forever be remembered here as the extremely boring economics teacher.There are many more characters to this movie that make it great. There is Grace (Rooney's secretary), Jeanie and the rest of Ferris's family, the parking garage guys, the snooty waiter, Charlie Sheen and others. My friends and I still quote randomly from the movie in our everyday situations. That is how much of an impact this movie has made on many lives.There are so many great parts and quotes from this movie, they are too numerous to list in a review, nor would I want to ruin it for anybody who has not seen it, although I can not fathom why you haven't. If not, it is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart A*s v. The Establishment -- Ferris Bueller Rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller was either loved or hated by his peers for always getting away with anything he'd do. Some would want him expelled, others want him for Class President. On this extremely eventful day, the audience is invited to follow Ferris, his best pal and his girlfriend from morning to afternoon (when they all should have been in school), enjoying a holiday declared by the resourceful Ferris Bueller.They get to speed on the freeway in a Ferrari, sing "Danke Schoen" on an Octoberfest Float, eat at the most exclusive restaurant in town and always keep just one step ahead of a furious principal in hot pursuit. With fake computer grade and attendance records, Ferris has it made.The scene where the principal hitches a ride on a school bus after having been "torn up" by Doberman watch dogs is worth the ticket price (Oh Yeah!). This is one of the funniest "high school prankster movies" ever! Has it been 20 years already? This is a definite Cult Classic! Right up there with Animal House and Caddy Shack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broderick banked off that boyish charm that made him so popular on the Broadway stage (Brighton Beach Memoirs) and brought it to this witty laugh ride about a high schooler who one day, just didn't want to go to school and puts himself and his friends in constant mayhem and jeopardy. Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them. It's a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let school get in the way of your education....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes does a tremendous job of portraying school as an oppressive prison in which children are forced into the most unnatural setting to memorize useless facts to "get their grade." _The Breakfast Club_ is another example of this, but FBDO does it tremendously well. The setting portrayed at the school of the bored students listening to a nasal monotone lecture, while intended to be a caricature of the nature of classroom lessons and children's reactions, was pretty much on target.Ferris Bueller takes the day off and what does he do? Certainly not what Rooney assumed smart teenagers will do. He didn't use this time to damage some bedsprings with his girlfriend, or play video games. No, he viewed fabulous pieces of art, ate at a very classy restaurant, participated in a parade, and taught his friends a few lessons in some interesting ways.As a believer in education as an organic experience, this movie is a real eye opener to anyone wishing to educate their children outside of the public school venue. It's funny, and shows just how worthy time "living your life before it passes by" can be.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have an ongoing discussion with my friends and family about what movie defines your generation, and for me, this is it! Ferris' commentary throughout the movie is hilarious and irreverent, giving a voice to those on the borderline between Generations X and Y. It's Office Space, the teenage years! This movie is witty and fast-paced, not relying on the bathroom humor and physical comedy that most teenage and college comedies do these days. Yes it is dated, but that's part of what makes it great. I love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, horrible movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate this movie. Ferris is a whiny spoiled little ass who believes himself worthy of having a day off from school, stealing his best buddy's dad's Ferrari and becoming the grand marshal of a parade. All of this might have been forgiven if Ferris were in the least bit likable , but he's not. He is a bullying, snobbish, jerk who uses his parents, hacks on to a computer , destroys Cameron(his buddy)'s dad Ferrari, and escapes with no punishment. Everybody, save the unfortunate principal and his sister loves Ferris and thinks he's a great guy. Sorry, but if I had to choose a friend I would choose his buddy, the likable and put upon Cameron, rather than the egotistical jackass that is Ferris. It has good music though which is the only reason it rises above a "1" for me.</fullReview>

Ferris intending to make one last skip day out before graduation, Ferris calls in sick, "borrows" his friend Cameron's (Alan Ruck) father's Ferrari, and goes on a one day adventure through the streets of Chicago with his pals. Ferris' is followed by his high school principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), determined to catch Bueller in the act of cutting class, but finds it is more trouble than he bargained for. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the best comedies ever, John Hughes is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even as a child when I saw this movie, I never liked Ferris, I thought the character was a creep and that something was wrong with him. It always baffled me why the character was painted in a heroic light. I understand that people love this movie and I don't want to take that away from anyone, you love the sh*t out of this movie, also I see plainly that I am in the minority, in regards to audience reaction to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Recently, some one has published an article arguing that from a clinical observation, the actions of the character Ferris, would in real life be those of a psychopath.I feel a lot of validation from reading this article ( apologies to the article's author, I didn't bother to learn your name ) because it explains to me the impression of Ferris Bueller I had as a kid. Filling his hours with meaningless deceptions, manipulating everyone he comes in contact with, always seeking to be the desperate center of attention. F*cking monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilt brats laugh at the working man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that the main story here, involving the kids, contains many iconic scenes.The problem is the sub-plot about the misadventures of the school's principle (Mr Rooney) which seems to come from a different and inferior film. Its lazy slapstick brings to mind the worst parts of Police Academy or Home Alone.But the problem is deeper than that. It is philosophical.For here we have 3 affluent kids who have pampered lifestyles (particularly the insufferable Ferris), and our sympathies are supposed to lie with them. Meanwhile the butt of the joke is someone who actually has to work for a living.The cruelty with which he is subjected to humiliation while the kids swan around at others' expense is actually quite sickening. It is like seeing aristocrats gorging themselves and then being invited to laugh at their servants.It is no good saying that he is an authority figure. That would only work if the kids were of a lower standing in society as he is. If they were Chaplinesque hobos who needed to kick a cop up the behind or they were acting out of necessity, you could understand it. But they are entirely selfish.Ferris Bueller is an impossibly perfect youth, good looking, pampered by his parents, with a beautiful girlfriend and an assortment of gadgets which would have cost his adversary, principle Rooney, a year's wages back in the mid 80s. We are constantly told how popular he is in school. Why? I imagine a real life Bueller would annoy the hell out of most people.His friend Cameron has access to at least two cars, one of which is a fabulous Ferrari which his father keeps in a large garage overlooking a specular wooded area.And we are supposed to care that these, and Bueller's girl, go on a joyride? Rather like in the old Road Runner cartoons, which suppose our sympathies should lie with a one-dimensional annoying character rather than the harassed workaholic, I guess many people were hoping that Bueller would get his comeuppance in the end. Alas no such luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Icon Of Self Annihilation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Hey, I own some of Hughes' films but not this one. Sorry to be a party pooper but did everyone catch this is his ninth day of partying? Yes, everyone needs an existential vacation from the straight jacket society puts around you but being expelled is not funny. Though not a parent, I did not find his Machiavellian mockery and humiliation of those dolts who work all day to support his little behind funny. If I felt this way, a philosopher, I wonder how the movie struck all the parents watching working two or three jobs to keep the little creep decked out in what looks like long johns with some kind of vest, 80's fashion, it did not age well. Is the movie funny, yes, if you like authority figures who are trying to save the little idiot from being homeless being mocked and ridiculed: this is the movie for you. The scene that contains the essence of the movie's total amorality is where Cameron destroys his father's classic Ferrari because he has been ignoring the little darling. We see the looks of admiration from Ferris and his girlfriend. Forgive an old stick in the mud, is it right to destroy a half million dollars of personal property of your dad's to get his attention? The image contains all you need to know about the movie. It is an exact reflection of the narcissistic Yuppie 80's. Can you tell what the God of this decade was? ME: themselves.All through the movie, the principal, the parents, the waiter, and even the school nurse are being held up as figures of contempt. Often, Ferris looks out at through the camera and gives a lecture the point being what a useless, pain in the butt his poor life is and how school is pointless. Yes, in 1986, this was so cool; it has not aged well. The streets are full of people who had this kind of chic rebel without a clue pose. My favorite scene is the art museum, guess why your author and Ferris cannot appreciate art? We never had an art education. See, the hilarious irony? He rebels against what is needed to make sense out of the universe. When you look down at people from a tall building, guess what makes sense of what you are seeing? Geometry. Education is what makes you function within society; forgive me, friends, but glorifying dropping out and laughing at the necessary tools you need to live I find a trifle disturbing. Later, the movie bends reality to the breaking point with Ferris mounting a float like no security exists around a parade and torturing us with Wayne Newton's instrument of auditory pain: Dorky Shame. That author above me is correct; his smile is a giant middle finger to all of us. All these people trying to save the idiot from being out in the street and dying a slow, painful death is what this Icon of self destruction seems to have missed. Yes, lots of high school is boring but the attendance is intended to prepare you for work out in the world. Guess what employers do to Ferris Buellers who work for them but are not there? They don't come to your house and beg you to come back to work: they fire you! What you think of my review is less concern to me than whether you want to show this little narcissist's diatribe on how to be a homeless wino to your kids. Ferris' dream is so vapid: humiliating a snobby waiter, mocking art he is too stupid to understand, staring out at people from a roof. Even the Cub's game he is oblivious to. I have always, for thirty years, found this work of Hughes to be utterly bizarre. Think I'm crazy? Try Ferris' ideas out at work, see how that goes. Believe it or not, we do not have the right to destroy others property because they have been ignoring us. Sorry, this is one awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely, Ingeniously Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me say that this movie is genuinely, ingeniously funny, the watch-it-twelve-times-and-it-never-gets-old kind of movie. I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23-year-old Matthew Broderick as 17-year-old Ferris Bueller, a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane (who he gets out of school extremely cleverly, and quite hilariously i might add!). It doesn't take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris's skipping, so he tries as hard as he can to catch him, but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron's struggles with his parents and life itself, and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn't been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes, such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade, in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the parade-goers dance to "Danke Schoen" by Wayne Newton and "TWIST AND SHOUT" of course, by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller, his revenge-seeking sister who can't seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything, and Grace, the absent-minded and honest-to-a-fault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you'll have to watch the movie (you won't regret it!). "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." -ferris bueller I give this movie 2 thumbs up, if only i had more hands i could give it a higher rating....</fullReview>

I saw it a long time ago on television but couldn't remember much about it.I put it on to watch with a friend recently but we had to switch it off pretty quickly. It didn't seem to work at all but maybe we weren't in the mood for it. To us it was pretty ridiculous and plainly terrible.I hope I have not shocked the fans but I would like to know what was so good or endearing about the film. It seemed badly dated and the parts where Broderick talks to the viewer didn't help it.I will try and update it later if I ever get to see it again. I could revise my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry folks but got to go against the norm here. I pretty much hated this. I watched it in the 80's &amp; couldn't remember much about it other than I liked it. Watching it again, heaven knows how. The worst thing I found was that it had dated badly. The first Home Alone say, retains far more features which keep it relevant &amp; able to stand the test of time than this.My main comment is identical to the correspondent below. I too spent the entire film just hoping against hope that Ferris did get his come uppence &amp; that I'd forgotten it. But sadly he didn't &amp; the ending was poor. I never saw the Rooney teacher as the 'baddie' nor found anything that happened to him remotely amusing. Infact I struggled to see where any of the laughs in the film as a whole were. Also, I found Ferris' dad an absolute drip &amp; irritating. Nor was anything they actually did in the day off even slightly exciting. Had I had a choice of a going to a museum, watching baseball or walking alongside a float I'd have chosen school any time. It was hardly worthy of a day off.And at the risk of being labelled a leftie I didn't like to see the stealing of someones car &amp; then have it speeding around the roads with a uninsured &amp; inexperienced teenage driver at the wheel, trivialised &amp; inserted into a film in the hope of a few cheap laughs. Likewise I've always found something a bit sick in people who use family member's deaths as a means of bunking off school or work, and again this was the basis of more humour. Of course that happens and of course it has a place in films. Someone pretending their nan had died would fit in fine in the Godfather or the Krays but it didn't do anything for this film.3/10 the lively innovations.Oh &amp; would anyone called Ferris be that popular?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a movie to be shown at teacher rallies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think you have to be or have been a teacher to feel as though John Hughes' movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is like a student scraping his nails across your blackboard for 90 minutes. When this movie was first released, I happened to see it on a week where a student came tardy to my class, cussed me out when I called him on it, and then had his mother phone and tell me that I was overreacting [for doing what was expected of me] and tell me that she was praying for me. By the time I finished watching the movie, Principal Rooney (ployed by Jeffrey Jones), who was intended as a figure of fun, was a very sympathetic character to me.Anyway, Matthew Broderick plays the title role, an insufferable youngster who appears to have an angel of God at his side. Ferris concocts elaborate schemes for playing hooky from school, yet he manages to endear himself to everyone except Mr. Rooney, who can never quite catch Ferris in the act, and his sister Jennie (Jennifer Grey of "Dirty Dancing"), who is justifiably annoyed at Ferris's liberties.One fine spring day, Ferris again fools his parents into thinking he is on Death's doorstep. When they leave for work, Ferris browbeats his downtrodden buddy Cameron (Alan Ruck, later of TV's "Spin City") into stealing his father's prized 1961 Ferrari, hijacking Ferris's girlfriend (Mia Sara) from school and going on a joyride.The angel-of-God analogy is particularly apt because the movie seems a latter-day version of deus-ex-machina. And never has a movie seemed so stagy. When Ferris starts talking to the camera (presaging similarly self-conscious '90s movies and TV shows), expounding his theories on life and skipping school, one half-expects to read "Based on a play by Neil Simon" in the credits.What a great combination--the self-righteousness of John Hughes and the Broadway smarminess of Matthew Broderick. Two minds without a single thought.And the film in constantly at odds with what it tries to tell us. At one point, Ferris tells us that you'll never get anywhere by kissing people's hindquarters. Yet he can't get anywhere without sucking up to people or manipulating them for his selfish whims.He also complains about his parents being weird. The poor kid--all his parents have ever given him are everything he wants, and more attention than his sister can hope to receive.And how is all of this massive manipulation possible? Because Hughes sets up cardboard characters and emotions. Mr. Rooney is essentially Wile E. Coyote, forever chasing the Road Runner in vain.Ferris's parents are vapid dummies who don't care much about anything. And Ferris is supposedly made lovable by such acts as his hammy performance to get out of school (an old bit when it was used in "E.T.") and his lip-syncing to a rock song (which, after Tom Cruise in "Risky Business" and Rodney Dangerfield in "Easy Money," was well on its way to become a modern-day movie cliché).All of the performances are execrable, except for Ruck as Cameron, the put-upon friend. When Cameron vows to take a stand against his dad, the scene almost works, despite its utter gravity, because Cameron has been such a likable dolt up until then. If only we could see a movie about a teenager like *him*, instead of this self-indulgent vehicle about a self-indulgent brat. When John Hughes--a Mel Brooks for high-school geeks--was asked how he prepares his scripts, he said, "I never start with the jokes. I look at an issue and try to find the story in it...To me, 'Animal House' was a character movie." That's funnier than anything in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller is an asshole.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of high school/coming-of-age movies, I had high expectations from this film. Everyone says it's one of the best coming-of-age comedies out there, and it's maintained that title for nearly 3 decades now. The movie starts off very promising, immediately setting itself apart from a sea of derivative titles in the coming-of-age comedy genre, with its rather original protagonist. Most conventional high school films are about an unpopular kid's rise to popularity despite numerous challenges, popular kids bullying and rejecting them, etc. Ferris Bueller, on the other hand, is already popular. He's handsome. He's got a girlfriend. All the things that the protagonist has at the end of most high school movies, Ferris Bueller starts his day off with. However, I now understand why kids like him are usually the villain, because Ferris Bueller is just an unbelievable asshole. He fakes sickness to get out of school, something we've all done and can relate to, but then he drags his actually sick friend, Cameron, out of bed using all kinds of manipulation, not because he enjoys hanging out with him, but because he needs a ride. He then pressures Cameron to steal his dad's Ferrari, drives to school with the henceforth stressed-out Cameron to pick up his girlfriend, effectively turning him into the third wheel for the remainder of the day. In fact, they barely talk to the guy from that point. Oh, and he doesn't return the car after all this, instead he drives recklessly for a while, to yet further worried protest from Cameron that goes ignored, then takes it to a garage and hands the keys to a random guy (who also proceeds to drive recklessly with it). He then spends the rest of day doing the weirdest crap. He could drive around in the Ferrari for example, or go do drugs or smoke or drink like normal kids do when they skip school, or maybe use his popularity and his confidence to get Cameron a girl as well, but instead he uses his day off to dine at a fancy restaurant and go to a museum. What high school kid ditches school to go to museum? Oh, and apparently he is so popular, that he can use his citywide influence to be the star of a whole parade. I'm all for the anti-hero approach to the otherwise over-told high school story, but Ferris Bueller is not a good anti-hero. You can't relate to him and you don't root for him, except only when the school principal develops a strange obsession with exposing Ferris Bueller's whole plan, and only then because the principal is an even bigger asshole. The story is mostly not so believable, and none of the characters are very layered or developed. From the weirdly adult choice of entertainment, to the variety of strange and hardly believable events that unfold, such as the principal's obsession, or Cameron entering a catatonic state at some point, to the parade scene, the film feels like a collection of random events sparsely unfolding between a lot of silence or uninteresting/unfunny dialog. A big portion of the film is just kinda awkward. In my opinion, what makes most teenage movies great, is how relatable they are to all of us, and to our own adolescent experiences. As teenagers they helped us get through our own lives and as adults they make us laugh at who we used to be. In my opinion, Ferris Bueller's Day Off fails in this regard. Maybe if I was myself still a teenager, or kind of an asshole, I would appreciate this film more. To its credit it doesn't look like it's a movie that hasn't aged well, though that would at least explain why such a bad movie is so highly spoken of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine Catcher in the Rye if it was from the POV of a teen yuppie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After liking''Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and having taken into consideration the cult status this film enjoys i was expecting good things. What i got was an irritating little movie where the central conceit leave a bad taste in the mouth. The films message; Take a break from the mundane-take a 'Day off'-escape the banality of everyday life and find adventure. Whats wrong with that you might say? Well privileged little Ferris Bullers life is anything but mundane. He gets to drive around in a ferarri with a supermodel girlfriend in a world where he never has to take responsibility for his own actions, then sits there earnestly telling us about ''life passing him by?'' I wanted to throw things at the screen. Hughes completely misses the point in the same way Ben Stiller did recently with his awful ''Secret Life of Walter Mitty''; these people seeking something more from life already lead perfect lives so its impossible to to relate to them or understand what they have to feel hard done by about. The film is not really a Bildungsroman, it does not really deal with coming of age; its kind of a bastard relative of the baby boomer movies from the 70s but made for the brat pack generation. We are expected to root for a spoiled overachiever who believes the universe revolves around him and, as others have correctly pointed out, seems to demonstrate sociopathic personality traits. That i can't do. Hated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment and a bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it very strange that a teenage boy would spend his day off at mall and fine dining. It is rather what a middle age man with bad job would do on his day off. But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not better the 2nd time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie nearly as well as most of my family and acquaintances, when it was originally released. Recently, visiting friends, they had rented it for their teenage daughter, and all watched it one evening. I thought I might enjoy it more, and having lived in Chicago previously, like to see the locales there in any film.However, I liked it even less the second time, and, frankly, have enjoyed looking at information about the film and cast on this site (IMDb) even more than seeing the picture.I found Broderick's character un-funny, annoying, and even obnoxious. It is also interesting and humorous (more than the flick) to see that naughty high-schooler Broderick was 24 when the film was made, and Alan Ruck, his laconic sidekick (also annoying in his droll lethargy) was either 29 (or 30!!). Little sister Jennifer Grey was actually 26 (two years senior to Broderick) - but at least the girlfriend was "only" 19. And this assumes none have "fudged" a couple of years on age, not uncommon for "show biz" personalities Another interesting factoid from this site: the actor and actress portraying the Buehler parents met on this film, and married in real life (but were later divorced at an indeterminate date).Finally, anything as ludicrous as Buehler's boarding the parade float and singing like a nightclub emcee, to the participation and enjoyment of the girls properly on the float, the marching band following, and every onlooker in sight, is not only outrageous, but not in the least bit amusing, also. When this sort of nonsense is put into this type of film, it had better be funny, and this wasn't. Equally outrageous, stupid, and even less humorous (if possible) was Buehler's supposed duping the maitre d' in the swanky restaurant. This wasn't as funny as even the weakest skits, performed every week on SNL or Mad TV - and far more appropriate to one of these.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off-*-Worthless- Directed by: John Hughes. Written by: John Hughes, Starring: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffery Jones, Jennifer Grey, Cindy Pickett, Lyman Ward, Edie McClurg, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Del Close, Virginia Capers, Louis Anderson, Max Perlich, T. Scott Coffey, Kristy Swanson.Pointless and irreverent comedy with Broderick as a cool as ice teen who ditches school with his best buddy (Ruck) and his girlfriend (Sara) but must avoid the angry principal (Jones) and every adult who tries to destroy their plans but miraculously fails.John Hughes is artificial in his storytelling because there is nothing truthful to say about teenagers. To him, there are two groups of teenagers, those that are unharmed and those that are harmed. By this, I mean Bueller as the unharmed and every other teenager out there as the harmed. Bueller is perfect in every sense of the word and I do not understand how a filmmaker fixated on the destabilization of the teenager could create a protagonist so devoid of conflict.Ruck's character is Hughes's attempt at realism if only Ruck had played the part a bit better in terms of conflict. Yet Ruck did what he could, the character's emotions come out toward the end and without any warnings, which is Hughes's signature uneven qualities. In the film, kids are great and all adults are morons, which is more nihilism than counterculture. It's silly and goes on without much of a point besides tips and tricks to an unrealistic day of fun grounded by a director who does not know how to keep the elements of his story together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and stylish take on the years of then-contemporary American teenagers, that carries on finding new audiences due to its study of individualism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off seems to hold a pretty firm and entrenched place in whatever 1980s teen cannon that people hold in such high regard. Back to the Future was, perhaps famously, rejected by many-a studios on the basis of 'not being raunchy enough'; something other films of its ilk were at the time. I can imagine something similar happening to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but like Back to the Future, it is the decidedly 'un-raunchy' films of the era that we now revisit the most often and just seem to hold in higher regard.I think what keeps this film resonating with past and current audiences alike is its clear distinction in paying close attention to young people, and their ever-ongoing battle for independence, for recognition and for individuality. The lead is Ferris Bueller (Broderick); a young and very confident, almost borderline sociopathic in his behaviour, male in then-contemporary America. Ferris is the sort of guy who can con his way into an expensive restaurant; hack his way into the school computer mainframe and shows total disregard to his friend's and certain respective situations when trying to haggle the use of a rare and classic car for the day. The film takes special care in introducing him as an individual whom lives in a large, detached house in a rich neighbourhood that comes complete with a white picket fence. He is literate in all the latest gadgets and pieces of technology, be it home computers used to hack or stereo systems to further the notion he is unwell.In direct opposition to Ferris is the principal of Ferris' school, named Ed Rooney (Jones). Rooney isn't just out to capture Bueller as he plays truant, he is out to destroy Bueller's life; this, Rooney outlines as his goal very early on in the piece. This seems to be the essence of what keeps audiences old and new consistently discovering the film; that study of 'old vs. young' as these cocky, smart and quite attractive bunch of confident oddball kids dare stand up to those of a high authority; those that are grey, suit-clad authoritarian figures such as Rooney.But I think Bueller is smarter-still than what he lets on. He talks very early on about how important it is to go to college and learn a trade and live the American Dream, but he does so in a very nonchalant manner, almost as if he is repeating what it is he's told to say, or think, or feel. What follows is a chain of events and total disregard to most things that suggest he isn't of this ideation at all. But the journey does have an ideation; an ideation Bueller himself cooks up to do with being able to notice life and enjoy life as best you can, otherwise it might seem like it's passing you by.But the film isn't preoccupied with just these studies. Its attention to young vs. old or independence vs. routine is similarly played about with through one of Bueller's two friends named Cameron Frye (Ruck), who is given a slight subplot to do with being able to stand up to his father. Ferris and Cameron's third friend is Sloane Peterson (Sara), Ferris' girlfriend. The three complete an unusual triangle of pals; they are one another's' friend as well as foil, forever getting into adventures and situations but hitting the odd wall when it comes to the finer things during the day out. Cameron is forever concerned with the car; Cameron and Sloane are forever worried they might get caught (particularly when Ferris partakes in a large musical number in the street) and Ferris seems forever pre-occupied that the three of them will not get the best out of their day off; a day off Ferris sees as a gift, as something they worked hard towards earning with their scheming, and thus; must embrace it as fully as possible.The film is a love story, a comedy that relies on slapstick, situation and screwball alike; the film is an odd beast of basic convention, surrealist humour and truancy glorification. But does it ever focus too much on one thing? Does it particularly care what you might think of it? I don't think it does, it just throws mostly everything at the screen, stirs it all up and allows it all to play out. It feels like two, or possibly three, different films at once ? but that's fine because there is enough different sorts of content all brewing at once, and focused on at a balanced rate, that we go with it. One might say the film's attitude echoes that of its lead; it's doing things its own way, in its own style and doesn't particularly mind how you react. It's the kind of film that can go from a slow motion shot of two guys driving a sort-of stolen car that was sort-of stolen in the first place to the Star Wars theme; to a series of scenes that rely on a school teacher falling over a few times as a source of humour. The best thing about it all, is that it's all actually rather effective.</fullReview>

I especially took a liking to the socially awkward Cameron who really makes this movie worth while with his constant negative thinking. I love the jealous sister who really wants to be more like Ferris but just does not feel like she could and I adored Charlie Sheen but still..The movie is filled with situation that are just not really believable. Not considering some obvious but - hopefully - intended illogical situations like Ferris on the parade truck myself wondering whether or not those kids are just plain stupid. (Like sneaking behind Ferris father to catch a cab - they could just take the next one!)The plot is completely predictable but that's part of the fun and for the most part is really was fun but those ten minutes that weren't just kinda spoiled the mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best (Early) Beatles Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.John Hughes had made a few `straight' teen movies before this: that's where the world of the movie -- though abstract -- is to be taken at face value. The actors actually try to play their characters, in fact Hughes generally tries to find actors that already are those characters.But he tried something else with Molly Ringwald starting with `Breakfast Club' where he cast her `against type.' Much of that film depended on a notion of acting to be someone else. Here he takes the next step, this time with Broderick. And this time, he gets a seasoned, self-aware actor.This time, the story is not about teen angst associated with self-identity, but about the joy of the con. The pleasures of being someone else (which is all most kids have anyway). Broderick's stage experience before this was all in roles where he winked at the audience: `See what I do.' A couple years later, Bruce Willis would reintroduce this style of acting to the big picture, but here we have it early.The tip-off is those moments when Ferris -- or is it Broderick? -- looks straight at you and tells you about the role he is playing: Broderick playing a role of a kid who is playing a role. We have the `Mr Peterson' bit; the `sausage king' bit; the performance in the parade; the fake-in-the-bed bit (shades of `Home Alone'), the sick six year old bit; and finally the actor telling us to just go home. Its all acting about acting: a teen's life is all about adopting a persona.Today, this seems normal, but in its time, it was pretty revolutionary film for a mainstream product. Its the reason this is remembered so fondly, because for many youngsters -- those who never learn to read intelligently -- it was the first encounter with reflexive art. (The previous generation got their's from the Beatles and Dylan.) I'm not sure what teen film predecessors there could be, but this may be where the whole explosion of non-ironic irony in teen films comes from.That redhead Stephanie Blake character is important. Look for her.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.</fullReview>

Storyline weak, humour minimal and crass - OK the odd good part but very few and far between.Everything was far exaggerated and OTT. The reactions of his sister and the school teacher. The actual 'adventure' that Ferris has.To reiterate, if you're 25+ and this is currently 2010+, I don't think the film has much to offer you. Pass it by and save an hour forty five.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many adjectives to describe this. .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is one of the most well known movies of all time. Whenever you talk about it it brings a illuminating smile to someones face. John Hughes once again delivers a high school film with its heart in the right place that is presented horribly. When Matthew Broderick plays the title character, Ferris Bueller, he skips school pretending he is sick to spend the day with his best friend and girlfriend by spending time in Chicago. This film seems cute, but it has too many flaws. For one, Ferris is one of the most obnoxious movie characters in history. He is so thoughtless and rambunctious that it is impossible to laugh at his jokes. What doesn't work here is how Hughes makes Ferris talk to the camera in several scenes. Some directors allow this aspect in films to work, but Hughes make it really uncomfortable. Of course since it is a John Hughes film there will be some idiotic adult or adults trying to take down the high school protagonist's mission. The dean of the school tries to take Ferris down in a cat and mouse game super frustrating. The stereotypical portrayal of high school, the numerous amounts of close calls to get Ferris caught by his parents, and the extreme amount of arguing all add up to "Ferris Bueller's Day Off's" repetitive dynamics that enable any negative adjective to describe this film overall. This film is really overdone and annoying due to all the close calls and unlikable aspects presented by Hughes. His directing is just inconsistent. "Ferris Bueller's day Off" has it's heart in the right place, just it has too many tricks, unlikable actions by the protagonist, and preposterous conflicts that get repetitive. This is more forgettable than remarkably entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie started off really well, in a fast and entertaining pace. However, after some while, I could guess exactly where this movie was going, and surely knew it wouldn't bring anything new or extraordinary to the genre. Even Charlie Sheen worked in this picture, looking like a vampire from "Twilight"; I could barely recognize him being that young-- I'm more used to his age in "Two and a Half Men" era. Main character is a sharpie guy that fools everybody and, in the end, gets away with murder. His sister, a correct girl that does everything right, ends up being labeled as the bad guy off the story. These scenes are at least useful to remind us that good people always end up being misunderstood. Obviously this film inspired many of modern teen comedies, such as "American Pie", "Not Another Teen Movie", "Road Trip", among others. I confess that I enjoyed 1988's "License to Drive" much more than this one, even thought that movie copied many aspects of this. Also, Marlon Wayans' productions are much better in making you laugh. All in all, it's an interesting movie for the time it was released, but offers nothing different of modern comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a bona fide 80s classic. If you haven't seen it, where have you been? Much loved, much quoted and preferred, it stands the test of time as a gripping, funny, high school caper. Basically, Ferris Bueller is the class prankster and decides to play truant one day having convinced his friends (Ruck and Sara) to come along. So the plot follows the school Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) trying the catch him out, to prove he is skipping not - as he claims - sick.It's brilliant. Broderick is so believable, mischievous and exciting to watch, against the foil of his sister played by Jennifer Grey pre-Dirty Dancing. The one-liner thief of the film is Charlie Sheen, in a small role, but memorable! This is the sort of film you watch again and again, don't turn over when it's on TV and know most of the lines from. Watch it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Want a Day Off --- Ferris Bueller will show you how to do it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day off is practically a step by step guide to taking a day off from school, although it requires some elaborate equipment and schemes, both of which Ferris has in abundance, to much chagrin from his sister and the school principal whom are not fooled by his schemes.Ferris has decided to take his ninth day off with his best friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloane. With the principal hot on their tails Ferris and Co. drive around town in Cameron's father's Ferrari, go see a baseball match, eat at a fancy restaurant and watches a parade (well Ferris participate in it to some extent).This movie is fun to watch mostly due to the principal and Cameron but also due to the elaborate schemes of Ferris and the way he tricks his parents into believing that he's really sick (the father even 'sees' his son a couple of times but for some reason dosn't recognize him?????) It has some pretty stupid moments (like the above mentioned scenes with the father). But these dos not ruin the movie in any way.The acting is okay, not award winning but satisfactory enough: Matthew Broderick does a okay job at portraying Ferris Bueller; the scheming kid. Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye; the somewhat insecure kid; is probable the actor that does the best work here, especially considering that he at the time was near 30 years (well above the normal age of a high school kid). Mia Sara as Sloane Peterson does an fairly anonymous performance, this can be due to the fact that the character doesn't do that much in the first place. Jeffrey Jones does a splendid job as Edward R. Rooney; the school principal; in fact his performance also candidates to the best alongside Ruck's. Jennifer Grey plays Jeanie Bueller; Ferris's sister; with a pretty stuck up trait, this is probably how she's supposed to play it but in comes out somewhat single minded. In smaller roles we have Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Del Close as English Teacher, both does a fairly boring impression, but this is in most cases how teachers seem; boring and dry (actually this is how Ben Stein plays most of the roles I have seen him in). In cameo roles we have Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley, Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, both does okay especially Sheen.All in all I give this 6 out of 10. If you like either Broderick, Ruck or Jones then see this you won't regret it. If your not that big a Broderick fan then it depends on how small a fan of him you are whether or not you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps John Hughes' hostage to fortune, certainly the only one of his films as director that has some--not a lot, but some--of the devil-may-care attitude of his days as a writer for the National Lampoon, when writing about sex with teenagers was his forte. Matthew Broderick stars as the antithesis of Hughes' usual sad sack heroes, a smarmy, cocksure, insanely popular high school senior with an optimistic, yet realistic, outlook on life who decides to cut school along with his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and best friend (Alan Ruck) and spend the day seeing the sights of Chicago; meanwhile his antagonist, Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), plots his capture. Broderick is genuinely charming and perfectly cast as the sophisticated yet sweetly dorky kid that the director clearly wishes he had been and when Broderick's doing nothing but cajoling and insinuating, he fills the film with a heart that Hughes' other films sorely lack. It's all terrific, inspired fun until the third act when Hughes trudges out his usual collegiate psychobabble aimed squarely at the lesser characters of Ruck and Sara; then the whole thing submerges into the usual deep self-pity that renders his movies unbearable. With Jennifer Grey as Broderick's sister, herself a model of crack comic timing, and Charlie Sheen, uproarious in a scene-stealing cameo, as a placid, monosyllabic burnout with the wisdom of a Confucius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't easy to make a movie on adolescence. The attempt may backfire in more than one ways. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" thankfully stays crisp till the end, a genre-defining film that manages to revive you with a fresh verve on a familiar concept. No, I'm not saying its the best film I've seen on the subject but it's a thoroughly enjoyable fare that wasn't aiming for that anyway. Or was it? Doesn't matter. It manages to charm in many ways, and that's the whole point.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenage miscreant who fakes an illness to skip school on a beautiful summer day. Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), his best friend, decides to join him in his plans to spend a memorable albeit intuitive day. Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) is also picked up by them from school right under the supervision of the dean, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who is out to nail Ferris for his poor attendance record. As the gang spends the day roaming around the city, Rooney repeatedly tries to apprehend Ferris but to no avail. Ferris' sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), jealous of her brother's ability to wriggle out of any tight situation, longs to catch him fooling around. The story revolves around how Ferris and his friends spend an entire day that is both unforgettable and life-changing."Ferris Bueller's Day Off" starts off on a great note, with a few of the film's funniest scenes playing out in the first-half itself. Broderick sneaks into his character effortlessly, being charming and fascinating from the very beginning and never letting his character be someone you won't like. Apart from the many things that impressed me, I was most inspired by how director John Hughes made it seem all so familiar. I chuckled at how many of the scenes in the movie took me back to certain points in my life when I faced a similar situation, and when you're reminded of something like that in a movie, you know that the director has done his job well. The characters are endearing, likable and that helps when the film starts to slog after a while. Hughes has always been great at creating rascally characters who are affable enough to carry a parodic story to its end. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is no different. It doesn't even seek to try anything else other than delight you with its vigor and observations. And, in parts, it's pretty hilarious.When attempting a coming-of-age film, one should keep his indulgences in check. Though "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" targets the younger generation, I found it a tad too childish. And that's not entirely bad, but after a while, I found it difficult to invest into the characters. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a corpus of the fantasies of an average teenager, which is also the reason why the touch of pragmatism is almost entirely abandoned. Hughes creates a world where nothing can go wrong for his protagonist, where everything is sorted out with absurd ease and a few clever pranks. The character of Ferris Bueller is a synecdoche, just a synecdoche. If you like him, you'll like the movie. But if you don't, you might find it more annoying than amusing. Me, I liked him when he first came on-screen but I found my likeness wearying as the story progressed. But your viewpoint about the him may differ.Broderick, in his most important role to date, infuses Ferris with charm and wit that gives the movie its legs. It's a candid performance and surely Broderick's best. Sara is absolutely gorgeous to look at and she brings a quiet confidence to her role. Ruck is fascinating as Cameron, and when I grew tired of Ferris' antics, I found myself looking forward to watching Ruck's elucidation of his character. He hands in a wonderfully nuanced performance and the best of the lot."Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a watchable film, supremely entertaining, a good-looking film with its heart in the right place. Though I was expecting it to really dig into the genre, and was disappointed when it chose to stay away from being too ambitious and played it safe instead, it's one of those films that delights in everything it does. And a movie like that is hard to come by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorifying recklessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What would the 80s be without John Hughes? While his contributions will never be forgotten in history, I think I am quite glad that filmmakers are over this phase. All of his films seem to send the message that being completely carefree is okay.I think this film sends the wrong message. While childhood and adolescence are supposed to be happy years, I don't believe that kids are supposed to be so irresponsible. Most people who watch this film say: "it is just a movie", "kids are kids", "they didn't do anything so bad" or whatever. But I don't agree. It is not about what they did, it is about how much impunity they had and how Ferris was depicted as a "great guy".What's kids mentality today? They think that they "deserve" to have an hedonistic, exciting and devil-may-care life. I dare to say that this film is one of the reasons a whole generation became more like this. Many people grew up watching this film, seeing Ferris as a hero or something.The difference between today's films is that when teenagers show acts of recklessness, they at least get punished in some way. I guess Ferris is the kind of character that is supposed to "always have his way", but I think that he should've been at least a little sorry for all his acts.Personally, I didn't like the principal's character either. They "satanized" the guy so much it didn't even make sense anymore. While some school authorities really don't care a lot about their students, it doesn't make sense that a grown man would be so resentful towards a kid.And well, while this film is certainly a classic... I can't help but feel a little disturbed that recklessness could be so glorified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>giving it the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is over 25 years old now and so I thought it was about time I gave it a review. Recently I also went back and reviewed Risky Business, NL's Vacation and a few other 80's movies and so I'm kind of going to try and compare it to its contemporaries. Anyway, I'll kick this off by asking a few question: No 1 - Where do you think Ferris wound up in life after he graduated from High School? Another question might go like this: "If you liked Ferris, how would you compare your life now to that of someone who didn't like Ferris?". THere is a polarization of attitudes here at IMDb over him, and so these would seem to be relevant questions.And so to begin with, as has often been pointed out over the years, the biggest issue with Ferris for many was that he was made of Teflon - i.e. nothing stuck to him. I think that this was due in part to the fact that he got so much love and attention from his parents that he never considered the possibility that others might not also love him. This in turn made him feel impervious to wrongdoing and caused him to do morally questionable things :) Another issue is that he came from that part of society where parents are powerful enough to bully school administrators whenever they feel like it. Witness Ed Rooney's shivering in his boots when he thinks he's talking to Sloan Peterson's Dad. So, Ferris moral compass is a bit skewed, and if you have any teaching experience, you have probably seen this all before.Now, contrast him to buddy Cam and maybe Joel Goodson of "Risky Business". Cam and Joel, in contrast to Ferris, had moral consciences. Where Ferris would just sort of go out and do something whenever he felt like it, Cam and Joel were more restrained and prone to weighing pros and cons. All of these differences to me were related to each character's relationship with his parents. Only Ferris seemed to take his parents (and their love) completely for granted. And where Cam would say "I don't know what I'm going to do with my life", it shows you that at least he's thinking about it. Joel Goodson was also on a career path at the time his story takes place. But Ferris? Does Ferris ever talk about what he wants to do with his life? No, not that I can recall. So, I ask myself all of this because I am no longer 18 and am not that successful in life. I also got a kick out of skipping class when I was in high school, and didn't like to talk about what I wanted to do afterwords because I didn't know. And......I always pretty much loved this movie which has perhaps caused me to be blind to its message. And just what was the message?Well, a good movie will take you on a journey, a journey in which the principal characters change. Well, but the problem as I look back on it now is that Ferris DIDN'T change that day. Cam did, and Joel did in Risky Business, but Ferris learned only that, once again, deceitful and impulsive behavior results in no consequences. This was perhaps the movie's message, that Ferris was some sort of God or something and well, "just don't try this at home kids!" Sounds like I really didn't like him, heh? Well, but i DID! I'm not one of those Ferris haters. But I gotta admit, of the three characters I'm referring to, he's the one who's going to have the most issues to deal with later in life, IHMO!And so the irony to me is that Ferris was the catalyst that caused Cam to grow up and face his fears, but it was really Ferris that needed a catalyst, not Cam. Catalysts cause other things to react and change, but don't change themselves. This was the "Teflon" aspect of Ferris's existence. He didn't project any sense that he needed to work on himself, to grow. Perhaps unconditional parental love is not always a good thing then, and Ferris never appreciated how good he had it. Guys like that can get you in a lot of trouble because they have few moral boundaries owing to that love. I don't know, but remember that "the motorheads, dweebs, wasteoids, dickheads, etc" all loved Ferris. That left Ed and sister Jeanie to lead any attempts to burst his bubble, to catalyze any change in him. They don't succeed here, but maybe they planted some seeds in his brain? So "wake up and smell the coffee", Ferris. Cam's dad's is going to find out that you really wrecked the car, not Cam. And then your reputation is going to be the next hot topic around town.....OK, OK......there, I've said it. I've made my peace with myself and with Ferris. Yeah, we love you, and I'd still pluck my money down to watch you outsmart Ed Rooney and the whole town of Chicago. But if immortal youth is the only God in this universe, you've got some years of reckoning ahead of you. That is unless of course, you drift into theatre, acting, comedy, or are independently wealthy. Because I guess I still don't know what you were really planning on doing with YOUR life? What skill sets were you going to bring to the rest of world? Well, you might have made a pretty good houdini....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched the recent Honda commercial send-up of Matthew Broderick, I watched this movie again.This will always be a great teen coming of age movie, or at least a movie for people under the age of 30 who were recently in high school. It's premise is based on the human urge to go against the system and buck the rules and just have a good time. Practically every kid that feels stuck in the walls of an institution such as high school is going to get these urges, and for all of those kids, Ferris Bueller is their hero.Matthew Broderick brings a warm, innocent charm to the title role as a young man who has luck on his side. Everything goes his way, from worming his best friend (Alan Ruck) into taking his father's rare Ferrari, to warding off the high school principal (Jeffrey Jones) to getting his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school as well.Writer/director John Hughes takes his love for teenagers and school situations and gives us a story that deals with life outside school and the freedoms and privileges of being a kid. What Ferris does is, as they say, getting away with murder, but it is such a joy to watch him get into predicaments and wonder how can he possibly get out of this one. Broderick is a delight, as are the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Grey as his envious sister. This movie is about luck and what that power can do for you. It is also about enjoying life and the power that can do. It is the ultimate skipping school movie and is one of Hughes' best efforts as a writer and director. See it for the story, the funnies or the plain joy of skipping school and catching a glimpse of life as it was back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic case of senoritis. Despite the slacker mentality and overall sense of purposelessness, deep down we all realize that Ferris is only acting this way because he has already been accepted to an Ivy League college somewhere in the fall and will end up a banker, lawyer, or doctor eventually (don't think for one second he will be vexed by the decision just as his decision over which country club to join will be equally non-disconcerting).The saddest part is that young people who have been given so much act so snotty to everyone around them. Yet, we all laugh as if somehow we are in on the joke. Sure we are allowed to peek into this privileged life for 90 minutes, but the huge majority must go back to the grinding reality of real life knowing that money does by friends and happiness as Ferris so artfully proves.</fullReview>

Cameron is rather reluctant about getting his father's car but Ferris over comes and they also take along a gal named Sloane Peterson, (Mia Sara) who is a girl friend of Ferris and they all head to Chicago, Illinios and have a ball going to baseball games at Wrigley Field, an expensive place to eat and visit the Art Museum.

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), written and directed by John Hughes, is a high school student's wish fulfillment dream. Imagine being able to skip school, enjoy a fantastic day in Chicago, and do this with your best buddy (driving a spectacular car) and your beautiful girl friend. Ferris Bueller knows he's on his way to a solid career and a trophy wife. He may as well enjoy the ride along the way. Even with our recognition that Ferris is dishonest, selfish, and arrogant, we can't help but be on his side as he outwits adults at every turn.Matthew Broderick was born to play Ferris Bueller, and he is spectacular in the role. All the other characters are only important insofar as they rotate in orbit around Ferris. Jeffrey Jones does a competent job as Principal Rooney, who plays Wile E. Coyote to Broderick's Road Runner. Rooney knows Ferris isn't sick and he takes on the job of catching his nemesis violating regulations. (We can guess that he'll be no more successful than Wile E. Coyote, but neither Rooney nor Coyote ever catch on.)Mia Sara is attractive as Ferris's girlfriend Sloane, although I'd advise her to think twice before considering Ferris as marriage material. Ben Stein is perfect as the economics teacher whose teaching techniques have reached a perfection of tedium.Finally, how can you not like a movie that features Charlie Sheen as "Boy in Police Station," and that gives the world the definitive cinematic version of "Twist and Shout"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Buehler's Day Off is one of my favorite John Hughes movies. Matthew Broderick as Ferris Buehler puts in a classic eighties performance as the lovable slacker. Chicago has never looked better. After ditching school the movie takes all kinds of improbable twists and turns, each one more funny than the last. Definitely John Hughes's best movie, Ferris Buehler's Day Off has many memorable scenes, my favorite being when Edward Rooney (the villainous principal in search of Ferris...) walks into a bar with a television set playing the same Cub's Game that Ferris is ditching school to attend. The movie then cuts to Ferris at the Wrigley Field catching a baseball laughing about how much better it is to go to a baseball game than it is to go to P.E. That scene always cracks me up.</fullReview>

Incidentally, doesn't Broderick look like Greg Maddux? Anyway, Alan Ruck is good also as Cameron, and the scene where he pounds the hell out of his dad's ferrari is unforgettable. And who could forget Jeffrey Jones as the bum principal. He utters the classic line in the following sequence: Rooney: "What's the score?" Bartender: "0-0" Rooney: Who's winning?" Bartender: (incredulous) "the bears!"All in all this is a great film and every time I hear "Twist and Shout" I can't help of think of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is simply a classic movie. Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, is a cool guy, who many people wish they could be. He is friends with everyone and it seems as though nobody dislikes him at all, except for maybe his sister at times. He is always relaxed, clever, and funny, and he is able to use his traits to manipulate those around him. This movie shows the adventure that Ferris, his best friend Cameron Frye, Alan Ruck, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, Mia Sara, have in Chicage driving a classic Ferrari while attempting not be caught by their parents or Principal Ed Rooney, Jeffrey Jones. This movie is funny and smart, and is one of the few greats that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never had a day off like this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even today, I've wondered why this film is so loved by many people today. I guess it's because it was made during the decade that will never die, the 1980's. I've often felt that the reason people cherish the 80's is because the 1990's and the oughts of 2000 haven't got anything to distinguish them. Even in 2002 or 2003, we seem to be still stuck in the 1990's. Unless this decade has a style that will distinguish it, the 1980's will continue to be beloved. All the excesses of the 1980's are here.The story is pretty simple: Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick), a young man who seems to be in a class by himself, fakes an illness so he and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (the cute Mia Sara) and best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) can traipse through Chicago. While he's out there, his "enemies" are out to ruin his afternoon. Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney, the Principal of his HS who is trying to bust Ferris for past truancy and is out to look for him. Jennifer Grey (who looked ancient in this film and was dating Broderick at the time) plays his older sister Jeanie, who wants to also ruin the day for him but ends up being the one with the bad day.Yes, the film has decent acting and is a somewhat fun romp, but the film was made to once again show everyone why the 80's was such a storied decade. The excesses are here: the big dance and song routine at the parade, Grey's outfit, the fact that Ferris' mother (Cindy Pickett) has a more hip hairstyle than her daughter, etc. You could never remake this one today, the 2000's haven't earned any distinct image yet. Not a favorite of mine, but I can understand those 80's lovers fawning over this. I guess I prefer to revere the 80's through video games like Grand Theft Auto:Vice City and Activision Anthology and the music (not the videos).</fullReview>

All performances are wonderful (especially those of Matthew Broderick and Edie McClurg as Grace and my personal favorite, Jennifer Grey). Ferris contains some truly unforgettable one-liners (most of which are spoken by Grey). The facial and physical actions of all the different characters are also a riot. From the sick in bed scene, to the boring teachers, to the snooty restaurant, FBDO, never loses it's comic momentum. John Hughes has truly capture the spirit of every coming of age teenager, in this film, which I've seen dozens of times. It's one of those classics which just never gets old.

I always put this movie on when I need to remember that life is supposed to be about having fun, and the best fun usually comes at times when you should be getting serious (like Ferris's college prospects). It is a pure comedy, and that is what makes it so PERFECT. Alongside movies like Rebecca and Miller's Crossing, I give Ferris a 10/10.Also, Ferris's portrayal of Chicago is brilliant, like that of Blues Brothers. I especially love the montage at the Art Institute. If you want to know what makes Chicago great, those two movies can tell you most of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hughes is one director who make you feel life as a fairy tale filled with rainbows. Before he took the baby out (Baby's day out) he did ask Ferris to take his day off. The movie contains certain scenes that may require Parental Guidance (PG) but far better than high school movies of today. Other than that it is a family entertainer and is one of the best. Ferris character is superb and everybody loves him and wants to be him. Mia Sara looks very pretty to me. The principal's character is the funniest of all. My favorite was "Twist and Shout" scene, where all people dance to Ferris lip-synch. The bottom line is that it is one of the best 80s comedy flick and not to be missed. So, take a day off and watch 'Ferris Bueller's day off'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farris Bueller's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1986 film, "Farris Bueller's Day Off", one determined teenager pushes every limit to the max, with his sites set on the goal of having the day off from his own form of prison, high school. Farris is the ultimate wise guy. He outsmarts everyone who may potentially get in his way of skipping school. And, while doing so, creates many laughs for the audience along the way. This film incorporates great acting along with an entertaining plot that makes for a great comedy, just maybe not one for all ages. It seems as though every character was hand picked to perfectly fill their part. Matthew Broderick has the complete package for his role as the main character, Farris Bueller. His performance captures the essence of the crazy, free-spirited teenager who just wants to live life to the fullest. Starring alongside Broderick is Alan Ruck, or better known as Ferris's best friend, Cameron Frye. Ruck's drone voice and tense facial expressions mimic the characteristics of the up-tight personality his character is supposed to represent. Together the two actor's juxtaposition and spectacular performances make for a hilarious comedy of pranks and lies. Though the film will produce many laughs, my hope would be that those laughs are produced only from the mouths of those 14 and up. The plot is centered around lies that snowball throughout the storyline. At first it's one little lie, and then one more, until it seems as though it is the only dialogue being used. Younger children may process the message of this film to be finding it acceptable behavior to skip school, lie to their parents and authority figures, and steal a car with ultimately no consequences. But, these over-the-top lies and inflated situations are what make for such an amusing plot. With that being said, the film is rated PG-13 mostly for its language. Swear words flow loosely from the lips of some of the young characters. But, then again, the dialogue is part of what makes the movie so funny. The smarta** kids, the monotone teacher, and the na?ve parents are all needed to add cohesion to the piece. Director John Hughes seems to stay in his line of fire with this movie, filming the different perspectives of life viewed from the rebellious, love stricken teenagers, as he does in his other timeless films, "The Breakfast Club" (1985) and "Sixteen Candles" (1984). Though Hughes doesn't incorporate any flashy special effects or amazing scenery in the film, it isn't needed. It allows the audience to focus on, and enjoy, the classic story of the young man who fakes sick to skip school and, in turn, makes the best out of his "free" day.

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off = Exceptional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bueller?... Bueller?... Bueller?" Every teenager dreams of skipping school and Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) does just that. In this 1986 teenage comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a not so innocent teenager nearing the end of his high school career, ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), embark on an adventure to the "Windy City" of Chicago. With the upcoming obstacles of college, Bueller plans a day of shenanigans in hopes of saving Cameron. Little does Bueller know that his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey), and principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) would do everything in their power to make sure that the so called "perfect" child would be caught red-handed.Jeanie Bueller and Principal Ed Rooney didn't expect that catching the famous Ferris Bueller was going to be easier said than done. Along the way, they themselves dig into deeper trouble, even with the law! Running through neighbor's yards, encountering a gruesome rottweiler, and maybe even a little romance with a young, troubled teen (Charlie Sheen). What else could possibly go wrong? Throughout this movie, it is hard for anyone to despise Ferris. His young, seemingly childish attitude that never gets him in trouble appeals to everyone. He never ceases to address the audience with a sarcastic, funny side note as if we are apart of his scheme. By the end of this movie, the audience will see Ferris develop on so many levels. He even goes as far as taking the blame for something he didn't do, even if that means being caught. Matthew Broderick comes through with his best performance to date.Although Cameron, much more reserved than Bueller, is a bit skeptical of Bueller's mischief, he slowly warms up to the idea of fun and even does the unexpected. Yet throughout this movie he never seems to wear more than three expressions. It's not until the end that the audience sees the true Cameron that has been bottled up. Will his father ever open his heart to his son? Sloane Peterson plays the perfect girl for the wild and unpredictable Ferris Bueller. She's able to keep Ferris in check and temporarily out of trouble, yet she still plays along with his shenanigans. Together they balance out to the perfect high school relationship.John Hughes, director of the famous "16 Candles" and "The Breakfast Club," adds another memorable and comedic piece to his repertoire. Through the cultivation of every teenager's dream and the development of these characters, John Hughes certainly delivers. Anyone looking for countless laughs should indulge in this one of a kind teenage comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I too had day off to watch this Awesome flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie review by me is an attempt to improve my image in eyes of all those people who have always complained that I write movie reviews without interacting much with the reader, So here goes the review of Ferris Bueller's Dy Off keeping in mind my XI standard days of missing the school 48-times in a year.Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller), widely liked by everyone in his community decides to take a day off from a school. He plays hookie with his friends Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and enjoys a day in Chicago. There's only one person who can stop the fun and that's the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). And Ferris' sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey). OK, that's two persons. Ferris is a slacker but in his parents' eyes Ferris a perfect angel. So can Ferris get away with his plan or will he get caught?Seeking the company of his best friend Cameron to loan him his father's car which is a super sports car and the pride and joy of his father. Cameron is rather reluctant about getting his father's car but Ferris overcomes and they also take along Sloane Peterson, girlfriend of Ferris and they all head to Chicago, Illinios and have a ball going to baseball game at Wrigley Field, an expensive place to eat and visit the Art Museum. The movie is filled with some cool comic scenes involving his Principal and his witty tricks to fool people around him to get the things done in a manner he really wants. Don't miss the Greatest scene of the movie when Ferris gets up and sings TWist &amp; ShOut by Beatles along with the parade making everyone out there dance. I admit that storyline is paper thin, and there isn't much substance that it contributes to the movie ,but at the same time we also don't want some complex storyline in a teen comedy. The dialogue for this movie has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them. It's a classic! Afterall, JOHN HUGHES is best at this......My Rating - 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was simply just another John Hughes masterpiece - he churned them out like crazy in the 80's. "The Breakfast Club" was simply wonderful - imagine a whole movie shot in a high school library! ONE set! Brilliant on a Hitchcockian scale! John Hughes reminds me of Jean Shepherd - the writer of "A Christmas Story" (Ralphie, the boy who wants a BB-gun for Christmas) - a fantastic observer and scribe of the human condition. The grace, the stupidity, the tragedy of humanity. I actually feel sorry for people who don't like this movie - what sad specimens of humanity they must truly be? What a beautifully simple concept - boy takes a day off school! Only John Hughes could turn this into a thing of pure beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Comedy &amp; Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently met too many people in their twenties that haven't actually seen this film (although they're familiar with it). Twenty-six years later, however, it's still hilarious?the fashion and technology are outdated, but the comedy is timeless, and the commentary on society is still keen. Broderick reminds you that every day is an adventure waiting to happen?get off your couch and carpe diem! Ben Stein became famous from this film by demonstrating the pitfalls of the lecture system in high schools. With the help of burn-out street therapist Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey shows you how sibling jealousy will only hold you back in your enjoyment of your own life. And Ruck exhibits how rich, repressed kids can turn into ticking time bombs.This movie is a pop culture icon. The recent Honda CR-V Super Bowl commercial is a testament to that. If you haven't seen this flick yet, your penance is throwing an 80s party within the next couple of weeks, featuring an old-school boombox, Pop Rocks &amp; Mountain Dew, and a screening of this film?and invite me; I'm there.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much.1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him! 2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good.3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever.7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8. The most memorable scene was "Twist and Shout" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching.9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own! Overall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) - Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The leader of the Brat Pack, the late John Hughes, comes back with another movie for all coming of age teenagers. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" takes place on a popular high school student named Ferris Bueller who gets away with everything, when skipping nine days of high school, and his principal is on the loose to finally get him busted. The movie was perfectly funny, and there were some perfect moments with drama hiding behind it. John Hughes has made a movie teaching us to do what we want, be free, have a day off, and get away with it. That sounds like something you can steal from a teenager's diary. And the great cast including Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jennifer Grey, Lyman Ward, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Peckett, and Edie McClurg, were all hilariously brilliant. But besides Broderick, who made a great favorite of a performance, it was Alan Ruck who caught my attention as Cameron, and looking at the character, reminds me so much of how I am as a person. I sometimes can't handle things, and can't get my way out of anything, and that makes me a bit similar to this particular character. Now, who knew John Hughes can come up with an awesome coming-of-age teenage story of the 80s, and put it on film. The movie was funny, dramatic, and mostly a well-written diary of what every teenager wants to do for a living. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", in my review, "a well-written, coming-of-age story".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot explain to you how great this movie is. It is my favorite movie of all time, I watched it when I was 3, and it has been my favorite movie since. I plan to show it to my son as soon as possible, so I can share the joy. Ferris Bueller reminds me of my brother when we were kids, running around, ditching school. This was the first, and best movie I have ever seen. I would recommend this to EVERYONE. It is hilarious. The part where he was in the parade cracked me up, especially Twist and Shout, aka the #1 Beatles song. Obviously John Hughes (the director and co-producer) think alike. All I can say is that this movie is the single greatest movie I have ever watched and probably will be forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for reminiscing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of those movies that sticks in your mind for a long time. I first watched this movie back in 2002 when I was 17 so I guess at the time I could relate to the characters in the script who were based on a similar age to me. I enjoyed this so much that I watched it over and over and then 9 years later I stumbled across it again, you don't realisze when your a teenager how important things are and how good some memories are, but once you get older you begin to appreciate life and realize how much fun you had watching this. All the characters play good roles in the movie, Matthew Broderick really does a good job as the lead role Ferris.To sum it up, 9 years down the road and this movie is still definitely enjoyable but not as much as when I was a teen, however if you are a teenager then this is a great film to watch especially with a bunch of friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80's Classic That Has Aged Surprisingly Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1980's film gem that not only rises above its teen comedy genre, but escaped the outdated tag that now defines most of its peers. Written and directed by John Hughes, and starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris, the film is the tale of a spunky mischievous teenager who cuts school for the day with the ultimate of style and "moxy". Ferris is ultimately a tale of a self absorbed but lovable teen who just wants to have fun (with himself as the lead character). A little misguided and vain, but a character that "most" of the audience will root for nonetheless.NOTE: The story of Ferris Bueller is told from a young persons perspective, with the adults either relegated to minor roles, or portrayed as stick in the mud buffoons (for its intended audiences pleasure of course). This narrative is typical of most of Hughes best films, as is a certain "cartoonishness", so if not your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this film could be diminished.Ferris Bueller scores 8/10 (7 for the film itself plus 1/10 extra for the music)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It'd been years since I last watched 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986),' and, as a young adult, I was struck by just how tame Ferris Bueller's day off actually was. In my memory, I'd concocted all sorts of exciting and dangerous escapades. But Ferris (Matthew Broderick), it seems, is quite intent on emulating adulthood, and his choice of destinations is characteristically "grown up": the stock market exchange, an upper-class restaurant, a museum. He asks Sloane (Mia Sara) to marry him, lightly but nevertheless earnestly. Even his choice of parade music ("Danke Schoen" by Wayne Newton, "Twist and Shout" by The Beatles) harks to an older generation. "Life moves pretty fast," Ferris tells us, and yet he seems intent on accelerating the process.Spontaneity comes with youth. At first glance, we might consider Ferris Bueller to be spontaneous. But is he? Abe Froman, touted as "The Sausage King of Chicago," never arrives for his three-person reservation at the restaurant. Could Ferris not himself have made the reservation, and simply feigned spontaneity for the benefit of his friends? We've seen for ourselves the cunning genius with which Ferris creates illusions ? that he is too ill to attend school, that he is sound asleep in bed ? and this is just another deception, only now he's even fooling the viewer. This is perhaps referenced at the film's end, when Sloane suggests "You knew what you were doing when you woke up this morning, didn't you?", to which Ferris coyly replies, "Me? Na." (Thanks to Scott Murray of "Senses of Cinema" for first planting this idea in my head).I haven't mentioned Cameron (Alan Ruck) yet, but he's the most important character. Whereas Ferris remains his usual glossy self throughout (whoever that may be), the uptight and neglected Cameron learns to stand up for yourself, particularly towards his cold (and appropriately absent) father. There's one particularly striking sequence in the Chicago Museum of Art, in which Cameron studies Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte," fixating so closely on the image of a mother and child that the child's face becomes indistinguishable amid the texture of the canvas. Is this a deconstructionist hint, referencing the artistic medium in the same way that Ferris' fourth-wall breaking does so? Or does it have the opposite intent? The more we look into it, the less truth we see. So just have a fun day, damn it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immensely likable and fun comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I like this film, I actually consider Planes, Trains and Automobiles John Hughes' best film. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is immensely fun and likable as both a comedy and a film. It is marred slightly by some of the sentimentality, but the story is engaging and the script is smart and funny. Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." Good point there. After all, he was the walrus." ? Ferris Bueller After a short monologue on fascism, wisecracking teenager Ferris Bueller dons the hat of a Marxist revolutionary and sets off on his day of adventure. He's conned his principal into letting him stay home from school, conned his parents into thinking he's sick, and, as the day progresses, will have outsmarted a variety of authoritarian figures.Director John Hughes fills the film with discussions on European socialism, voodoo economics and shots of teachers writing the word "prison" on blackboards. The point: life is only worth living if you break free of all imposed structures, diverting your time to friends, art, culture, fine food and knowledge. Bueller thus embodies a kind of unconscious libertarianism, metaphorically opposed to all manners of state intervention. The "state" initially taking the form of "Principal Rooney", a bumbling careerist who exists to keep Ferris on lock-down. "The last thing I need is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls!" Rooney yells. "He jeopardises my ability to effectively govern this student body!" But the film is really about Ferris Bueller's best friend, Cameron Frye, and his relationship with his authoritarian father, Morris Frye, an Orwellian character who "sees everything" despite never actually being seen. In fact, while Ferris Bueller remains a wisecracking trickster throughout the film, it is Cameron who undergoes the Hero's Journey, undergoing a full transformation and slaying his own personal antagonist at the end.Uptight, unhappy and always unwell, Cameron Frye has spent his entire life bottling up his rage and living in fear of his father. His father's house is itself a spotless tomb, everything encased in glass and plastic, nobody allowed to touch anything. Though invisible, Mr Frye's cold and oppressive means of fatherhood are felt throughout the film, weighing down on Cameron like a lead balloon.Mr Frye's presence is symbolized by his prized possession, a red Ferrari GT. The Ferrari, encased in a glass cage, perfectly polished and never used, is representative of everything Mr Frye adores. Mr Frye wants the whole world in glass, imprisoned and always under scrutiny. Ferris, of course, wants to break the Ferrari out of its cage. He wants Cameron to ride the beast.Intentionally or not, the Ferrari also conjures up images of Enzo Ferrari and fascist Italy, its sleek lines, bright red paint and fetishized machinery reminding us of Mussolini, Nazi chic, the SS and their sexy Hugo Boss designer uniforms etc. Fascism's always been aesthetically pleasing; beauty in total control.Regardless, throughout the film various characters spout the line "Save Ferris!" They believe Ferris to be ill and so seek to collect donations to help pay his imaginary hospital bills. The irony, though, is that Ferris organises his entire day off from school precisely because he wishes to "Save Cameron" from the illness caused by his father. But only Cameron can save himself. And unless he breaks free, unless he crashes that Ferrari out of its cage, he will always be "sick", "nauseous" and on the verge of suicide. In other words, the illness is not internal, its external.What's great about the film is the way this "external illness" is then "internalised" by Ferris' sister, Jeanie. Jeanie, because she isn't able to skip school, do as she pleases and con folk like her brother does, resents Ferris and wishes to see him punished. In Lacanian terms, she is the "divided subject", mistakenly believing that some external force is barring her from pleasure. But as Jeanie learns, she is opposed to Ferris' libertarianism for the wrong reasons. She wrongly blames her various familial and social problems on Ferris, instead of facing these problems and attempting to figure out why these conditions exist.So while Cameron's "internal sickness" is "imaginary" and is really the result of external "social antagonists" which he ignores, Jeanie's illness is "internal" and the result of an imaginary "social antagonist" which she invents. Significantly, these complementary characters (who never meet) are the only two people who change or have story arcs in the film. More importantly, their last act realisations are manifested through action, Cameron and Jeanie only "alligning themselves" with Ferris' once they slay Mr Frye and Mr Rooney respectively.This is really just a convoluted way of saying don't blame others (Jeanie) or yourself (Cameron), just identify the real target and kick its ass. If you don't, you'll end up like Cameron (suicidal, blaming one's self) or like Jeanie (bitter, blaming some phantom Other). So be strong, baby, slay your demons and be free like Ferris. Of course this then means that the Mr Rooneys and Mr Fryes of the world become unfortunate scapegoats. Principals, politicians, policemen and parents become the targets for misdirected animosity, a common flaw with all these anti-authoritarian films. In real life, the targets aren't people or figureheads. They're more invisible...elusive.8.5/10 ? Though Ferris has a poster of the obscure band "Cabaret Voltaire" on his bedroom wall (the French philosopher Voltaire being a sort of proto-libertarian), the film really embodies a kind of "ignorant libertarianism", Ferris really not ready to accept the consequences and challenges of true libertarianism. Hughes seems to know this as well, for while Jeanie and Cameron triumph, we get the sad impression that Ferris will head back to school, marry and have a fairly dull life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Successful Movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First order of business, Rest in Peace Mr. John Hughes as of yesterday which was Thursday August 6, 2009. He made some of the greatest coming of age comedies and dramas of all time.Now on to the business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This very successful 80's comedy stars the very entertaining Matthew Broderick. The movie is really just a simply entertaining and excellent concept. Ferris is trying to play his parents for yet another absence this year. He finds himself once again home from school, so he calls up his best friend Cameron and they pick up his girlfriend Sloane from school.Following this Ferris has probably the best day of his life, all with the principal and his sister trying to bring him to justice. Honestly there is no reason to pick out the flaws in this movie, because the movie is just flat out entertaining and funny. So if you want to see a film that will not disappoint then I suggest you check out Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it lives up to its reputation as a classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is what you ideally want a teen movie to be. Its funny and not just simply stupid as most of the teen movies today are.All the characters in this movie are likable and full of humour and wisdom. The story is quite simple as the title suggests. Ferris Bueller{played exceptionally well by Matthew Broderick}, a character no one would hate is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favour. He has a beautiful girlfriend, Sloane {Mia Sara}, and a very paranoid, yet lovable best friend, Cameron {Alan Ruck}. One of the things to notice is that the movie is completely original. Sure the stuff that Ferris pulls off aren't exactly doable but this movie serves as a guidebook for fun.What a sad coincidence that I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and the great John Hughes {director of this and some other nice movies} died the same day...RIP John. But he did leave behind a legacy. This film certainly is a Gem in his crown.One of the best, if not the best comedy out there.Better not miss out this movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dream for kids; a nightmare for adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how you try to put it, this will always be a teen movie, or at least a movie for people under the age of 25 who were recently in high school. It's premise is based on the human urge to go against the system and buck the rules and just have a good time. Practically every kid that feels stuck in the walls of an institution such as high school is going to get these urges, and for all of those kids, Ferris Bueller is their hero. Matthew Broderick brings a warm, innocent charm to the title role as a young man who has luck on his side. Everything goes his way, from worming his best friend (Alan Ruck) into taking his father's rare Ferrari, to warding off the high school principal (Jeffrey Jones) to getting his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school as well.Writer/director John Hughes takes his love for teenagers and school situations and gives us a story that deals with life outside school and the freedoms and privileges of being a kid. What Ferris does is, as they say, getting away with murder, but it is such a joy to watch him get into predicaments and wonder how can he possibly get out of this one. Broderick is a delight, as are the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Grey as his envious sister. This movie is about luck and what that power can do for you. It is also about enjoying life and the power that can do. It is the ultimate skipping school movie and is one of Hughes' best efforts as a writer and director. See it for the story, the funnies or the plain joy of skipping school and catching a glimpse of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a worthwhile movie. High school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Roderick) brings his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) on a trip around Chicago when they're supposed to be in school.My main problem with that movie is the title character, Ferris. He is super popular for some reason, but he doesn't seem to care about how what he does affects other people. However, you just can't help but like him more and more as the movie progresses, probably because of Roderick's acting.What saved this movie for me was Alan Ruck as Cameron. He did a terrific job, and I never would've guessed that he was in his late 20's. I just love the way Cameron and Sloane get along; while Ferris is off singing on a parade float, they are content to stand there chatting without seeming awkward at all.This might not be the best movie in the world, but it is still quality entertainment and in my top 20 favorite movies. Just rent it and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate Ferris, Love the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie in the theatre with my sister, and we cracked up! I just loved the classic "School-Itis" scene in the beginning and the love/hate between Ferris and his sister Jeannie! She knew he was faking but he totally fooled his parents! And then he winks at Jeannie and she gives him one of her hate-filled stares (which she did all through the movie,) and her expressions were just so evocative! She was GREAT in this movie! (And I've always had a thing for JG!) Her classic lines: "I KNEW IT! OHHHHHH!" when she finds Ferris' dummy under the covers in his bed - "And if you say Ferris Bueller you lose a testicle!" to Charlie Sheen in the police station - "My name is Jeannie but guys call me Shauna" - the same "You don't have to live with the little trouser-snake!"But I have to confess that I really despise Ferris. He thinks he's so funny, but he's nothing but a selfish little boy. He doesn't give a damn about anything but his own pleasure. Just look at the way he treated Cameron. He didn't give a POOP if Cameron was really sick, or if Ed Rooney caught Cameron ditching and he got in trouble for that, or much worse for a phony phone call, or if Cameron's old man beat the s**t out of him for taking the Ferrari, or anything else - he just manipulated and shamed and bullied Cameron until he got what he wanted. Then he burned rubber out of the school parking lot, he took his hands off the wheel a lot while driving, and then he left that priceless car with those two dirt-bags! Then he under-loaded the engine trying to run the speedometer back for 150 miles (which won't work on a Smiths-Jaeger speedometer-it's made to defeat that.) And he called Cameron's Subaru "a piece of s**t." You know, Sloane could do better than Ferris. I really hated the little b@st@ard!Poor Ed Rooney! I liked Grace, though! She was funny, especially her accent. I'm from Minnesota and the Chicago accent is really quite similar, and she did it perfectly. Classic Grace lines: "Sluts, dweebs, jocks, motor-heads, they all love him. He's a Righteous Dude!" (which she pronounced 'doooooooode," which cracked me up!) "Peterson home on Line 2 - and watch your mouth this time!" "Oh, Ed! You sound just like Dirty Harry!" Ed says "Ferris Bueller's behind this, I know it! And now he's got Sloane Peterson involved in it." and she says: "And her grandmother, too." Not to mention how she put down Jeannie when she got a little smart-mouthed.And now we come to Mia Sara... smoking hot is the best way to describe her. Dude, there are all kinds of nude pictures of her on the web and I've downloaded every single one of them. Like Beavis said: "Boingoingoingoingoingoing!!!!" How could a geek like Ferris land a girlfriend like that? Only by being a consummate bull-s**tter... It really cracked me up when the school nurse walked into the classroom and Sloane starts putting on her jacket (which was really ugly, by the way) and grabbing her purse EVEN BEFORE the teacher said anything! She knew!You know, the girl's clothes in the '80s were a lot more modest than the '70s. They looked better. Now - God! It's horrible!Classic Sloane Lines: Ferris says "do you have a kiss for Daddy?" and she says "are you kidding" (TOOOUUUUNNNNGGGGE!) and Ed Rooney is standing up there, just TOTALLY FREAKED OUT! Dude, I damn near died laughing!Bloopers: Every movie has at least one. When the dirt-bags are out seriously abusing the Ferrari, the speedometer they show is NOT the real one from the actual car. Ferris' parents supposedly didn't have the money to buy him a car, but between the synthesizer, the stereo and the computer, there's about $13,000 worth of electronics in his room (Back then, a car (like Jeannie's Fiero) was only about $9,000 (in 1986 prices.)So, it's a really fun movie and it'll go down in history as a classic, but I still say Ferris is a trouser-snake . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charismatic teenager risks it all for one more "sick" day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this came out in 1986, I had no intention of seeing it. There had been too many movies about bratty teenagers for my taste, and there seemed to be no reason to devote a couple of hours to it. Flash forward about ten years, and I finally saw it on one of the premium cable channels. Long story short, at the age of 52, I fell in love with it. I can't count the number of times I've seen it since, and I look forward to enjoying it again. I am particularly fond of Jennifer Grey's work in this; I haven't seen her since in anything that shows her talent as well. (P. S. Of course I own a copy too.) Love it, love it, love it!--arnie113</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "Ferris" wheel of comic greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't decide whether "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is John Hughes's best movie ever. But either way, this one is just great. How can anyone not admire Ferris's (Matthew Broderick) love of life, and then the bad things that befall Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones)? In my opinion, the best scene in the movie is when Ferris sings "Twist and Shout". I felt like I wanted to jump into the movie and start dancing to it. Of course, there's also the econ teacher (Ben Stein) drolly reading "Bueller...Bueller". Some of the stuff that Jeanie (Jennifer Grey, of "Dirty Dancing" fame) did made her one Jeanie to truly dream of.Another really great scene is when Jeanie and Katie (Cindy Pickett) are driving home and Katie is chewing Jeanie out for making a phony phone call and killing a potential business deal, when Ferris runs by and Jeanie stops the car, scattering Katie's papers. Jeanie glares at Ferris, but Katie doesn't even look up. And then Ferris runs away and Jeanie floors the gas pedal, further scattering Katie's papers. How they all kept straight faces I'll never figure out! Anyway, this is truly a comedy classic. It goes to show that John Hughes reached his apex in the mid to late '80s. Why was it that in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads? Also starring Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Edie McClurg, Lyman Ward and Kristy Swanson.In conclusion: OH...YEAH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best High School Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an absolute classic. After watching this movie you kinda say to yourself, 'who wouldn't wanna be Ferris Beuller?' "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" was directed by John Hughes who also directed "The Breakfast Club" which was made the year before. This movie follows a high school senior, Ferris Beuller, who decides to take the day off. He gets his best friend, Carmen and girlfriend, Sloane to join him. It's absolutely impossible not to love Ferris. He's sweet, funny, and can make you have a great time like it or not. This movie is a must-have in any DVD collection. And every time you watch it, it's just as fun as seeing it the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick plays a kid who goes to high school and decides to take a day off.He plays hookie with his friends Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and enjoys the day in Chicago.There's only one person who can stop the fun and that's the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).And Ferris' sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey).OK, that's two persons.Ferris is a slacker but in his parents' eyes he's a perfect angel.So can Ferris get away with his plan or will he get caught? Ferris Bueller's Day Off is an amazing John Hughes movie from 1986.The movie's twenty years old and yet it seems so fresh.Teens all over the world still love the movie.Oh so young Matthew Broderick shines in the lead.This movie was made for him.Just like the role of Marty McFly was made for Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future one year earlier this one was made for Matthew.All the other actors do a great job too.The young Charlie Sheen can also be seen in the movie as Boy in police station.The movie is filled with terrific scenes.One of the greatest moments is when Ferris gets up and sings Twist and Shout by The Beatles.This movie sends a great message for the kids at school.Everybody should follow Ferris' example and skip school once in a while.Let's all just get out of that class room and have a piece of the world out there.All you need is a good plan.You have to pretend you're sick.You're gonna have to be a good actor so you can fool everybody.It helps if your best friends' father has a Ferrari.It makes it all cooler.I'm kidding of course.You kids should stay at school.I'm graduating tomorrow and I haven't skipped any day of school.And no, I am not a geek.Now a few words about the movie before I finish.This is the king of all high school movies.It's entertaining, it's funny, it's serious in times.It has everything you can ever ask for a teen movie.Another thing to mention about the movie is Ferris' straight to camera monologues he gives.That thing works in this movie.That's some wise stuff he says there.It's a very well written movie.Much more intelligent than teen movies generally.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a movie for all the high school students and those who feel like one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The craftiest skip day ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about high school? The separation between diligent students and lazy students couldn't be more obvious. It's also funny how breaking all the rules is a desperate longing for rebellion and following all the rules is a desperate longing for acceptance. Highschool was surely a funny time.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) was an interesting young chap who wanted to enjoy his life as a youth whilst living in a suburban Illinois neighbourhood. I must say, it is typical behaviour in places where there is no action. Suburbia is a 'manufactured' lifestyle where there is no activity of any sort. Children often feel bored and as a result, they misbehave more often.Ferris is in his senior year and he longs to have fun before he graduates. It may not seem so, but he means well when he drags his scrupulously-natured best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and his sweetly-natured girlfriend, Sloan Peterson (Mia Sara) to 'dance' the day away (so to say). They play along with it and as a result, they unexpectedly had an unforgettable day and a thrill of a lifetime (the ball game, fancy lunch prank, cruising downtown Chicago in a red Ferrari). He cunningly fakes sick in the most technological of ways (even with our advanced 21st century technology, I must say this is more advanced than I could have ever imagined; he must have really planned this). Life is short. We should live every second as if it were our last.Mr Rooney was a successful, suburban secondary school principal who obviously has nothing better to do than to 'catch' Ferris in the act. He was so determined to do so that he went well out of his way to the point where he was only fooling himself. To reinforce authority is one thing, but to 'chase' someone is another.This movie really gets one thinking about how things could have been if he or she followed or broke the rules. Out of all the skip days I have seen, I must say that this is one that could never be easily executed (for those of whom I knew thought they were 'bad' by skipping school by writing false parental notes; that is rather asinine). I rate this film 5* for its originality and creativity.</fullReview>

I laughed at much of it, and the sheer "teen" attitude, which is still very true over here in the UK where I live - I'd know. Rooney was a great character, which added a comical feel to the story, and you have your romance and stupidity as well. The pranks in this film are exactly what you would expect - "Teenful", and provided me with a good laugh.

		<shortDescription>What a day off can do for you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to making films about teenagers, John Hughes is really the only writer and director who can get it right. Some of his incarnations can be very thought provoking like The Breakfast Club. In other cases, they can be downright funny. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is such an example, and manages to be quite inspirational too.Set in Chicago (like all of John Hughes' films), the audience is introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick). Ferris is a teenager who realises life can be complicated. That is why you're never too old (or too young!) to have a day off.He fakes an illness to his parents with "a non-specific symptom", much to the chagrin of his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) who just knows he is faking it. But still, his parents fall for it, hook, line and sinker. They believe their son is an angel who would never lie to them.Once they're gone, then the audience is properly introduced to Ferris Bueller. A hip, trendy, free-wheeling, philosophical spirit who has now been absent from school for a total of nine times in the past semester.One of the nice touches about this film is the way Ferris addresses the audience. He does seem to like to give sermons about how to enjoy life, and some of his observations about life are quite interesting. This derives from his personal philosophy that I must quote:"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it."It is exactly for this reason he wants to take a day off from the monotony of high school. When we actually see some of his lessons, you understand in an instant why.But a day off is no fun on you're own. It is an experience best shared. Ferris wants his best friend Cameron Frye (The superb Alan Ruck) to join him.Cameron is the exact opposite of Ferris. Ferris doesn't worry about anything, and manages to make the impossible possible. Cameron, on the other hand, is a neurotic, paranoid young man who is not in school that day because he genuinely believes he is sick. He is terrified of life, and how it seems to control him.Ferris hopes this day off will help Cameron to reflect and learn to appreciate life instead of running from it. When Ferris (eventually) convinces Cameron to come over to his house, they still have to add one more person into the mix.Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) has been invited along too. In a scheme concocted by Ferris, Cameron calls the school pretending to be Sloane's father. This is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, because his impersonation is so funny it had me in hysterics. It made me wonder if Sloane's father was really like that.Claiming that Sloane's grandmother has passed away, they manage to get one over on the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). He is certain that Ferris is faking his illness, and would like nothing more than to catch him in the act. His purpose in the film is to expose Ferris and failing in every attempt.Once they've got their hands on Cameron's father's Ferrari, a car his dad loves more than life itself (and sadly more than Cameron), Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are ready to go.Once they're in the city, our trio enjoy the sights and sounds. From checking out the Sears building to a baseball game, dining at a fancy restaurant, enjoying modern art, the audience begins to realise this is all for the benefit of Cameron. He's not really enjoying himself, mostly because he's terrified something will happen to the car.Gradually, he does begin to loosen up. Events such as Ferris singing on a parade float help Cameron to do that. That scene is so funny, because the whole crowd join in on Ferris' enthusiasm. It's quite nice as well to see so many people enjoying themselves at once.Cameron eventually manages to bring his perceptions of life into focus. He knows he can't just stand by and let life control him. For too long, he's allowed that to happen. Because his parents have never given him the love and affection he has wanted, and given it to the Ferrari instead, his first act of rebellion is to destroy the car.He is willing to take the blame, because he now wants to be the agent of his own destiny. This is something Ferris has been trying to teach him. Cameron is the real star of the film, and his courage about standing up to his father for wrecking the car is both inspirational and touching.Matthew Broderick is perfect as Ferris Bueller, bringing the boyish charm he is famous for. With people like Jeanie and Rooney against him, and coming out on top, it is hard to dislike him. Although Jeanie learns something from this day too, and becomes a better person for it, like Cameron.This film has a great deal to teach, about how life's moments must be seized, and reflecting on it to make the way for a better future, not only for yourself, but for other people out there like Cameron. It also has a wonderfully surreal touch, that adds a whimsical feeling to the whole enterprise.This is definitely my favourite of John Hughes' teenage films.</fullReview>

This guy could probably turn a trip for a root canal into a picnic. Perfect casting all around - from the oh-so-typical Bueller family to Grace, the school secretary (who has a line on all the school cliques - the dweebs, motorheads, sportos, etc) Didn't everybody have an Ed Rooney in the head office? There is something for everybody on this joyride through Chicago. From the ballpark to the art museum to the parade and everything in between - a day could not have more fun crammed into it. Even those angst-ridden teen characters (Jeannie/Shawna and Cameron) have an upspin in their lives. All in all, a great time was had by all. Bueller....Bueller....Bueller....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun, though ridiculous at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This used to be one of my favorite movies, and I still love watching it, but I can't help but realize more and more flaws in each viewing (which can add to the fun). I understand it's a farce, from a teenager's point of view--and that's why all the adults are such incompetent jerks--but you gotta draw the line somewhere.But all in all, "Ferris Bueller" is not an easy film to resist. It's a wild, energetic ride that will probably even make discerning grown-ups crack a smile. There are some landmark moments, including Ferris singing "Twist and Shout" at a German parade and him driving away with his buddy Cameron's Ferrari with the song "Oh Yeah" pumping in the background. Matthew Broderick gives a spirited performance (probably the one that put him on the map) and you couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Ferris as well as him. The same goes for Alan Ruck as Cameron and Jeffrey Jones as Principal Rooney. Mia Sara is a beautiful choice as Sloane, Ferris's girlfriend. Keep a lookout for Charlie Sheen in a cameo as a drug addict who ends up falling for Ferris's sister, Jeannie. I guess one of the reasons why I love this movie is because I relate to it, in my own way--and I'm sure many others do too. Everyone aspires to be like Ferris--slick, free-spirited and without a care in the world. My best friend is somewhat like Ferris, in a free-spirited sense. And I would compare myself to Cameron. I admit, I am quite cranky and paranoid at times. Cameron doesn't like to throw himself into troublesome situations, like me, mostly because he's under the strict rule of his parents. Now, my parents aren't that strict and they are decent people, which is why I don't try to violate their trust. But there is something inside of me that wants me to break out of this constrictive shell that I seclude myself in, and I am somewhat envious of my best friend for being able to function without that shell, like Cameron is obviosly envious of Ferris without that shell. I believe that everyone either is Ferris or knows a Ferris, and everyone is either Cameron or knows a Cameron. The characters are both exaggerated, but the basis of them are true.There are ridiculous scenes that couldn't help but make me roll my eyes and scream "Yeah, right!" How many times did Ferris almost come face-to-face with his Dad and escaped at the last minute? After Jeannie kicked Principal Rooney in the face, how come she reported that a stranger invaded her house? She knows Rooney from school! When Ferris's Mom went to check on Ferris, how come she didn't actually step inside the bedroom and check on him, even after she remembered back to Rooney mentioning he was absent 9 times? I'm sure any mother, whether her son was sleeping or not, would've went inside to check on him. This is a great fantasy world, but us young people ain't stupid and our parents ain't either. I don't even have overprotective parents, but my parents (well, my mom at least) are like human lie detectors. They have extra-sensitive senses and are basically like psychics. It's like the characters, not the actors, read the script and memorized their cues to become ignorant morons.So if you wanna have fun with this movie, please suspend and suspend and continue to suspend all disbelief. The plot holes are so evident that a 10-year-old can point them out, but trust me--it's still a wild and crazy ride with some good laughs to spare!My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High schooler cons everyone, including us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited until I was well into adulthood to view this film, so I'm decades removed from its target audience of teenagers frustrated with high school. But I have to say that Matthew Broderick's considerable charm in the title role is a smokescreen for a morally questionable story. Ostensibly a light-hearted romp with a "stop and smell the roses" message, this movie is actually about a con man who lies, cheats and steals, and cares about no one but himself. Oh sure, he has a best friend and a girlfriend, but his concern for them is scarcely more convincing than his mock affection for his parents.As an example of how the story dodges its own implications, the uplifting reversal one character experiences because of Ferris's behavior is just talk (and a kick or two); we don't actually *see* the confrontation that would bring the change home. Not that we want to; that would ruin the happy-go-lucky mood.Which is not to say that the movie is a total waste of time. It has many fun moments (the parade scene especially) and enough ingenuity to keep boredom at bay. And Broderick's appeal is undeniable. But if you're like me and do not check your brain at the door just because you're watching "mere entertainment," be prepared for an unpleasant aftertaste.For an interesting counterpoint, check out _Election_, a story with some similar themes, though with Broderick now on the teacher-authority side of the fence. Ferris, is that you in that limo?</fullReview>

It is about a boy bored with school who decides that he is determined to have one last day on the wag before he and his friends finish for good. Despite being totally over the top in many parts you will be able to relate to near enough everything that happens during the first half an hour. Tying to fool your parents by faking illness, The stroppy sister telling them that there's nothing wrong with you while your extra busy parents are in a rush! Best of all, which will strike a chord with everyone is the boring teacher who sends everyone to sleep as he rattles on in a monotone voice!!! Matthew Broderick is excellent in the role he was born for, while I wish they had girls in my school who were are gorgeous as Mia Sara, convincing as his girlfriend. Alan Ruck is brilliant as Ferris' extra nervous hypochondriac best friend Cameron while Jeffrey Jones is a hoot as Buellers Nemesis (The Headmaster at school) The gags speed along just as fast as the kids do in Cameron's dads Priceless Ferrari!!. Comedy like this makes good viewing for everyone and I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

As usual, the film is packed with the Hughesian trademark of subtle, yet clever, jokes, requiring some viewing to grasp. Hughes clearly had a great time with this movie (as did the cast) which adds to the general delight of watching the movie. Add some great performances by Jennifer Grey and Jeffrey Jones (and a killer Ferrari), FBDO is a movie to watch over and over again.

		<shortDescription>Ferris Buellers Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This coming-of-age film focuses on a high school senior named Ferris Bueller, who takes a day off of school by faking an illness. His parents, however, believe he is serious about being sick. Ferris realizes that he will be going off to different colleges with his two best friends, Cameron Frye; a hypochondriac pessimist, and Sloane Peterson; Bueller's significant other/attractive girlfriend.You'll notice Ferris Bueller constantly break the fourth wall throughout the film to explain to the audience his thoughts and techniques in order for us to compare our own life experiences with his. The first one we see in the film is when Ferris gives us pointers on how to fake an illness in three different ways if we choose to play hooky.When we see Ferris Bueller's room, we learn that he likes Simple Minds, as we notice a Simple Minds poster in a few frames throughout the film. He also happens to be a punk, and turns on the television and guess what comes on? Classic old MTV! Before he showers, he blasts "Love Missile F1-11" and even tries to sing part of it while taking a shower. We also hear him share some of his philosophy after his shower and he claims that he thinks "isms" are bad and that people should only believe in themselves. He then quotes John Lennon and compares himself to him due to their mutual beliefs. This leads to Bueller stating that Lennon was meant to be "the walrus" and Bueller, valuing Lennon's philosophy, says that he'd like to be the walrus someday. This is a reference to the Beatles song, in which John sang it.The movie switches scenes between Ferris Bueller enjoying his day off of school and contacting his friends at the same time and Principal Rooney having a dispute with the school's secretary, Grace. Principal Rooney notifies Ferris Bueller's mother that Ferris has had nine absences throughout the second semester. Mrs. Bueller doesn't remember it, for some reason, so Principal Rooney talks to Grace about why Bueller was frequently absent. Grace explains to him that Bueller is a popular student and that he is a good role model to everyone. Despite him being popular, we learn that his sister, Jeanie despises him and thinks he's a phony.Cameron takes the day off school because he is suffering from hypochondria, and Sloane gets to miss school early when a teacher notifies her that her grandfather recently passed away. When Ferris and Cameron are at Bueller's house before they pick up Sloane, Bueller wears a different outfit in order to disguise himself and not get caught by the principal. In other words, Bueller is hiding his actual appearance to avoid getting in trouble with the principal.The trio drive around Chicago in Cameron's father's 1961 Ferrari GT250. Cameron states that his dad loves his Ferrari more than anything else, despite it being an inanimate/unnatural object with no emotion whatsoever. They stop at the Chicago Museum of Art, watch a baseball game at the Wrigley Field and see a parade going on in downtown Chicago. They pretty much just hang out one last time before they go their separate ways when they head off to college.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great teenage movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is an absolute classic of the teenage variety. This was made by John Hughes back in the prime of his career when he was pumping out great movie after great movie with this movie, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science and so on.Ferris, Cameron and Sloane skip school and set out to have an adventure all over the city of Chicago going to Wrigley Field, Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, stock exchange and even to the Von Steuben Day parade.Easily my favorite performance of Matthew Broderick's career where the role is basically made for him. Alan Ruck, Jeffrey Jones, Mia Sara and Jennifer Grey are also great in support.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic American Teen Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's day off is an inspiration to everyone that understands the complexity of high school. Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) is an American Idol to all in this country. Everyone can appreciate the movie magic that is created when he takes of in the red car. The ingenuity of a moving, mechanical sleep dummy gets him started and on the right path to a truly successful day off. The plot is carefully orchestrated with Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as a wise-cracking high school senior from the fictional northern Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois (in reality, Lake Forest, Illinois), who decides to skip school (Lake Forest High School) for a day on the town by pretending to be sick. He convinces his nervous friend, Cameron (Ruck) to take his father's carefully restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California out for a spin, although Cameron's father has so little trust in him that he has memorized the car's mileage. Ferris makes the promise to erase any miles they put on the car by running the car in reverse when they return. Masquerading as her father, Ferris springs his junior girlfriend Sloane (Sara) from school on the premise that her grandmother has died. this is a truly remarkable film. This movie simply cannot be subjected to being graded by the same criteria as any other movie. It is completely original. To attempt to assess the acting in this movie is just stupid and pretentious. I have yet to see a movie that stands out in my collection (which is considerably large) as does this. Whether you are looking for depth or just comedy, which i think this movie achieves with class. Aimed at a younger generation of the time, it's truly surprising how much credit this movie gives to its audience; the esoteric conversations, the humor-in-dialogue-form, and the lack of crudeness is significantly above meant-for-the-average. This movie delivers any message a viewer may wish to find with class such that the movie/characters establish(es) an almost intimate relationship with the audience which must feel flattered by the highly intelligent work of art this movie is. It's a compliment to its viewer. Nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought this movie would have worked better if the Ferris Bueller character was less of an inconsiderate dick. I mean: this is the protagonist you're supposed to root for here, was it so difficult to give him some more redeeming qualities or something? Sure, he's supposed to be a Mahoney-like rebel that fights the system and whatnot, but is the system in this movie really that awful? Oh no, Rooney checks if Ferris is ditching school! That's his job of course, but how dare he actually do it? Apart from that, the movie is just a typical John Hughes film, coming of age and such and such. There are some laughs here and there, but mostly it's about teens trying to cope with growing up. This is done a bit better in "The Breakfast Club" though, that movie has more compelling characters. This one focuses a lot on a rather whiny Alan Ruck, too much I'd say. I do love the tertiary role for Charlie Sheen though, that was classic. Overall I never really felt the full appeal of this movie, though it isn't really bad either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is one heck of a film. It's Super Fun. It's YOUNG. It's Humorous, and It's from the 80'S! Superbly written and directed by the late John Hughes, this teen-flick is simply unmissable.'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is about a Young High-School student having fun. He wants to enjoy and he stands by his statement. This 1-day long story has fascinating characters, that also includes a good-for-nothing antagonist. This young story of a young kid, is filled with charming &amp; hilarious moments.The only hiccup I thought, lied in it's climax. Though not bad, I thought it could've been neater. The late John Hughes truly made memorable cinema in here. He's truly missed! What a talented personality he was! Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography also caught my attention, as it was spot-on.Performance-Wise: Matthew Broderick is excellent as Ferris Bueller. Alan Ruck is outstanding. Mia Sara does a good job, while Jeffrey Jones is magnificent as the antagonist and brings in a host of laughs. Jennifer Grey is extreme likable. Charlie Sheen makes a fine appearance. Edie McClurg leaves a mark. Others support well.On the whole, Go for Ferris Bueller! This one's a Classic! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In every school throughout the country, there are usually two certainties. There is a rules first and policy strict principal and consequently a very popular guy who becomes his Nemesis. There is no written code as to who is the most forceful, but it's easy to discover, if you're either a staff member or a school attending student. This film depicts an average day in the life of Ferris Bueller the most popular boy (Matthew Broderick) in school. Deciding he wants a day off, he convinces his parents Lyman Ward and Jennifer Grey) he is sick, who then advise him to stay home. Thereafter he cajoles his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) to join him. However, the Principal of the school Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is not fooled and plans to catch him ditching. Making matters worse is Ferris's sister (Cindy Pickett) who wants to see him get caught. Charlie Sheen and Ben Stein make brief appearances and add to the overall festive day which sees Ferris breeze through a trip to the city, a visit to a posh restaurant, a museum and an unexpected appearance in a parade to sing Twist and Shout. All in all, a fun day for the audience who is literally taken for a joy ride. Recommended to anyone who thinks they deserve to a day off or just to take on the school principal. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Buellers' Day Off follows three adolescent teens who decide to take the day off school. Ferris Bueller, the executor of the plan, decides to fake an illness in order to trick his parents into taking the day off. Ferris convinces his sick friend, Cameron to also take the day off and bring his fathers Ferrari. As soon as the two unite they form a plan to bail Ferris' girlfriend Sloane out of school. The principal, Ed Rooney, is aware of Ferris' rebellious manner and is hot on Ferris' tail to expose him for wagging school. Fortunately Ferris is always a step ahead of Rooney as he gallivants around the city. Ferris' sister Jeanie, jealous that Ferris is able to get away with ditching school on a regular basis, decides to catch Ferris in the act when she finds out the entire school thinks Ferris has come down with a serious illness. Ferris and his friends throughout the day manage to dine at a prestigious restaurant, attend an art gallery, view a baseball match, and sing at a street parade and other escapades in which he almost encounters his father. Cameron, Ferris' friend, is a neurotic individual who is eventually set over the top after the miles on his fathers Ferrari are raised significantly by the hoodlums in charge of taking care of it throughout the day. Eventually he is set into a catatonic state of mind before the entire car is destroyed set off by his mental angst. Cameron learns a valuable lesson in life following these incidents. Following the days events, it's eventually time to head home. Ferris' sister Jeanie learns not to stick her nose where it doesn't belong and Ed Rooney is in the end outsmarted by Ferris and Jeanie. Ferris achieves his goal of having an enjoyable and fulfilling day. Many genres of music are featured in the film, notable songs are Twist and Shout by The Beatles (lip synched by Ferris at the parade), Oh Yeah by Yellow which is played throughout the film, Star Wars is parodied with the main theme song when the men in charge of the Ferrari accelerate it into the air.Interesting camera shots include: a long shot of Ferris on the top of the float singing at the parade, a mid shot approximately 24 minutes into the film of Ferris and Cameron's feet right before they gaze upon the Ferrari, mid shots of the dull looks on the children's faces in school at the beginning of the film. Hughes took his time when editing. Edited scenes such as Jeanie triple kicking Rooney came out nicely. There is also another scene where Ferris has disguised himself and he kisses Sloane while Rooney is watching. The kiss was in fact brief and because of the editing which switches back to shots of Rooney and the kiss, it is made to appear longer then it is. Other interesting production elements are the fake 1960 Ferrari which in actual fact was worth $350,000 at the time. Insurance for the car to stand still most of the time on a movie set would cost a fortune. Instead they had three cars with fiberglass bodies using the framework of a mustang. One for the stunt was a higher powered vehicle, one which was driven by Ferris and his friends, and one which was just a shell to be driven through the window towards the end of the film. Acting is the film is outstanding at times the characters express more through actions and expressions rather than dialogue. Alan Ruck is able to project his voice in an amusing manner for one particular prank call scene which is exceptional, Mathew Broderick is fantastic in his portrayal of a confident and charismatic young teen and Mia Sara is also strong on performance. Jeffery Jones plays a convincing principal who seems to be more of a villain. Jennifer Grey accurately portrays the jealous and spiteful sister. Overall the acting is excellent and the supporting casts are great. Charlie Sheen's brief cameo appearance as a drug addict is even brilliant.My favorite part of the film would have to be where Ferris takes Sloane and Cameron to the street parade and jumps on board the float and dedicates a lip synched solo to Cameron: "a young boy who thinks he hasn't seen anything good today". Ferris gets everybody dancing in a lively performance of Twist and Shout by the Beatles, with the band. This is my favorite scene because it's quite entertaining and shows just how much Ferris is able to influence those around him. There is a choreographed scene of the crowd dancing which is also quite good. My overall opinion of the film is that it is a highly entertaining film and definitely one of the greatest teen films ever made. Overall the scenes are well put together showing us what one can accomplish in one day with the right mind. The humor in the film works on a scale of different ages which makes this one suitable for the entire family. The acting and shots are definitely strong aspects making the film a highly enjoyable one. I give this film four stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to get into films of the teen genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes at his finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the movies I've seen by John Hughes, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is my favourite out of all of them. It's a great movie for teens everywhere.It starts out when Ferris' mother Katie checks up on him. She sees him in bed and he doesn't look too good. When I see Ferris, I laugh. It's just the way he looks; he looks dead, eyes open. However, he is only pretending, and his sister Jean knows it from the second she sees him. It's odd how Jennifer Grey and Matt Broderick were dating when they filmed this. Of course, the parents buy it, and they leave him to rest and he will miss school for the day. A classic line from Ferris: "They bought it." He then teaches us how to fake the parents out. It's pretty good. At school, the Dean of Students, Mr. Edward Rooney, is suspicious of Ferris' increasing amount of absences from school. He feels as though Ferris is skipping. Well, of course, he's right. Meanwhile, in Ferris' class, the teacher--who I do feel bad for--repeats, "Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?" At that same time, Ferris' best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is actually sick. A line that I still like from there is, "When Cameron was in Egypt's land...let my Cameron go." Eventually, Ferris gets Cameron out of bed. Back at school, Sloan (Mia Sara) is asked to go home after the passing of her grandmother. Rooney thinks that Ferris is behind it. However, he calls on the other line. It turns out that Rooney is talking to Cameron, doing his best impersonation of Sgt. Peterson, Sloan's dad. They pull it off, and they steal Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari GT California. It's something along the lines of that. When they get to school, they pick her up, and drive off into the late morning. Most of the movie takes place in the heart of Chicago, with the 3 of them seeing the sights of the city. Various things include cheating a snooty waiter into thinking Ferris is Abe Froman (The Sausage King of Chicago), and seating them in a restaurant that Ferris' father Tom goes to. They see a museum with some very nice paintings including A Sunday at Grand la Jatte. For those of you who don't know, that's the one that has all those individual dots of pigment. It's really cool; I don't know how that guy did it.In between this, Rooney invades the Bueller home, while Jeanie goes home to prove that Ferris is faking. When she gets there, she thinks Ferris is home when it's really Rooney. Rooney thinks that Jeanie is Ferris, with the 2 of them saying--Jean, then Rooney--"Ferris.." "Bueller.." When they jump for the other, Jean screams and kicks Rooney in the face. Her look is priceless. Her call to the police is funny. "This isn't a phony phone call! There is a intruder, male Caucasian, possibly armed...my name is Bueller...look, it's real nice that you hope that my brother's okay but I am in danger! I am very cute, I am very alone and I am very protective of my body! I do not want it violated or killed, ALRIGHT???!! I need HELP!! SPEAKING IN English????!!!!!! D/CKHEAD!!!!!!!!!" "Excuse me, whoever was in the house is still in the house, I'd like to let you know that I've just called the police, so if you have any brains whatsoever you'll get your @ss out of my house..... I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes."Of course, last but definitely not least, Ferris goes on the float in the parade, first singing 'Danke shen', then 'Twist and Shout' by The Beatles, with a group doing, 'coincidentally', moves from the Thriller music video. It is a very memorable moment, and it would be so cool to do that!! With the last bit of time left for Ferris, they return the Ferrari back to Cam's place, but with the mileage too high, Cameron kicks the car's front because Cam's father loves the car more than he loves Cameron. When he leans on it, it drives backwards since they still had it in reverse to bring back the mileage, it smashes into the glass wall behind it, falls, and lands on the ground. Cam had "killed the car," as Ferris stated. Cameron accepts this, and says he'll deal with his dad.With 5 minutes left, Ferris kisses Sloan, who says, "He's going to marry me," and Ferris runs off home to beat his dad, mom, and sister. As the race gets more intense, Ferris runs to the back but gets caught by Rooney. However, Jeanie saves him, and lets him get back in bed. Jeanie throws Mr. Rooney's wallet that fell onto the floor into the mud. Ferris manages to get into bed as though nothing had happened just in time. When Katie and Tom check on him, they still think that he's still sick. The movie ends with Ferris saying as he said before in the beginning, "Yep. I said it before and I'll say it again... Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around, you could miss it."Good words to go by. The movie is lots of fun. Clever one that Ferris is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I missed something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But this film never struck me as funny, witty, inspiring or just simply irreverent. The smug smirky Ferris seems to have the entire world and all the adults that populate it figured out, really at 17 I'd like to think I did to, but reality said different. His attitude toward life is to get the most out of it, an admirable quality except that his methodology to achieve his end involves shameless manipulation of his friend Cameron and of course Cameron's father Ferrari California Spider, which he just has to have for his day off, reasoning that if Cameron's dad hadn't wanted the car taken he should have locked it in the garage. The logic here is that I'm not responsible for taking the car your irresponsible for not locking it up, therefore I'm blameless. OK never mind that this car sells for about 2 to 3 million dollars on the auction market when they ever come up, the fact that it gets wrecked at the end of movie is just a crime. Of course there's Ferris, once the deed is done shifting the blame and onus onto his friend for what happened. Is as if to say "Ok I had my fun, now you take the consequences" Maybe I love cars too much or was just imbued with a stronger moral code as kid, but I find the whole smarmy Ferris a bit much to take, friends are merely there for his pleasure and the minute that pleasure is done so are they. Look down at the Ferrari for proof of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trying to explain the true glory of Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a tough thing to do. It's not a big thought provoking masterpiece made on a shoestring nor is it an ensemble piece featuring the best of the worlds acting talent. It's just an 80's teen movie featuring a cast of 'B'-list talent and a good idea. What would you do if you had one day in which anything was possible. In which ignoring the rules and regulations that bind the rest of us poor mortals was all part of the fun. It's one of those movies you see when you're a kid and you wish so much that you could do the same thing, take a Ferrari, your girlfriend, best mate and a wad of cash and enjoy all the guilty pursuits you can in one day. It's the perfect fantasy movie and demands constant screenings in order to fully appreciate its brilliance, its glorious simplicity. And the characters are a joy to behold, the carefree Ferris, uptight Principal, tightly wound sister and friend and completely ignorant parents. After seeing it you'll wish your school days were so much fun and the ending is surprisingly touching. You just know that's not the last stunt Ferris will pull and you can't wait for the surely forthcoming sequel. Please John???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very possible that Ferris Bueller is the type of movie I had to have seen in my teens to really have any feelings for. As it is, having just seen it, I'm not that impressed. Broderick made for a poor lead; I didn't feel any of the charisma other reviewers talked about. Jeffrey Jones was a very unconvincing villain. Alan Ruck and Jennifer Grey were the only cast members who were really effective, in my opinion (in addition to a lovely little cameo from Charlie Sheen.It does have its moments; John Hughes only ever did one genre, but he clearly knew his way around it. There are some good scenes here that are probably the origin of its cult status. But if this movie wasn't a part of your childhood, you probably won't get a big kick out of them. In other words - I recommend it only for people who have already seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember this movie when I was in my first year in college, People billed it as a classic and it certainly made Matthew Broderick a star. The problem that I have with this movie is that I have a resentment for smart-alec know it all kids who make adults look like one-dimensional airheads, making the kid out to be some sort of hero for skipping school, slacking off, and pushing people into uncomfortable situations. The audience thinks that the "Know it all" is the greatest, coolest, most wonderful person in the whole world. But in reality, Ferris Bueller is a character with an attitude. Give Matthew credit for playing him brilliantly, but if you are like me and a "character type" person rubs you the wrong way, you won't think this movie is as great as so many make it out to be.We all know the story: Ferris Bueller is a typical high-school slacker who wants to take the day off, so he cons his RIDICULOUSLY gullible parents into believing that he is sick, calls his best friend Cameron over, talks poor Cameron out of stealing his father's Ferrari out of the garage, picks up his girlfriend Sloane by disguising himself as her father in a phone conversation, conning the Dean of Students Mr. Ed Rooney into believing that her grandmother has passed away so that he can get her out of class disguised as her "Dad" driving Cameron's Dad's classic car.He acts like a jerk in a classy restaurant to a Matre'D, pulls a few strings to get an expensive lunch, goes to an art museum, and a baseball game, while always able to elude Mr. Rooney and his parents.It's the typical teen comedy movie where you root for the teen because he's able to get away with crap, while the parents and school administrators can't catch him. It's too bad that the adults are made to look so superficial in this movie, because some do a good job such as the zany school secretary, some funny lines by the Dean of Students Mr. Rooney, and Ben Stein as an economics teacher, (Who's lecture, other than the roll call, was improvised because he had a Master's Degree in economics and John Hughes the director liked the idea.) Maybe it's because I have grown out of the teen years, might be another reason why I can't give this movie a higher review. I think people in their teen-early adult years might like it better.</fullReview>

His principal knows that he's faking the sickness, he just can't prove it.His sister meets . . . someone at a police station. I'm not sure what she did to get arrested, but she and Ferris didn't really get along before.This is a great comedy.

		<fullReview>More than twenty years after its release "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is something of a cult classic. Simply put, it's the story of one young man's struggle to take it easy.The title character is played by Matthew Broderick and, for me, that's where the problems start. I'm not a Broderick fan at the best of times and here it's twice as bad since he's playing a character that I find it very difficult to like. I blame John Hughes's script for giving little or no justification of why Ferris is almost universally liked.Ferris's pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) is a little more engaging but his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) serves no discernible function other than that of eye-candy. Easily the best effort in the acting department comes from Jeffrey Jones who gives an iconic performance as the dean who's out to get Ferris.Considering these characters, the story is unsurprisingly slight. The trio basically drive around town in a Ferrari and supposedly live life to its fullest, though in actuality doing little of consequence. Adding just a smidgen of depth to the proceedings is the introduction of a crisis that will force Cameron to decide if he'll finally start standing up to his father.The direction by John Hughes (who was also the screenwriter) is well handled though not particularly remarkable. The soundtrack is a typical 80's melange, complete with Yello's soon-to-be-cliché "Oh Yeah". I would say that the production values are solid but they're not going to turn the tide if you can't connect with the characters.If you have fond memories of this film then I doubt that they'll be dashed by seeing it again but if you didn't see it back in the 80's then I wouldn't really recommend seeing it now.</fullReview>

He is a master of skipping classes and very popular not only in his school, but in his city.

This makes the school's director,Ed Rooney, stay mad, and he wants to prove that Ferris is lying for his parents no matter what.

		<fullReview>'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is known as one of the great comedies of the 80s. And I was urged to watch it by the teenager in my life. Oh dear. The movie's premise is the title - the character of Ferris (played by a young and cute Matthew Broderick) being a liar who convinces other friends, via lies, to spend a day off with him. He fills the day with events, convincing a friend to steal his father's prized Porsch and another to say her grandmother is dead. He bulldozes his sister, his parents, school staff and his friends. I found him obnoxious and dishonest to the extreme of not liking the main character at all - thus I was in trouble in the first ten minutes of the film.To add to this turmoil, there is a caricature of a principal, Mr. Rooney, who endeavours to track down Ferris. Mr. Rooney winds up in extreme slapstick situations, quite unfunny to this viewer and far too frequently I was reminded of that awfulness "Home Alone", in fact a lot of the scenes are similar, complicated gadgets rigged up at the last minute to foil the "bad guy", in this case the school principal doing an extreme form of his job.Nothing really makes sense. Jennifer Grey does a lot with her role as Ferris' sister as does Ferris' best friend. I guess confronting and beating authority is funny when you're say, twelve, but there's not much of a story for anyone in the other demographics of the movie watching public.3 out of 10, some of the music was really good, some scenes are quite striking, but not enough to carry the whole mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The McDonalds Hamburger of John Hughes films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, it's popular- but is there any nutritional value? I think not. In one of his most successful teen movies, Hughes follows the unbearably cutesy antics of Ferris Beuller- well, I won't give away the plot such as it is. He ditches school, okay? But Matthew Broderick prances through the role as though Ferris were a queen waltzing through Chelsea, so full of himself that it's hard to watch and hard to turn away. Thankfully the supporting roles are actually real people. Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones provide great comedy based in reality, and the sound track is terrific.As Mr. Hughes films progress, either because he had more money to make them or because his taste improved- the music gets better and better.Actually, so does the film making. He's assured and bold as a director in this film, I just couldn't stand the lead character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haha it's funny being a rebel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film teaches kids that it's cool to be a rebellious icon. In the tradition of James Dean, Ferris Bueller doesn't obey anyone. He is a rebel without a cause. There's only one problem -- James Dean died because he didn't listen to anyone. The reality that Hughes does NOT portray in "Bueller" is that of a 30-something construction worker, 150 pounds overweight, packing in the beers on a nightly basis, living in a trailer park dump with a wife and twenty kids.That's where Ferris Bueller would wind up in twenty years. But Hughes doesn't show that. He betrays his audience.Plus, the movie isn't even good. It switches from a stupid comedy to a serious retrospective comment on the meaning of life towards the end. No offense but I'd rather take advice from someone who can actually relate to the adult world, thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking a day off with Ferris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick's breakout role about a bright schemer who will do anything to take a day off school. When John Huges say down to write the screenplay you could tell a lot of his heart and soul went into the role from the choreography, the locations and the enchanting characters he created.Ferris and Cameron's friendship brought out the chemistry in both actors as they play fight, taunt and reveal little secrets from childhood. Mia looked stunning as the "IT" girl of the 80a who's cool, hip and the girlfriend to our lead.They are my favorite trio to ever grace the screen and play off each other making the relationships believable.The breaking of the fourth wall for Ferris to address the audience added a lot of depth to a character who would otherwise be a stereotypical slacker. I haven't been this engaged since the rocky horror picture show.Two characters who deserve recognition are Ed Rooney and Jeannie both wanting to take the lead down. The lengths a high school principal would go lead to hilarious shenanigans and situations that leave you smiling for days. Jeannie had such deadpan wit and attitude that was memorizing.John Huges deserves an A for originality and wonderful characters to explore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten stars for "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before all the slapstick, before re-writing "Home Alone" umpteen times and before selling his soul to "Disney Pictures Inc.", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst. He wrote eloquently of it in "Sixteen Candles", "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty in Pink". And with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hooky and Ferris' own sister (Grey, PR-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the "trouser-snake". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dyslectic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s tendon at its best? Seize this "Day"!Ten stars for "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that will lift your spirits every time. A real feel good movie, it delivers with a great story and first rate comedy. The film itself is funny and entertaining to watch from start to finish, with some scenes that feature a lovely Ferrari 250 GT California, which does get the attention of Ferris, who wants to take the Ferrari out for a spin.While it may be difficult to watch Ferris Bueller run up slides and jump on trampolines all to get home with a serious eye, one must admit that when one looks back at school, some things are like that, even if only in your mind. The movie has very funny jokes and slapstick. The parade downtown with Ferris on the float singing "Twist And Shout" is a showstopper, and a memorable cinema scene. Broderick is good. He brings Ferris' cocky charm to life and makes it real. Grey is perfect as the sister from hell. Overall, this is a great, funny, poignant movie, a tribute to living, instead of getting caught up in life.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic 80s comedy that never gets old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What John Hughes brought to Hollywood in the 1980s was some classic teen comedies that went on by cult classics and brought inspiration to many other teen flicks. Hughes was a director that brought a new generation to the coming-of-age genre, and with films like 'Sixteen Candles, 'Weird Science', and his most famous 'The Breakfast Club', comedies that many teenagers today are sadly missing out on, as Hollywood has declined more and more with original comedies. In recent years, the teen comedy genre has been gradually losing its vibe with movies depraved of originality. This comedy directed by John Hughes, is one that stands high on the pinnacle of teen films. Matthew Broderick plays Ferris Bueller, a popular Chicago high school senior who's been known playing hooky from school by faking medical illnesses, unlike his sister Jeanie (played by Jennifer Grey) who's grown frustrated for being unsuccessful with ditching school without getting caught. On another day of skipping school, Bueller calls his reluctant best friend Cameron (played by Alan Ruck) and his underclassmen girlfriend Sloane (played by Mia Sara) to ditch school and join him on an adventure through the streets of downtown Chicago for a day of fun in Cameron's dad's 1961 Ferrari GT. Their truancy however, gains the attention of the school principal Ed Rooney (played by Jeffrey Jones) who's tried desperately to catch Bueller skipping school throughout the year, and goes the hunt for him, Sloane, and Cameron as they tour through Chicago on their day off.Ferris Bueller is definitely the role that defined Matthew Broderick's career, at least my opinion. Bueller is the kind of character who is easily likable and fun to watch, and his message about how life moves pretty fast and if you don't stop to look around every once in a while, you could miss it, a message many can relate to. The movie itself is very easy to relate, especially nowadays. When you reaches your senior year of high school, there's a good bet you developed a case of "senioritus" to the point where you might have planned a day to ditch school with your friends and go to the mall, got to the movies, etc. Yes, it is not the smartest decision to make and can handle you into trouble, but it is just the reminder that we were all teenagers at one point. Matthew Broderick brings such delight and charm to the titular character, and he is very funny in most scenes that it keeps viewers entertained and liking him as a character. Alan Ruck who plays his best friend Cameron who struggles to endure their day of fun from the fear of being caught by his hard-nosed father or Bueller's day who happens to be touring around Chicago the same day, is very great in his role and fun to watch, much like Mia Sara who plays Bueller's girlfriend. Every scene these three are in is entertaining, and provide viewers with some of the most quotable lines ever delivered in a comedy, as well as beautiful imagery of downtown Chicago and a nostalgic 80s soundtrack. And then there Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney, the sneaky principal has nothing better on his agenda than to catch Bueller skipping school and hold him back for another senior year. He provides some good comedic relief as we watch him involved in his unexpected shenanigans that make his day a living (and funny) hell. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is classic 80s comedy that certainly holds up today and something that everyone should watch, especially the teenagers who have yet to explore the 80s era of Hollywood. This movie is easily one of the most memorable movies of its decade, and quite quotable for many. If there is a friend you know who hasn't seen this, I strongly encourage you to make this a recommendation for him or her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie after a test in high school (believe it or not), and this what I call a classic movie. I will admit it does get slow at times, but the Ferris Bueller character has to have almost every teen's dream come true. First he fakes being sick to stay home, then takes his friends out on a wild cruse through the city using a car he practically swipes from his friend's rich father.The only part I didn't care much for is that it gets a little slow in the middle with his sister coming home and the principle breaking into the house. It was also rather unbelievable when he tries to take the car's mileage out running the car in reverse, and accidentally breaks it through the window. But the movie does pick up at the end, when he goes running back to his house and fools his family again, all hot and sweaty (from his run), the family thinks he's still got a fever and sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes funny, sometimes obnoxious, and sometimes just puzzling, "Bueller" is a transitional work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller" has its moments, and most of the best ones are of its own making. The much greater number of moments that don't work are a mix of atonal original content and otiose memes of better films.Almost immediately, Ferris sets the movie outside the bounds of realism by talking to the camera. The technique suits Matthew Broderick's characteristic sense of detachment from the process of acting, his ability to exist on screen without seeming to even try to act but without seeming at all natural either. The cold eyes and feces- eating grin that accompany his verbal asides, though, give the impression that something more is going on in the film than whimsy. There is a darkness?not exactly a darkness, but a kind of menacing quality to the movie, as though it were a prank, and the audience is forever suspended in the instant of dawning horror and appreciation. It as as if John Hughes and a real-life Ferris Bueller are out joyriding in our cars while we are trying to figure out what we are watching, and realizing that it is both a joke for us and a joke on us.The laugh-out-loud bits are played fairly straight. Ben Stein's steady drone in front of catatonic students. Charlie Sheen's cameo in which "drugs" is an inevitable but perfectly-timed punchline. The cheery profanity of a seemingly old-fashioned school secretary. A glorious song and dance number in the middle of the movie fills the streets of Chicago with color, and the spectacle seems as rich with directorial intent as it is with pure exuberance. John Hughes' placement of WASP city fathers on one side of the street, the ethnic European element of the city in the center, and the black community on the other side is undoubtedly conscious, and is appropriate for Chicago. There is probably no attempt at a social message here; it is part of the movie's non-judgmental celebration of the Windy City, and to portray the city as integrated would have been false.A gawking fixation on Chicago adds to the sense that there is a movie going on beneath the movie, because there is no way that a kid like Ferris would choose this itinerary for his dream day. The Sears Tower? It's only for tourists. The Art Institute and its collection of 19th and 20th century masterpieces? Please. A black tie restaurant? I'd expect a real teenager to prefer deep-dish pizza and brats. Maybe the secret to understanding Ferris is that he's having the dream day that adults wish they had had, but only if they had known then what they know now.But if Ferris is such a figure of fantasy, and so above the movie, why does Hughes burden him and his friends with the serious suburban anxieties that some people decades later derisively dub "affluenza"? Hughes had covered that ground very well in "The Breakfast Club," a film whose kids are much more real. In this movie, with its cultivated sense of superiority and apathy, the periodic downshift produces whiplash and slows the pace to an intolerable crawl. Alan Ruck is a good actor, but his best friend character is designed to be a drag and succeeds at it better than intended. Mia Sara's idealized, sexualized girlfriend character is a drag, too, because she has so much less mold-breaking individuality than Ally Sheedy and Molly Ringwold had brought to their earlier collaborations with John Hughes and Matthew Broderick.Yet "Ferris Bueller" prefigures 21st-century entertainment in a way that the thoroughly dated brat pack films do not. Its use of antihumor, wherein a joke is held in abeyance for a long time while anticipation builds, and in which the big payoff is often understated, paved the way for postmodern high school comedies like "Napoleon Dynamite." This approach to humor is best exemplified by the additional content that plays during the movie's closing credits. Such stingers are rarely seen before "Ferris Bueller" but became a staple of the genre afterward. Instead of using 80s hits, the movie's musical cues are more timeless, like John Lennon and the theme from "Star Wars." Frequently, though, its pop culture references feel arbitrary and meaningless. Why bring "Alien" or Wayne Newton into this? They're drawn from a hat, like a "Family Guy" joke or an internet gif. The uneven "Ferris Bueller" is sometimes funny, sometimes obnoxious, and sometimes just puzzling.</fullReview>

It has enough believability for you to love the characters, and enough heart for you to sympathize with them. The comedy is sometimes subtle and crispy, sometimes so quirky and over the top that you just let it slide and enjoy it. I love the clueless parents and the whole late 80's vibe.

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is definitely my favorite high school movie ever. First of all, this movie takes place in Chicago which is my favorite city. I like the 4th wall breaks in the movie and I like the characters. The first time I saw this movie I was about 6 years old at my grandparents house and I was watching this movie with my cousin. Daniel who was 5 years old. Daniel and I both loved everything about the movie, but a few of our favorite parts were the beginning (the fourth wall break) and the parade scene when Ferris Beuler sang "Twist and Shout" by the Everly Brothers and later covered by my favorite band, The Beatles. There's one quote in this movie that Daniel and I will remember forever and that quote is "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is over-rated and uneven. I'm not even sure why it works, but it does. I think Reese was cast just for eye-candy, and I think the movie should have, instead, focused on the interaction between Ferris and Cameron: What does Ferris have to offer Cameron? Is it possible that Cameron has something of value for Ferris to learn? Because of Bueller's smug attitude, even toward his best friend, the manipulation disguised as "liberation" he offers Cameron comes to a destructive, suicidal head as Cameron acknowledges the lie he is living and seeks escape from both his unfeeling father and Bueller. There are some funny moments in the movie, don't get me wrong. Broderick also has charm and stage-presence. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially the High school administration members. Jennifer Grey is a fine actress and Charlie Sheen's cameo is memorable. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the main character gives us a somewhat potent illustration of the lesson many of us need to un-learn: How to project an illusion. As a testament to Cameron's character, he survived the "friendship", and hopefully, there-after, demanded a new level of authenticity from his social contacts.Even with Ferris's falsity and smugness, his manipulation and shallowness, we all find ourselves rooting for him during the movie; (even at the absurd, surreal end scene where the entire city is gathered at an indescript "parade", with Bueller doing an impromptu, amplified lip-synch to a rock n roll song. Screw the fact that he might have just ruined his only friend's life: He wants to be the center of attention and adulation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Ferris Bueller World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller is probably the worst friend, brother, and certainly the most popular kid in the state of Chicago. From the very opening image of the film he exhibits the pretty boy, handed- everything-on-a-silver-platter attitude you'd see from the bustiest blond in your own high school. But as much as you can try to hate him, everyone else loves him. I probably wouldn't have been in Ferris's entourage if we went to high school together, but I'd likely revel at the chance to hang out and try to steal Mia Sara from him (probably to no avail). The choice of name (Ferris, as in Ferris wheel) is symbolic of this arcade-like world of Chicago, where everything plays under Ferris's rules (like carnival or casino odds). Ferris even takes over the conventions of the cinema world by breaking the fourth wall. He kinda breaks bro-code too in the film's most emotional driven side-story. The most entertaining side-story is the Tom &amp; Jerry chase between Ferris and the principal. Mr. Rooney is everyone's imagination running wild, while sitting and being "justly" punished in the principal's office. We feel their punishments are cruel and sometimes unique to us, and we all dream that someday we can have our own German Shepherd give them hell. Contrary to traditional Hollywood film and storytelling, Ferris Bueller faces little to no drama on his day-off. He does every fun thing under the sun- till dinner time, so no booze and strippers, high school remember- with the apotheosis of high school sweetheart, Sloane Peterson, and a friend willing to lend his daddy's Ferrari because, why would Ferris need a car? Their youth is beautifully captured on this day through Prank calls, visits to Art Museums, Wrigley's Field, and promises to get married. The ambiguity of their "I love you" confessions brought me back to the innocence of my high school days. Jeanie Bueller, Bueller's sister, is the moral figure in the story. She's smarter than everyone else and can see through Bueller's b/s. Actually, Jeanie is "us", the viewer, looking in with the "normal-world" goggles. But the one person who can expose Ferris's 9th absence (because we know Tom usually never gets Jerry) being his sister makes for a clean resolution that even though we may think, here's a guy who got away with everything and learned nothing, we expect Ferris Bueller won't be skipping school anymore. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it" says Ferris (Matthew Broderick). Twice. A wise statement. In the pop 80's, »the decade that made as« (as advertised in National Geographic). An era, where USA was in it's heights (pop culture were exported oversees), materialism was the name of the game (Ferrari GTO, stock market, slow food restaurants), the music was dance/pop/new wave (Ziggy Ziggy Sputnik, Yello,?MTV was the channel, which actually aired music videos), John Hughes made the movie in which everyone around the world could adopt. I remember, that I was in elementary school, when it was in '86 played in our cinemas and it was a huge hit back than. Everybody wanted to be Ferris, skipping school and enjoying freedom in sunny day. Seeing this movie some 25 years later?it brought a lot of memories. At first, i was a little bit skeptic, if I would be still fond of it, but after seeing it, i can only say:« Kudos to John and the cast for making this masterpiece, still watchable and enjoyable some 30 years after«. It's one of that movies, which simply makes you feel good. It hasn't got any weak parts and after watching it, you are sad that is over. As for me, a critical viewer, i rate it 9/10. (It would be 10/10, if they put Micheal J. Fox in it, instead Matthew, but i guess he was too busy with Back to the Future trilogy). Sure, one could argue, that some scenes are highly unlikely and that it hasn't got a depth in the characters (like in »Breakfast club«), but all this is forgotten, when you dive in Ferris world of a free man and watch unforgettable "Twist &amp; Shout" scene.</fullReview>

None of us I think. I mean, it's too much cool stuff to do for just one person, in only one day. But he did, and in the end, we liked it.The characters are perfectly defined: the bad sister, the condescending parents, the evil principal, the shy friend, the pretty girlfriend.They make their roles in a straight line, then in the end, we see Cameron, the best friend, stand up and have a different vision of his life. Maybe the movie is about Cameron and how much he need to work to be a free minded one. Sometimes you need some help from friends to make different things and have a different view of your life. Cameron noticed that, and had the biggest character change.The music, the photography, the sounds and edition were great and flawless. Chicago, the director's city, was well explored and showed on the screen, and how beautiful sunny days Chicago has!I think Ferris took a lot of time to elaborate his plan. Maybe it's really possible for one person to make all that stuff in one day. You just need to exercise (he had 9 absent days!) and put yourself in risk. So, have a good plan, have good friends, improvise when needed and never give up your ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie and a guilty pleasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guilty pleasures continue with this 1986 classic starring Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, and Mia Sara. the story follows a carefree and amazingly lucky high school student named Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as he attempts to give his girlfriend Sloane (Sara) and best friend Cameron (Ruck) the best day ever. To do so he has to get himself and his girlfriend out of school and get Cameron out of bed. From there on its one adventure after another as they head to Chicago in Cameron's father's pristine Ferrari. The trio is out for some fun but they have the principal and Ferris's sister hot on their heels. In the end they'll have the best day ever or get caught trying.This is one of my favorite movies ever. The story line is fun and full of great moments. Jeffrey Jones does a great job playing the principal who always seems to be one step behind Ferris. Additionally Jennifer Grey is amazing as Ferris's sister who can't accept the fact that her brother gets away with so much.The cast is wonderfully put together in a film written and directed by the late great John Hughes. Hughes is responsible for some of the best remembered films of my generation some of which include Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, The Great Outdoors and Mr. Mom. This film has some of those great signature moments that define some of Hughes films. Hughes also makes great use of music in creating one of the most memorable scenes of the film.I would suggest this film to anyone and everyone. If you haven't seen it I would hope you might take the time.Remember this: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." ? Ferris Bueller I give this a 3.7 out of 5 stars. (Remember that this is a guilty pleasure and one of my favorite films.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insightful, comedic masterpiece by the great John Hughes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around every once in a while, you could miss it." Not only is Ferris Bueller's Day Off filled with plenty of insightful messages about life in itself and frankly, how to live a much better one, it is easily John Hughes' magnum opus (although, The Breakfast Club is a close second for me) and a hilarious comedy filled with wonderful performances. It follows high school senior, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) who decides to skip school by faking sick and his parents easily buy into it. Right from the start, the movie breaks the 4th wall and Ferris talks directly to the audience and in my opinion, it is one of the best uses of 4th wall breaking in movies. It allows the audience to get right into the head of Ferris without it feeling forced and allows Ferris to constantly make small facial gestures at the camera throughout the movie in reaction to the things happening around him. He manages to convince his depressed friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to join him and take a spin with Cameron's father's Ferrari. They also do some nice trickery to get Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) out of school to join them. They go out into the city of Chicago in which is John Hughes' love letter to the wonderful city as we see great beautiful shots of it all. Mr. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is the principal of the school and doesn't trust Ferris in anyway, he wants to catch him and prove that he isn't the guy everyone thinks he is. Everyone loves Ferris. He breaks the clichés of high school and is the guy that everyone just adores. Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) is Ferris' sister and also wants to prove he is faking sick and how he is always managing to skip out on school. So, throughout the film, three plot lines are going on. Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane's event filled day in Chicago from lip-synching to "Twist and Shout" by The Beatles or going to a Cubs game. Mr. Rooney trying to catch Ferris. And Jeanie trying to catch Ferris as well. These three plot lines all mesh together perfectly and let the film flow so well, allowing for what is in my opinion, a perfect film. Whether Ferris is saying something extremely insightful or extremely hilarious, Broderick does an amazing job with his performance. It's truly difficult for me to find a single real flaw in this movie. This has been my 2nd viewing of this film as I write this review and it really has quite possibly jumped into my top 10 films of all time. It seems to portray the aspects of high school so well without most of the film even taking place inside of a high school. The pointlessness of much of what you are learning. The boring teachers, the childishness coming from most of the people there (which is summed up fairly well by a single line), amongst other things. If anything, John Hughes gets it. He gets teenagers. Sure, most of his films are truly a more fantasy-esque thing as most of what happens in his films would almost never happen in real life, but that doesn't change the fact that he has such an understanding. He never belittles teenagers, he treats them like real human beings and it shows in all of his films. Ferris Bueller being the best in my opinion. If anything, thank you John Hughes for just getting it. Everyone should live a more Ferris Bueller life?and well, that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) writes and directs this 80's cult comedy with Matthew Broderick in the title role of Ferris Bueller.One of the most energetic, fun and entertaining movies I have ever seen. Matthew Broderick is perfect as cheeky Ferris Bueller, Alan Ruck is brilliant in the role of Cameron Frye who is always ill and worried. Even Charlie Sheen pops up as a teenager on drugs (he likes to stay in character long after filming is done). Ferris Buellers Day Off is one of the funniest most entertaining films I have ever seen and never at any point while watching was I bored. This is one of my favourite movies and definitely in my Top 50. I recommend Ferris Buellers Day Off to everyone. The highlight of the film is the parade scene where Ferris creates the first flash mob.Ferris Buellers Day Off - 8.9/10 and ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Usual Hughes Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mathew Broderick was a good choice to play super-confident high school student Ferris Bueller, who decides one beautiful morning to skip school, and recruits his girlfriend(Mia Sara) and best friend(Alan Ruck) to accompany him on his outing in Chicago. Jeffrey Jones plays the jealous school principal who has it in for Ferris.Surprisingly funny and insightful comedy has a fine cast, and contains many memorable scenes; not your typical teen fare either, since, though Ferris is a wise-guy, he doesn't do anything cruel to anyone, just a bit too free-spirited perhaps(not the worst of faults). Principal Rooney suffers the most, but he brings it all on himself; if he only stayed in the office, and waited it out, he would have caught Ferris in the act of truancy, he did not have to chase him all over the city. He ultimately resembles the John Cleese character Basil Fawlty from "Fawlty Towers" in that regard.Ben Stein(and that whole homeroom sequence) are hilarious and dead-on accurate, as are the ending credits. Occasionally missteps, but mostly works in this bright comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OH YEAH! Ferris Bueller's Day Off is more like Cameron's Day off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly I felt that this was more Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck)'s movie than Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) because nothing about Ferris is a coming of age story character arch. Ferris Bueller just end up being just Ferris Bueller by the end of the film, while Cameron grows as a character. This comedy movie written, produced and directed by John Hughes tells the story of Ferris Bueller who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago, while not getting catch by Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) or Ferris' sarcastic sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) . It's just another day in the life of Ferris Bueller. While, normal fans think that the movie is just that. A simple plot. Others think, the events of the day are really happening in Cameron Frye's mind. Ferris Bueller and even Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) might just be made up in Cameron's mind to feel the void of no- friends. This might be taken serious due to the fact that Cameron is clearly older (Ruck was 29 playing 17) have no girlfriend, lonely, and has a control freak of a father. Ferris is the total opposite of Cameron: he's fun, spontaneous and has a loving family and sexy girlfriend. I don't really like Ferris due to his unrealistic nature. Truly he is unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker without judgment. It's Cameron that is the punching bag of events, taking all the risk. While, Ferris act sick to get out of school, Cameron is sick. This theory explains the more fantastic elements of the film such as the breaking of the fourth wall or unexplained events. For example, the whole city of Chicago rallies around the sick Ferris. This represents Cameron's dejected home life and how he yearns for people to care for him. This might also might represent what Cameron thinks the "popular" kids at school are like. The world revolves around them. Most of the film has Cameron wearing a medical insignia t-shirt. By the end of the film, the medical insignia, is inside out. Perhaps saying he doesn't need the medical help anymore, he has set himself on the path to correcting his life and facing his father. This film might be a comedy, but it's a thinking man comedy. There was the odd scene with Cameron was fixated on the little girl in Georges Seurat's 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' painting. Does it any deeper meaning or just pointless. Cameron might see his life in pointillism, a technique of painting using small dots, hence the zoom in. That's kind of a discouraging thought. Unless, perhaps this was Cameron's mental journey towards understanding. In a way, that really works with this theory. The closer you look at the movie, the more everything looks like abstract blemishes on the fabric of Cameron's mind. When you're just observing the movie without thinking too deeply about it, it's just Ferris and his friends having a day running around Chicago. But the closer you look, the less things appear to be what we're shown. Actually, even before I did notice near the end that Ferris and Cameron had a bit of a role reversal when the car went over the edge. In that scene, Ferris, the always calm confident guy was scared and Cameron stepped up as the calm confident guy. Almost as though there was a momentary persona swap as though Cameron where beginning to reconcile himself, drawing Ferris strengths into himself and offloading his weaknesses into Ferris. Fascinating. Anyway, it's a cute theory, though probably not what John Hughes had in mind. The humor is so funny that it is often parody or use in other movies. The acting from all the cast is spot on. This movie is a tour guide of Chicago as it feature many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower, Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago. I like how Wrigley Field had a Ferris Bueller's Day game in 2011. John Hughes wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount scrapped it. Honestly, that would have made the movie way more interesting than it supposed to have. I love the 1961 Ferrari GT California. I hope to get one, one day to drive around Chicago. Things I didn't like about the film: no character development for Ferris. All fun, but no work ethic. It might be telling kids, it's OK to have fun, it's not like you have to work a little to have that fun. I dig the "Danke Schoen" and "Twist and Shout" songs, just not the over the top parade scene. It felt too cheesy. I did like the 'Oh Yeah' song as well. The soundtrack is amazing. The movie was so popular, it got a short live TV show in 1990's with a then unknown Jennifer Aniston, a 2011's documentary and even an Super Bowl commercial in 2012. Overall: it has the spirit of effortless escapism. Like Ferris Bueller said on his day off, "Find the joy in life, because Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!'" So don't miss out on seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finally saw this movie, and I can't say I thought a whole lot about it. We have a kid who doesn't think much of conventional education, and so he tends to eschew towards seeking knowledge and wisdom his own unique way; i.e. blow off school, homework, and embrace the big world.Yeah, okay. Great. Depending on what you do in life you may need that diploma and high marks, although I've never been asked for my grades on ANY job I've ever applied to. But hey, who knows? That may change, though I doubt it.Reasonalby well shot, cliché dialogue, predictable plot, I can't say I really enjoyed this thing from frame one. Hell, I could have written this script if I was of a mind to. We follow the adventures and misadventures of a teenager who's actually too ready for the world, and is being held back by formal institutions of education. In the end he finds his moment to shine, and we all benefit in the end.I can't tell you how many times since this movie hit the theatres that people kept telling me to go see it. Well, I did. Neat. It's a good movie, but I personally found it predictable to a fault. I guess my life is a little more unique than everyone else's. Oh well.Give it a shot, but odds are you've already seen it. Either way don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off ? The best way to skip school and have fun in the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a teen flick by John Hughes which became a cult movie and is now a classic.Its genius lies in the direct perspective of the teen mind. It's not an exaggerated view in the sense that it is not trashy. It's just a dream day any teen would love to be able to pull off and Ferris the coolest dude everybody wants to know. Great story, well developed characters, and cool dialogs.The only negative things I can say are that I find that Matthew Broderick's acting is sometime a bit off. While it gives his performance a certain flair and a very distinctive flavor, it can be distracting at time. Mia Sara is also part of the those little negative things. She's just not top notch in this film, unlike Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones. She had done better.If you don't mind a trip back to the 80s, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>learn from Ferris, folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was an perfect actor for a movie, it would be Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's day off. All that lovable cheek, and those classic facial expressions, one when looking straight to camera, sometimes before he delivers his insightful and colorful monologues. Ferris, the professional, shows us some tips for successful faking in front of the folks. There's absolutely no way you could hate this guy, unless you were Ferris's sister (Jennifer Grey) who envies him the way he always gets out of stuff, like school, and his award winning performances of a sick kid in bed, his parents taking the bait, where he gets to bludge his way through college. He takes no chances, making sure his operation is foolproof, where all avenues of his little charade, are backed up, if anyone should pay a visit or ring the house. He has a tape equipment, with a synthesizer of sounds, coughs, vomiting, or barfing up a lung. Only the headmaster, Ed Rooney is onto his little show, out to catch him if it's the last thing he does, even if it kills him, which it almost does, on a return bus trip back to school, in tattered garb. What this movie's message is, stands true to a few of Ferris's wise words. Everybody should relax and take a break every so often like a day off work, or in Ferris case, high school, though never as many days as Ferris. Being a wagging student myself, I did relate a bit to it, only I just went on and wagged school, especially in my last year in grade eleven, where I left a week before the end of the second term. Coincidentally, I left a week before this movie hit cinema. In home class, the last two or so months, I was absent almost every day, and my parents never got a call. In fact I was wagging subjects I didn't like and I had an assortment of grades ranging from A's down to E's. And to tell you the truth, I felt much better, liberated, and defiant. How I hated biology. Ferris's best friend, Cameron, worked and stressed to the max, with a real arse...e of a father, although we never see him, is a severe example of someone who needs to decompress, I was myself concerned for him, even though he was just a character. On Ferris's latest day off, he keeps hounding Cameron, to drive over and pick him up for a city trip. Cameron's sick in in bed, though Ferris tells us, it's only in his head, which I believe too. Cameron folds, helping Ferris too in a plan of phoney voices, that involves taking Ferris's girl (Mia Sara) out of school. You'll love how this plays off. So now they have the rest of the day, and how they spend it makes it a fun filled adventure. One scene in particular, that's unforgettable, is in a museum, with Cameron relating to a painting of void, that keeps minifying, where he feels so small. Ferris brazes out, and risks all, jumping up onto a float before live t.v. and sings Twist And Shout. Another potent scene involves Gray at the police station, pouring her troubles onto, a wasted teen, who else but Charlie Sheen, who makes her see with his insightful analogy, that Ferris is not the problem. And just when you think Ferris is about to be caught out, when making like a hare, crossing numerous backyards and jumping fences, in a hasty rush to beat his parents, returning home, guess who saves the day. Highly infectious comedy cult hit of 86, that I've heard favorable mentions from people here and there. One of Hughes's best, again another one with it's share of morals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller Pays Off!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes will be remembered for many teen comedies, but "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" qualifies as the funniest. Matthew Broderick is at his charismatic best in this outlandish saga about a high school rebel. As the eponymous character, Ferris hates to attend classes. In fact, when the film unfolds, Ferris has reached the maximum number of sick days; he has been sick nine days. High School Administrator Edward Rooney watches as the number of days shrinks from nine to two days on his computer. Ferris is an adequate hacker, but then computers were quite as sophisticated back in 1986. The title tells all in this amusing epic about freeloaders. Ferris, his best friend Cameron, and their girlfriend Sloane Peterson cruise into Chicago in Cameron's father's red sports car, a 1960 Ferrari GT California. The logistics of this comedy is how does Ferris pull the wool over everybody's eyes?his parents and the high school?while his friends and he goof off for a day. The suspense builds when Mr. Rooney?like Wiley E. Coyote?tries to catch Ferris in his lies and masquerades. Sure, there are other people who try to pull a fast one on Ferris, but he is just too nimble. This lightweight, frivolous comedy was made in another era when cell phones and other modern day amenities didn't exist. Aside from Ferris, we also watch his sister Jeanie wind up in police station where she meets a druggie (Charlie Sheen) who gets into a conversation with her. The conflict that emerges involves two garage hucksters who steal Cameron's father's car for the day while Ferris and company are cavorting around Chicago, masquerading as wealthy types to get a seat in an upscale restaurant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unusually sprawling, giddy production from John Hughes's most fruitful period as a director. Where his preceding efforts like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were rich, moody tales set almost unanimously in small high schools, Ferris is a plucky, enthusiastic fantasy that breaks free from the confines of an institutional setting and celebrates life outside the walls. Matthew Broderick brings the brash, popular title character to life with an energy that's so infectious it's easy to overlook a few ridiculous twists and turns, and the plot takes full advantage, pushing the envelope as far as it can feasibly get away with. Great comedic timing, an astoundingly deep, versatile cast of characters and the rocketing pace of an out-of-control avalanche help make this a timeless comedy that's aged extremely gracefully. The only sticking point, really, is the totally '80s wardrobe.</fullReview>

Broderick (Wargames) plays Chicago teen, Ferris Bueller who decides to play hooky from school. Ruck (Speed) plays his ill pal, Cameron Frye and Sara (Legend) plays Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson who join him. Jones (Beetlejuice) plays principal, Ed Rooney who learns what Ferris is up to and tries to catch him. Grey (Dirty Dancing) plays Ferris' sister, Jeannie who is jealous of him for being able to fool everyone and get all the attention. Pickett (Hot to Trot) and Ward (Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles) play their parents, Katie &amp; Tom, McGlurg (Back to School) plays Rooney's secretary, Grace and Sheen (Platoon) plays a boy at a police station Jeannie meets.

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rare variety of Hollywood teen farce has aged pretty well since its birth 25 years ago, written and directed by the late John Hughes, it is a witty and awful jolly comedy without any vulgar intention like American PIE franchise and heralds Hughes' later triumph of the astronomically sensational HOME ALONE (1994). At the stage of adolescent rebellion, highschooler Ferris Bueller is against the grain and aptly jostles between his wide-eyed parents and the staidly villainous school principle (safely inside the comedic zone though), he is the paragon from all kinds of aspects (save for his overshadowed sister), so hymning the free spirit under the milieu of 80s, no wonder its evocation and novelty was such a blockbuster during its cinema runs. There are numerous gags in the film, mostly benevolent but virtually diverting, while the narrative also nurses a plausible character development, the contrast between Ferris and his bro Cameron is plausibly enacted, but a graceful and underage exemplary girlfriend Mia Sara has barely her own lines and scenes to show her wisdom other than "just being there prettily". The film's apex achieves when Ferris staggering showcase his dance routine of The Beatle's TWIST AND SHOUT during the parade, Matthew Broderick is unparalleled and glistening in the leading role brought him to an instant stardom elevation. One just cannot help being nostalgic after watching this film since nowadays in the mainstream track, youngsters are pandered and reveled only in raunchy stench of coarseness and crassness, the good ole days are bygone with the premature demise of Mr. Hughes. All the social ethics and aesthetics spin faster than we generally expected, being reminiscent of these timeless cream from time to time is a stroke of luck which is not exclusively in the hands of cinemagoes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Moves Pretty Fast, if you don't stop and look around, you'll probably miss it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess Ferris Bueller's statement "life moves pretty fast; and if you don't stop and look around you will probably miss it" sums up the entire theme of this movie. In fact Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in some circles, has reached the status of being a cult movie. I know that it is a cult movie in my circle of friends, though I don't see it as such. In my opinion it is a okay movie and does deserve to be stated that it is good, but I would not make it a cult movie. I guess when you compare it with real cult movies such as The Blues Brothers, Eraserhead, any Jackie Chan movie, and Edward Scissorhands (okay, it is not really a cult movie, but it is one of my favourites) Ferris Bueller's Day Off can't really compare.Anyway, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is about a final year high school student named Ferris Bueller (surprise, surprise) and guess what? Yes, it is about a day that he takes off from school. But there is a bit more to this movie that that. Ferris Bueller is an idol not only among the people at his school, and not in his home town, but basically everywhere. This idolisation of Ferris Bueller is taken right out of proportion, and in a way he is seen as the champion of everybody. He is the all round nice guy who befriends everybody, but earns himself bitter enemies, and these enemies are his principle and his sister.I guess this movie looks at High School life through the eyes of a teenager. Bueller's ambition is to own a car, and to drive the best car there is, which is his best friend's 1969 Ferarri (which is really the property of his best friend's dad). School is portrayed at a dull and boring place with dull and boring teachers. They are simply automations who tell the students everything, while the students sit there brain dead. This is contrasted with the time that Ferris Bueller is having. He is driving a cool car around the city, and going to expensive restaurants, singing in parades, and catching baseballs at a baseball match, while avoiding his Dad, his principle, and his sister.I guess the thing about this movie is the whole idea of carpe diem. Why worry about school when you are young because one has all of this energy and wants to waste it. Unfortunately when one reaches my age, one has the desire to be going out and making an impact on the world. I lived the Ferris Bueller life when I was younger, but the life got wilder and wilder until it crashed to a halt. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction - the fun that I was having running around creating trouble smashed back on me creating a time a deep depression. Now I am much older and really wish that I did not waste so much of my youth - but in another way I if I did not waste my youth I probably will not be the person that I am today, and I would not have met that lovely lady that I have, as well as the really cool colleague that I have.On the other hand, Ferris Bueller is looking forward and knows that he must go to college to get somewhere, he simply justifies what he does now as taking time out too look at life for it goes so fast now that we will miss it if we are not careful. I guess there is a lot of truth in that because our obsession with making money and getting ahead means that we can miss a lot of the beautiful things such as love and the beauty that the world has to offer. It can also be that we miss the opportunity that God gives us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic about Skiving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In less capable hands than those of Matthew Broderick, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" might have been unbearable. Ferris is self-centered, manipulative, dishonest. He uses his friends and family. He hacks into his school computer. He commits identity fraud. But there is something so darn likable about the way Broderick plays Ferris, we don't hold any of that against him. He comes off as likable as any other literary trickster (more likable than some). One of the charming things Bueller does is break the "fourth wall" and talk directly to the audience, sort of like his own Greek chorus. This way we willingly become co-conspirators in his misdeeds, and share the wonderful feeling that comes with shaking school off for the day and having a good time.At rock bottom, Ferris is just a boy who doesn't want to go to school. And it makes sense. Ferris does not seem to cherish a good education, but he is a whole lot smarter than anyone else, especially his drab teachers (one of whom is played hilariously by Ben Stein). By his talk of college, Ferris is probably making good enough marks, and having to sit through one tedious school day after another is wasting a good mind.After all, one of the things Ferris does is to look at Kandinskys in an art museum. A boy who goes to a museum when he blows off school rather than a brothel should not be forced to grind through boring school days that confine his mind. Oh, he also takes in a Cubs game (the film is set in the Chicago area).But Ferris' cleverness is not appreciated in all quarters. Because everything seems to come so easily for Ferris, his sister (Jennifer Grey) is envious. Knowing Ferris is faking sick, she becomes determined to blow his cover and get him in trouble -- not knowing he has taken off from the suburbs and is in the big city. Ferris is also being stalked by Mister Rooney, the principal (Jeffrey Jones, who turned in a wonderful performance as the emperor in "Amadeus" a couple of years earlier, and who is just as good this time around in a very different part). He has no proof, but he is certain he can catch Ferris Bueller malingering. So obsessive is he -- even though he has Ferris' mother's assurance her son is off sick and not being truant -- one feels Rooney and Bueller have a long history together, and it is not just this one incident that sets him off. Bueller's little games, we sense, have gotten the better of Rooney before.Can Bueller escape detection in truancy with his sister and Rooney both pursuing him? Can he get his friend's father's EXTREMELY rare automobile, which they have taken without permission, back home without a scratch? And will he and his pals get safely back from Chicago before their parents catch them?Loath as I am to bring in personal experiences, I'll admit I am the age of some of the actors in the movie. I was born in the year after Jennifer Grey and the year before Matthew Broderick (I'm also exactly Broderick's height). So even though they are playing teenagers, they were both well into their twenties; I was in grad school the year this film came out. Somehow, I missed it. I probably figured it was another dreary John Hughes "teen angst" flick. I only caught the movie in 2011, twenty-five years after its release; I may be the only fifty year old this movie speaks to. My philosophy in school was the same as Bueller's. And frankly, work for me has been nothing more than an extension of school. I have pulled many "Buellers" in my time without having a name for them -- which I will now regularly apply when I call in sick to have a good time. Since I knew nothing about the movie before seeing it, I was able to enjoy it without knowing what was coming next, and seeing it as fresh as if it had just been released. And I related to it on its most basic level, which I probably would not have had anyone but Broderick gotten the lead role. Otherwise, I'd have written him off as a manipulative little skunk. With Broderick in the lead I can list this among my "feel good" movies.And I think I'll pull a Bueller this Friday!Oh, "skive" is British slang for shirking responsibilities to do something fun. And I won't be going a museum. Whoopee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hollywood version of that "too cool for school" guy that we all knew.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went to public high school,you knew the guy,because every school had that "too cool for school" guy that could do no wrong in the eyes of many and who could charm his way out of just about everything.This film is practically on homage to that guy,whoever he happened to be at your school.I was not that guy.In fact,I was about the furthest thing from him that you can imagine,but that's another matter.Ferris Bueller's Day Off gives that "too cool for school" guy the Hollywood touch,taking him one step beyond anything that that guy that you knew ever could have been.That's what gives it such long lasting appeal and makes it so timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "Ferris Bueller Day Off" is one of the best ever created in motion picture and that's why most people love this film: a teenage in his last year at high school whose major interest is to skip school, have fun, living the life of his dream. The execution of the film is good, almost hits the target of being a great comedy but there's some flaws in there that seems to be unnoticed by audiences in general. This movie is a classic comedy, considered to be John Hughes's best work among his fans, fact in which I respectfully disagree because he stepped outside of his usual humor with this film, and most of the actors who worked with him in other films are not here, and there are moments when you think that this is not a Hughes film. It works? Yes, the movie is funny, the performances are great, the soundtrack is even better, and the technique of Matthew Broderick speaking to the viewer is excellent.What doesn't work quite well in this film is that Ferris (Broderick) is flawless. This guy skip classes, plays the good son tricking his parents, annoying his sister (Jennifer Grey), has lots of fun with his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and his friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and so and so; nothing goes wrong to him, or his confusions always leaves him out of trouble and this kind of perfection left the film without laughs at some sequences, something should have gone bad so that us viewers have something to enjoy, laugh, or say something. He's not the only one with problems: his sister keeps complaining about his actions of fooling everyone and not get caught, she seeks revenge but doesn't do much, and she has the chance she saves him, so here the story became contradictory, no coherence at all.One of the things I enjoy in "Ferris Bueller Day Off" is Alan Ruck, who plays the rich and shy friend and that's something rare, I guess most people get identified with Ferris and his tactics of skipping school. Of course, people will get identified with Ferris rather than Cameron because they like to see something they're not (Ferris) instead of something that they might be (Cameron). But I enjoyed his persona, his nervous breakdown moments, and the most funny moment with him is trying to fool the school principal (Jeffrey Jones), pretending to be Mia Sara's dad. I'm not going to the same path as many other users walked by claiming that the film wasn't realistic and all, but I will expose some things that didn't work and could be better developed here. You might wonder what these three friends will do instead of going to school, and if you pay attention to where they go and what they do you'll notice that it wasn't so funny to be in a comedy. Do you skip school to go to a museum? I don't think so! And for people who doesn't attend classes these characters are too much nice, almost square figures that acquires cultural education by not going to school. At last but not least, the system made by Ferris to fool everybody, pretending he's at home and sick....that just doesn't work, because if you're sick parents will take you to the hospital and then you'll think that is better to go to school then to go to hospital. Believe me, I had better ways to skip classes and no one ever found out.For the ones who never saw it watch it fast because it is a good comedy from one of the most interesting decades ever for films. For the ones who give ten stars to this film make a good revaluation, and see how this film is not that funny as many claim to say, it only gets near. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danke Schoen, Mr. Hughes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was young, I was not allowed to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off in fear I would "get ideas" on how to skip school. Thank God my parents didn't allow me to watch The Boys in the Band or I might get ideas on how to become gay. (Sorry, old reference ? 1970, but Brokeback Mountain wasn't around when I was a child.)Too bad. For me, that is. This movie is as near a comedic masterpiece as one can come upon. Perhaps I would've been a better writer, or told better jokes had I been subjected to such genius.Ferris Bueller, genius? Why, yes. Originality? Check. Jokes that hold up and a script almost 99% timeless? Check. Relevance, drama mixed with comedy, convincing and believable acting? Check, check, check. Wow, that's starting to sound like "Bueller, Bueller, Bueller?"Speaking of which, and this may be just my opinion, but this is one of the most quotable movies, next to Office Space that would come out 13 years following. I, myself, have been single-handedly quoting this movie since I saw it for the first time 20 years ago. And surprisingly, I haven't even seen this movie since then, not once, but I can still quote the film almost verbatim. (Though I got the Kristy Swanson "Um, he's sick?" line mostly right, I sure as heck toned down on how long she rambles. And, I completely blew the "Cubs/Bears" bar line. But then, it was something I probably didn't catch before ? I had no idea the Chicago Bears weren't a baseball team. Ha. I hated sports back then.)And now, watching it for the first time in two decades ? now with critique eyes, I have to make the statement: this is as close to perfect as a comedy, er, make that, any movie, as one can achieve. The only things holding it back from being flawless, well, thing, is probably the pacing, but that's only slightly a problem in the third act and boy things get back on track for the finale.I found myself laughing out loud, rooting for our "heroes," shaking my fist at the evil principal, singing along with the fantastic soundtrack, mourning with Cameron and getting so pumped at the climax, I just wanted to start from the beginning to watch it all over again. These statements are very rare coming from me and gave me a deeper appreciation for this film than I ever have before.If anyone hasn't seen this classic tale of high school rebellion, allow me to elaborate on the synopsis: young Ferris (Broderick) is trying to enjoy every day as if it were his last, and he does this by skipping school and dragging his best friend, Cameron (Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloane (Sara), along with him.This will be his ninth (or second?) absence this senior year of high school so he wants "to make it count." He fools his parents, disturbs his jealous sister, Jeanie (Grey) and irritates his principal, Ed Rooney (Jones) enough to make it his mission to catch Ferris in the act of ditching school.Along the way, kids (and adults alike) root for Ferris to feel better (SEE: the now debunked ska band, Save Ferris), the threesome have zany and close-call adventures in the downtown Chicago area and learn about their lives, future and how to further avoid being caught.Will Ferris get back home so his parents don't realize he faked a sickness to avoid school? Will Cameron deal with his dad who loves his car more than life (or son) itself? Will Sloane get the proposal she desperately wants while dealing with the fake death of her grandmother?If you have not seen this, you MUST. Without (re)watching and reviewing all of late Director Hughes movies, it's tough not to put this absolutely excellent and all-but timeless film in the top 2-3 spots of his films. Oh, and by the way, it's almost timeless?I honestly can't see too many things that would have prevented this from appearing fresh, even after it being released 24 years ago. Caller ID, maybe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off Movie Review"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." Though life may move pretty fast, Director John Hughes's Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one film you don't want to miss. Though this film is nearly 25 years old, it is considered to be a classic amongst teens and enthusiasts of 1980's culture everywhere. A well-developed story, believable acting, and the unique directing insight of John Hughes make this film worthy of a Golden Globe nomination, and a must see for anyone looking for an entertaining blast to the past. The premise of Ferris Bueller's Day Off is simple but something everyone can relate to. Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, (War Games, The Producers) is an 18-year old High School Senior just weeks from graduating who fakes sick to enjoy one of his last days of spring with his best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck, Spin City) and his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara, Birds of Prey) to explore the metropolis of Chicago, IL. Ferris and his friends take a grand tour of Chicago in Cameron's father's extremely rare vintage Ferrari sports car, making appearances at Wrigley Field, The Art Institute of Chicago, and the Sears Tower. While "the sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, and dickheads" (who all adore Bueller) rally support to fight Ferris' rumored life-threatening condition, Principal Rooney, (Jeffery Jones, Amadeus) and his sister, Jeanie, (Jennifer Grey, Red Dawn) do everything in their power to catch Ferris in the act of skipping school. Though Ferris uses his charm, wit, and improvised acting to slip through the grasp of pursuers, the care-free joyride the trio takes turns out to be more than they bargained for. The climax of the film kept me on the edge of my seat, constantly wondering if Ferris would make it through the day without being caught. By the end of the film viewers will feel satisfied with the conclusion, but hungry to hear more about the characters and their futures. Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris Bueller is outstanding. Broderick spent many years sharpening his skills in formal acting training focusing mainly on theater, and his performance reflects that. Ferris is a smart-mouthed, cocky, and daring teenager willing to do anything to encourage others to laugh and have a good time. Like many teenagers, his hobbies include skipping school, killing time with his friends, and praying that one day he will have a car of his own. The iconic "Parade" and "French Restaurant" scenes show off Broderick's ability to be charismatic and commanding in a lead role, separating him from many of the cheesy, over-the-top actors of the 1980's. Though War Games is considered to be Broderick's breakout role, Ferris Bueller's Day Off will be easily remembered as his greatest work. Alan Ruck plays the role of Cameron Frye, Ferris's sickly best friend who worries that a reckless cruise in his father's Ferrari will end in complete disaster. Cameron is arguably the most complex character of the film, as he struggles with depression, conflict with his parents, and disillusionment with the world around him, like many teenagers in the 1980's. Though Ruck was nearly 30 years old when he joined the cast as Cameron, he convincingly plays a teen that is not in control of his own life. As the film progresses, the viewer sympathizes with Cameron, and secretly crosses their fingers that he will recover from the problems he faces. Ruck secured his place in this classic because of his goofy sidekick role, quality acting skills, and his ability to evoke emotion from the actors on screen as well as the viewers. Mia Sara plays the role of Sloane Peterson, Ferris's popular girlfriend. After the boys impersonate Sloane's father to have her released from school, she joins the pair in their adventure around Chicago. Unlike Broderick and Ruck, Sara had little experience in Hollywood, but it hardly shows in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Like Ferris, Sloane loves fun and adventure, and wants to have one last good day with her boyfriend before he graduates. Sara's performance is emotionally genuine and authentic to the mentality of a 1980's teenager, as she was one at the time of the film's production. Though many actresses were auditioned to play the role of Sloane, I feel that Mia Sara was complementary to Broderick and Ruck, making her perfect for the part. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is known as one John Hughes's best films. Hughes wrote and directed this film, as well as the "Brat Pack" classics, Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, and The Breakfast Club. Unlike many movies of that era, Hughes wrote characters that were complex, with desires and problems that many teens to this day can still relate with. The camera style as scene in the rest of his films returns; unique and visually appealing. The sound track features many classic songs of the 1980's, including Bueller's own rendition of The Beatles' "Twist and Shout". As long as there are high school students who are eager to get more out of life than learning from a monotonous economics teacher and gym class this film will remain relevant. Without the unique vision and clever writing skills of John Hughes however, this film may have flopped. Though the era of the 1980's is slowly fading from the conscious of our culture, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is likely to remain as popular as always. The stellar writing and directing of Hughes, a unique story, and a perfectly selected cast make this film a rare gem. I urge everyone who needs a good laugh to skip school and watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a feel good film! This masterpiece is absolutely brilliant! It encapsulates perfectly the feelings of thousands of teens who can only dream of ditching a whole day of school-simply because they don't 'feel' like learning today...I definitely know how it feels: you've had to get up at some silly time in the morning just to attend registration, (*cough* scare small children as you look like a Shaun of the dead extra *cough*); you end up sitting next to some poor child who has an unfortunate bodily odour beast of a problem, and the plan of attempting suicide with a ruler or launching yourself out the window gradually becomes more appealing when your teacher is about as exciting as a pile of mud. Ferris Bueller is a role model to those who's only wish is to live on the edge and take every opportunity that is thrown your way! Everyone should act like Ferris Bueller in some way or another-just to make life that bit more interesting. This film has made me promise myself that I will NEVER become a boring adult with a monotone voice, and that, no matter how old I am, if there's a chance for me to sing whilst on a parade float, I will definitely take that chance! :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Hughes Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A high school senior (Matthew Broderick) uses his ninth sick day to go to Chicago with his best friend and his girlfriend (Mia Sara). The principal (Jeffrey Jones) is more than a little suspicious and spends his day trying to track the boy down... who is going to win this one?This film is a modern classic, and we've all probably seen it a dozen times or more. Is it John Hughes' best film? I think it's a tough call between this and "Breakfast Club", though "Home Alone" may rank up there, too. The whole film is memorable, quotable... almost in such a way that it gets old, but yet you don't turn the channel when it's on television.I would like to thank Hughes for this film for showcasing Chicago. His other films are in the suburbs, but this one really shows off the skyline in a beautiful fashion. New York and Los Angeles get plenty of attention... it's nice to give the Midwest a little bit of love from time to time.Anyway, if nothing else, the film is full of Ferris Bueller wisdom: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." You can skip the television series, though (if you can even find it), unless you're a die-hard Jennifer Aniston fan.</fullReview>

There were different events in the movie in a short amount of time, which was even better because it wasn't boring to watch. I find it amusing how the mom did not even notice the dummy in Ferris' bed...but hey, that would have ruined the whole movie! And another thing that is far-fetched is when Slone kisses Ferris when he is picking her up from school making it so obvious for Rooney to figure everything out.

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's day off is one of my favorite films. Not only that, it's one of my favorite comedies. There are a rare few comedies that actually work now days. I mean, look at The Love Guru, that movie was just awful. But Ferris Bueller is a film that I grew up with and will never grow away from. Ferris Bueller's day off is probably the best teen film ever too. There are some great teen comedies, like Clueless and Mean Girls, But Ferris Bueller is absolutely fantastic. Every character in the film is likable, even the ones that you wouldn't expect to love. Like Jeanie(Jennifer Grey, who gives her best performance to date) and Rooney(Jeffery Jones, who also gives his best performance to date). Of course Matthew Broderick is fantastic Bueller, and i love it when he's on that float. Ferris Bueller's day off is one of the most memorable teen comedies ever. My favorite scene is where Jeanie and Rooney jump out at each other and Jeanie kicks his ass. Ferris Bueller's day off is a classic.The Plot: Ferris Bueller, the funnest teen in the world, decides to take a sick day off. Him and his friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloan join with him. Meanwhile, Principal Rooney and Ferris's sister Jeanie go out of there way to prove that he is skipping school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film as care-free as any day off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick plays the title character in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," a hilarious, congenial and timeless comedy from the 80's teen-flick king John Hughes ("The Breakfast Club," "Sixteen Candles"). When one sees the words "A John Hughes Film," one expects an 80's gem, a pure classic. In the case of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," truer words were never spoken.Despite the fact that he is nearing the end of high school, Ferris will do anything for a day off. This means enlisting the aid of his depressed best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), his too-nice-to-be-true girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and a mint 1961 cherry red Ferrari. Cruising through downtown Chicago, taking in a baseball game, partaking in a parade, inspiring an outlandish dance routine, strolling through an art museum and playing grown-up at a classy French restaurant, Ferris is bound and determined to live it up, partly for himself, and partly for the benefit of his troubled friend. Along the way he must match wits with his principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his bitter sister, Jeannie (Jennifer Gray).Without a doubt, this is Broderick's signature role, the one he will be remembered for. Despite the fact that his character appears mildly psychotic ? throwing caution to the wind one too many times, talking to imaginary people (a.k.a. the audience) ? it's a well-written one that is as likable as it is life-like. If John Hughes was known for one thing, it was creating believable teenagers on film, and Ferris' best friend Cameron is perhaps his best example. Alan Ruck nearly steals the show as the character more people can relate to, but despite his serious tone, never drags down the film and the film never feels too melodramatic for it. The rest of the cast is superb as well. Jeffrey Jones is unforgettable as the mad principal holding a grudge, and even Charlie Sheen manages to sneak it a cameo as a charming junkie.The film is sharply written, brilliantly paced and most importantly: Timeless. The idea of skipping school (or work) is a fantasy we've all indulged in at one time or another. Surprisingly, it has not dated itself too badly either. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is simply a fun film that people from all walks of life can appreciate and which generations of teenagers will relate to many, many years down the line. To put it in a sentence, they sure don't make 'em like they used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller is a righteous dude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The untimely death of John Hughes reminded me that it had been a while since I'd watched this film. I thought it was great when I first watched in back in the eighties and having just watching it again think it has lost none of its charm. While some of the technology seen in the film is old the film itself doesn't seem dated at all.Ferris Bueller is a seventeen year old high school student who has decided to feign illness so that he can take the day off and enjoy himself in the city. He is joined on his escapade by his friend Cameron who is off school because he really is sick and his girlfriend Sloane who gets let out of school when Cameron phones in, claiming to be her father, saying her grandmother has died. They head off to the city in Cameron's father's pride and joy; a 1961 Ferrari 250GT California. Once there they see the sights narrowly avoiding being caught a few times along the way; they probably learn much more than they would have had they stayed in school.While Ferris and his friends are out enjoying their day school principal Ed Rooney is sure that Ferris is faking his illness and he is determined to prove it. The only other person who believes Ferris is faking it is his sister Jeanie who is fed up with how he always seems to get away with everything.This is one of the great eighties teen movies created by the master of the genre, the film is full of memorably scenes that contain lots of classic lines. The actors are all on form, especially Matthew Broderick in the title role and Jeffrey Jones as the principal. I strongly recommend watching this, it is one of those films everybody should watch at least once.</fullReview>

I generally don't write Comments and just rate them,but for this flick,well it was different.This movie isn't your run of the mill teenage comedy stuff like the American Pie series, but actually makes you believe that this genre can also be entertaining without the raunchy humor that typifies such flicks.Ferris is the kind of person that makes it impossible for you not to desire to be his friend. He's fun to hang out with,he can make you get rid of your problems,and if not,take the blame on his shoulder,just as Cameron discovers. If you had a friend like Ferris during your high school years, you should definitely consider yourself very fortunate.Ferris,in his fun trip around Chicago,takes his girlfriend and best friend along and tries to make it special for Cameron,who leads a very mundane life. He tries to relieve him of his fears and as we see towards the end,Cameron learns to stand up for himself.A thoroughly enjoyable movie,and a must see when you get your day off.My Rating, 4 n a 1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hughes' 1986 classic comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off is irresistible. It set the benchmark for teen comedies which few have matched, with its all out fun story.The story is simple enough. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is everybody's favorite guy. He's handsome, cool, funny, fearless, and charming to no end. He has a beautiful girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), and a very paranoid, yet lovable best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck). One day, Ferris wakes up and decides that he doesn't want to go to school, thinking that spending the day in downtown Chicago sounds like a better idea. So Ferris whips up a clever scheme that fools his parents, and drives to pick up Cameron and then Sloane at school. However, 2 people are not fooled: over zealous and crazed school dean Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) and Ferris's sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey...yes the one that dated Matthew Broderick...weird, eh?).The character Ferris Bueller is simply irresistible. Matthew Broderick brings an unprecedented amount of cool to the character that will make him one of the most lovable rebels in film history. Each of our 3 main characters compliments the other. While Ferris has his wild and crazy moments, Mia Sara's character brings out the good guy in him, as they have great on screen chemistry. Alan Ruck is also great. Cameron is the exact opposite of Ferris...paranoid, by the book, afraid of confrontation, and unwelcome to change. But that's what makes them such excellent buddies. Ferris brings out the best in Cameron and vice versa. Jeffrey Jones is great as well, and the film features a priceless cameo from Charlie Sheen that may be his on screen breakout (prior to Platoon, of course). All in all, this movie is a great example of why Broderick and Sheen are as bankable and famous as they are today.John Hughes just knows teenagers and the 1980's. The spirits of both are alive and well here. The music is 80's, as are the characters. But the mark of how great a movie it is and how classic it is is that it can be enjoyed by anyone from any generation. It's a great movie that I'd recommend to everyone. Everybody should see Ferris Bueller's Day Off, because of the wonderfully fun experience it is.10/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off - Should Not Be Skipped!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's simplistic view of faking out his parents is void. It's a lot more difficult than that nowadays, and the only way to get out of high school legitimately is actually being sick.Matthew Broderick is Ferris, with Alan Ruck as his sidekick, Cameron Frye.An interesting story, with a good cast, a kick butt musical number, witty remarks and a whole day of fun, there is no reason for anyone of any age to not love this classic.If you find one thing to despise about this film, point it out to me because I can't find anything to not like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Are You (John Hughes) ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this man, his work, his sense of humor, and his way to say great things by comedy..However I see that the comic scenes here were less than what it should be (or maybe it's just me who waited for more !). Plus in someway I think the real HERO of the movie's drama was (Alan Ruck) as (Cameron Frye) the friend, because he is the only person who changed through the journey of the day/the movie, as he was dying because of his fear to do what he really wants as the opposite of Ferris Bueller, however at the end he became capable of facing his fear to be what he wants, but on the other hand the original hero, or the movie's title character, remained the same till the very end ! The selfsame liar, swindler, who's enjoying the moment without any concern or whatsoever about the future!! But maybe (Hughes) was showing a nice symbol for being loose, released and free just to teach us (as the tidy regular bourgeois) how to loosen a little so not to miss the train of life. The beauty of it is that (Ferris Bueller) and all of his values aren't harmful as his fraud which is so innocent, for instance he didn't run away from school to take drugs or to robe a bank !, he went with his friends to an art museum for god's sake (I tried so many times to do such a visit with my own friends even after the school time.. but I couldn't make them to !) and (Hughes) presented him as that intelligent wicked to the extent that he could beat any future problems especially with the love of the people; he vanquished the principal too many times by his cleverness, having the ultimate victory by his sister's last minute rescue when she finally believed in his crazy deeds and his lively philosophy. Therefore (Bueller) was just a symbol, a lovely mentor more than a guy who would change. Although it's not as strong as being weaker, or suffering from defects sometimes, but (Hughes) by that wasn't only venerating the character itself.. He meant to disclose our frailty and failure compared to such a young man too.I loved the glee childish feeling of the whole movie, the condensation of all the events in less than a daytime, the special appearance of (Charlie Sheen) in a brief yet propitious role, so (Jeffrey Jones) as the poor clumsy principal who looks and walks as dirty Harry !! Also those fresh ideas : the school's contribution for the fake sick Ferris, redress the car's counter by the hard way, the mechanical robot as F.B's clone in bed !. And yes I loved the main personality and the performance of (Matthew Broderick) but I just think that he was more sensitive and less bravery to be (Bueller), of course (Broderick) is a gentle comedian and his acting here is so vivacious but his soft presence was one of some reasons made me think that he wasn't as mad, bold and indifferent as (Ferris Bueller), or maybe not as any (Ferris Bueller) of whom I've met or known.At last you must ask yourself with confusion as well as fury where is that great writer ? and where are his competent comedies ? and how could he let us in the hands of some things like (Dumb and Dumber), (American Pie), (Deuce Bigalow), or (Cheaper by the Dozen), (Are We There Yet) and their sequels, prequels, flooding ? without one decent charm comedy which hasn't the usual tons of toilet humor, and says something that lives longer than a week !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Smash Hit Teen Comedy that became a blessing and curse for its star...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF was the fresh and imaginative teen comedy that followed a smart-aleck high school senior through a series of amusing adventures when he decides to skip school for the day. This comedy was a smash hit at the box office that became an instant classic and made a star out of Matthew Broderick, who is absolute perfection in the title role. Broderick lights up the screen and tackles this role with an effortless charm that is quite engaging and even appears quite comfortable during the moments when Ferris talks directly to the camera. John Hughes' inventive direction is a plus and Broderick is given sterling support from Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney, the principal of Ferris' school who is determined to catch Ferris ditching school, Edie McClurg as Rooney's secretary, Alan Ruck as Ferris' best friend Cameron, Jennifer Grey as Ferris' jealous older sister, and Lyman Hall and Cindy Pickett as Ferris' parents. Yes, the screenplay is a little one-sided...all the adults in the film are made to look like idiots, but if you can accept that, this comic-fantasy adventure is one entertaining roller-coaster ride. The film made a star out of Broderick but he was so good in the film that he became type-cast for years to the point where no one would even think of casting him as an adult, but if you're gonna get typecast, be thankful it was due to a classic like this one. Followed years later by a brief TV series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's day off is an inspiration to everyone that understands the complexity of high school. Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) is an American Idol to all in this country. Everyone can appreciate the movie magic that is created when he takes of in the red car. The ingenuity of a moving, mechanical sleep dummy gets him started and on the right path to a truly successful day off. The plot is carefully orchestrated with Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as a wise-cracking high school senior from the fictional northern Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois (in reality, Lake Forest, Illinois), who decides to skip school (Lake Forest High School) for a day on the town by pretending to be sick. He convinces his nervous friend, Cameron (Ruck) to take his father's carefully restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California out for a spin, although Cameron's father has so little trust in him that he has memorized the car's mileage. Ferris makes the promise to erase any miles they put on the car by running the car in reverse when they return. Masquerading as her father, Ferris springs his junior girlfriend Sloane (Sara) from school on the premise that her grandmother has died. this is a truly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie simply cannot be subjected to being graded by the same criteria as any other movie. It is completely original. To attempt to assess the acting in this movie is just stupid and pretentious. I have yet to see a movie that stands out in my collection (which is considerably large) as does this. Whether you are looking for depth or just comedy, which i think this movie achieves with class. Aimed at a younger generation of the time, it's truly surprising how much credit this movie gives to its audience; the esoteric conversations, the humor-in-dialogue-form, and the lack of crudeness is significantly above meant-for-the-average. This movie delivers any message a viewer may wish to find with class such that the movie/characters establish(es) an almost intimate relationship with the audience which must feel flattered by the highly intelligent work of art this movie is. It's a compliment to its viewer. Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Comedy Film That Is Really Fun To Watch When You Are Not In School(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSWow, that was a lousy summary. Anyway, I had a very fun time watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It is one of the funniest movies ever made and is well, really, funny. When I watched this I felt like ditching school the very next day. I did not, but I felt like it. This movie contains some very famous scenes, like Ferris Bueller's trip back to his house, and the parade scene, and more. I also think that this Matthew Broderick's very best film, and funniest film.Here is the plot. The title pretty much says it all. A popular teenager named Ferris Bueller takes, well, the day off from school with his friend and his girlfriend. He pretends to be sick. Amazingly, his parents do think he is sick. He puts a dummy in his room. He takes a trip into the city of Chicago. The only problem is that his principal and his sister Jeanne do not think he is sick and they both try to prove that he is faking it. By the time he does everything he could possibly do he runs home to his house. His parents never found out that he skipped school.Overall, this is an excellent teenager movie. I also loved the very end of the film when Ferris Bueller asks the audience way they are still bothering him. The movie is over. Also, this is only Ben Stein's second film. He also has a great line, "Bueller? Bueller?" Anyway, anyone that is a fan of comedy would bound to love this film. This is definitely John Hughes's best movie.9/10Recommended Films: The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never gets tired or old,kinda like the characters themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharp-as-a-tack high schooler Ferris Bueller(Matthew Broderick,whose long and successful career since owes itself majoritively to this role over any other)decides on this particular sunny Chicago day that he should take another "sick day" off. His reasoning is simple: he feels that going off to school like a mindless drone when there are other things he'd like to do is a complete and pitiable waste. As he so famously puts it:"Life goes by fast,and if you don't slow down,you'll miss it. So slow down."To this end,he perfects a simple yet elaborate ruse to dupe his parents into having him stay home,much to the seething envy of his sister Jeanie(Jennifer Grey,who will always be Jeanie to me,much the way she's Baby from Dirty DAncing to others)who rarely gets this kind of parental benefit of a doubt. Next,he rounds up his two best friends:dyspeptic,hyper-depressed killjoy Cameron(Alan Ruck,fantastic here!)and his pretty,quiet girl Fallon(Mia Sara,lovely),who as much become party to the ploy as Ferris himself.The three are pretty much in the clear,save the dogged suspicions of the pompous,self-righteous principal(Jeffrey Jones,practically born to play this role it seems!),who goes in pursuit of catching Ferris,whom he's been convinced has been faking it through all of the(so far)nine sick days hes taken. It goes without saying that all three,Ferris,Cameron and Fallon have all done this before,and gotten quite good at it.From there,the tour-de-force(farce?)becomes a rollicking travelogue for the city of Chicago. The fun that is culled from these experiences is nearly surreal,and the time-line that these events(German Day parade,Chicago Cubs game,Art museum,dining at a ritzy four-star)would suggest that they didn't spend too much time in one place,just enough to drink in the experience.Director and co-writer John Hughes was on a colossal roll in 1986 and after dipping into darker material in the previous year's The Breakfast Club,returned to lighter fare here and did it seamlessly. Probably one of the best elements of the movie was the breakdown of the "fourth wall",where Ferris talks to the audience,setting the tempo and giving the story a "persona" that is endearing as well as humorous. This film is a keeper,and despite the datedness of the music,clothes and hairstyles,this film is timeless in its theme and as always enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all-time comedy classic, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" has something for everyone. The witty, scathing character of Ferris will keep anybody amused for one and a half hours.The premise is that the wily high=schooler Ferris Bueller decides that since it's such a beautiful day outside, he'll take a day off school by feigning illness. And despite his performance being "one of his worst", he still succeeds in convincing his parents that he needs rest.Cue lots of antics involving him and his best friend Cameron, involving "borrowing" Cameron's father's Ferrari, going to the top of the Sears Tower and foxing his poor put-upon principal at every turn.The movie is full of fantastic scenes, and is a fantastic movie to sit and watch again and again. It reminds you to either enjoy your youth while you have it, or reminds you what it was like to be young. A truly joyous movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favourite movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I was just finishing high school myself. It was every high school guy's fantasy. Grown men want to be like James Bond, high school guys want to be like Ferris Bueller. He's cool, smart, and in control in every situation. One of the best movie characters ever created.The movie itself was brilliant. There's not a real strong plot, but like Seinfeld, the story is about the characters, their interaction, and the circumstances they find themselves in.This movie really did a great job of bringing together a lot of cool stuff. Maybe not all firsts, but the first time all these things were integrated and accomplished so well. For example, including the audience. Talking to the camera, documentary like sidebars with overlay texts, etc.The directing and cinematography were also excellent and the soundtrack was brilliantly matched to the content. For example the shot of the Ferrari jumping over the railroad tracks in slow-motion to the StarWars theme was brilliant. Also this is first movie I remember to make use of the cool sounds of the band "Yello" in it's sound-track. After FB made such brilliant use of Yello, many movies and TV shows started using them. Especially the cool track "oh yeah" (You know, shhhe-bow bow, cha chigga) See http://www.yello.ch/ to hear what I mean.There's just so many brilliant scenes in this movie, it's as near a 10 as I could vote. If IMDb allowed decimal voting, which I think they should, I'd give it a 9.8.Matthew Broderick is one of the great unsung actors of our time. He's amazing. I just saw him in "The Producers" and am reminded again how good he is. He's a throwback from the days of _real_ entertainers. When they could not only act, but they could do everything. Act, sing, dance, etc.Alan Ruck also put in a memorable performance as Cameron. I loved the "he'll keep calling me" and "Sloan's dad" scenes especially.Jennifer Grey also was great as "Shauna" and her scenes with Charlie Sheen in his cameo were a nice contrast to her angry sister performance.I love the quirky parents performances by Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward. I really love when Tom Bueller is listening to the parade, and when he's behind the old lady in the car.Well, anyway, if you haven't seen this, you don't deserve access to IMDb as you are a movie infidel. This is a must see classic.One of the most entertaining movies ever made, especially if you ever went to high-school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a true classic. I believe it withstands the test of time. Remember when all you wanted was a day off from school? I sat down with my 15-year-old son and it was incredible watching his reactions to the movie. Except for the outdated technology in the film, it's all the same things kids are still trying to get away with today and still wish they could pull off. This movie takes you back to relive those days of carefree fun. Kids growing up in any time period can relate to this. I recommend any parent to be present the first time your kids watches this. Sit back and watch as they enjoy the same scenes you enjoyed at that age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of director John Hughes' best efforts. It captures some of the ethos of the 1980's, as well as the timeless pathos of the passage to adulthood. Matthew Broderick is superb in the title role, mixing the wise guy with the nice guy in the perfect proportions, so well that he may never truly escape from this role. The supporting cast is equally up to the task, with Alan Ruck, Jennifer Grey and Jeffrey Jones especially noteworthy. Charlie Sheen also makes the most of a small role late in the movie. There are an abundance of laughs from beginning to end, and like all of Hughes' films, it also has a heart, and a serious moment or two. This movie has been a part of my collection for many years, and will continue to provide enjoyment for as long as I am able to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could possibly be wrong with this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't understand how anyone that had actually watched this movie could think it was bad! Despite others' belief, Ferris, Sloan, and Cameron are NOT spoiled, especially Cameron. His dad acts like he doesn't exist and only cares about his precious Ferrari. I have watched the movie a few times, and yes, some people may have enjoyed the movie more having watched it in their teen years. Ferris is simply looking for a bit of freedom from school before he graduates. Many high schoolers these days, it seems, would love to leave an impression on their school after leaving it by doing something that everyone would remember, such as what Ferris did. He's not really spoiled, he's parents just aren't the brightest out there, and it's a movie! It's Hollywood! Things are exaggerated! It's meant to be a movie for teens, about teens; it's the kind of thing young people like. I thought it was a hilarious watch with a bit of everything for someone.</fullReview>

Matthew Broderick is definitely a legend at playing his role as a college student who just wants to escape school and have a whole day's fun with a Ferrari alongside with his girl and his best friend. what is very enjoyable are the humorous parts where Ferris has to hide or escape from certain conditions which would ruin his day of fun; along with various humors of his principal Rooney while chasing Ferris. Ferris's role in the film are charming, clever and loud which makes him very suitable in the role. The exaggerations within the last scene definitely puts me off the sit.

		<shortDescription>Likable, very funny teen comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Variety was way off the mark when it stated that Ferris Bueller's Day Off exhibits John Hughes on an off day. This is one of the high points of the teen-comedy genre and probably the best of John Hughes's films (only The Breakfast Club can be considered a rival).Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenager from a rich Chicago family. Adored by the pupils at his school, Ferris is the ultimate Mr. Popular with everyone apart from his spiteful sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) and the school's obsessive principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). One hot summer's day, Ferris feels the urge to skip school so he fools his parents into believing that he has a fever. He then enlists the aid of his depressed buddy Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to plan the ultimate adventure. First, they "borrow" Cameron's father's classic Ferrarri, then they engineer a story to get Ferris's girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school, before heading off to Chicago to live the dream. On their agenda are such excesses as lunch in a swanky restaurant, a visit to Sears Tower, a trip to the baseball stadium, a whistle-stop tour of the museum, an interlude at the stock exchange.... at one point, Ferris even hijacks a parade float and performs a Beatles tune for the adoring crowds! Meanwhile, Ed Rooney spends the entire day attempting to catch Ferris out, proving once and for all that he isn't the dream son his parents believe him to be.What makes Ferris Bueller's Day Off work is the simplicity of the premise and the skillful accumulation of comic moments that are built around it. Jones has a fabulous time in his role as the ever-suffering school principal; Lyman Ward is hilarious as Ferris's gullible, goofy father; Ruck is by turns funny and pitiful as the melancholy Cameron Frye; Grey perfects a bitchy scowl as Ferris's sister; and, if you watch closely, there's a truly outstanding cameo from Charlie Sheen as a streetwise junkie who melts Jeanie's heart. All this is held together by Broderick's good work as the central character. There are some terrific comedy moments, the best of which for me are when Ferris's father gets held up by a car being erratically driven by a 4 ft octogenarian, and the scene where a busty nurse turns up to "cheer-up" the poorly Ferris. Many critics and reviewers have noted the sentimental vein that runs through the film, and it's true that it spoils things slightly, but on the whole this is an irresistible comedy and an absolute must for anyone who enjoys a good teen flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller. The coolest guy in his school, possibly in Chicago. After Ferris (Matthew Broderick) determines that he should have a day off he fakes sick and calls up his odd-ball, morbid friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) to come and pick him up in his fathers Ferrari 250GT California Spyder.After a few phone calls and smart designs, Ferris and Cameron are able to get his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school. Now it is an all out adventure through downtown Chicago: going to a baseball game, singing in a parade, faking names at a restaurant and trying to solve Cameron's state of frozenness after seeing his car has an extra 100 miles on it. All the while Broderick brings the life out of the cool guy we always wanted to be in high school. Always on Ferris' tail is his high school principal,Mr. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) and Ferris' hateful sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) out to get him.The movie is funny and deals with high school life minus the drugs and sex involved in most high school films today. Broderick surprised me after seeing his work in Glory (1989) that he was able to do a comedy like this. This is the ultimate teenager film.Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Starring: Matthew Broderick, Mia Sara, Alan Ruck, Jeffrey Jones, and Jennifer Grey.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the luck to be 17 when I watched this film at the cinema. I didn't know what it was all about before, the movie poster just looked inviting. But I didn't expect to see one of the few movies I'll watch over and over again my whole life!Many fellows have already told enough about the plot, so I can concentrate on my personal impressions. The film is simply about enjoying life and taking a day off sometimes to do just that, no matter what circumstances. Although the 1980s setting may seem a bit dated to some viewers today - as the very American setting is still a bit strange to viewers from other countries - the movie hasn't lost a bit of its actuality. It's pure fun, combined with unexpected twists and turns, a bit of wisdom and a genius cast. Matthew Broderick is in his best role ever, closely followed by his appearance in "War Games", and his teenage looks still make it nearly impossible for me to accept him in any of his later films ("Hey, what's Ferris doing in that movie?").To round it all up, the perfect choice of music makes this movie the outstanding work of director John Hughes, although all his other teenager films are real gems, too!To put it in a nutshell: If you are in your teens, don't ever miss that movie! But be careful, it may seriously affect your whole life!10/10 (and just a handful of movies get that from me!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly wonderful film from the 1980s that brings back fond memories for me and it just becomes even more wonderful every time that I view it. I would consider `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' to be one of the classic movies of the 1980s and probably one of the most profoundly entertaining, enjoyable, hilarious and poignant movies of all time. This movie has everything in it to make it a success ?a wonderful storyline, a strong script, a wonderfully talented array of highly qualified main actors and supporting cast and naturally flowing dialogue. If some of the producers of today could learn from movies of the 1980s, this world would be a much better place.Matthew Broderick delivers high quality, first class and believable acting to his role as Ferris Bueller. Portraying Ferris Bueller seems to be a strong point for him and I would consider it as a defining moment in his acting career. He gives Bueller's character a lot of depth and personality that tends to be missing from the vast majority of movies. Alan Ruck and Mia Sara also provide wonderful portrayals of Ferris's friends Cameron and Sloane. Jeffrey Jones is priceless in his excellent portrayal of constantly beleaguered headmaster Ed Rooney and Jennifer Grey shines as Ferris's disgruntled sister Jeannie Bueller. Even the supporting cast ?such as Ferris's parents down to school attendant Florence Sparrow down to the garage mechanic who `looks after' the car-give wonderful performances that make the film even more wonderful than it already is.The storyline is entertaining, enjoyable and gripping enough to keep you hanging on to the end. It's portrayal of youth, innocence and having a good time is truly a class act. The dialogue is witty, catchy and contains some priceless one liners that are still popular catchphrases today. It had me laughing hysterically even watching it for the tenth time. Everything down to the music and scenery works for this movie.My advice would be to go and see it. You won't regret it and will come away with a warm, nostalgic, feel good and wonderful feeling. They don't make movies this good anymore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSI'll admit from the offset that this is a film I'd bought in curiousity, but for a long time had never felt like watching. A friend of mine had seen this ages before I'd made the effort to, and he condemned it, apparently for the facts that he hates Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Grey. Whilst in films like "Godzilla", I'd happily agree that Broderick is an unoriginal, relatively irritating actor, the reasoning for this is that in another life he was obviously Ferris Bueller.In this film, we are introduced to Ferris Bueller. A popular guy around school, Bueller one day decides to take the day off and sets up an elaborate scheme to allow himself, his girlfriend (the delectable Mia Sara in one of her first roles) and his best friend Cameron (played beautifully by Alan Ruck) to travel to Chicago and to have the time of their lives. Along the way Ferris will show Cameron the "best day of his life", punish people who deserved to be tortured, and allude and torment his principle Mr Rooney (performed by the outstanding Jeffrey Jones).It's hard to really criticise this film. The plot is generally brilliant and feels almost like the "missing link" between 1980's comedy and later films like "American Pie", the directing superb, and the acting ranging from middle of the road to 100% believable. Despite these though, two things from this film spring to mind I confess.Firstly, possibly the highlight of this film is the introduction of a young actor with an amazing father who was only in acting for two years when he produced this film. That actor was Charlie Sheen, and after Matt Broderick, he must take full honours for coming out of this movie the brightest.Secondly, and most importantly of all is perhaps a minor criticism. I stand by a previous comment that it is hard to criticise this film, simply because that's the truth. The one really serious moment when Alan Ruck's Cameron is forced to face upto his past is stunning. However, the one criticism with this film is more to do with the third of the partying trio, that being the stunning Mia Sara. Now Mia was new to the world of acting when she appeared in this movie (only previously featuring as Princess Lily in "Labyrinth" the last year), but in this film at times it does feel very much that her character is more attracted to Cameron than to Bueller. I confess I don't know whether this is intentional or not, but until her last scene when she mutters to herself that she loves &amp; is going to marry Ferris, it feels incredibly like she is going to reject him in favour of Cameron who she seems to be increasingly friendly towards. Perhaps this is just me, either way, this point does not detract from the film in any way.I guess, to summarise, often this film when viewed anytime after 1995 (I'm viewing it in 2004!) is going to appear slightly 1980s, but irrelevant of this, we are presented with the heart warming, often hilarious, story of one 17 year old who one day decides he wants a day off. Ferris Bueller, we salute you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If my eyes were bleeding you wouldn't let me stay home from school...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller is your typical teenage boy. He lives in a middle-class suburban home, has a sister and lives with her and his parents. One morning Ferris seems to be "under the weather". When his parents discover this, being the concerned set that they are, decide that it would be best if Ferris stay home for the day. When they and his sister leave the house, that's when Ferris becomes "better".With his key tips on 'faking out the parents', his crazy ways of getting his girlfriend out of school, insulting the principal and getting away with it, and getting on top of a float in a parade in the middle of Chicago singing the lead song, are just several reasons why Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the greatest teen comedies that will remain a classic forever.Matthew Brodrick plays Ferris, while Jennifer Grey takes the part of his sister and Jeffery Jones the role of the principal, whom no one could have done a better job portraying.From the famous car, his girlfriend and best friend, his restaraunt routine, to his sister constantly being berated with signs, banners and charity collections in the hallways of her school, saying, "Save Ferris", she about loses it. Hey---wasn't there a band called that?This movie is a great watch and fun for the whole family (no really, it is). I love it, and it's a personal favorite. If you haven't seen this movie you need to, and if you have, you need to see it again!A 10 out of 10 in my opinion. I love it!And that's my review</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller is the guy you'd love to know in high school. Charismatic, good looking, smart, and popular with "The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, dickheads. . . they all think he's a righteous dude" This movie is hysterical, though unrealistic (HOW did Ferris manage to get himself on that float? well, I guess he is Ferris Bueller. ..) Matthew Broderick is perfect as the title role, and Jennifer Gray is hysterical as his hateful scheming sister. Alan Ruck is also great as the paranoid best friend of Ferris. All in all, this movie is a must see and has been enjoyed by people from all age groups. I don't know a single person who doesn't think Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the best movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes should be hailed the best writer for teen comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey, Cindy Pickett, Lyman Ward, Eddie McClurg, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Kristy Swanson, D: John Hughes. Undemanding if hilarious coming-of-age teen comedy with Broderick the title character, a rascally, cocky teenager hamming up a cold to take an absence from his education one day where him, his best friend (Ruck), and girlfriend (Sara) have a set of escapades in Chicago, where anything can happen. Still pretty popular among diehard fans of Hughes, who is a master of writing sharp teen-dialogue, generating charm, and bringing on the bundle of laughs. Grey is good as Ferris's feisty older sibling, who will see to it that he gets caught. Running Time: 103 minutes and rated PG-13 for language. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defining film of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film as many times as I have (too many to count), you may think that maybe i would get bored of it. Never going to happen. I believe that this film is not only the best teen movie that has ever been made, but also the defining movie of the 1980's. Although essentially a comedy, the film shows the essence of life as a teenager through brilliant performances by Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck. Broderick's Ferris is a wonderful character neither stereotype nor overbearing persona, and John Hughes yet again creates genius through the character of Cameron, played by Alan Ruck - who was 30 at the time!Many may disagree, but for me the best lines in the whole film are Camerons - 'When Cameron walked in Egypt land...... Let my Cameron go' wonderfully delivered to convey the characters stifled existence in his home life and the pressures of being the best friend of such a man as Ferris. In all, teen comedies don't get better than this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film will change your life.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant, politically incorrect teen comedy, written with blazing originality and off-beat irreverence. Told in a stylistically slick narrative that surprises and enlightens, with characters that are portrayed with staggering comedic timing and sometimes shocking depth. This will remain the pinnacle of John Hughes' career. Though considered such an '80s classic, the movie is extremely timeless, even though now-a-days, the actions the students commit in the film would probably get them thrown in jail. Students today will find much to identify with in the always-fresh and touching "unknown future" themes. But the most identifiable element in the film is the farcically bureaucratic characters. In other words, there will always be Ed Rooneys roaming the hallways in this modern educational environment. And as long as it stays that way, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" will remain one of the most entertaining, satirical, and accessible comedies around. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The negative comments that I'm reading is that the life of Ferris and his buddies isn't realistic. NO KIDDING! That really isn't the point of the film; in fact, one of the most striking characteristics about FBDO is that it makes a point of reminding you that you're watching a movie. Ferris addresses the audience (one of the first to ever do so as a regular feature of the film); film sequences are tweaked to emphasize certain scenes (such as Jeannie kicking Rooney in the face and then bolting upstairs before he seemingly hits the ground), and the Ferrarri getting about 5 feet of air. None of this is the slightest bit realistic, but it's great fun to watch, and so is the rest of this movie. It's *supposed* to be over-the-top. That's the whole point.The great thing about this movie is that it uses all its elements in perfect harmony. The clothing is '80s, but not *too* '80s--miniskirts and hockey jerseys will always be in. The music is classic, not overly-familiar, overplayed '80s anthems. The scenery is pure Chicago. Ferris and Cameron are very believable as long-time buddies, and the other characters play off each other perfectly. The dialogue is brilliant. The comic scenes are hilarious, and the parade scene makes you want to shake it up right along with the movie. It's a great film by a great movie-maker who was smart enough to know exactly how far to go, unlike today's directors who would undoubtedly have sequeled and merchandised it to death. (Not that they didn't try to make a TV show out of it back in the day.) It is the quintessence of everything that was good about the '80s, and that's why it's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my all time favorites. It is an Excellent movie about seeing your own personal value and realizing your potential. I think a little bit of every character lives inside us and it is that constant struggle that makes this life fun. At times we are much like Cameron; conservative, unhappy, and insecure. Other times we are like Ferris; uninhibited, fun-loving, and relaxed. We all need to realize that we control our lives and determine our future. I think Cameron put it best when he said, "I am not going to sit on my ass as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life. I'm going to take a stand. I'm going to defend it. Right or wrong, I'm going to defend it." We should all strive to be memorable in this life, to take some advice from Ferris. "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it."I think John Hughes knew what he was doing when he made this movie and I'm grateful to him for it.I give it a 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>escape reality for 2 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who wouldn't want to be Ferris, at least for one day? And especially if it could be the day he takes off from school, with friends Cameron and Sloane, journeying into downtown Chicago impersonating the rich and famous while capturing the hearts of an entire city? Ferris represents everything all high school boys want to be: funny, good-looking, quick, charming, conniving yet smart, and popular. Having a girlfriend as hot as Sloan Peterson doesn't hurt either. And driving a Ferrari helps. What really won me over about his character was Ferris' ability to talk his way through conflicts and problems. Perhaps it is his strategic way of thinking I envy. When faced with similar confrontations (i.e. the restaurant scene with the `snooty' host), I'd probably crack and then wet my pants. Ferris was able to, though non-violently and painlessly, deceive people, achieve his goal, and make himself look like the good guy all while doing so. It's this ability I find so intriguing and sexy. In a way, yes, this movie told kids it's okay to lie and do the wrong thing. But it also taught kids not to give up in the face of opposition. But who really cares what the underlying message is? Movies are made to help one escape miserable reality for 2 hours. In those two hours I imagined myself as Ferris Bueller, conquering the world, singing in a parade, being ogled by beautiful dancers, and tooling around in a Ferrari. This life is a dream come true- as long as you ignore the final scene, which I suppose the director/writer John Hughes included to help movie-goers prepare for re-entry back into their pathetic and dreary lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is known all over as a modern classic. It's true. When we talk about modern classics, this movie has to be mentioned. Teen movies are looked down upon because most of them don't live up to this one.The actors obviously weren't taken from the cast of Dawson's Creek, they didn't dig into Beverly Hills 90210, or Party of Five. They took real actors. These actors took on some hilarious roles and delivered.The music took me back to the 80s, the decade of my birth. I am only one year older than this movie, after all. Not only that, that Ferrari kicked ass! They don't make cars like that anymore.If you hate teen movies, this will be an exception. If you love teen movies, you will soon see them as inferior to this one. Ferris Bueller, you're my hero. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was simply comic work of genius. Unlike alot of corny teenage "Let's skip school" movies, Ferris Beuller's Day Off isn't full of Velveeta. And even though this movie was made in the 1980's I know that Ferris would still be the most popular boy in school at the present time!I remember renting this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old. Well my parents rented it rather, and they almost peed themselves from laughing. I of course thought that it was funny but wasnt able to appreciate the subtle comic quirks that it possessed. The thing that I love the most about this movie was the random humor. Though Hugh's had alot of humor in Sixteen Candles, the humor was more bubblegum than anything else. Ferris' humor is a little more edgy and sarcastic...call it quirky if you will but shows for a more mature sense of humor.Things like Ben Stein as the history teacher announcing someone's name over and over until they acknowledged their presence for the attendance that day. "Bueller, Bueller, Bueller". Or how Ferris made a floppy disk of sick/vomiting noises that he would play over the phone to his friends at school. Even the "Save Ferris" posted on the Water Tower was a riot. It was the little things that made this film so great. Along with a great cast, this film is going to remain a real 1980's cult classic!</fullReview>

(any comments on this?)Generally a very well put together movie with some truly comic moments and good acting (especially from some of the supporting actors such as Edie McClurg as the school secretary, Del Close as the English teacher and Jonathan Schmock as the maitre'd)Has appeal for all ages, not only teens! Since the movie is a comedy, it's possible to overlook certain small flaws in the timing / storyline that may seem unlikely.The movie is now 16 years old and destined to be one of those timeless classics of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie actually has Depth! Ain't Ferris Cool Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie originally in the theatre way back in 1986. I even remember my friend saying, " one for Ferris Booger's day off " and this made me laugh hysterically. This obviously demonstrates my young age when I saw this movie back then. Now when I watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off, now much older, it gains a timeless quality as I still love it just as much, or more than I did originally in 1986. I strongly believe it is one of John Hughe's finest films. Ferris Bueller's character (Matthew Broderick) demonstrates a heroic quality, with his charm, cunning and zest for life. He displays a confidence that many of us could only dream of. His friend Cameron on the other hand is the anti-thesis to Ferris' high strung personality, as this character is contrastedly low spirited and worrisome about life and his possible future after high school. And this is the beauty of the movie, Ferris allows Cameron to finally bust out of his nervous shell and take hold of the reins of life. The plot is simple, Ferris a high school student is pretending to be home sick with the flu so he can enjoy a kick ass day o' fun. His parents buy into his ploy but Ferris must do a little tampering with his attendance record (to avoid being caught by the nasty Mr. Rooney, Dean of Students played by Jeffrey Jones) by hacking into the school computer. He is successful and notifies his good friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) of his plan to have an incredible day in the city of Chicago. Cameron is wallowing in his own self pity and this situates his character symbolically as an everyman who we can all relate to, he is a person who is scared of life and would rather hide than face the bitterness of reality. Therefore it is Ferris' job to aid Cameron in his voyage towards self realization. And you thought Ferris Bueller's Day Off had no depth, think again! But first they must rescue Ferris' hottie girl friend Sloan (Mia Sara) from the drudgery of her high school English class so they can escape to the city. The fun begins once the trio take off to the city and many hilarious and wonderful scenes take place. One particularly excellent scene takes place in the art gallery where Cameron is galvanized by one particular painting. He cannot take his eyes off this painting and this scene strongly signifies his transformation towards self realization.Mr. Rooney is continually on a quest to defile the academic career of Ferris Bueller in his hilarious performance. He remains the huge obstacle that stands in the way of our hero's enjoyment of a kick ass day 'o fun in the city. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a fascinating romp of hilarity with true moments of tenderness to keep every viewer happy. Look for a young Jennifer Grey (from " Dirty Dancing " fame), she is fabulous in this movie as Ferris' despising sister Jeanie, all she wants is for her brother to be ruined in this whimsical tale of spiritual renewal.I give this movie *** out of 5 stars! A very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST 'TEEN' MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you, I hate teen movies. I hate them, hate them, HATE THEM!!!! All the characters seem to only see their future at the latest keg party, love to get high, get knocked up, and for the most part, screw up their entire lives. And you know what? I AM A TEENAGER! But let me put it this way....Ferris Bueller's is the king of not only 'teen movies' but of all Comedy's!Ferris Bueller's Day Off came out a year before I was born. Though I don't necessarily care for a ton of 80's movies for the fact that all the huge hair and cheesy teenage love stories annoy me, but this movie has got to be one of my all-time favorites.I distinctively remember the first time my mom and I rented Ferris Buellers Day off together. I think I was 5...and I loved every Matthew Broderick movie I had seen (and still do...with the exception of The Cable Guy...that movie was a brick) So, naturally, I knew I was going to like this one...Within 2 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard I was crying. And not only that, I realized it was a movie that was made in an era that I was not at all too familiar with. But I didn't care, all I knew was that I loved the movie. And of course...I STILL DO!!!!Now here I am, a high school Freshman, and I've heard tons of adults tell me to remember my highschool years, because they are some of the best years of your life. Well, I'm starting to feel that. And not only am I now gaining good memories from high school, but good memories from a great movie, that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.10+++++++++++/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview> A little over a decade and a half ago a legend that would revolutionize movie making forever was created. Even today, you might just hear people referring to "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" as being one of the best movies that came out of the 80's. Or, on the other hand, you might hear how it's one of the best things that came out of the 80's overall! Complete with a great environment, interesting twists, and a perfect trio main cast, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" blows all the other teen movies out of the water to date; and even those that aren't teen movies. It's hard to believe that Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck and Mia Sara are actually acting in this movie. The movie shows yesterday's youth with solid and focused soul. One of which is totally accurate. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a movie which any person with good taste would have in their collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hughes, master of teen films, hit a home run with Ferris Bueller. The purpose of a teen flick is to make teenagers glad to be one and to make adults reflect back on those years of their lives fondly. This movie does just that and more. Ferris Bueller is an amazing man in an awesome movie. The journey he goes on is spectacular and hilarious. Everyone should see this fabulous movie, with great performances by all Broderick and all the supporting characters (especially Jeffrey Jones). P.S. Also check out Charlie Sheen in one of his earliest roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is sheer genius. It's one of those films like High Fedelity or the Breakfast Club; they seem to have a plot that can only go so far and then get boring. Somehow they all end up being the most amazing films i have ever, or will ever see.The plot of 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is simple, our young Ferris decides to take a day off school...From this simple start ferris shows his friends one of the most memorable days they will have for a long time. Whilst dodging detection from his parents and his jealous sister Jeanie, whom you may remember from 'Dirty Dancing' (he said with a pained smile on his face) Ferris tries to show his girlfriend Slone (huba huba) and best friend Cameron all that the city has to offer.Amidst all this confusion one man makes it his personal mission to catch Ferris and bring him to justice...Ed Runey, the dean. And throughout the film you will want him to fail at every turn.Two things make this film so great, one, the best 80's soundtracks on the planet, and two being the way Ferris talks to the camera. You may be familiar with this technique being used in the popular hit TV series 'Saved by the Bell' and if it worked for them i can tell you it worked for Ferris. Big time =]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie For ALL Seniors in High School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen from the Class of ____. (put your year here.) Watch "Ferris Bueller". Everything you need to know about life comes from this movie! Yes, "Ferris Bueller" does contain offensive language, but I'm telling you right now...every student should watch this movie before they graduate from high school. Record it from TV and watch the TV edit! I don't care how you watch it, just do it!!!Now that's off my chest, I can actually comment on this movie.I don't know if it's just due to Matthew Broderick's likeableness (a word I just made up) or what, but you just can't help but love Ferris. Ferris is the guy everyone wants to be with in high. Heck, Ferris is the guy everyone wanted to be in high school...Get away with murder, get worshipped by your entire community and know all the words to "Danke Schoen".When I think back to my teenage years, I can honestly say that this movie epidomizes the 80's more than almost any other movie. (The only exception would be "Back to the Future".) From the music to the clothes to the hair to the Ferrari, everything about this movie is 1980's! Even Charlie Sheen is in this movie!I know that there are a lot of actors who don't want to be remembered for one certain role, but if I were Matthew Broderick, I would definitely accept that as a compliment that people know me as Ferris Bueller. It's the ultimate role that I would do for free if I had the chance.Now, don't think that this movie is all about Broderick. The supporting cast did a great job of pulling their own weight. Jeffrey Jones, Alan Ruck, Jennifer "Yummy" Grey, and of course Edie McClurg.Ferris Bueller is just one of those movies that when you finish watching it, you can't help but walk out of the TV room with a smile on your face. It's that enjoyable! P.S. I know you probably already know this, but don't stop the video until the credits are all done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was hysterically funny, but I do wish that the characters didn't use so much profanity. Ironically this wasn't the first movie that I ever saw Matthew Broderick in, but instead "Faerie Tale Theatre" was the first project that I ever saw Matthew Broderick's face in. Everything about this movie is great, except of course all the profanity. I thought the scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron were at the restaurant was too funny. Abe Frohman? Who would have a name like that? Especially a seventeen year old. It's too bad Matthew Broderick was typecast for a long time after this since he looks so young for his age. He's almost forty now, and he definitely does not look it! Overall I thought this movie was funny.</fullReview>

Matthew Broderick is absolutely adorable as Ferris, and Jennifer Grey is hilarious as the understandably bitter younger sister. Though this movie is first and foremost a madcap comedy, there are some cute, sentimental (but not mushy) moments between Ferris and his girlfriend Sloane and his best friend Cameron. And of course, the best scene is hands down, when Ferris lipsynches to the Beatles' "Twist and Shout." This movie should be required viewing for all high school seniors everywhere!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they could only make more movies like this. The plot is simple as it is about what happens when the slick "know-it-all" high school senior takes a day off school to hang with his best friend and girlfriend. My only criticism of the movie was the way the characters had to analyze themselves ( a John Hughes staple ala "Breakfast Club", "Sixteen Candles", "Weird Science") and look deep within themselves to come to some sort of realization about who they really are. The few moments this happens you stop laughing, though only for a minute.There is no doubt that the casting for this movie was outstanding. The secretary and Ed Rooney are absolutely hilarious. The mother, father, and sister "Jeannie/Shawna" were great selections. Cameron plays the cynical/pessimistic best friend part beautifully, and what is not to like about Mia Sara.This is nothing but a good, funny movie that you don't need to think about, just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of its genre, "Ferris" amuses and entertains at the same level it did 15 years ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that has aged well-- rather better than most of its viewers, in fact (take a look around your office). Indeed, "Ferris" continues to amuse and entertain precisely because all of us, whether we admit it or not, still want to identify with the victories of the hero and his friends over the adults we have long since become. Or perhaps already were in 1986...Beyond the steadily successful development of its plot-driven (or maybe "plot"-driven) situational humor, "Ferris" impresses as a film of wonderful isolated moments; many of these have drawn well-deserved praise-- Ben Stein now *defines* the classic feckless teacher for a generation, and Charlie Sheen (appearing unbilled) managed an inspired James Dean homage for the 80's kids to guess the origins of-- but some have (apparently) escaped general notice. Has there ever been a better, more believable Irritable Best Friend character than that created in Alan Ruck's sulking-Cameron scenes? Or consider Richard Edson ("Joey Breaker", "Do the Right Thing") as the swarth-enhanced parking garage attendant; when Ferris asks "Do you speak English?", Edson simply masterfully doles out incredulity via a raised eyebrow and the now-classic response (today so daringly un-PC) "What country do you think this *is*?"Briefly put, "Ferris" continues to do credit to all who created and appeared in it--and rewards the home viewer over multiple screenings. The fact that this film has drawn a paltry 2 1/2-star rating from a standard (and usually reliable) source such as Maltin remains a Bermuda Triangle-sized anomaly...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!I see this film differently as an older adult than as a young one. When this first came out I was still a few years out of High School, so I revered Ferris and all of his slickness and charm. Now as I near 40 (with a grad degree in Education Administration to boot) I'm a little leary of the mischevious Mr. Bueller. Still this is a funny movie with plenty of crafty scenes (though some of the outlandish stuff has become thin through the years).Creator John Hughes stuffed this comedy full of clever details and quirky moments. Broderick performs well in his tounge-in-cheek role, and one of the joys of the film is his sub rosa sides with the screen audience, culminating at the very end with a reminder that it is time to go home after all the film credits have fully finished. For all the celebration of smart-alleck youths in this movie, it is two adults who steal the show--Edie McClurg as the pixilated secratary Grace (I have watched this numerous times and I have yet to not laugh at her enumeration of all the school cliques)and Jeffery Jones as the unforgetable arch-enemy of Ferris, Principal Ed Rooney. His antics in his quest to ruin the young truant are ultimately the picture's funniest moments.One side note- When I give educational presentations I often use the Ben Stein scene (discussing Taft/Hartley-Voodoo Economics) with all the bored students (that kid drooling on his desk is classic) as an opening ice-breaker. I juxtapose it with a scene from "Better Off Dead"--where the kids are intently listening to a recondite physics lesson. I then ask the educators which scene reminds them more of today's kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Still The Best Teen Comedy Of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who doesn't like this movie is crazy. What's not to like? I mean, it's a classic. It's a pretty light hearted and silly comedy that is very hard not to laugh at. John Hughs is a great comedy director, and he always will be (hopefully). The story is set mainly in Chicago, so you know that strange and unusual things will happen. This movie has a lot of running and chasing and tricking other people, so I ask again, what's not to like?Matthew Broderick is Ferris Bueller, the coolest kid in school, who just wakes up one morning and decides he doesn't want to go to school, so he convinces his overly trusting parents that he is ver sick, so they tell him to stay in bed, and they head off to work, sure it's nieve, but who cares. Ferris then drags his up tight best friend Cameron, his equally mischievous girlfriend Sloane, and Cameron's father's rare Mustang for a day on the town filled with mis-adventures and some of the strangest people in Illinois.Ferris' angry sister Jeanie is hysterical. She and the nosey Principal Rooney are both out to get Ferris and put him in his place. Rooney is a very funny character just because of all of the situations he gets himself into. I recommend this movie to anyone who goes to or has gone to school, or who likes a good comedy. Matthew Broderick is really funny as fun-loving Ferris. Just watch it, and you'll see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SEE THE MOVIE BEFORE READING ON, OK? OK!!The second of Hughes' two classic teen flicks of all time. The wisecracking, wisdom offering, laid back Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides that it's time to take a day off. But not just any day off. Not a lay around at home playing video games sort of day off. We're talking the best day off ever.Taking his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who is forever wound up tight and his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), who is about the only person who can keep Ferris in check, to Chicago. But it's not Ferris style to go in Cameron's old car. No no no. The best way by far is in Cameron's dad's Ferrari. 1961 Ferrari 250GT California to be exact. It doesn't bother Ferris one bit that less than a hundred were made and that Cameron's dad keeps a close eye on the mileage. The car is sheer Ferris and it's something that he has to drive.But it isn't just a day off. It helps Cameron from being uptight all his life, it helps Ferris from screwing his life up and makes Sloane realize that Ferris loves her.Hughes directs this movie superbly. It has everything needed to make a successful comedy. A young cast, great camera shots and a 'hero' everyone wants to be like. Broderick's camera shots when he talks to the audience or gives them sly looks are classic and help the audience identify with a guy who gets his kicks from skipping school. We see everything from Ferris's eyes and how he views the world.Once again Hughes uses teen pyschology, mainly with Cameron in this movie. The film shows how Cameron goes from a guy who flips out because he's being forced to do something he doesn't want to, to someone who does what he likes and fights for what he believes in. The scene when the three go to the art museum is clever as it shows how Cameron feels inside. Staring at a piece of art Cam notices that the closer you look the less you see and believes that this is how people are going to see him.It's Ferris' intention to liven Cameron up before the go their seperate ways, off to college and work. That's the real reason of taking the day off. Of course it's for Ferris' own pleasure too. A trip to the Sears tower, a posh restaurant and a parade ensure that Ferris can make sure that Cam, Sloane and himself have fun.But it's not as simple as that. Ferris has Mr. Rooney, dean of students, on his tail. If Rooney has his way Ferris will be spending the next year at school resitting everything subject. But Rooney doesn't know when to stop. He leaves the school grounds in pursuit of Ferris and keeps going one step too far in his goal. This is his downfall as the more he tries the more of an ass he makes himself look. The faces the kids on the late bus pull when a bedraggled Mr. Rooney walks on is great. Ferris' other enemy is his sister, Jeannie, who feels that Ferris shouldn't get the day off when he's not really sick and does everything she can to catch him in the act. She too goes over the top and ends up in a police station, making out with Charlie Sheen's character, Garth Volbeck, who offers her advice on her troubles.Once again Hughes manages to combine teen humor with slapstick comedy and it blends perfectly. As in Weird Science and The Breakfast Club the authority figures are ridiculed and mocked to the point of extreme, in this case the ever trying, ever failing Mr. Rooney.The reason this movie was more successful than Hughes previous films (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Weird Science) is because it has a wider appeal than say, surrealistic Weird Science. As in true Hughes tradition it has a cast of unknowns who later went on to become part of the Eighties brat pack, including Broderick and a cameo by Charlie Sheen.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a feel good movie. There's not a real plot, it's just pure entertainment, and Hughes directs it this way. If you're looking for fun then you can't go wrong with a John Hughes movie, and this movie in particular. If you have the chance I highly recommend you watch this.Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you don't like 80s music, you can't help but find the soundtrack to this movie infectious (track listings are posted on fan websites all over the Internet though there was never an official soundtrack). Matthew Broderick is an extremely likeable character as Ferris Bueller: an intensely popular high school student with a close circle of friends. I'm not advocating ditching high school classes and dodging parents, but this movie conveys a true sense of anxiety and excitement while skipping classes and barely making it home in time to finish off a day that could not have gone better. A cult classic that belongs in the adventure/comedy section of a video collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of John Hughes Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on 12/31/97. It's has to be one of the best comedy selections in my collection. Matthew Broderick is brilliant as Ferris. Alan Ruck plays a great part as Cameron. Ferris's girlfriend is attractive, no more than that. Jeannie is also hilarious. This is just a great movie. It has a simple plot. A high school student who wants to take the day off with his friends. One of the best parts is when Ferris gives pointers on how to fake a sickness. You start moaning and wailing and you bend over and you lick your palms. I know it sounds a bit childish and stupid, but than so is high school. LOL! Here's the plot. The movie takes place on a beautiful day, so Ferris decides to take the day off with his best firend Cameron (Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane. Ferris tries to fake out his parents which he always does successfully and he fakes them out again. The only four people that know that he is not really sick is Sloane, Cameron, Jeannie, and the evil Mr. Rooney. Mr. Rooney would do anything to get Ferris caught. He tries to tell his parents, but neither of them believe him. While Mr. Rooney tries to get him, Ferris and his friends take a day down to Downtown, Chicago, where to have fun and stay away from getting caught. Not to mention they take a beautiful 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. Less than 100 were made. That's one of my dream cars.  Anyway Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a great movie and hope they never make a sequel cause it would suck and would be to predictable. This one of John Hughes best. His other one would be Home Alone. This movie gets a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites! **possible spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my goodness, I love this movie! I rented it so long ago, but then I saw they were playing it on the WB so I taped it. Wow am I glad I did. This movie has everything you need. Comedy, romance, poignant humor, real-life issues, and an all-star line up. Matthew Broderick is *perfect* in his role as the witty wise-guy Ferris Bueller who plays hooky and goes into the City with his girlfriend Sloane and best friend Cameron to have some fun. Along the way he faces obstacle after obstacle with pure charm and ease, even when he's chased down by his older sister Jean (played by the wonderful Jennifer Grey) and the principle, Mr. Rooney. This movie is so much fun, and is great when you watch it in large groups or at parties. A winner! I rate it 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He may not be the walrus, but he'll always be Ferris!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Ferris Bueller's Day Off was first released, I was already into my 20's, so obviously it's been a long time since I was a teenager. Nonetheless, this has always been one of my very favourite movies, and remains so today. Ferris is a teenager who decides to take the day off school and goes to incredible lengths to cover his tracks, right down to recording a fake "Funeral Home" answering machine message! Matthew Broderick is, of course, wonderful as the title character and Alan Ruck is absolutely brilliant (even upstaging Broderick at times) as the anal-retentive Cameron. The supporting roles are all very well done, especially Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward as Ferris' dim-bulb parents, Jennifer Grey as his wonderfully bitchy sister, Edie McClurg as the scatterbrained secretary Grace, and especially Jeffrey Jones as the hapless principal Ed Rooney. Also worth a giggle are the hilarious cameo performances by Kristy Swanson, Ben Stein and Charlie Sheen. Best scene of the movie: the "Twist and Shout" scene. This movie is filled with some terrific one-liners, such as "I weep for the future", "I think we should shoot her" and my personal favourite "what country do you think this is?" Matthew Broderick may be making it big on Broadway these days but to me he'll always be Ferris.</fullReview>

Hughes outdid himself. I especially enjoyed Allan Ruck's (of Spin City) performance in this film. Also Edie McClurg is one righteous dudette in this.

		<fullReview>Being a child of the 80's, I grew up with this movie, and I loved it since the first time I saw it! It's my favorite comedy and 80's flick, and for what better reason? This movie is hilarious, and all of us can only dream of sneaking out of school and having a day off like Ferris does! (And we can only dream of our most hated principal/teacher always getting the worst of it while trying to catch us.) My favorite scenes are where they're trying to get into the restaurant with the snobby waiter, ("I weep for the future!") and Jeannie's chat with the guy in the police station. The only thing I don't like about this movie is how Ferris seems to slightly manipulate Cameron, his best friend, but despite that, this movie must be seen if you love 80's flicks. If you haven't seen Ferris Buller's Day off, then you haven't seen a great comedy! Rent it, buy it, catch it on T.V, but whatever you do, you gotta see this movie!</fullReview>

Perhaps it's the fact that every character, from Matthew Broderick to the bit parts (Charlie Sheen and Ben Stein) are so well-developed and portrayed.Perhaps one example of the popularity of this movie is the fact that, 15 years later, Ben Stein is still capitalising on his "boring teacher" character.

		<shortDescription>No other movie embodies the 80's like this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to pick ONE movie that embodied the 80's, it would be "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". Ferris' asides to the camera add to his charm and wit, the soundtrack is right on key, the casting dead on, and the entire movie flows with the pace of someone who got up 1/2 hour late for school in the morning. Ferris' ability to get away with it all is kept very much alive throughout the film.John Hughes has crafted a delightful film that's funny all over, touching where it needs to be, and has the many signature elements that Hughes films are known for (the impending doom at the front door, teen angst, a number of great cameos, but, alas, no Molly Ringwald). This film also gave us a number of the sound bytes that you hear so often today (Ben Stein's "Bueller...Bueller" and the spoken-in-one-breath update on Ferris' condition by then not-quite-known Kristy Swanson).This film is Hughes at his best, and Broderick in probably his biggest, best role (or at least his most memorable). How they could try to follow this with a sitcom was beyond me. This is definitely not a movie that could be sequelized - Let this one stand alone. It's fine the way it is. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorite comedies of all time. While there are really very few laugh out loud hilarious moments in this movie it is still great. (possible spoilers) Ferris is the most popular Senior in school who decides to take the day off. He semi-bullies his best friend Cameron into joining him and then breaks his girlfriend out of school. They spend the rest of the day eating at fine restaurants, going to a Cubs game, visiting an Art gallery, and generally a lot of things you wouldn't expect the average teen to do on a day of skipped school. Despite their somewhat dry sounding itinerary, Ferris and company still have lots of fun and do take time to do some wild and crazy things. The principal Mr. Rooney is hilarious at his horribly inept attempts to catch Ferris. All in all a wonderfully fun movie and one of the best films of the 80's."Gentlemen, you can't fight in here!

Ferris is a kid, an underdog, which we can all relate to; a clever kid, who just finds the system so boring and inept that he fails it for being "a righteous dude". His quest is to show his audience the big picture; what can be done if you chill out, take out your friends, and borrow you friends' dads ferrari. Throughout the film you cannot help but root for Ferris and his swashbuckling determination to have fun, whilst not getting caught. Witty, clever and a great way to cherish the fondness of your schooldays. "Go Ferris."10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, God- if only it were that easy. I try to ditch school and the teacher phones home to ask how I'm feeling, and... well. Yes, obviously it's no cinch for Ferris to not get caught, but as we learn, Ferris Bueller never gets caught. Sure it's no sophisticated Oscar winning comedy but I'll watch it over 'Shakespeare In Love' any day. Why? It's light, it's easy, you don't have to stop and think to understand the jokes, it's one of those stupid comedies that you can't resist. One of those movies that you keep in the video drawer and watch on a rainy day... it's also a movie you don't want your kids to get ideas from.I haven't seen many of Matthew Broderick's films but from those I did, this is my favorite (I mean Godzilla, eh ok, but Inspector Gadget, in the old Jewish words of wisdom: Oy Vay). Matthew Broderick is absolutely brilliant and Alan Ruck (Cameron) and Mia Sara (Sloane) are great too. I have many favorite lines, but one of them is in the beginning where Ferris explains the rules on how to ditch school without getting caught, after he finishes explaining- he then says: "It's a little childish and stupid but then- so is school". I also liked when he said: "I asked for a car, I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?", yes Ferris- we sympathize with you. But enough quotes.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a great movie that can be enjoyed by anybody (even teachers, well maybe I'm going a bit too far now). It's one of my top ten favorites, a must see for all kids who wanna skip school and a reminder to parents of how naive they can be some... all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie. There are better films, yes, and there are more popular films...perhaps. But Ferris Bueller has always been on the top of my list. This movie succeeds on so many different levels: a teen comedy, a satire, a social commentary, even a promotional film for the city of Chicago. I've seen it a few dozen times and every time I notice things in a whole different way.The movie, on the surface, is of course the account of how an impossibly carefree senior named Ferris Bueller decides to skip a day of school and take his girl and his best friend out on the town, while setting clever traps and ruses to foil his clueless parents, his nosy sister and even nosier dean. Even on this level the movie is fantastic. But to me, and probably to many others, the movie is not really about Ferris skipping school and having fun. It's really about Ferris skipping school and trying to get his depressed buddy, Cameron Frye, to have fun and learn to have confidence in himself. Cameron is probably the character most people identify with; uptight, unsure of himself, afraid to stand up to his parents. Everyone has part of Cameron inside them at some point in their lives. No one is ever really Ferris. Ferris is the unblemished perfect soul that the Camerons of the world have to put up with: he gets away with everything, has perfect grades, perfect family, perfect girl, and he's always happy. The great thing about Ferris is, he knows all of that, and he's taking this day off to make it up to Cameron.The film has great characters (very few films capture the true nature of high school like this one; Ben Stein was born for this role), and even better directing: I love the camera work; the quick, rapid establishing shots are priceless. Even the story is excellent; it's sharp and intelligent (though Ferris sure seems to fit quite a lot of activity into one day). I sincerely doubt there's anyone who wouldn't like this movie. It's just great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some say "The Breakfast Club" is Hughes best, but I enjoy his all out comedies a little more, so this ranks at the top. The movie is just fun, with Broderick and company galavanting about Chicago going from one misadventure to another. Hughes does manage to get great laughs from those having not such a great day as well, such as Grey and the most memorable high school principal in a movie, the luckless Jones. The signature scene of the film is no doubt the "Twist and Shout" parade, with Broderick lip-syncing to the Beatles hit. You can't help but rock along to the electrifying moment. Tack on an excellent closing five minutes, where despite the lack of dialogue, you'll be left with a huge smile as the film fades out. Broderick is perfect as the smooth operator, Ruck likable as his hapless friend and Sara as the cutesy girlfriend. Hughes best work is sure to please anybody here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>#3 best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(For you people who are wondering, the first is Back to the Future and the second is Raiders of the Lost Ark).I have a poster over my bed from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Its a poster of Ferris laying back with his feet up and in big letters over top, it says "Leisure Rules." There is not a school day that goes by without me debating with myself, after looking at the poster, weather or not I should lick my palms.This is one of the best movies you will ever see because it indulges in a teenage fantasy: beating your parents, beating the school, and overall just beating the system to have fun when you aren't supposed to. "Just think, if we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym." That sums up the movie pretty much. Ferris has a great amount of magic in him: his presence is magnetic. Watching Ferris and Cameron trick Mr. Rooney into releasing Sloane is hilairious. I always wished I could pull something like that. I used to want to be Ferris and do everything he does, but I think now I realize that it is just a fantasy, and the audience will identify more with Cameron ("Ferris can handle anything. I can't handle a thing."). But it is still great fun to indulge in the fantasy every once in a while.Everything about this movie is memorable and is treasured, even though now i tend to skip the scene in Cameron's garage. Only Ferris could beat the waiter at his own game, turn a typical parade into a block party, turn off his stereo with a baseball and get home in time to be sick in bed, gaining sympathy for his parents.THis movie rules and I haven't met anyone who can honsetly admit they didn't like it. Buy yourself a copy today and on your next REAL sick day, take a trip into Chicago in a Ferrari with Ferris Bueller and see if you don't feel better.</fullReview>

The way principal Rooney stumbles over himself in an effort to appease Mr. Peterson (that's not really Mr. Peterson... so that's how it is in their family!) is one of the many highlights. Even 14 years after the film release, my friends and co-workers still drop lines from this movie constantly, and always get great laughs with them... "Yes... call the police, this should be a HOOT!!!", "I asked for a car, and they got me a computer... how's that for living under a bad sign?", "When Cameron was in Egypt's land... let my Cameron goooooooo!!!!"So many great scenes, lines and situations in this movie, that to tell you about them all, would take... well, it would take 90 minutes at least!

As a teenager, I give this my snarky adolescent seal of approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could you not love this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear God, has it been this long? Is this movie really fifteen years old? Well, Mathew Broderick hasn't aged a day since (must be drinking the same magic sauce as Dick Clark. I think it's called embalming fluid). I decided to watch this again the other day to see if it was as good as I remembered it. It had been about ten years since I had last seen it, and you know how movies from your youth are never as good as you remembered them. Well, this one is every bit as good now as it was then. I love this movie!There are just too many good things about this movie to mention. Broderick is instantly likeable as Ferris. Makes you wish you had a buddy like him back in school, if for no other reason than to get close to his hottie of a girlfriend (Mia Sara). For some reason, I keep thinking of Alan Ruck as being the most outstanding character in this movie. He gives a very sweet performance as Cameron, Ferris' loser friend. He actually has the most performance-intensive role in this one. And what a cast! I was most looking forward to seeing Ben Stein again, and a hilarious cameo by Charlie Sheen, and they didn't disapoint. Oh, but that's not all folks, we also have Jeffrey Jones as the principle ("Rooney Eats It!"). He's great. Even better is Jennifer Grey as Ferris' sister, ?Shawna-Jean'. I love her attitude.John Hughes, where for art thou? Seems he's been writing a lot for the last ten years. Yikes! I took a look at his resume and it's not a pretty sight. I think the 80's was his decade. Anyway, this one is easily his greatest film. Everything just clicks. This one is easily a 10/10 stars on my scale. G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always saw the FBDO box in the comedy section at the videostore, but I never rented it, thinking it would be some sort of cheesy 80's movie. One day though, I had a "3 for the price of 1" coupon, and having already seen everything decent at the videostore, I decided to give it a go.Well, wow. A clean teen comedy that's not about getting laid. I dont know if I was in a good mood, but I remember laughing hysterically throughout the movie. Ferris, his friend Cameron, and his girlfriend (forgot her name)decide to take the day off...but unbeknownst to the trio , but beknownst to us, the principal is after them, because he is obsessed with catching Ferris. Every character is memorable, especially the male trio. Ferris, Cameron, and the principal are just too funny.I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie - I will ALWAYS love it - because it has about EVERYTHING I want to be happy. Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck - especially Alan - give the best performances of their lives. And adding the beautiful Ferrari only makes it better.'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' symbolises what many teenagers would consider thé perfect day off. But of course, who can do that without getting nailed? Right, no body but Ferris. He's cute, funny and er... smart. His best friend, Cameron Frye is the opposite of Ferris. Always thinking negative, acting negative and being depressive, he makes me feel sad. But the rest is cool: seeing mr. Rooney getting chased by the Bueller's dog is cool, Ferris singing at the parade is cool and Alan Ruck's fantastic blue eyes are really cool.What touched me most is the evolution in Alan's character - you can actually see Cameron change. He realises that it is silly to be down all the time. I'm not gonna say more, check it out yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I make a point of watching this film at least once a month. There's something fundamentally timeless about this film (like Weird Science and The Breakfast Club) that captures the imagination. I grew up with this film, I can quote huge chunks verbatim and yet I still p**s myself with laughter every time Jeff Jones has the "Nine Times" discussion with Cindy Pickett.There are many things to love about this (not least the 250 GT California) and I'm eagerly awaiting the UK DVD release. The only problem with this film is that I find it difficult to watch any of the actors in anything else - I half expect Matt Broderick and Alan Ruck to turn into Ferris and Cameron in every other thing I see them in. As for Jeff Jones... words are not enough. This film is my love, it is my passion... and it is my fault I don't rewatch it as often as I should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And we all have seen it, so let's celebrate it with cheerful reminiscing. Because, what's NOT to like about this, John Hughes, cult- epic. Except for the fact it never got a sequel! Only the television show, which lasted only one season and was poorly cast ed. And besides that, a series is not a good format and wouldn't do justice to the Day Off concept. Although I did enjoy 'Parker Lewis can't loose' as a kid. Which is a direct rip-off in my perspective. Ferris Bueller however is timeless. The Characters are great but the idea of the Day Off was most inspiring. I often say to myself the words "How can u possible handle "school" on a day like this" and then change 'school' for 'work' or 'social family obligations'. In the 80's I related mostly to Cameron (Ferris's loser friend). And I still (now twenty odd years later) when I don't like to get up, I hear his song in my head "When Cameron was in Egypt land, let my people go". This was so abstract for me, back then, and at the same time so perfectly clear. When you liked this one, you also should see; Better of Dead and The Breakfast Club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I obviously had my impressions too high when seeing this movie. From what I read about it, it seemed like it would be a revolution, but I ended up being very disappointed. This movie did not mean as much to me as the other 80's teen flicks did. I found it dragged on: 103 minutes seemed like three hours. My attention could not keep up with the television screen.It did have its share of laughs, and its share of lame trash trash as well, like all teen movies. I can't see why so many people would faint if Ferris Bueller walked by.This movie is nowhere near as meaningful to me as John Hughes' other 80's movies (Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles). However, it does not stink. It's just, well, average. 50%.My rating: **1/2 (out of 5 *'s)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is the best movie ever made. It's at once hilarious and heart-rending, absurd and down-to-earth. I was born three years before its release, and it's one of the earliest movies I remember seeing. I watched it so much during my formative years, and still do, that it is an inextricable part of who I am. A quote from the movie that fits the situation I'm in perfectly often springs to my head, and I drive my family crazy reciting all the dialogue each time I watch it. So many things about this movie ring true - friendship, teen stress, the need to have a day off once in a while. I think most of John Hughes' other movies (with the possible exception of The Breakfast Club) are poor excuses for a window on teen life, but he must be applauded for this one, as must the actors, writers, and everyone else involved. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris is my hero. He lives life the way it should be lived, and the world is a better place for it. Occasionally profound, always likeable and funny, this is a film that everyone should see. Especially on a wet Wednesday afternoon, because it will cheer you up - guaranteed.The performances by the lead actors are superb, and Broderick gives his lifetime best portrayal. The direction is spot on, although quintessentially a Hughes 1980s film. The editing is also good, as short set piece scenes give the film an upbeat rhythm.A friend of mine compared this film to Wayne's World. But Ferris' talks to camera are infinitely more assured than Wayne, and Cameron is a believable character. Minor criticisms are the overdose of slapstick and the fact that the day seems to last for ever. But we want it to last forever.Make everyone you know see this film.</fullReview>

And unlike many of today's teen "comedies" it isn't superficial; Ferris has more in mind than skipping. He wants to help his best friend gain some confidence, although it is really the audience that feels the best in the end.This is the ultimate feel-good movie and is one that never gets old!

		<fullReview>I was 15 when this movie was released, and it was my very favorite movie for a couple of years after that. In my senior year of high school, a friend and I decided that, like Ferris, we needed a day off.Of course, our day off was a huge disappointment compared to Mr. Bueller's. Which is in some ways instructive; the movie basically tells you to live for today, don't wait for tomorrow. But it's a fantasy. Living for today, in real life, spells disaster as often as not. I still wish I could be as cool and confident as Ferris Bueller, but I think there is some physical law against that many coolness particles occupying any one person's body. Oh well.It's really just light, frothy fun, in retrospect. The highlight may well be watching Ferris's friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) react in his super-pessimist way to Ferris's infuriatingly just-do-it nature ? a classic performance.</fullReview>

(not only that, that is...) The whole point of the excursion is to spend more time with his best friend Cameron, try to get him to shake off his terminal melancholy. Ferris connives, schemes, lies...but is in fact a good-hearted kid. You get the feeling that Ferris and, by the end of the movie, Cameron have a better grip on what's important than the people they're supposed to be learning from.I don't know whether his parents' amazing gullibility, or the fact that the kids skip school to visit an art museum, is harder to believe...but 's OK, go along for the ride anyway.</fullReview>

But if you've seen the movie, I'm sure you'll agree with me that that is just not enough to say about the one-and-only, unremakable, funny, just-for-fun and, like I said before, classic, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." This is a high school movie with girls and dating and referances to nudity and many curses, but just in case you're wondering, it's far from the 1982 classic "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." There are no drugs and nothing really along the lines of sex like in that movie. This is also a classic, but it deals with a totally different aspect of high school. The point of the movie, the main plot, whatever, is ditching school. It is about how the very cool, slick, popular Ferris Beuller makes a hobby (technically, not literally) out of ditching. To add to the funniness, the producers add in Ferris's best friend Cameron Fry, played by Alan Ruck. Cameron's parents run their household "like a museum. It's cold, very beautiful, and you're not allowed to touch anything."-Ferris Beuller. It's funny how slick Ferris tries to manage and convince Cameron, who is very law abident, into ditching with him. The ultimate is when Ferris insists on taking Cameron's father's Ferrari out to Chicago. Wait to see what happens there. Another funny part, probably the funniest of the funny parts and the real plot of the movie, is how Ed Rooney tries to nail Ferris for ditching, and how he fails at everything he tries to do. If you are in high school, or even in middle school, you are sure to love this movie. If you haven't seen it, make sure you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller Will Carry Us Through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/screenwriter John Hughs dominated the teen oriented films of the 1980's with grade A production value films such as "The Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen Candles". Good films in their own right, but none reach the stature of his "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the story of (who else?) 17 year old high school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Brodrick) and his efforts to play hooky from school on an impossibly beautiful late spring day using verbal games, high-tech gadgetry and help from his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck). They, along with Ferris's girlfriend Sloan (Mia Sara), set off for downtown Chicago for a day of relaxation, unaware that Mr. Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), Dean of Students, is doggedly attempting to confirm his suspicions and nail Ferris for skipping school. Should this occur, Ferris will not graduate. Ferris, fully aware of the dangers of possibly being caught, has set his stage with elaborate deceptions to cover his tracks. And always looming in the backround is Ferris's younger sister Jennie (Jennifer Grey) who is extremely envious of her brothers ability to bamboozle their parents and everyone else and get away with his antics. She would also love to nail Ferris. Ferris is a very charming, popular, intelligent, and insightful 17 year old. Through the course of the story, he turns to the camera to make a comment about a recent turn of events or an accurate, funny observation about life. Matthew Brodrick pulls this role off effortlessly, and it is this actors inherent charm which carries half the film. Brodrick receives wonderful support from Alan Ruck, Jennifer Grey, Mia Sara, and Jeffrey Jones. The script (story and screenplay by director John Hughs) is funny, insightful, well paced and, although this film is really a fable, somehow believable. The friendship between Ferris and Cameron, which started in the third grade, is heartfelt and realistic. The photography of downtown Chicago is beautiful.However, there is another level to this film which was not apparent when I first saw it as a 22 year old in the theater in 1986. Now, in 1999, with the benefit of comparison, it is possible to see the sheer optimism which fills the characters in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". To Ferris and his friends, anything is possible and the world is their oyster, ready for the taking. Confidence in the future abounds, even through the toughest moments (and Cameron has one of the toughest). To quote another charismatic character from another '80's film, "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" (and his whole future was at stake!). This important value is sorely lacking in the teen and early twenties story characters of the 1990's, being replaced by cynicism and pessimism about the future under the mask of "just being realistic". The charm is gone, but films like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" will carry us through until the charm returns. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST JOHN HUGHES MOVIE EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand what has gotten into John Hughes. The man responsible for such definitive and great teen films such as this one and PRETTY IN PINK, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is still possessed by the HOME ALONE formula. I mean after HOME ALONE hit it big, he made HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK which was the same slapstick formula but set against the background of NEW YORK, DENNIS THE MENACE the same slapstick formula set against the background of a Hank Ketcham comic strip, BABY's DAY OUT the same slapstick formula only with a BABY!!! 101 DALMATIONS, the same slapstick formula only this time with Glenn Close and a bunch of dogs tagged on, FLUBBER the same slapstick formula only this time it has Robin Williams to make funny faces and green snot. The list goes on. Back in the 80's, John Hughes was an icon. He truly complemented the teenage experience with his terrific movies with Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. But his greatest movie is FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF! This is the movie everyone remembers to the fullest and can fully quote scenes. Its just such a feel good teen movie, unlike the crap we see today with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Matthew Broderick is awesome and charismatic as the title character. He gives us inspiration to take things easy and not treat life too seriously. I loved Jeffrey Jones' portrayal of Mr.Rooney. The scenes with him in it are pure comic gold. He's perfect as the evil principal who'd do anything to see Ferris fail. Jennifer Grey is terrific as the sister who hates Ferris' existence because he gets away with everything. She's hilarious. She should have never got that nose job. There are so many memorable scenes in this movie. John Hughes knows how to direct. I liked the scene that focused on the faces of the students in the classroom as they hear a boring lecture from none other than Ben Stein. I liked the riotously scenes with Mr.Rooney and his assistant Grace. The parade sequence where Ferris Bueller lip syncs is a classic. I rewind that part at least 15 times every time I see it. And I love the dance those people do on the steps. MY FAVORITE SCENE OF ALL TIME IN THAT MOVIE: the kicking scene. Every Ferris Bueller fan should know what I'm talking about. It's just so hilarious and the perfect comic timing is so there. It's just hysterical. FERRIS BUELLER is a movie that defined our generation and I'll never forget it. Thank you John Hughes for such a great movie Quit the Disney movie remakes do something GREAT like you used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Oddly Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I was in the second or third grade, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" was one of THE movies to see. I caught it on one of those cable channels a few weeks ago and was surprised how much I still enjoyed it. That's odd. Most movie favorites from early elementary school loose their charm with age; but not "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," for some unknown reason.OK, the plot: Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a young, sly con man; think of him as the Sergeant Bilko of high school. Anyway, he decides one day to elaborately fake illness, get his best friend and girlfriend out of school, and have a day on the town.It sounds simple enough, and it was good enough back when I was younger. Still, when I was watching it a few weeks ago I actually found a hidden underlying message. Ferris is just a person trying to help his nervous, paranoid friend gain some self-respect and maybe have a little fun in the process. I know it sounds kind of corny, but there might be a lot more to this film, which may be described by some as "just another high school comedy." I don't think it is, I think it's better than that. Rated PG-13. 98 minutes. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's day off is one of those films that can be taken off the shelf and watched 20 times yet still retains its original luster. When the character Ferris Bueller talks into the camera you almost feel like your right there with him looking over your shoulder every step of the way, not knowing when or where "ROONEY" will pop up. This film provides an hour and a half of quality entertainment, very few films can captivate the youth of america but Ferris Bueller's day off proves strong 2 generations in a row and still going. If your attending high school I suggest renting this, the tips for faking out parents and always staying a half a step ahead of your teachers should come in handy. I think Ferris says it best "Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop to look around once in awhile you might miss it".</fullReview>

Besides all that this movie is hilarious. Ferris is still known as the best example of a high school student in film history. Great performane by Broderick and the leading cast does a good enough job. Poor Jeffrey Jones, everybody recognizes him in his various movies but nobody actually knows who he is. That's cause he always has second billing. Whoever wrote the story and screenplay for this had to have been fresh out of high school. Mia Sara is so hot in this movie! But one question remains. Who has the better rendition of Shake It Up Baby, Mathew Broderick or Rodney Dangerfeild in Back To School?</fullReview>

Every single time I watch it, I start laughing even before the payoff scenes, and laugh even louder when they arrive than when I first was surprised by them in the theatre:Note Ferris's inventive "breaking the fourth wall" manner of talking directly to the audience;Ferris's endlessly creative ways of avoiding school on a beautiful Chicago afternoon;The hilarious juxtaposition of chant-like music and set props when his hypochondriac friend, Cameron, first appears;The roadrunner-and-coyote matching of wits between Ferris and the bumbling school principal and his equally clueless secretary, culminating early on in a phone call that had me falling out of my theatre seat;The first movie appearance of the now-familiar, but hilariously deadpan, Ben Stein ("Anyone?...Anyone?" as a drone-like teacher;The fun-filled escapades around downtown and near-north Chicago, which play like a travelogue of that wonderful city;The unforgettable reaction of Cameron when he discovers what the parking guys have done to his dad's prized sports car (I almost choked to death on that one);The prinicipal's mishap-laden visit to Ferris's home;Charlie Sheen's subtle, yet hilarious, reaction to Jennifer Gray's profane suggestion at the police station;... ...and on and on.It may seem odd that a 46-year old man can call a high school flick from 1986 as the funniest film he's ever seen, but this is it.As the closing-credits music puts it, "Ooooohhhhhhh...... ......yyyeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh!"</fullReview>

You just need to watch this cinematic staple. You don't see it for its drama or soulful enlightenment; you see it to enjoy yourself. Jeffrey Jones, as the bumbling principal hell-bent on destroying Ferris's day off, is hysterical. Jennifer Gray, in her pre-Dirty Dancing days is dead-on as the envious sister.

Of course Hollywood does everything in multiples so this is no surprise. The two other movies I remember with this theme are Adventures in Babysitting and The Night Before (Keanu Reeves in I think the most bizarre prom-night movies ever made.)Ferris Bueller is perhaps the only one of these three that actually works.

		<fullReview>In the 70s, it was cool for directors to look back to earlier times to create feel good films - Grease, American Graffiti being examples.#John Hughes took a different approach in the 80s. His films were about the 80s and its values. As someone who was 18 in 1985, these films mean a lot to me. They sum up the work hard play hard ethic. Except Ferris Bueller - he worked smart and played hard.Ferris Bueller was how we all wanted to be. The guy could bluff his way out of any situation. He had a gorgeous girlfriend, a best friend who idolised him, and access to a Ferrari. In order to cheer up said best friend, he decides to take the day off and show him the outside world. Of course he is being pursued along the way by school principal.The film is witty, artistic (compared to others in the genre), has a great 80s sound track, and really does capture the mood of the times.The funniest character in my opinion is the nutty secretary at the high school. This actress (who played Eunice in Whats up Doc) should have got an oscar.

		<fullReview>In terms of events, a day off for just about anyone is a welcome break - an oasis of freedom in this mad-cap world. As Ferris puts it: "Life moves fast - if you don't stop to look around, you might just miss it." And this is where "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" succeeds. The premise is simple: Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to skip school and heads for downtown Chicago. With girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and Cameron (Alan Ruck)in tow, the trio travel to art galleries, restaurants and even view a carnival. But Principal Ed Rooney is in pursuit of evidence to prove Bueller has been skipping class and therefore can hold him back a year. Hence follows a collection of superb slap-stick incidents and other visual and dialogue gags. This is a top class, feel good movie. Watch it with a smile from ear to ear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't really watched this movie in a while, but I just finished it again. Good lord, man, it's some quality film making. I mean, honestly, I was surprised.Don't get me wrong, I mean, It's always had a special place in my heart. But I never thought of it as real 'art,' or even as a 'film.' It was just some amusing little footnote. But lo, I was wrong. Not only is this an exceptionally well assembled film (noting accomplished film editor Paul Hirsch), but there is some real merit to the subject matter. The writing is smart and pointed in criticism of the mundane. I don't wish to deeply examine the metaphors here, but the inter-cutting between Cameron (Alan Ruck) and "sunday afternoon in the park," by Seurat (actually, I'm not sure about the painting, but that sounds right) was a particularlly nice touch.And since I mentioned him, Alan Ruck delivered an amazing performance as Cameron. All of the actors were in fine form here, and subtle measures including shots of pivoting feet or hand gestures show the director Alan Hughes' expertise in the craft; however Alan Ruck is particularly noteworthy. The character of Cameron is a quietly multi-dimensional one. Whatever his situation throughout the film, he retains another level of, well, pain. He is the suffering one. He has had a loveless childhood. He is nervous about having stolen his father's car. He is resentful of Ferris for having all the luck. All of these things are apparent throughout the performance. Not once does Ruck let you forget that he is unhappy, even if he might crack a smile or two. Truly impressive.I was very sad to discover the fates of those who worked on this film. At the time of this commentary, John Hughes has written Home Alone 3. Ruck is wasting his talent on an ABC sitcom (albeit an amusing one). Broderick most recently starred in the farsical slaughter of one of the big screen's most beloved monsters (Godzilla) and is currently at work on the Hollywood adaptation of Inspector Gadget.Whatever will be, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One previous review mentioned that it is impossible to put 3000 miles on a car in a matter of hours. Yes, this is impossible, but it also didn't happen in the movie. If you subtract the mileage displayed (the last digit in orange is tenths of a mile) from what Cameron says, you get a number around 180 miles (I don't remember exactly). 180 miles can easily be driven in 3 or 4 hours if one is motivated enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why so many adore this movie, it has a lot of heart to it and doesn't take itself to seriously, I can also imagine a lot of the older audience feeling delighted to experience how it once felt to be young and careless through the crazy, wacky shenanigans of our three main characters.Beyond all of the laughs, gags and unrealistic situations the movie is shallow and weak, it just feels like the director is trying to over indulge the viewers with happiness. The movie would have had a lot more depth to it if it concentrated on Cameron, how effective would it have been if instead of just showing us Bueller's morning it also contrasted with Cameron's morning to further show the audience just how much more Cameron needs live and let go. What about a scene where Cameron confronts his dad i mean i would have taken that over Bueller's sister snogging Charlie Sheen; that was not necessary at all towards anything other than magically changing her views on Ferris;i was like "wow Charlie managed to rearrange her brain with his tongue".Movie felt like a forced smile and can someone please tell me why there was so much unnecessary cringe when Ferris's mum and dad where pampering him i mean this kids almost going to college, also the trust relationship with his parents is just so damn strange if only my parents were that easy to manipulate. So much more wrong with this movie that could have been fixed if they replaced the numerous cheap laughs with more development of Cameron; i am right in thinking this movie is based around Cameron and not Ferris? anyways this movie is a good pass time but its nothing to marvel at i know I'm gonna hurt a lot of peoples childhoods with that statement but eh...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" endures for a very good reason. John Hughes was a tremendously gifted writer and director, and his talents are what make this movie so damn good. What's really surprising about this movie is that the main character isn't a likable one. So it really speaks to Broderick's abilities that he's able to bring such a 4th-wall-breaking charm to the role. And it's not just the stars, but the supporting cast makes an impact; Jeffrey Jones, Lyman Ward, and -especially- Edie McClurg. She made those scenes in Rooney's office hilarious. And the other really notable aspect is that this movie plays as a love letter to Chicago. The cityscape flyovers, the scenes in the suburb (I've always wanted to live in that neighborhood); these are very picturesque locations. It's visually striking in the same way as "Risky Business". This flick never gets old. It's got a great soundtrack (Hughes really knew how to pick songs), and it excels on all fronts: solid '80s/teen/Hughes movie, and an all-around great comedy. My favorite John Hughes movie.9/10EDIT: Cameron's George Peterson voice is solid gold!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) *** (out of 4)The popular Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to take a day off school so that he can enjoy the beautiful weather with his best friend (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend (Mia Sara). Even though Bueller has created a lot of tricks to pull this day off, he still has to avoid his principle (Jeffrey Jones) who has been waiting four years to bust him for skipping school. FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF comes from John Hughes and it's easy to see why so many people really love this picture. There's a certain innocent quality that comes with it that makes it something rather special and especially when you consider what other types of teen comedies were being released around this time. I think what makes the film work so well is that it really captures the spirit of what it's like really skipping school. I'm sure most people have skipped a day or two and just sat at home because they didn't have the courage or the ways to do what Ferris did so I think there's a certain fantasy appeal that people have with the character and film. A lot of credit has to go to Hughes' screenplay, which offers up plenty of great characters, fun situations and of course it just allows for a good time. More credit has to go to the cast members for being able to pull off their roles. This includes Broderick who is extremely good in the lead role. I think a lesser actor or a lesser performance really could have made this character annoying but Broderick hits all the right notes in making Ferris rather charming. Both Ruck and Sara are good in their supporting roles as is Jennifer Grey in her role as the sister. Edie McClurg adds her typical wonderful charm and even a young Charlie Sheen gets a pretty funny role, although it probably works better today knowing who Sheen became. However, it's Jones who really steals the picture as the principle who is constantly getting himself in one bad situation after another. The comic timing of Jones is quite flawless and he really makes the picture what it is.</fullReview>

Being a six year old at the time, I started taking Ferris' advice on how to fake an illness to get out of going to school....I owe so much to John Hughes. From first grade through my senior year of high school...same tactics and it worked every time.The writing in this film is classic John Hughes, but this time it's the popular kid who's the focus. It also contains several things that make this movie an enjoyable watch: A classic Ferrari, a musical number (or two), an over zealous principal, and Matthew Broderick.It's a must watch, as it is, and always will be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated But Still Fun And Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a teen coming of age comedy written and directed by John Hughes.It stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller together with Mia Sara and Alan Ruck.Teenaged Ferris Bueller is a legend in his own time thanks to his uncanny skill at cutting classes and getting away with it. Intending to make one last grand duck-out before graduation, Ferris calls in sick, "borrows" a Ferrari, and embarks on a one-day bacchanal through the streets of Chicago. Dogging Ferris' trail at every turn is high-school principal Rooney, determined to catch Bueller in the act of class- cutting.But he creatively avoids his school's Dean of Students Edward Rooney, his resentful sister Jeanie, and his parents. During the film, Bueller frequently breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera to explain to the audience his techniques and thoughts.Matthew Broderick charms as Ferris Bueller in this light and irrepressibly comedy about being young and having fun.But there's a definite sense that this was a classic during a particular time frame: the '80s. It's still entertaining though. There's Ferris singing "Twist and Shout" during a Chicago parade, and a lovely sequence in the Art Institute. But it definitely is dated at present and kids of today would barely love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller was either loved or hated by his peers for always getting away with anything he'd do. Some would want him expelled, others want him for Class President. On this extremely eventful day, the audience is invited to follow Ferris, his best pal and his girlfriend from morning to afternoon (when they all should have been in school), enjoying a holiday declared by the resourceful Ferris Bueller.They get to speed on the freeway in a Ferrari, sing "Danke Schoen" on an Octoberfest Float, eat at the most exclusive restaurant in town and always keep just one step ahead of a furious principal in hot pursuit. With fake computer grade and attendance records, Ferris has it made.The scene where the principal hitches a ride on a school bus after having been "torn up" by Doberman watch dogs is worth the ticket price (Oh Yeah!). This is one of the funniest "high school prankster movies" ever! Has it been 20 years already? This is a definite Cult Classic! Right up there with Animal House and Caddy Shack.</fullReview>

Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them.

		<shortDescription>My favorite John Hugues Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the John Hughe's 80's frat pack movies, this is my personal favorite. While The Breakfast Club may technically be better, this movie is just a lot of fun to watch. I would love to try and do exactly what Ferris did in this movie, except for the fact that my city is boring and I'm too afraid of getting in trouble.As for negatives, well the musical numbers in the middle were annoying, not saying Matthew Broderick can't sing, but they were pointless and every time I just fast forward through them. Also some moments aren't that funny and go on for too long.The reason this movie works is because of Ferris, and it's weird, I should hate this guy, but he is just so charming and likable. I know I will get hate, but he's kind of like Sam Witwicky for me. Cameron is me, he acts exactly how I would act in this situation. And the movie is so over the top, unlike Breakfast Club, this one doesn't try to be realistic, which is why I like how the princibal acts. And it's just funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a fantastic movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very relaxing, feel good movie to watch, the plot is not overly complicated, all taking place in one day, we are not spoon fed information about these characters, only given necessary stuff about them as the story progresses, it is John Hughes at his very finest. As well as that, it has a lot of heart, it takes place at a time in these three teenagers lives when they are moving on, concerned about what the future may whole, and there s always a hint from Bueller's fourth wall breaks that this day off will be their last for a long time, which adds depth to their fun sheenagins. The cast could not he any better, Matthew Broderick shines as the title character, it will always be his greateat role, his on screen chemistry with Alan Ruck and Mia Sara is flawless, Jeffrey Jones steals all his scenes, Jennifer Grey is as talented as always and a cameo by a young Charlie Sheen is still some of my favourite work from him. Funny, heartwarming and simple, Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that less can sometimes be more, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. Ferris Bueller decides to take a day off school, convincing his parents that he's sick and encouraging his best friend and girlfriend to tag along, but his sister and principal are not falling for his tricks. Best Performance: Alan Ruck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a break from Intense Drama movies and watch this .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American teen movie, which any teenager of any country can relate themselves to. Such is the quality of stories written by John Hughes. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a high school senior student, takes a day off from school and plans to have fun with his best friend, Cameron, played by Alan Ruck and his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara). The movie, with hilarious effect, revolves around the trip of Ferris and also how he manages to trick his parents and principal, Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), even under his sister's reproachful eyes. Credit goes to John Hughes for some of the really side-splitting funny scenes. Jeffrey Jones is superbly funny as the determined principal who tries to catch Ferris red-handed and then falls to Ferris' pranks. Broderick, Ruck and Sara, they all do their parts and delivered a nice performance together. Jennifer Grey is also good as Ferris' resentful sister. Lastly, quoting Ferris " Life moves fast. If we don't stop and look around a bit, we might miss it" , one could say sometimes it's great for the movie-watchers to take a break from watching all those high intense drama movies and watch some light-hearted movies like this. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Bueller still relevant?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a 1980s comedy classic. This is a statement I believe most people would have a hard time finding fault with, but the question is -- how relevant is this movie today? For the most part, I'd say the film has aged relatively well. Sure, a lot of the elements are dated, such as the clothes, technology, fashion, and expressions of the day, but having said that, I still feel it is relatable to today's generation. Everyone's had a god-awful, boring teacher like Ben Stein, a friend who was wound up too tightly like Cameron, and a friend who got away with everything like Ferris.I do like this movie, but I've seen it so many times over the years that I do feel it's been played out. Now when I watch it, I don't laugh because I think it's funny, I laugh because I remember thinking it was funny in the past, and now it seems it's just a conditioned response.Realistically, it's probably highly unlikely, if not altogether impossible for Ferris to have done all that he did during his day off in the Windy City, but it wouldn't have been very fun to watch a movie called, "Ferris Bueller's Uneventful Day Off" either.The only problem with a movie as famous as this is that by the time you see it, assuming you've never seen it before, you probably know or have heard a lot of the famous lines, but never in context. It's worth seeing if only to be able to say you've seen it, too.This movie is definitely what put Matthew Broderick on the map, that's for sure. It's strange to think how at one time he played the ultimate cool kid, but now he's been relegated to playing mostly obnoxious losers. Actually, that's just sad.In closing, I'd say I recommend seeing it. However, keep in mind that as funny as you may find it initially, it will lose its luster in time. Is "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" still relevant today? Watch it and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not only one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most inspiring, life-affirming movies I've ever seen. If somebody were simply told this was the story of a teenager skipping school to go on a fun-filled journey through Chicago, many would expect Ferris Bueller to be a reckless teenager that doesn't take his life seriously. These people would then be shocked to find Ferris is taking a day off because he IS taking his life very seriously. Ferris is the person we'd all love to be ? free from worries and problems and simply living life to the fullest. School faculties will hate me for saying this, but it's very exhilarating to see this happy-go-lucky character escape from the mind-numbing prison that is high school, and live his life in absolute freedom. If there was ever a convincing case for truancy, this is it.When I first saw this movie, I immediately related to Ferris's friend, Cameron ? a worried and nervous person who "feels better when he's sick." I have an anxiety disorder, and every now and then find myself in complete fear and panic when faced with a situation that I'm not used to. So to see this character's emotional journey throughout the film was probably one of the most meaningful moments in my history of watching movies. All of the supporting characters are well-crafted, with the principal being the anti-thesis of Ferris(a stressed and gullible man), and his sister being jealous of Ferris's annoying habit of getting away with everything. This film is one of John Hughes's best achievements as a director. He is renowned for having amazing soundtracks that fit beautifully with the images shown. One great example off the top of my head is the art museum scene with an instrumental version of The Smiths' "Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want." The parade scene is the best scene in the film, showing exuberant joy on an enormous scale. Critic Richard Roeper called this film "a form of suicide prevention," and he's right. This film is the ultimate feel-good, laugh-out-loud movie; it might as well be used for therapy. This is definitely John Hughes's best movie, I love it and admire it so much that I want this to be the last film I watch before I die ? that way, I can go out saying that life certainly was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Hughes's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1980s, filmmaker John Hughes made a considerable, almost shocking amount of brilliant work in a short span of time. There is of course "Thriller", his music video classic with Michael Jackson performing one of the defining songs of the 80s. He also made an impressive body of work with "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink," and "The Breakfast Club." While these movies are fantastic pieces blending a perfect synthesis of contemporary accuracy and thematic timelessness, there is one movie in his career which stands out above all others: "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." First off, the plot is very impressive. The four main threads - Cameron's insecurity, our hero Ferris with Sloan at his side, Rooney's dogged quest to bust Ferris the truant, and Jeanie's seething rage at her brother's successes - weave in and out of each other almost seamlessly. While there's been a long-controversial problem with Ferris's ability to do so many things in such a short amount of time, it should be at least clear that one could conceivably do what Ferris does, given determination and a little bit of luck. And anyway, time factors are not the point. Ferris set out to have an ideal day, and because he IS Ferris Bueller, he makes it happen despite the odds.As sophisticated and well-written a plot can be, it takes the actors themselves to give flesh to the bone. The casting was so flawless that it's hard to imagine anybody BUT Matthew Broderick as Ferris. The chemistry between all of the actors is quite genuine. Alan Ruck and Broderick were friends and colleagues on Broadway before the film, and given Jeffrey Jones' later criminal record as a sex offender, he is a perfect portrayal as the unnerving, oily law enforcer. Plus, Ben Stein in his brief role as an economics teacher is absolutely hysterical.The one thing that gives the film more depth than other John Hughes films, and what makes the film so stunning, is the philosophy behind it. Last year an Australian journalist wrote a piece declaring that he learned everything there is to know in life by watching the film. I don't have the link anymore, but you should be able to Google it. It's well worth the read, and only goes to show that Hughes wanted to illustrate a larger point about life. To paraphrase Cameron, we need to take control of our own lives when and where we can. Life is just too short to be miserable, and even one day of pure, unbridled freedom can make up for 18 years of insecurity and fear."It is a BEAUTIFUL day in Chicago." Truer words are rarely spoken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a highly entertaining teen comedy after over twenty years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This popular teen movie was first released the year I was born, so obviously, I didn't have the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen back in 1986. I didn't even know about the film throughout my childhood and early teens (I was obviously too young for the majority of that time), but was finally introduced to it when I was around Ferris Bueller's age. I saw quite a bit of it at the time, but didn't see the rest of it until later. I have watched the entire thing again since then, and can say that overall, it's definitely my kind of comedy! On a beautiful day, fairly close to the end of Ferris Bueller's senior year, the rebellious student decides to take the day off. In the morning, he pretends to be sick, and even though this is certainly not the first time, his parents still buy it. Now that Ferris has the day off, he calls up his friend, Cameron Frye, who really is sick, and manages to lure him out of bed so he can try and enjoy the day with him! Together, they manage to get Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson, out of school by making phony calls. All three of them go out to have fun, but Ed Rooney, the school principal, just knows that Ferris isn't really sick, so he goes out, determined to bust him and prove to other students that he is not a good role model! Ferris' sister, Jeanie, is aware of her brother's tricks, and also wants to bust him! The popular high school rebel may be in trouble, as he will not graduate if he is caught!I must confess, I think there were a few jokes I didn't get, even though I can't think of any off the top of my head right now. I don't know if these are dated jokes that I didn't get because they're before my time, or if it's something else. However, for the most part, this certainly wasn't an issue. For me, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is mostly highly amusing, filled with slapstick and silliness! If you ask me, there are so many comic highlights in the film, including Cameron's reaction to Ferris taking out his father's rare, extremely valuable Ferrari, and the trouble poor Ed Rooney experiences as he tries to bust Ferris! The film may go downhill a bit towards the end, but in my opinion, this is not much of a problem. For those who are into the kind of humour that "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" has to offer, I think it should be entertaining to some degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teen flick king John Hughes is writer/director for this escapist movie about how high school kids should try not to let life pass them by in the prime of their youth.A great boppy soundtrack which includes Yello's "Oh Yeah" and "Twist and Shout" from the Beatles accompanies Matthew Broderick's refreshing turn as the excessively confident and immensely popular young Ferris. He is perfectly cast, as is Mia Sara, the attractive girlfriend, and Alan Ruck, Ferris' ever paranoid and worrying friend Cameron who supplies the trio with their 'choice' transport, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. Also great value are Jeffrey Jones as the Dean of Students from hell who is determined to catch Ferris, and Jennifer Grey as the insanely jealous sister with an attitude. Charlie Sheen drops by with a cameo as a drug fiend with some friendly advice.While one of Hughes' best teen comedies, the movie still has his trademark misplaced scenes. Much of the attempts at drama are corny, the serious moments don't work and any moral messages fall flat. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" works best sending itself and other films up. Some very clever comedy is evident and Hughes produces some hilarious scenes including two terrific running gags involving firstly an over the top "Save Ferris" campaign and secondly a little tune called "Auf Wiedersehn". Broderick talks to the camera through much of the film which proves to be relatively effective.Friday, May 19, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen; it is full of humor and wisdom. Although in China's educational system, the dramatic condition in the movie can never be happen, the movie still makes me recall my life in high school. Furthermore, Ferris's passion with life, altitude with difficulties has embarrassed me. Lately, I found myself more and more incline to see those bald sides of life, and at the same time lack the courage to face difficulties. Maybe, to some degree, just like Cameron once did in the movie. After watching the movie, I found myself quite relaxed and have some kind of impulse which maybe show I am on my way to change my condition^_^</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He is known as the philosopher of adolescence, the creative genius behind the cash cow that is "Home Alone", and, last not least, incumbent role model for Kevin "Silent Bob" Smith. Writer-director John Hughes is all that and more. In a movie packed with memorable moments and outrageously funny scenes, he conveys the laughter and tears that come with growing up. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick, arguably in his career's single moment of glory) radiates an indestructible zest for life, culminating in his spirited performance of "Twist and Shout" atop a parade float in Chicago's Von Steuben Day parade. Outstanding performances by Alan Ruck as world-weary Cameron and Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney, the headmaster from hell. Notable guest appearances by Jennifer Grey as Ferris' ball-busting big sister and Charlie Sheen as a juvenile delinquent. Watch it, then watch it again. "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" gets better every time. Promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must have for any DVD collection! It's great stuff and a lot more fun than nowadays 'comedys'My personal experience with Ferris Bueller: about 20 years ago, I used to be like 10 years old, my brother had a copy on VHS. I must've watched it between 15 to 20 times and never got bored with it.On the forum I see suggestions for a remake, but this movie doesn't need a remake. The original still stands tough as a rock. My favourite moment: when Ferris'sister and mr. Rooney meet in the house. This had had me rolling over the floor. Go look on the internet for a copy. If you're unfamilliar with it, look up a preview on the tube or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Squeezing out that last possible sick day just before high school graduation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some really high reviews on this thread, while FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is definitely a funny movie it is not the greatest comedy of all time. But it is in that group of films with varied backgrounds (the HOME ALONE series for instance) where the grown-ups are easily out-witted by the children or high schoolers who confront them. Jeffrey Jones is Principal Ed Rooney. He runs a pretty taut, well run school, but there is one annoying fly in the ointment: Senior high schooler Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), who is extremely plausible and clever. Ferris understands the limits of the system Rooney dominates, and manipulates it. Ferris has a nice personality, so most people like and trust him. He certainly knows how to manipulate his two parents (Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ford) who are too busy in their business careers to pay sufficient attention to Ferris' activities. They feel he is a wonderful boy, which drives Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) crazy. Both Jones and Grey want to catch Ferris in the act, the former to discredit him with the students who regard him as a role-model and hero, the latter to force her parents to realize what a phony he is.The plot of the film is simple. With about one or two months left before his graduation from high school, Ferris wants to take the last possible day of sick-leave off, but to do so with both his closest friend Cameron/"Cam" Frye (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara). Make a real day of it in their home town (Chicago), doing all sorts of wonderful things. Cameron has health problems (usually dealing with his lousy home life - his parents hate each other, and his father is a car collector and restorer who loves his 1960 Mazzerati more than his wife or son). Ferris times a serious chest ailment of his own to occur on at the same time as Cam's absence. He sets it up using the electronic wizardry he has developed, complete with a fake Ferris covered up in bed who is "snoring" while "sleeping", and a series of recorded messages linked to the intercom in his home for anyone (including Rooney) who tries to call him to the door. As for Sloane, Ferris manages to get her released from classes (and leave Rooney with egg on his face) for the sudden "death" of her grandmother. We gradually watch the next eight hours (until 6:00 P.M., when both his parents return home) unfurl, with Ferris, Cam, and Sloane going to a fine restaurant, going to an art museum, going to a Chicago Cubs game, and taking over a parade, while Rooney gradually manages to figure out he's been duped, but always finding himself not in command of the situation. He insults strangers who spit on him. He misses seeing the kids on a televised baseball game (he barely listens to what is going on in the game...or what the game is!). He runs afoul of a mean dog. His car is towed away. And Jeannie also discovers her suspicions about Ferris are correct, but she ends up arrested as a result of a phone call. The enjoyment of the day for Ferris, Sloane, and Cam is mixed - Cam's personal problems (which are symbolized by the Mazzerati) are too big for him to get away from...or seemingly so. And Ferris and Sloane are aware that they may not be able to maintain their romance after Ferris graduates.A clever film with good performances, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF really delivers. If I must choose my favorite performance it's a toss off between Jones and Broderick, but I may add that towards the end Charlie Sheen as a teenager arrested on a drug charge does quite nicely opposite Jennifer Grey. Certainly a worthy film comedy to watch...particularly on one's day off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer (Home Alone) and director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club; Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles), I remember seeing this once before, but I needed a second viewing to appreciate it even more. Basically street-wise teenager Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) convinces his parents, mother Katie (Cindy Pickett) and father Tom (Lyman Ward), that he has a serious illness forcing him to stay home and miss a school test. In reality he is faking to take the day off, and he has plenty of tricks, gizmos and back-ups to make sure he has little chance of getting caught. To make his nice spring day much more enjoyable he needs his best friend Cameron Frye (Speed's Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) to join him. Knowing how often he has been absent from school, overly suspicious Dean Ed Rooney (Beetle Juice's Jeffrey Jones) knows Ferris well, and he wants to catch him in the act this time. Ferris, Cameron and Mia meanwhile have taken the convertible Ferrari 250 GT California, beloved by Cameron's father, to have a city adventure in Chicago. In the day they take the Ferrari to a garage with two untrustworthy attendants, eat at a fancy restaurant stealing someone else's reservation, watch a ball game, visit an art gallery, and take part in an annual parade. The parents have been fooled by Ferris's contraptions and stuff to thinking he is still at home in bed, but Rooney is going to all lengths to prove he isn't. So he goes to one or two places before going to the Bueller residence to find Ferris himself, and suffering all the humiliations of the house, e.g. mud, the dog. After a long day, Ferris, Cameron and Mia take the Ferrari back, but Cameron decides when it gets damaged, oh, and goes speeds backwards down the hill, to stand up to his father. Also seen in the story by the way is Ferris's sister Jeanie (Dirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey) who is resentful and jealous of Ferris, because he gets away with loads and she doesn't. In the end, Ferris races home to be there at the time his father said he would return, and when it looks like Rooney has busted, Jeanie backs him up and he gets away with it all. Also starring Edie McClurg as Grace, young Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, The Mask's Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley. I love teen movies like American Pie, and this is considered by many as the ultimate skiving film, and with great performances by Broderick, Ruck and Jones, and early appearances by Grey and Sheen, it is good fun comedy. It was number 26 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not terribly fun for adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to say something unpopular here. Ferris is not a very likable character. While I loved this movie as a kid, and I find the surreal aspects of the movie incredibly enjoyable, it hasn't aged very well. Viewing the picture as an adult, I find Ferris to be ultimately too selfish, too narrow-minded, and too pseudo-intellectual.Regardless, the film is fun, but only until you grow out of it, then it becomes a reminder of how short our sight is as a know-it-all high school student.The characters are pleasant caricatures, the only exception being Cameron, who is treated poorly.To see a real high school hero, go watch the Ferris knockoff, Parker Lewis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic. It's actually good clean fun to follow "Ferris" through his day playing hooky. And it's not his first time. This is an endearing character who "gets away with everything". (Save Ferris!) His principal is out to get him. Will he succeed in bringing Ferris down? His sister is angry...She never gets away with anything. She knows he is faking. How can she get through to her parents and expose her brother for the faker he is? (Recognize the guy she joins on the couch? None other than bad-boy bro to Bratpacker Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen...) Not to mention, Ben Stein's breakout role ("Bueller....Bueller..."), this also brought Jennifer Grey and Matthew Broderick to America's attention. (Feel sorry for Michael J. Fox...I heard he turned down this role. But he already had our attention, didn't he?) I went to the theater twice to see this one when it came out. I don't own it -- yet -- but am looking forward to adding it to my collection. Well worth sitting through this one. Enjoy it with your friends and even your kids. It's a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of John Hughes's few films I can watch over and over and not get tired of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I'm not big on John Hughes's 80s movies, but there are some exceptions that do spring to mind (Breakfast Club is fun to watch when it pops up on TV, his script to Vacation is always very funny, and he had some underrated films with Planes Trains &amp; Automobiles and especially with Uncle Buck). This, however, comes to mind as being a thoroughly enjoyable movie for kids, teens, adults, old people, etc, as it has that universal core- school stinks, enough to have one epic cut day, perhaps. Also at this core are some extremely good performances elevating the material. Matthew Broderick is in one of his most memorable parts as the title character, faking sick so he can a) get his friend Cameron (Alan Ruck, arguably his best role and performance to date), a closet-case, to allocate his father's golden calf in the form of a 61 Ferrari, b) get a friend, Sloane (Mia Sara) out of class, and c) take a tour of Chicago that forms as substantiative on its own and as a kind of fill-in-the-blank for other kids watching the film. What would you do on a day off? Some of the dumber parts of the movie, however still very funny and almost perfectly played depending on the scene, come from Jeffrey Jones as the smarmy, determined principal. And rounding out the cast is Jennifer Grey (pre-new nose) as the suspicious, jealous sister Bueller. All in all, even with sophomoric and diluted moments, it's an overall excellent chance at material that is just a lot of fun, even in its more dramatic moments. Darker issues are dealt with, such as with Cameron (and dealt on the somewhat shallow level of Hughes movies that only really broke with Breakfast Club). But in the end you watch the film for the all-too-memorable lines, kitschy moments, crazy turns at using the camera for comedy (as it pulls out of Cameron's mouth as he screams over the car), and music that is quintessentially catchy 80s. Funniest scene though is the call of Norm Peterson, on par with the funniest scenes in all modern comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bueller? Bueller?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw this film in the movie theater. I wanted to go to Chicago and live in the suburbs like those kids. You have to admit that Ferris is a pretty strange name for a kid. Anyway, I love this film. It has a great cast including Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Grey, Mia Sara, ALan Ruck, Edie McClurg, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Pickett, and I must have left somebody out. Anyway, Ferris takes off school on a beautiful spring day. He fooled his parents but not his sister played wickedly by Jennifer Grey before she did Dirty Dancing. Anyway, Ferris is one of the most popular kids in his overcrowded high school. Also Ben Stein made his acting debut as his homeroom teacher where he repeats Bueller several times. THe film's cast is always excellent and in place. I will never understand some things like why Ferris has to be home by 6 P.M. or why the school buses run so late but I'm not going to ask questions. Ferris, his girlfriend Sloane, and his best buddy Cameron (odd names?) have a memorable day in Chicago. They go to museums, see a parade, a ball game, and have dinner in one of the city's finest restaurants. Of course, Ferris has to convince his parents that he's sick or ill. The town rallies around his survival. Of course, it's not always perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** Matthew Broederick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Edie McClurg. Directed by John Hughes. Comic icon John Hughes strikes again with this uncanny comedy of epic proportions, after winning big with other teenage films "Breakfast Club" and "Sixteen Candles". The story about a teenage kid Ferris (Broderick) who decides to take the day off with friends; high strung Cameron (Ruck) and his girl friend Sloane (Beautiful Sara). With principal Ed Rooney (unforgettable Jones) hot on his trail (so he thinks) and determined to catch Ferris if it's the last thing he does. One of the funniest movies about a day in the life of a teenager that just wanted to skip school. Hughes is the master of comedy when it comes to High School, one of my favorites. My final rating 10/10.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, Ferris and his gang try to do everything there is to do in Chicago while evading the constant interruptions of his annoying principal who tries to catch Ferris skipping school. The movie also consists of well done chemistry between Ferris and his girlfriend Sloan. Tagging along with the two is Ferris's best friend, Cameron. Despite Cameron's constant worrying of being caught, the gang lets loose in 2 extremely entertaining hours. It isn't an Oscar winner by any means however it was made to be a box-office hit, not a drama. In all, it is an extremely entertaining, funny, and enjoyable film (directed towards ages 11-25).</fullReview>

Everyone knows a Cameron, after all, what would life be like without someone to worry for you and make fake phone calls? Sloane just goes along with whatever plan she's presented with, and always adds a little extra fun to the adventure. You can't help but fall in love with the witty,and rule- "bending" Ferris, who also shows us that life is more than our work and responsibilities, we can have a whole lot of fun on the way!! So remember, "Life moves pretty fast, and if you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you might miss it" So take a break, you wouldn't want to miss your "Day Off"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1985 I saw this film on a plane. An after that it became part of my life. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is not just a film, but its an instruction manual for a teenager to real life, guiding them to become a success. Its true, FBDO is a film that can build confidence, cure depression and make you realize that everyday of your life should be filled with as much fun, learning and excitement as you possibly can, and in many cases not even spend a penny. Successful people in the world are those who are confident, speak clearly and know how to plan and have great time management. Ferris Buellers Day off will be the cheapest MBA you could ever pay for, and perhaps be just as good. Trust me I have one from Oxford. Since 1985, 20 years later, I have seen FBDO 109 times, and know the dialogue by heart and even the entire cast including the extras. And I could put it on right now and watch it again. By 1996, with the scope of the Internet, it was only then I realized that I was not alone. Millions of people where Ferris fans and the film had a strong cult following. A TV serial was made, but without the originals charm, its popularity died. Matthew Broderick played Ferris Bueller as if he was born for the part. His on screen presence portrayed true charisma and charm. Broderick has never played a role more perfect since. 20 years on the film still does not look dated, in spite of DOS operated computers and the use of payphones (no mobiles / cell phones invented then) as John Hughes used classic cars and posh surrounding that fit in well even in the year 2005 and beyond. Save Ferris!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller is an incredible student, respected by all the teenagers at his typical school, excluding his sister, who despised him for his lack of care and hated how he got away with everything all the time. One day when the sun is shining, Ferris decides there is no way he'd be seen and school on a day like that. He convinces his parents that he is terrible ill and calls his best friend Cameron to drive over so they can spend the day having first-class fun. After the two of them manage to sneak Ferris' girlfriend Sloane out of school, they plan a day of pure excitement and end up in a race against time to stay out of trouble.This film is a light entertaining feature with moments of embarrassment and hilarity. I can't imagine anyone being able to crown it a 'favourite' movie as it's not particularly memorable or unique. It's important to remember that it's essential to watch films apart from those. How can you call a film unique if all you watch is those which stand out? This is not unmissable movie but it's the best of it's kind. Late night in with a couple of friends and you're all pretty tired? Watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a riot! One of the best comedies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its age, 'Ferris Bueller' has to be one of my favorite comedies. There are some annoying sequences and the odd cliche, but mostly it's a well-written, funny take on a boy, Ferris (Matthew Broderick) who plays hooky from school, while trying to dodge the ever-annoying principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his parents (Cindy Pickett &amp; Lyman Ward).Although the plot is well-known to most, I still have to say:***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***Grade 12 student Ferris Bueller decides, impulsively, to take the day off &amp; play hooky. He contrives a plan to get his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school, and cajoles his pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) into going along. Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jones) who discovers Ferris has been absent 'niiiiiine times this semester', also contrives a plan - to catch him in the act in order to keep Ferris from graduating. Ferris &amp; his pals take off into Chicago, eating at expensive restaurants, seeing museums, and getting caught up in a parade (in a very badly overblown sequence). Mr. Rooney, meanwhile, tries to break into the Bueller home but finds himself confronted by the family Rottweiler and - later - Ferris's sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey). What follows is a comedy of errors as Rooney finds himself sinking into a mudhole, getting chased by the Rottweiler, and being confronted by an obnoxious flower-delivery man. ***END SPOILER WARNING***The parade sequence was overdone and some of it was totally unnecessary, especially the 'Twist &amp; Shout' sequence. I found myself squirming in my chair until that one was over. It also seemed a little cliche in the sequence where Ferris is racing to get home before his parents, and stops while running through a yard to introduce himself to 2 girls in bikinis suntanning in their yard. The teachers are portrayed as dull, boring, uninspiring goofs (which is exactly what I thought of some of mine!), especially the economics teacher (Ben Stein, in the role that launched his career) whose dull, monotone voice...'Anyone? Anyone?...the Great Depression...' left the students in an apparent trance, most staring at him with their mouths agape or in one case, asleep on his desk and drooling. The english teacher (Dell Close) was another favorite, leaving Sloane and her classmates in la-la-land with his bland, dragging voice; 'In....what...way...does the author's use of prison....symbolize...' This guy reminded me of teachers I'd had in Grade 8! By the end of these takes I was roaring. I'm not going to spoile the ending except to say it is hilarious as it shows what finally happens to Mr. Rooney. Rent it to find out!**** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is adorable and well made. If every film was based around sheer entertainment value, I believe, for me, this one would take the cake.And even thought it's called "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", for me, Cameron steals the show. I read on this site that Anthony Michael Hall turned down this very role, fearing he'd be type cast. That was a definate blessing in disguise. Alan Ruck took the role and he gave the character a thousand more dimensions than anyone, let alone Hall, could have contributed. Cameron Frye is my favorite character of all time and I know I wouldn't be saying that if he was portrayed by anyone other than Ruck. I love you, Alan Ruck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really really did not like this movie. I found Ferris Bueller's character way too annoying as the know-it-all under achiever that gets away with everything and drags us along for the ride.As for Mathew Broderick well, he an actor much like Kevin Costner; which means if Broderick is to be a scientist then it is Broderick as the scientist or if he is to play Robin Hood then it is Broderick as Robin Hood. In other words he does not become the character the character becomes him.And I am beguiled as to how destroying your father's prized sports car will prove anything???The only movie I demanded by movie back for after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only slightly better than a college movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers.You know those college movies they show late at night on the USA network? There's always an evil authority figure, a bunch of free-spirited and ergo protagonist teenagers that we're supposed to root for, a violent dog, a cool car, and a winsome young girl. This film has all of that and more.I never liked this film. There is something so inherently unlikable about a boy who cheats the system and emerges the winner. Who cares if America is going down the toilet due to truancy, at least the kids will get to ride around in a cool car and play make-believe at Chicago's finest restaurant. But I suppose that is the American dream; who cares about good grades?Matthew Broderick is perfect in the role of the miscreant Ferris Bueller, the boy who mortgages his future by skipping school. He talks to the camera, sings in the shower, lies to his parents, and convinces his best friend to steal his father's car. Nice role model.Jeffrey Jones, who has been shown since his star turn as the Emperor of Austria in Amadeus to take any role that he is offered, lowers his standards (if he ever had any) several notches and participates in John Hughes's prequel to the ouch-that-hurts-fest of Home Alone. Lest you forget, Hughes is the same man who wrote `Beethoven' and `Flubber'. There's plenty of slapstick comic relief as Jones is hurt many, many times. I guess it would be funny to an eight-year-old.Cliches abound: snooty restaurant hosts, flummoxed school secretaries, air-headed parents, hateful sisters. Gee, this thing wrote itself. I've been all over the world from Costa Rica to Paris and I have never seen a snooty restaurant host. Much like the mythical `quicksand' that supporting cast usually get stuck in, the snooty restaurant host only exists in films as fodder to advance the plot. Also, someone please explain something to me: where the Hell did the parade come from? It's a school day and a working day for most people, yet there is a parade. Where did it come from? What holiday or event are they celebrating? The whole Ferrari-crash-through-window thing was the most pointless movie scene ever. Empty and soulless, this film says nothing except that ruining your father's car and house is a good thing to do if you are depressed.I will never understand this dreadful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic teen comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as the title character. Its the only time in his career he did a John Hughes movie and boy did he pick a good one, but its mostly because of him that its so good. Ferris enjoys life, has a ton of friends and a very pretty girlfriend named Sloane Peterson. The only strain in his life is his best friend Cameron who is prone to anxiety attacks, wild mood swings and general unpleasantness.One day Ferris decides he cannot bear school so fakes an illness to spend the day with Sloane &amp; Cameron. They go to Chicago, see the city from way above, go to the Art Institute of Chicago and a Cubs game, have lunch in an upscale restaurant, and join in on a parade. While all that is going on, Ferris is being found out by the principal Ed Rooney. His sister is also after blood because she knows he's faking it and is jealous of his ability to get what he wants. Its all for fun and a lot of it works, but for me the movie drags considerably when Cameron starts in on his litany of problems. I am not unsympathetic to a teenagers problems, but they are in the wrong movie. The best thing about this movie is the parade. Ferris yells 'Twist and Shout' by the Beatles and all of Chicago joins in. Something about all those people, all getting along and laughing and smiling and having a great time, makes me really love that scene.Lastly, what a car! And I don't even drive, but if I had that car I'd learn in a hurry! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I have every seen. I have watched it about twenty times and am still not tired of it. Matthew Broderick is Ferris Bueller. Ferris is the school wise guy. He seems to have an answer for everything. To be exact, he practically runs the school.Ferris decides to skip school one day. His friend Cameron, played by Alan Ruck, is already home sick. The two manage to get Ferris' girlfriend out of class too. Principal Rooney played by Jeffrey Jones is out to get Ferris at any cost. He always seems to fail miserably trying to catch Ferris playing hookey.The three class cutters don't exactly keep a low profile. They end up in a downtown parade and even on a televised baseball game at Wrigley Field. The trio is also responsible for demolishing Cameron's father's prized sports car.Mia Sara plays Ferris' girlfriend. She just goes along for the ride. Jennifer Grey is wasted in the part of Ferris' sister. Broderick was excellent as the wise ass Ferris. I was most impressed though with Ruck. Sometimes really deadpan, but funny. Jones was hapless and hilarious as the butt of the pranks laid out for him.Sometimes I wish Master Bueller would take another day off!</fullReview>

You make more money you spent. So why even make an effort. You don't even need to be funny to have hit comedy. Poor Jeffrey Jones. He is a great actor.

Bueller is meant to be an irresistible charmer, but he is a self-centered, inconsiderate, and annoying jerk. Since everyone else in this movie has the IQ of a cucumber, Ferris looks like a genius by comparison. The characters are straight out of Central Casting, the script is sophomoric and contrived. As director and writer, Hughes gets all the blame for this lame comedy. The acting is on the level of a sitcom. Sheen has an amusing cameo as a drug addict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Accurate Reflection of the Decade of Grim Optimism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there's three movies produced, filmed, and released in my lifetime that fall into the category of greatness: Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Don't see this movie for the hype. See it because you lived through the eighties. If you didn't live through the eighties, see it because this film gives you the spirit of the decade on a silver platter. You'll learn something.The eighties were about grim optimism, and this sort of semi-nihilistic veneer is expressed in the scene where Cameron and Sloane discuss their interests. Sloane: What are you interested in? Cameron: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.And they chuckle it off like it's no big deal to have no interests in life. Their outlook is positive despite themselves, or in spite of themselves. Meanwhile Ferris lip syncs on a parade float and the world is there to catch him before he falls. The Eighties and the Fifties had many cultural similarities, and let me just point out that Matthew Broderick is the first and only male lead since Johnny Weissmuller in "Jungle Jim" to effortlessly pull off animal prints. Bueller sports two: his vest, and in one scene, his swim trunks. Does this embody coolness? Probably not, but it works here. This film is fun, entertaining, but more importantly it's the best Hughes had to offer us. You know you want to see it. Oh, yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A day in the life of Ferris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies that hit the right spot with the right people and they become cult classics. We all know about star wars and the Rocky Horror Picture show. Did you realise that FBDO is also one of those cult movies. There are those who watch it over and over again....be warned before you get this movie, you could become an addict.The idea behind this movie is great. It is about all the lessons you learn during your school years which you don't actually learn while you are at school.Ferris is the sort of guy that school is good to. He is good looking, but not a jock, he is good at study but not a nerd, everyone likes him, but he is not a hero, he is good looking but wears bad 80s clothes and has a bad 80s hair cut.Skipping school, borrowing his friends dad's Ferrari, singing "twist &amp; shout" at a parade and crashing an exclusive french restaurant don't quite add up to a riveting story.What we have a school student who is not a loser who makes good, but someone who is perhaps too perfect. He is the person whose head you would must like to shove down the toilet and flush on a bad day at school. But he is also the person you like and in many ways admire. He is the over dressed wussy boy you actually want to be (or perhaps date...or both).Like "pretty in pink" it was one of those movies in the 1980s you quietly mentioned to friends you liked only to find they also liked it. Because there is nothing else like it around it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent teen comedy from director John Hughes, who has also done The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles. Matthew Broderick is the hero in the film, he has been in allot of films including The Cable guy and Godzilla. Ferris is a street-wise kid who knows all the tricks. When Ferris takes the day off, so must his best friends, Cameron and Sloane. Cameron is reluctantly persuaded to borrow his father's Ferrari, and together they hatch a plan to get Sloane out of class. Suspicious dean of students Ed Rooney knows all about Ferris, but can never catch him. Ferris' sister Jeanie is also frustrated that Ferris always gets away with his tricks and she doesn't. Furthermore, Ferris is an 'angel' in his parents eyes. It's Ferris' day off, he's out to enjoy himself, and he does!.It is a movie that makes you feel good and gives allot of laughs. There isn't as much Dramatic depth as The Breakfast Club but is just as fun. So sit back and enjoy. Also check out Van Wilder and American Pie!</fullReview>

Maybe this was a good film back in 1986 but now it look very dated . Perhaps this led way for all the teen comedies we see far to many of these days, if so, it has a lot to answer for. Perhaps i am being a little harsh because really it isnt that bad but top 100? no way!

		<fullReview>Author's Forewarning: I am making many comparisons between this and The Breakfast Club because the two represent John Hughes' best work. Forget Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, if you cannot handle such constant comparisons, get a life and start thinking.Matthew Broderick has never grown out of the image he created with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he never will. His poise is correct for the character, proving that John Hughes can make some proper casting decisions. His wise-ass comments are not as clever as Judd Nelson's in TBC, but raise Ferris' character level beyond Bender's.Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones are the real saving graces of this film. Anthony Michael Hall was smart to turn down the part of Cameron because it would be out of his line and, while Ruck never went onto anything better, he did make his declaration here. Jeffrey Jones' Rooney is absolutely in line because, perhaps, he is the only one sans Broderick to understand the overwhelming parody of the movie. I am extremely thankful that Hughes didn't use Molly Ringwald (again) because she is unable to expand on his paper-thin roles. Mia Sara is no better, but at least she has fewer lines.Hughes is more artistic here (in an MTV fashion) and Broderick knows how to exploit this change to his advantage. The editing is both efficient and superior to TBC, but here it is merely editing for the sake of comedy and pacing whereas TBC tried developing character. The script, conventional Hughes as it is (see my Breakfast Club comment), has some key points that both age it and retain its value at the same time.Though Hughes' movies are for teens, their level of credibility ranges from innocent (as in this case) to insulting (Weird Science anyone?), thus I find TBC to be more insightful in the long run. Ferris Bueller has its moments, but there are no long-standing messages to take away other than Cameron's fits. Unfortunately, since Ferris' world is so focused on youth, the distant world of adults is falls into the similar problems of TBC except here it is merely for laughs. There are no brief moments of self-discovery for Ed Rooney.Overall, I give this a tied recommendation level with TBC due to shifts in tone and ideas, but recommended this for anyone between 14-22 years old. 3.5 out of 5 stars. Isn't high school all about malarkey anyway?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why this movie got a score of 7.7 out of 10. It's just another boring teen comedy. Those three high school guys are doing actually nothing on their day off. Just going to restaurant, to a baseball match, etc. The high school principal is a funny character trying to catch the slackers, but has a forced humor. Okay, there are some funny scenes in the movie, e.g. Ferri's father spotting his son in a taxi or in the crowd for a moment, and then in the next moment the guy disappears as he had never been there. I dare say this movie is good for a rainy afternoon, but otherwise don't waste time watching it. I'll rate this move 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend told me i had to see this movie. he said i'd love it and i'd add it to my collection in an instant. not only did i NOT love it, i did add it to a collection. my 'light the movie on fire' collection.This is one of the most infuriating movies i've ever watched in my life. i don't know why everyone loves it, and i was in high school when i first saw this, so i was at the perfect age. and i STILL hated this movie.Besides not liking Matthew Brod (except in lion king) the main thing that frustrated me in this movie is that ferris decides that he deserves to have a day off. This confused me because he'd already had 8 days off and he couldn't have another one off. Now correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't that mean he's already done this EIGHT times? so WHY does he deserve a day off? he doesn't and should be in school. Maybe it's because my mom rocked, but when i didn't feel like going to school because i had a test i didn't study for or something, she let me stay home. however, that's because there was TRUST and i never broke it. This movie spits all over parental/son trust and just everyone in general. I did not find this movie enjoyable in the least. it's the second most overrated movie next to godfather and it's boring and stupid. I felt REALLY bad for the principal and thought Ferris needed to be expelled. then he could have had all the days off he wanted. i saw this for the first time when i was 15 and now i'm 22 and i STILL despise this. The only lesson i gathered is to skip school, wreck a car, and everything will turn out OK. Bull.Ferris Bueller fails the chemistry test, with a 1. out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoy the long and successful run of films that John Hughes had back in the 1980s; PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES has long been one of my very favourite comedies. I'd seen bits and pieces of FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF in the past, but never once had I sat down and watched it all the way through - until now.To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I should like BUELLER because it has an easy-going charm and plenty of incident packed into the running time, but I ended up hating it, and for one reason alone: Bueller himself. He's the most idiotic, sarcastic, and sheer unlikeable protagonist I've seen in a film in a good long time, and never once could I warm to his supposed humour or character. He's a prime example of hubris, thinking himself better than his friends, his classmates, his parents, and his teachers, and I despised him for it. Even worse, Hughes seems to celebrate this cockiness in the character, never once cutting him down to size. This film is the reason I don't like Matthew Broderick as an actor (well, this and GODZILLA), even though he'd previously been good in WAR GAMES.The film itself adopts a journey narrative and offers a handful of memorable set-pieces, including Charlie Sheen's cameo, the elaborate bedroom set-up, and a great public sing-along to the Beatles song. And, although I'm no fan of the actor, Jeffrey Jones has a great role as the antagonist of the piece. FERRIS BUELLER is light-hearted, brash, and full of humour, so it's just a pity that I didn't identify with the jerk lead in any way, shape or form, rendering this a near-unwatchable movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Ferris Buellers day off was released in 1986, it got so much positive reviews and became so famous it had a lot of movies/ TV shows reference it. That's just a brief history of a movie that I think is actually really overrated, frankly. But how come? The story in this is about a teen wise guy named Ferris who pretends to be sick so that he can force his friend to go and lie to get his girlfriend out of school so that the 3 can spend a day in Chicago. The problem with the story is that its just weak. I mean, just a highly sophisticated plan for a day off of school? That's not all. There's no emotional journey for the protagonist, no real drama, and no heartwarming moments. There's also no message. I mean, this film is so lighthearted they lacked all those things. But one thing people might be wondering, is at least funny? Well, the movie actually has some really great humor and plus its a little enjoyable to watch with a great soundtrack. But that still doesn't make up for the pitiful main story. Also, one really bad thing about this movie is that it makes skipping school when there's something important like a test without permission from your parents or teachers so that you can have fun look cool, which is a not a good message at all. I give it a 4.5/10 The characters in this movie. Let me say that they are just one dimensional with no development. First off, our main character, Ferris, is a high school hot shot who's selfish, unlikable when he bully's his Ill friend to go on the trip, and a liar. Like I said, he makes skipping school and being selfish look cool. He is an absolutely terrible role model for kids. His ill friend Cameron, is a character that you can feel bad for because of not wanting to be on the trip to Chicago but he's actually a great guy whose honest, kind, and doesn't find Ferris's selfish acts cool. Ferris's girlfriend Sloane is just a one dimensional girl who agrees to go to Chicago and forgettable. The "Villain" Principal Ed Rooney, is actually good because of trying to bust Ferris, but pointlessly bumbles around the suburbs doing so and has no development, but he's a bit funny. Then there's Ferris's sister, Jeanie, who is aware of Ferris's whereabouts. She's very bland and instantly forgettable.So overall, Ferris Beullers day of is funny, has great music and is enjoyable, but it still has a weak story, and lacks any real drama, emotion, and character development. The characters are all one dimensional with a couple of bland ones. So this movie is just a light hearted comedy, and if you want a movie with a valuable message, this is not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you list the greatest movies of all time, Ferris Bueller makes the cut. From the pale lighting in the school to the large grandiose shots of downtown Chicago, This movie has it all. In what could be Matthew Broderick breakout performance, this movie was a portrayal of one man's effort to just take it easy. The lighting in this movie is worth mentioning, when they are in the high school the lighting is very pale and boring. Much like the school they are in, the natural silence in the classroom is what carries over the boredom in your head as well as the character's learning about "voodoo economics". Also one thing to mention is Ferris bueller's foil in the story, Edward Rooney. Ed is a man who takes his job too seriously and his attempt to finally catch ferris in the act of ditching led for some of the film's more funnier moments. One of the thing that really gets to me is the character development of Ferris' friend Cameron. Cam is a very troubled young man who lives in a very troubled household. My favorite part of the movie is him finding himself and his confidence when he destroyed that beautiful Ferrari and said that his dad and him will have a chat when they get home. His self discovery is something a lot of people can relate to. Overall the story of ferris bueller is one about living life to the fullest and not wasting opportunities. As ferris says "life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop to look around every once and awhile, you might miss it." This movie is a classic and one I can watch a million times over. I suggest that if you are fan of comedy and teenage high school films then this movie is the one for you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 1986, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" chronicles the misadventures of three high school seniors in suburban Chicago when they skip school to have fun in the city (Matthew Broderick, Mia Sara and Alan Ruck). Jennifer Grey is on hand as the title character's feisty sister while Jeffrey Jones plays the dean of students who tries to apprehend Ferris. Charlie Sheen has a glorified cameo as a dude from the other side of the tracks whom Ferris' sister (Grey) meets. Written and directed by John Hughes, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a coming-of-age comedy, but it's so atypical that it stands out from the pack of other 80's flicks of the genre. It has a quirky sense of humor that's so offbeat that it might turn you off upon initial viewing, but you'll catch a grip if you give it a chance. While there's some cussing (which is either realistic or amusing IMHO), there's thankfully no raunch or idiotic bathroom humor; the movie's too smart for that. The three protagonists are great and work well together. Mia Sara is jaw-dropping stunning throughout, but they could've (and should've) seized the opportunity and done more with her.The moral is carpe diem ? seize the day ? a conviction Ferris (Broderick) adheres to, which can be observed when he says to the viewer: "Life goes by so fast that if you don't stop and look around, you might miss it." There are other messages: Cameron (Ruck) learns that living in fear of others' expectations will destroy you. And Jeanie (Grey) learns that resenting someone else's success, whether or not you think it's unfairly won, will eat you alive and morph you into a curmudgeon. While the movie's focus is obviously on Ferris' respite from the mundane and celebrating the freedom thereof he's not selfish. A veiled theme is that Ferris is concerned about his best friend (Ruck) in the face of his father's screwed-up priorities. When Cameron beats on his Dad's prized Ferrari we see his hurt due to a friggin' car being given a place of honor denied to him.Getting back to the main theme and Ferris, was it wrong for him to use deception against his parents and school officials in order to "seize the day," not to mention later deceiving the host at the swank restaurant? Yes, but consider this: Ferris isn't a hoodlum in the least, nor an alcoholic or druggie. He's clearly got it together and brims with confidence; so much so that when he jumps on board a float at a parade he takes the mic and leads everyone in song. It's an absurd scene (and entertaining), but it culminates with a matter-of-fact statement by Cameron to Sloane (Sara): "Ferris can do ANYTHING." When he says this you discern Cameron's monumental respect for Ferris' developing greatness. While it's true that Ferris' confidence and talents CAN devolve into arrogance, he's just an 18 year-old high schooler at this point, on the verge of graduation. Give him a break. He's merely experimenting with his mounting sense of freedom, which will segue into adulthood and the responsibilities thereof. Did YOU make mistakes when you were doing the same in your teens? Of course you did; so did I. For anyone who would argue that it's wrong to skip school, every student is allowed so many absentee days a year and it's clear that Ferris is on top of things, as far as school goes. In fact, there's an amusing scene that effectively shows how uninspiring the classes are. Ferris is more than on top of his education and knows that skipping a day for whatever reason won't hinder his current status or future potential. Furthermore, Ferris is a senior and it's close to graduation time. It's an unwritten rule that seniors skip school to celebrate, whether on official "skip day" or otherwise. Again, Ferris is taking charge of his life and he no longer needs the supervision of school laws and the strident taskmasters thereof. He understands and adheres to the SPIRIT of the law. Speaking of which, consider the most profound subtext, which I've never heard brought up by commentators, although it's obvious when you reflect on the movie: The dean of students, Ed Rooney (Jones), is a sourpuss legalist who naturally tries to squelch the spirit of freedom &amp; life from anyone who would dare embrace it; and Ferris is public enemy # 1. In other words, Rooney represents legalism ? law-ism or rule-ism ? which is the rigid obsession with rules and the corresponding grouchy, joyless spirit. By their very nature staunch legalists HATE the spirit of freedom and will do whatever it takes to stamp it out when they smell it, which explains their nosey tendencies and why Rooney arrogantly feels he has the right to enter Ferris' house and snoop around. The message is: Don't allow crabby legalists to rob you of your true freedom and joy because they'll definitely try. Seize the day!Like I said, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is a smart film; it's so eccentric and goofy that you can easily miss its profundities and write it off as nothing more than a silly 80's teen comedy. It is that, but it also treads the borders of greatness. I didn't like it on my first viewing, but 'got it' on my second, and might love it on my third. The film runs 103 minutes and shot in the Chicago area with Ferris' house exterior in California, as well as interiors throughout. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome movie! Very funny and shows how much of a handful some students can be. As a future teacher, I hope I don't have to deal with Ferris Buellers! Still though it's a great movie that everybody should watch. Its about a troubling young hooky student who gets his friends to skip school with him and shows the excitement and exhilaration of a young student on the run from the teachers and his nemesis the principal. While entertaining, it shows the struggle that some teachers, especially principals have to deal with. Although this particular principal didn't do a very good job, he shows the hard work that has to be put in taking this high authority job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the most enjoyable day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is among the most acclaimed and beloved comedy films of its generation. Which is quite startling as this is a very ordinary, frankly disappointing, film. There's not enough fun, not enough laughs. The movie never truly sparks to life. Ferris Bueller had a pretty eventful day. But it doesn't translate. Ferris, the character, probably found his day off to be wildly exciting. Living it is one thing. Watching it is another. For those of us who can only watch it is not particularly exciting at all.It's an absurdly simple story. High school senior Ferris Bueller skips school and, girlfriend and best friend in tow, goes to Chicago and does some stuff. There's a subplot about the school principal who is obsessed with catching Ferris. This subplot falls completely, and rather annoyingly, flat. The principal is an unfunny irritant. Time spent with him is time wasted. We'd rather spend more time with Ferris and his friends. But honestly the time we do spend with them is disappointing as well. Matthew Broderick gives a game performance, infusing Ferris with some personality. But the girlfriend, played by Mia Sara is a dud. A stunningly beautiful dud but a dud nonetheless. And Cameron, the mopey best friend played by Alan Ruck, is a total drag. Ferris tries to get Cameron to loosen up and have a good time. Not happening. And then, in a film which is meant to be escapist fun, things get all too serious as Cameron has to deal with his unseen, overbearing father. The tone here is all wrong. It puts a damper on a film which wasn't even as fun as it is cracked up to be in the first place. The great adventure Ferris went on wasn't so great. It was quite frankly mundane. Laughs are in desperately short supply. The principal is notably annoying and the other supporting characters, including Ferris's sister, add nothing to the proceedings. The device of Ferris breaking the fourth wall and speaking to the camera is overused and wears thin very quickly. All in all this is a very disappointing movie, one which falls far short of the expectations you would have of it given its stellar reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will first start off by saying this is my favorite movie of all time. Mostly because I loved the idea of ditching school and just going on a wild adventure but was to chicken to actually do it. Ferris is considered the it guy and who wouldn't want to be that. He is always so sly and had so many out of the box ideas. The only thing I am surprised about is how they have the money to actually do all these things...oh ya their rich parents. ha ha I also love the way they portrayed the characters were very interesting to me. This movie is filled with lots of memorable parts and there is a reason for it. John Hughes is a master of creative films that are timeless and he did not fall short on creating Ferris Bullers day off. I have nothing bad to say about this film and it will forever be my all time favorite movie created. End of story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a Cult classic that I watched since I was 5. This Movie has an excellent Story, Cast, Screenplay, and Directing. This Is Matthew Broderick's Best Movie in my Opinion. This Movie is hilarious with Comments and Scenes that are funny. The Movie Is about a Teenager who lies to his parents that he is sick and they believe him and he gets his girlfriend Sloane Peterson and his nervous negative Friend Cameron Frye to have a day off with him until his High School Principal Ed Rooney played by Jeffrey Jones who was later in Beetlejuice chases Ferris through Chicago to his house. Movies to recommend for after you have seen the movie. The Breakfast Club, The Goonies, Sixteen Candles, Meatballs and Dazed and Confused.</fullReview>

Whether it's because of all the laughs or the memories I share with my father, it doesn't really matter I will always love it. Sorry if I'm repeating myself, they are making me write "at least ten lines?" What the heck? Okay.

		<fullReview>I loved this film in its entirety! I liked how fresh an outlook Ferris's character had, he really makes you feel excited about life. I like how the film was more about the people in Ferris's life growing and developing for themselves, in healthier if not better ways than they were already. Apart from the poor prick of a principle/headmaster, every character had a 'happy ending.' It isn't just a film, it's an encouragement for anyone who watches it. For me it says that people can be crazy happy and have their own spontaneous fun in life, not everything needs to be planned out and 'safe by the books'. I loved this film and I loved how it makes me, (and my friends), feel. A definite MUST watch. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cameron Frye's Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off I think this film was great in visuals and I really enjoyed the moments where Ferris is talking to the camera because it seems he is also teaching the audience how to live spontaneously like himself.However, I did not like the pace of the film, if Ferris really was skipping school then there would be a sense of danger throughout the film, whether it was prominent or not. With a faster pace it would have kept me more involved and believed that the events are truly real. John Hughes failed to address this.It feels weird that Cameron developed more than Ferris. Ferris teaches Cameron how to live his life more enjoyably and eventually Cameron succeeds in feeling this way. He decides to take matters into his own hands rather than running away from them. Ferris is a smart-ass throughout the whole film and in the end he only learns that he should be more careful when he goes out and about.Another thing that bothered me is that we barely know anything about Sloane. We know she is Ferris' girlfriend but other than that I don't feel she has any other use in the film.Overall this film was not very good but it had a great theme attached. Live your life the best you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life moves pretty fast ...so take the Ferrari that smells like a diaper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Matthew Broderick became typecast as a lukewarm simpleton, he was the epitome of 80s cool. British flag adorned doors be damned, Broderick was the natural heir to the throne of cinemerican teendom. James Dean was rendered irrelevant the instant a Mohicaned Matthew decided to sing in the shower. I mean this is a righteous dude who can eat pancreas, contemplate modern art, make downtown Chicago sing and dance all in one irresponsible day. Ferris' technological arsenal of tricks designed to dupe adults make anything that Kevin McCallister concocted look childish. But the best thing about Ferris Bueller's Day off is not Ferris Bueller. No! It's his best friend Cameron Howe! Cameron is a depressed hockey player (formerly of the Detroit Red Wings) who quite frankly deserved a sequel based solely around his plight. Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and steal your friend's dad's Ferrari and visit an art museum once in a while, you could run the risk of being lamer than a vest with no leopard print.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a very good film! I heard so many great things about it but for some reason I never got a chance to watch this film until now. I liked this film way better than The Breakfast Club. Compared with that film, this film has more jokes, more action, more fun, and just better chemistry.This film is about a high school senior named Ferris. He skips school for a day so he can hang out with his friend and girlfriend in Chicago. But, he must be on a lookout for his suspicious sister and principal.The acting was really good here. Matthew Broderick is just perfect as Ferris. Another perfect casting choice was Jeffrey Jones as the principal. He actually had the best scenes in the movie. The rest of the cast such as Jennifer Grey and Mia Sara are great too.Overall, this is a fun teen movie that represents the daily lives of high school kids. This movie brought me back some great memories. This film is very good for a film that was written in a week. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) just can't take it and needs a ninth day off from school--so after tricking his parents into thinking he was sick, forcing help from his hypochondriac best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck), and sneaking his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school, Ferris is ready to wreak havoc in Chicago. But, of course, it's all fun and games until someone puts a Ferrari in danger.I'm from the generation of High School Musical and Hannah Montana, so seeing a movie with this kind of quality was a big surprise. My friend made me watch it with her, but I ended up being the one who forced her to wait and watch the end because I loved it so much. It has real, good, clean comedy that doesn't need to use dirty or offensive jokes to make people laugh. This is real entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just put it this way. If an alien crash landed on my front lawn, and if he wanted to know about the 80's perchance; I'd recommend it watch this movie. This movie has style! It's a primer for 80's music, 80's fashion, and 80's education. I could never get enough of this movie as a kid. It is absolutely hilarious. This is definitely one of John Hughes' more perfect and offbeat comedies. Not only was Ferris Bueller cool in his own high school, but if he were real he'd have a statue made out of him in Chicago. One of the funniest things about this movie is how much of a mythological status Bueller has in his own high school. People talk about how uncool the 80's were. That's not true, and this movie proves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, this is a movie that display the real life of a teenager.See, I'm a Mexican 23 year old male. I had an American girlfriend who urged me to watch this movie. I was skeptical taking in consideration that this movie was highly compared with "American Pie" and many other American teen flicks.Well I decided to give it a try some years ago and I was impressed. This movie fits on any part of the world. Ferris has every single and possible clich? that perfectly shows how a teenager's life can be.The situations are hilarious and make you wanna return to high school times. Really! I couldn't stop praising American humor that does not necessary needs scatological references or clich?d mockery against minorities."Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the perfect teenager movie with clever jokes, situations, and extremely likable characters. The chemistry between Ferris, his girlfriend, and his best buddy is simply charming.Ferries takes into practice the "carpe diem" phrase and teaches how a single day can change your life as a student. Sure, we all got responsibilities during that phase but come on, some spice is always necessary if not obligatory.My favorite scenes include the infamous car action where the two valet parking guys ride with the Star Wars score in the background; the way the Principal tells a girl "your ass is mine" thinking it's Ferris; the ending; the song "Oh Yeah" which is now used in "The Simpsons" as the Duff Beer theme, etc.Ah, this is a great movie that hasn't suffered from the strays of time. The best American teen movie to date. Forget about the "American Pie" boom.</fullReview>

The music that was played through out the movie, while relatively unknown, was perfectly placed. John Hughes did a wonderful job with this movie.

Even now I will watch it and laugh out loud. It never gets old. I could probably quote this movie verbatim.The main thing that I have gleaned from this amazing film is that no matter what is happening around you, you control the outcome of your actions. You determine whether or not life is wonderful. That is something Cameron had to learn the hard way.FBDO has also taught me that if you set your mind to something then you will live in your own mind set. Ferris was not only an optimist, but he also took steps to live out his dreams. It did not matter how impossible these steps seemed to be, he still executed every step until his dreams were in the now.Cameron, on the other hand, did the same thing but moving in the opposite direction. He also was living his mind set but was not happy with his life. Cameron had to be shown how to change his thinking in order to live without fear. Ferris in many ways represents a savior while Cameron represents the saved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this not in the top 250 all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe Bueller has so infiltrated society that the powers that be are trying to keep it out of the top 250. The current rating of 7.8 is places 225 through 250. Ferris Bueller's day off is better than:226. 7.8 The Thing (1982), 240. 7.8 Planet of the Apes (1968), 241. 7.8 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), 249. 7.8 Mulholland Dr. (2001).The rest I either cannot make the comparison because I have not seen them, or comparing and contrasting yields relatively equal amounts of strengths and weaknesses.John Hughes also wrote The Breakfast Club which is bubbling under the top 250. John Hughes also wrote series, though purely schlock, which became juggernauts: National Lampoons ... Home Alone ... Beethoven.I say let's get all of the fans of John Candy, Anthony Michael Hall, and Molly Ringwald to help this deserving man, and this film, up into the top 250. How many times did this three gain shine off his lines? It's no The Bridge on the River Kwai, but the camp belonged in the film.The true test of film is not direction or production, but writing. Pierre Boulle's writing is the only thing that got Planet of the Apes into the top 250 and Impressionist production is all that got Mulholland Dr. there. I can't explain how The Thing became so highly rated, it only is there due to cult status and the John Carpenter effect.Where would the Black Pearl be without Johnny Depp? Johnny Depp's in three other rated films: Finding Neverland, Ed Wood, and Platoon, but tell me how the Black Pearl is better than Blow, Chocolat, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Donnie Brasco, Dead Man, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape let alone Bueller? I think that in this particular case It's the yellow mouse cult.oh well, opinions only here and mine says 8 of 10 for Bueller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more I can I say but this movie rocks! A cult classic that will never die! Of course, how anyone could get away with what he gets away with is a little outrageous but that's what makes the movie all the more timeless. It's what everyone (or a lot of people anyway) dreams about at one time or another in their life. Matthew Broderick was an excellent choice for playing the role of Ferris Bueller. One of his best movies in my estimation. Sure he went on to do moves like Glory but he will always be known as Ferris Bueller. It's kind of like Indiana Jones. I can't see anyone but Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. The other characters were all cast very well. Alan Ruck does a very good job as Cameron. He and Ferris combine to make an individual that a lot of people can identify with. The free spirit and the uptight friend. Then of course there is Sloane. She's hot. THat's really all I need to say there. However, I will say this. She too was cast well. She fit in and the trio just worked really well. I love to just turn on this movie and have it running in the background as I do other things. All in all I give this movie a fifteen out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conclusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hughes has always had a problem with ending his films. It seems he enjoys expanding his slapstick to its fullest extent, but suddenly - right when we're getting comfortable - he realizes he has to end the picture and resolve the conflicts of his characters, so he diverts the course and natural progression his movie and it transforms into an introspective psychology session.Point in fact: "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." The first half is excellent. Our heroes our introduced, comedy ensues and we have a great deal of fun watching the narrative unfold.The second half - or more appropriately, last third - of the film is not excellent. Suddenly Hughes realizes Bueller's foil, Cameron (Alan Ruck), must confront his father. That Bueller's sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) must come to terms with her resentment towards her brother. That Ferris must contemplate the meaning of life, marriage and love between himself and his wife-to-be (Mia Sara).It's this type of stuff I can't get into. Look, I really love some of the stuff Hughes has done. He's a very good filmmaker. But he's always had a problem with endings and pretensions... the turning point for me in "Ferris Bueller" is when Cameron stares into the oil painting at the museum in Chicago...from here onwards Cameron goes into this weird state of comatose (particularly towards the end), Ferris starts talking to us about moving on to college, how Cameron's dad is a jerk, etc.Of course this is a natural conclusion for any film or literary writing - conflict --&gt; desire --&gt; outcome. But Hughes' problem is that his change in progression is too swift - the movie goes from being a light-hearted comedy to this pretentious study of teenage angst in which it takes our selfish Cameron hours to realize he must step up to his father...and for what reason? At what cost? What truly is the point? For Ferris, a great future awaits him. He will marry his high school sweetheart, go to college, continue milking friendships for what they're worth. His sister will get a new boyfriend and stop hating her brother.But poor Cameron...his revelation at the end of the movie is that he's going to step up to his father and almost certainly face a miserable life? Yes, it's nice on film to see Cameron "rebel" against his strict father...it's a teenage ideal...all fathers are evil. But come on already - wrecking a Ferrari and having your character's inspiration be taking the blame for it is a lame ending. I've never liked it.I understand many people do. Somehow, I can see why. As I'm writing this, I have to admit, it doesn't sound quite as pretentious as it comes across as being in the film. One could say the same thing about any teen movie - particularly "Risky Business." But there's just something about this one. It suffers from that flaw Hughes has had his entire career. He just doesn't really know how to end his film (he's admitted this before... he said in an interview he never likes to end a movie, and that's why his closings always extend with extra footage while the credits scroll down).Sometimes he's gotten away with it - "The Breakfast Club" for example. That movie ended with a sudden introspective moment where the kids all got together and examined each other's problems. But it made more sense, given the context. It was justifiable. The ending of "Bueller" is not. I think it's childish and myopic.I do realize I've just repeated myself for about ten straight paragraphs, but that's something that's always bothered me about this film and I had to get it off my chest.What I DO like about it: (1) Matthew Broderick is hilarious and perfect for the role (2) The first hour or so is very funny and straightforward comedy (3) The characters are likable and seem realistic (4) Jeffrey Jones' quest to find Ferris is a very strong subplot...and so on.It's just a shame, you know, about that ending...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divine Slacker Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watchable and infinitely re-watchable. Loved it when it first came out nearly (gulp) 20 years ago and whenever airing on television (unexpurgated version, please). Great journey into the day of the life of a high school anti-hero and his escapades throughout Chicago. Entire cast shines (especially Broderick, Jeffrey Jones--as his belabored principal, Jennifer Grey as Ferris' hissy-fit sister, the pencil-headed Edie McClurg, and Charlie Sheen as a young hoodlum). John Hughes' best film, hands down. One of the best comedies of the 1980s and still fresh as ever. A great DVD rental, too, particularly when double-billed with ELECTION, Alexander Payne's dark comedy in which Broderick, now cast as a high school teacher, meets his match with a conniving student--a much darker Ferris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I half-watched this movie a long time ago, probably when it was first shown on TV -I thought it was just another silly show and so I really didn't sit down with my kids and pay attention to it. This time, I watched it by myself and found that it was a fun movie, was funny and had a good message hidden in the funny stuff. Matthew Broderick was so cute! and fresh. He did a great job of acting innocent for his not-to-bright parents. Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing's "Baby Houseman) was great as Ferris' younger sister who was determined to prove that Ferris was up to no-good. Jeffry Jones as Mr. Rooney the principal and Edie McClug as Grace, Mr. Rooney's secretary, were hilarious and actually made the show with their characters. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is nice light entertainment with a message that life moves very fast and every once in a while we should all stop and "smell the roses" or take a Day Off like Ferris'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Ferris really is a spoilt brat you gotta love the guy for the things he pulls in this great teen flick from the 80's.Ferris is a popular guy who has a lot of things going for him. One day (well, every other day really) he doesn't really feel like going to school, so he calls in sick and asks his best friend, depressed Cameron, to spend the day. In the process, they pick up Ferris' girlfriend Sloane and the three of them have a blast.Principal Rooney however knows Ferris is up to something and wants to catch him in the act, and big sister Jeanie hates the way Ferris is always getting away with things. Is Ferris going to have to stay another year in highschool or is he in luck yet again?Great fun in this one, as Broderick just *is* the cheeky Ferris. The story about Cameron and his parents sometimes is a bit of a downer (literally) but overall this film is pretty good. You gotta love Jones there in his role of principal Rooney. He's hilarious!7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wouldn't we have all liked to get away with what Ferris did? I liked this movie although not to the extent many reviewers on imdb did, I wouldn't rank this as the best teen movie ever although it was a great concept and a highly entertaining movie. I think the appeal of this story was getting away with the impossible-what kid wouldn't have wanted to get away with this? Maybe we all lived vicariously though Ferris!I remember very few teen movies from my past as popular as this one although there were a few. My feelings about Ferris Bueller(who came up with that soapopera like NAME?!) are all positive although I don't remember it as being quite as funny as others do. But this is a lovely little movie that didn't need to resort to cheap gags and over tired plots to be original and funny and that's a plus. Although this doesn't touch Breakfast club or Fast times to name a few for me, it's a darn good movie and a fun one that all kids should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris isn't exactly a good role model...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I say that? Well, because basically Ferris makes his living by lying, scamming, and taking advantage of others. Now, given the character of some of our recently-retired political leaders, while that might qualify one to hold high office, I'm not sure its a good character trait for ordinary folks.That said, this isn't a bad movie. It's a kind of blend of high school hijinks and teenage angst, the former supplied by Ferris and the latter by his friend Cameron. The viewer is taken for a dizzying ride through Ferris' "day off" school (playing hookey) courtesy of Cameron's father's sports car. Its kind of fun to watch the various tight spots and scrapes Ferris manages to get himself into and then extricated from, again mostly by lying and conniving. But, in spite of knowing better, you find yourself pulling for Ferris, who is basically a decent person but a bit full of himself.The movie is more a vehicle for showing off the beguiling charm of the young Matthrew Brodderick, who is fine in his leading role. Actor Jeffrey Jones is his foil as the uptight school principal. And Mia Sara does what she does best: portray a beautiful young woman, this time as Ferris' girlfriend (naturally, the charming rogues get the best-looking girls, which I am convinced is really the type of guy girls want in spite of what today's women say about wanting an intelligent and "sensitive" man). But the best roles are those of Alan Ruck (Cameron) and, as others have noted, Jennifer Grey (Jeanie).So give "Ferris" a look if you need a little time for relaxation and distraction, and maybe a chance to live vicariously the kind of "day off" we all wish we could have had at least once in our lives.</fullReview>

This movie became the basis for my education (as my summary says) the things Ferris did to skive school and things he did WHILST skiving all became a part of my life - ok i wasn't old enough to drive, but i had a moped, and would go into the nearest city (peterborough in this case) and hang out, do the tourist thing etc.Ok, so skiving aside why does the film work. Chemistry and timing between the characters. You feel for Cameron and his many illnesses, you wanna see Ferris ALMOST get caught again just to see how he gets out of it, and Sloane, well she just looks cute in the pool scene.The gags are plentiful, and the cameo of Charlie Sheen very funny. I haven't seen the TV series, but i am kinda guessing it wasn't too much of a success otherwise it would be available on dvd :)I truly enjoyed this movie, and try to watch it every time its on sky. They just dont make films like this anymore, which is a pity as am sure kids of today would love a `hero` like Ferris :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Meet Ferris Bueller. High school student. I'm sure we're all familiar with the pressures of high school life: homework, studying, the teacher always breathing down your neck, getting heckled by classmates. Well Ferris wasn't going to take it anymore. It was high time he got a day off so he feigned illness. His parents bought it. His sister, Jeanie did not. She was also sick of her parents liking Ferris seemingly more than her. So once Mom, Dad and Sis leave, Ferris decides to enjoy himself. At school, the surly principal, Ed Rooney, noticed Ferris Bueller wasn't in school and grew suspicious. He was wise to Bueller's ways and was determined to get to the bottom of this; Ferris' friend, Cameron Frye, was home sick too. Or rather, he was faking it as well. If only Ferris' girlfriend Sloane was out of school too then they could get together and rock the town. Luckily, Ferris had a plan. He set up some things to make it look as if he was still sick in bed then he called Cameron and they met at his place. Ferris wanted to use Cameron's dad's classic Ferrari. Cameron was worried because if that car got a single ding or scratch, Cameron would be toast. Ferris promised to be careful and the two head to the school and cleverly get Sloane out of school then they head to downtown Chicago to have a great time. They valet park the Ferrari and go to the top of the Sears tower then Ferris lip- synchs to a Beatles song, but while they were away, the valet parkers were joyriding in the Ferrari with the Star Wars theme montage. Good choice, by the way! When Ferris, Cameron and Sloane were finished and ready to go. Cameron noticed the odometer on the car had gone up alot. If his father found out they had take out the car, Cameron would be in deep donkey manure so Ferris got the idea of setting the car up on blocks and letting it run in reverse which would turn back the odometer. It didn't work and an accident causes the Ferrari to fall off the blocks and crash out the window and falling to its death.  Ed Rooney investigates the Bueller household. He is confronted by Jeanie. But our story has a happy ending. Ferris enjoyed his day off and may one day take another one; It's an OK movie, not great. It's from John Hughes who brought us Uncle Buck and Home Alone. Matthew Broderick was good, so was Alan Ruck and Mia Sara. Jeffrey Jones plays yet another interesting villain. Watch for cameos by Charlie Sheen and Edie McClurg!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film, every boy's envy, every parent's fear, every dean's frustration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vividly recall seeing "Ferris Bueller" in the theater in 1986, and it delighted me, especially the ending where the final scene is playing alongside the credits, then when the credits were over, Ferris comes out, looks us in the eye and says, "It's over...go home." I have always been one to watch the credits anyway so I didn't miss any of it, as many theater-goers did. All the way through this is a very clever and entertaining film.Now, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" has recently been issued as a DVD with Dolby 5.1 sound and widescreen, and with a selectable director's commentary. I bought my own copy and it really is a good one. This is somewhat a vanity project for writer/director John Hughes who grew up not too far from Chicago, the setting of this film. Hughes has had quite a good history with screenplays, including such films as Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Uncle Buck, Home Alone 1,2, and 3, Flubber, just to name a few. His commentary on this DVD is among the better ones, not going very often into the self-indulgent mode, and giving very interesting "behind the shots" commentary. An example of an interesting tidbit, although the film was set in Springtime, the outdoor shots at the ravine in Chicago were in the Fall, so they had to paint colored leaves green before each day's shooting, taking care not to knock them off!some SPOILERS - The story is one day in the life of smart, master-slacker and high school senior, Ferris Bueller. Pretending to be sick, he gets his girlfriend Sloane out of class, his really sick friend Cameron out of bed, they borrow the rare collector car and have a day on the town. Restaurant, baseball game, stock market floor, parade, tallest building, art museum, lakefront. Meanwhile way-too-serious Dean of Students Rooney is trying to nab Ferris and expose him. The footrace with the cars near the end is a highlight. Ultimately, brother and sister bond are stronger than jealousy and Rooney gets his due.The filming at school was done with real high school extras, but only Mia Sara, who played Sloane, was a teen-ager among the cast. Broderick (Ferris) was 23, Alan Ruck (Cameron) was 29, pre-nose-bob Jennifer Grey (Jeannie) was 25. The film addresses Cameron's timidity and this day converts him, he decides to take a stand in his homelife. Also, Jeannie learns to appreciate and accept her wily brother. However, there isn't much message here, just clever fun and every student's secret desire, to make a fool out of school administration. My word description may sound sinister but in reality the comedic tone of the film doesn't allow us to take it very seriously.Of course this was a landmark role for Broderick, who looked like a teenager, and it made it hard for him to get "adult" roles later. Jeffery Jones plays Rooney just perfectly, a parody of a Dean of Students who has little connection with the real world. All in all an almost perfect cast, a witty script, and very effective directing make this one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthew Broderick and Jeffrey Jones Are Marvellous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie in the theatre when it first came out (so long ago it seems now.) I loved it at the time. Laughed the whole way through. Although I've seen snippets of it since then as I've channel hopped and come across it, until today I had never actually seen it all the way through again. Somewhat to my surprise, it holds up quite well and I had an enjoyable couple of hours with Ferris and the gang.I've become accustomed to seeing Matthew Broderick playing dramatic roles, and he plays them very well. I'm convinced that he is extremely under-rated as an actor. Seeing him in the part of the master manipulator Ferris Bueller reminds me that he is a very versatile actor, with a good sense of comedy as well. He pulls this role off perfectly. It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Ferris. But with age and (I hope) a bit of maturity, I found other things to appreciate in this movie. Jeffrey Jones for one.Perhaps it was because I was younger and more likely to be unsympathetic toward authority figures, but I don't recall thinking much about Jones when I saw this movie originally, probably because he was playing the authoritarian role of Dean of Students Ed Rooney, whose sole purpose on this particular day was to spoil Ferris's fun. But Jones is marvellous in this role. If only comedies were taken more seriously, Broderick and Jones would have been a credible pair of nominees for Best Actor and Supporting Actor. Again, with more maturity, I was also able to better recognize and appreciate the subplot revolving around Cameron's (Alan Ruck) troubled relationship with his father, a piece of the story I frankly didn't remember from my earlier viewing.Sure, the storyline is paper thin, and there isn't much substance to the movie. But it's a decent time-waster. Better than decent, actually. It's a good way to fill a couple of hours. Nothing too deep; nothing much to think about. Just some good plain fun. And there's nothing wrong with that.I rate it as a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that started it all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>,,, my irrational hatred of Matthew Broderick, that is! I saw this film and initially thought I hated Broderick, which was puzzling, since I'd previously found him amiable enough in "WarGames" and "Project X". Then I caught "The Cable Guy" on TV and realised that it wasn't necessarily Broderick that I hated, but Ferris Bueller! Some people admire the character's brash personality and hip posing. I don't. Every time Bueller was onscreen I wanted to punch the smug, cocky little **** into the middle of next week. Was it just me? My repeated fantasies of doing immeasurable harm to Broderick with various sharp implements were just that, fantasies. What's worse, is that I will never get my chance to exact revenge on Ferris Bueller, due to the minor inconvenience of his non-existence... Despite these barely checked psychopathic tendencies at the mention of Bueller, I found it impossible to dislike the film. It screams "good natured wish fulfillment movie" at every turn, is pretty inventive, and gets you wondering "What would I do?" at certain points. The cast all have fun will their roles, but Matthew Broderick's status as a C list star and John Hughes' current record of cr*p movies is living proof that they are being punished by a higher power for their hateful rendering of such an obnoxius little prig. After all the bonhomie, only the hardest of hearts will remain staunch in their hatred of the movie. The hatred of Ferris Bueller, however, will remain supreme. The fact that certain characters in the movie also hated Ferris as much as I did made a slightly bitter pill that much easier to swallow. This could have been a great teen movie, but the fact that I consider it slightly over-rated and want to kill the main character merely makes it good. There is a silver lining to every cloud, though, and for "Ferris..." it is this: the fact that I consider it only a 'good' movie means that I do not feel obligated to add it to my collection. Were I motivated to rate it one mark higher than the 7 out of ten that I actually gave it, it would require purchase; and then I would have to grimace through an otherwise decent film every time 'HE' appeared onscreen... One final point: you may think that my slight hysteria over the main character is something of an act, in a crude ploy to make my review more interesting and amusing. This it MAY have done, but an act I can assure you it is not. I think I'll go have a lie down now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been scanning reviews for various movies on this database and I am always a little surprised that in reviews for films, that are absolute tripe, you will find the odd person that loves it and vice-versa. This got me thinking...ah Ferris, surely everyone must love Ferris, a simply superb cheer-me-up-feel-good movie, I was wrong.orb-2, I know we're all entitled to our opinion, but surely you're taking this film too seriously. This film was a wonderfully done satire on student life and stereotypes, it was obviously ridiculous, but that was part of the point, this film was never meant to be taken literally or seriously it's just a wonderful fantasy film.Everyone wants to be super-cool, popular and in control, not to mention driving a Ferrari and singing beetles songs to everyone, but alas the world in not that way. This, as films should do, is make us forget real life, the recession you mention, and indulge in our fantasies.  I for one have a big smile on my face when I watch this movie and it always cheers me up every time I watch it. I would love to see more of the same. I suspect that if more people watched movies like this the world would be a better place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a Ferris in all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick (war games) stars as Ferris Bueller, a cocky teenager who doesn't want to go to school on a day when the sun is shining and there is so much to explore, and this ideology, I believe, is something that is hidden in all of us.How many of us wake up in the morning and think, ah the hell with it, I'm skipping school/work today and going exploring, to see sights and enjoy myself! It is something with its consequences, but with so many more personal benefits. Both are explored in a comedy fashion by John Hughes in my personal favourite teenage comedy.Undoubtedly there are problems when skipping the day of the normal routine, whether that's your jealous sister (Grey) or a paranoid teacher (Jones) and these supporting characters lend such good support and humour to the tale of this mischievous kid.But what about the benefits? Well not sitting in class, seeing the world and spending time with those you love what more could you want? It is the true meaning of freedom, and the unfortunate boundaries that we have to live in sometimes, and this wouldn't have been justified without such a great central protagonist.The opening shot of Ferris in the bed pretending to be sick and his parents buying it is funny, and later when he starts addressing the camera, invites us into his world of crazy ideas, intelligence and sophistication, beautifully portrayed by Broderick.The comedy is great, with a lot of slapstick humour and smart timings and insults thrown in for good merit.Teenage comedy mean girls is run by stereotypes, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is run by a stereotype, but a classic one who we can all relate to, and who we should all take a lesson from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Day off movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Broderick plays Ferris Bueller, a very popular high school senior who decides life is too short to waste a beautiful day in the classroom. He convinces his hypochondriac friend Cameron to join him and they call the principal and impersonate the father of Ferris' girlfriend Sloane in order to get her released from school for the day. Although the plot is simple, it is wonderfully executed. To make the plot more interesting, the principal is suspicious whether or not Ferris is really sick and is so jealous of Ferris' popularity, that he is determined to prevent Ferris from graduating. Jeffrey Jones is very good as the principal along with Jennifer Grey as Ferris' angry sister Jeanie. The film score is well chosen and the fashion, haircuts, and cars bring you back to the 1980s when it was filmed. I love this movie. Matthew Broderick is extremely likable and the idea of getting away with innocent fun before we take on life's responsibilities is deeper than you realize.</fullReview>

All the characters are wonderful, and it has me laughing throughout, plus Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are simply amazing in this!. It hasn't dated one bit, in fact in my humble opinion it's a LOT funnier, then most of the comedies coming out now a days, plus all the characters were extremely likable, and you get to see Charlie Sheen in a cameo as a drug addict!. The opening is simply a classic, and Jeffery Jpnes is a real asshole as Principal Rooney, plus one of my favorite scenes, is Alan Ruk's character Cameron imitating Sloane Peterson's father, that is absolutely hilarious, and another one of my favorite moments is when his dad's prize car, goes out the window!. The finale is absolutely wonderful and i loved Alan Ruck's message at the end, plus Ruck and Broderick had fantastic chemistry together!. This is one of my favorite comedies of all time, that i watch quite often, it is indeed a true classic in my books, and if you haven't seen it Go see it right this instant you won't regret it!. The Direction is fabulous!. John Hughes does a fabulous job here, with fantastic camera work,and keeping it smart, witty and extremely hilarious throughout!. The Acting is amazing!. Matthew Broderick is AMAZING here, this is the role that made him famous, his character is a know it all, but i couldn't help but love him as he is extremely likable, and is very charismatic, he also has fantastic chemistry with Alan Ruck and Mia Sara, and you will really root for his character!, i loved him!. (Broderick Rules!). Alan Ruck is also AMAZING here, and is my favorite character in this film, he is extremely hilarious, like Matthew really seemed to be enjoying himself, and had some classic lines, and also had some great facial reactions, i simply loved him!. (Ruck Rules!). Mia Sara is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and is fantastic here, she had awesome chemistry with Broderick, was quite sexy, and was just fantastic overall!, even though she didn't have a lot to do. Jeffrey Jones is awesome as the Principal, he was quite an asshole, and i always love to hate him!, he did his job extremely well. Jennifer Grey is beautiful and is excellent as the sister, i found her quite likable, and thought her character was quite cool., she rocks. Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward are great as the parents, and both did there jobs extremely well. Charlie Sheen has a funny cameo as a drug addict! (Charlie Rules!).Kristy Swanson is good too.

		<shortDescription>Just Barely Avoids Obscurity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When describing 1980s cinema the word typical comes to mind very often. Unfortunately "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" does not break the trend. Is it a good film? Yes, but barely. Is it enjoyable? Once again yes, but barely. In short the film slips by the whole way and just barely overcomes its two-star premise. The reason? John Hughes' smart screenplay and his over-achieving direction are the main reasons why the film works most of the time. Matthew Broderick and friends Mia Sara and Alan Ruck take a Friday off from high school and travel all around the city of Chicago. The whole way they dodge Broderick's parents and their evil high school principal (Jeffrey Jones). Overall the film is watchable, but it is not as good as many think. In short it is another one of John Hughes' curious over-achievers. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an unrealistic and irritating film. A spoiled younger brother plays his parents for idiots (which in this case they really are!), uses his computer to hack into his highschool to change his record, talks his poor, insecure best friend into swiping his sadistic father's expensive car, steals a millionaire's identity and eats at the priciest gourmet restaurant in town (there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?), and gets away with it all in the end, just like he knew he would!This just doesn't happen in the real world. Hacking and identity theft are crimes, and dimwitted parents usually cannot afford to buy their kids computers since the smart people have all the good jobs. No friend of mine would leave me in the mess Ferris left Cameron in. The highschool principal is a heavy, I agree, but no girl can kick a principal in the face and not get herself and her parents into trouble (even if the principal breaks into her house, which you never hear about). The principal's obstinate secretary would be fired on the spot for aiding and abetting a hacker. I never heard of a parade going on during a school day, and parking valets just don't get away with abusing cars. And wasn't there a RECESSION going on in 1986?This flick gives a bad name to brothers, boyfriends, computer users and students. Many a sister or girlfriend has accused some poor guy of being a "freeloading Ferris". And smart-aleck know-it-alls are never regared as "righteous dudes" by every other kid. Besides getting on your nerves, it is also missing the comedic tension that makes good comedy work: Ferris Bueller can't lose, but if he could he would seem human and his antics would be truly funny. This movie is not for all tastes, but if you like pancreas...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hughes classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so unnecessary for anyone to make another comment about this film, really, but here I am! This is, of course, another nearly-timeless teen classic from John Hughes in his golden era. Unfortunately, this means it suffers from the same flaw most of this period does: after about the first third of the film you can probably turn it off since you've seen the best it's going to get. Aside from Principal Ed Rooney's very funny pursuit of Bueller through the remainder of the movie, the best moments for my money occur before Ferris leaves the house! I understand this excludes the well-known 'Danke Schoen'/'Twist &amp; Shout' parade scene, but this is an overrated one anyway. Our insights into Ferris -- as well as into the excellent portrayal of what could easily have been a thoroughly irritating spoiled brat by Broderick -- chiefly occur in the first half-hour of the film, and much after that is filler. Not that I would dissuade anyone from watching this fun movie all the way through at least once, but be prepared to make your popcorn break about the time they show up to pick up the girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been told for years how funny this movie was before I finally saw it. Maybe I would have liked it better if I had seen it as a teenager (or at age 21, when it was actually released), but quite frankly, I doubt it. I'm not sure why we're supposed to identify with the obnoxious, selfish Ferris and his rich preppie friends, but I spent most of the movie waiting for Ferris to get his comeuppance, which, needless to say, is not forthcoming. This movie apparently confuses "having fun" and "cutting loose" with "being selfish, pushy and inconsiderate" and never made me care about any of its characters. I give it 5/10 for the occasional chuckle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I felt sorry for Ferris' friend, not Ferris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is one of the classic comedies to come out of the 1980s. It's acquired a following of its own over the years, partly because it is quite easy to relate to it. In summary, the film is about Ferris and his friends, a female he has a crush on and his geeky male friend. Ferris is determined to get a day off of school, and this day is filled with events and plenty of mistakes and some comedy. Some of it is at the expense of his poor geeky friend, who I felt immensely sorry for because he was forced to follow an over-bearing Ferris and ended up with a big problem on his hands.Despite the comedy geared at the adult authority figures (who do not understand the youth), the film really did not make a lot of sense or provide a good story or conclusion. Right, Ferris gets his way and the principal makes a fool of himself and faces the consequences; this is a typical teen rebellion film.It's a classic comedy, but in terms of a good story, Ferris Bueller falls short. And, you either enjoy this type of comedy or you don't enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, then you will not enjoy the film. Simple as that. Personally, while I thought that some of the humor was good, I felt that it could not carry the story for me, and I felt more sorry for some of the characters and did not feel sorry for the main character at all. And, if you cannot stand the main character, then, well, it is difficult to enjoy the film.</fullReview>

Well my opinion of this movie is that it is not like other movie it is unique,funny and super corky. The first time that I watched this movie I was super excited because my mom said to me that when she was little she loved this movie so much so she inspired me. And I really loved it after all. This movie was made in 1985 or 1982. The first reason for you to like it is that just up to 9 years old you can watch the movie and it is perfect for teenagers too. Oh and I recommend for grown ups the bad thing of this movie is that it has just one inappropriate part but? You need need need to watch this movie in the time or day you want you need to watch this amazing movie!!!! Oh and I wanted to tell you that it is about a teenager that happen many crazy things in his life crazy :) :) :) :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller reportedly lives life on the edge, unplanned, spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment. But what we only later see are the clever little devices he has rigged up to precisely maintain an illusion of his sickness, and how he has carefully orchestrated a day for his friend to gain some self-worth and respect so that he may stand up to his father. It is easy for a viewer to take the opposite perspective in line with the dastardly Principal Rooney. Ferris is young, good looking, popular, has the girl; the sorts of things that are easy to be jealous of. And his sister, too, is not convinced like his legions of adoring fans, and in particular, his parents. We see then, how Hughes has magnified each and every close call because of this perspective, this needy desire to expose and ruin a teenager's fun. When Katie Bueller creeps up to her son's bedroom to check on her, the soundtrack takes a shrill, horror-influenced turn and the walls turn into something out of The Shining as she slowly approaches (and note that the fake arm is clearly in view; but these caricature parents are so endearing and loving that they never once question Ferris). And then as she is relieved, she skips down the steps and the score is once again pleasant. The same technique is used as Rooney attempts to trap Ferris in his tricks, only for a two way phone call to suddenly put into harsh light all the insults he has sprayed through the speaker. Again, this loud, ominous fanfare blasts as we zoom into his shocked realisation, and his bumbling attempts to patch up the situation milked all the way from Hughes, until the humorous reveal that Cameron is now on board with the day-trip. From the loathing tone in his voice you might have thought that Ferris was an escaped murdered on death row. But what we instead see are a series of innocent little adventures through the city of Chicago that are designed to slowly peel away at Cameron's shell. As they lean their heads on the glass of the Seers Tower and survey every tiny ant with their own lives, all he can think about is the coming rage of his father. Later, he nervously teeters as Ferris bluffs his way into a high-end restaurant before assisting him yet again by mimicking a police officer. In perhaps the most iconic sequence of the movie, they visit the Art Institute, and on the backdrop of a dreamy cover of Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want (a teenager's plea, if ever), they lose themselves and descend into playtime. Hughes freely admits this as a sort of self-indulgent nostalgia binge; a place of refuge and comfort for the youth of his time. And here they pose in mock pretense, they kiss like teenagers do in the silhouette of the beautiful blue glow of Chagall's America Windows, and it's just so soft and light- hearted. And like a teenager does, Cameron seems to find meaning in a grand Seurat, and through a series of axial cuts he focuses until the details are merely splotches of indistinct paint. There's no real meaning to be found in the canvas, but there is plenty of introspection that can be found in Cameron. And in the midst of these whirlwind events, there is a little side- plot that concerns Ferris' sister, whom is constantly pushed aside. While Broderick charms and addresses the audience directly and invites them along on his day off, we see reaction shots that tell us Jeannie has been enduring this farce for so long. She got the car, but what good is it if she cannot escape school like Ferris has the ability to? So while we are swept up in his adventures, there is a quiet, modest scene completely dedicated to Jeannie, where she voices her frustrations to a stranger played by Charlie Sheen. She bemoans the fact that he is always getting away with things that she cannot, and how unfair it is; anyone with a sibling will know this feeling. And then as he makes her come to the realisation that this says more about her than it does for Ferris, she becomes this giggling schoolgirl and her facade is shattered. This is handled extremely well without attacking Ferris, but allowing Jeannie to really show who she is, and that her problems are not really that bad. Another memorable scene is the parade that seemingly erupts in the middle of the day, to be high-jacked by Ferris. It seems like something of a daydream. Where did these people come from, and how do they have the time to dedicate to an elaborate dance and song? We see everyone drop their things like it is a pre-planned flash-mob, but it is anything but. The construction workers up above join in to a rousing rendition of Twist and Shout, and even Tom Bueller dances in his office. It's just pure, clean fun. And the iconic theme of Star Wars magnifies the slow- motion frenzy of two parking attendants who take the Ferrari for a joyride, where in some other film might result in a crash and a panicked hurried attempt to patch things together before Cameron's father reaches the front door. But that doesn't happen here. It seems that most people just need to take a Ferris Bueller day once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live your best life on an ordinary day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a defiant teenager who goes to great lengths take a day off school. He convinces his "down on his luck friend" Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to raise out of his depressed state and come join him on his day off using his dads prized and precious car. Together, Ferris and Cameron, conspire to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloan Peterson (Mia Sara), out of school for the day by imitating her father, calling the school regarding the death of her grandmother. Once Sloan is released from school, the three take off for a day freedom and fun. Well not so much for Cameron who is constantly worried about the wrath of his dad if something should happen to the car. Little do they know Mr. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is on a quest to catch Ferris in his deceitful lie of really being sick, and finding it a challenge to do so. The theme that comes to mind after viewing this film is to live it up and make the best out of an ordinary day. Ferris was the "push" Cameron needed to find the confidence to even think about confronting his dad about the disrespect and lack of love he has been shown over the years. Ferris is determined to make his fun where there is none. This is reminiscent of "Catch Me If You Can" by being the bad guy (Leo Dicaprio) that is chased by an authority looking to bury him, all the while silently being cheered for as he gets away with his violations. Even though we didn't see it play out on the screen, Cameron leads us to another theme of standing up for yourself. As we seen his confidence grow, we see him gaining freedom within himself. We seen Cameron's rendition of a breaking point in "Me, Myself, and Irene". In the film Jim Cary is bullied and disrespected by his peers. One technique used is flash cuts and panning, showing the beautiful day Ferris is planning to embark upon and the other is of the city. Both are the two important points of Ferris' day; make the best of the beautiful day by getting out and enjoying the city. Ferris was not the only one with the idea of "living it up" and taking advantage of the day, the parking attendants also shared the same motto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who grew up in or even around the 80's...this film is a classic period. Some might not understand that but in watching it again recently I really watched it and I completely understand why it endears itself so much to us. This film defines the 80's the way other films have before it like The Graduate or Casablanca. Sound hard to believe comparing it to those films? The 80's was a decade of pomp and success and flashy...everything...and even now when we look back that's how we remember it and Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that this is what we all wanted life to be like. The film is funny, sad, expressive and wild. The legend of teenage angst and modern day classics John Hughes had to know he was truly hitting his mark with this one. You could (and people do) quote it for ages and it still holds its own even today and is just as entertaining and silly and yet really effective as it was then. This film is about freedom and growing up and bucking responsibility...it is an homage to being a teenager and we all wanted to be Ferris Bueller or be his best friend because everyone was either a Ferris or a Cameron.As often happened with John Hughes films the man knew how to score a great cast. His plots and scripts seem to simple and yet they are easily some of the most memorable films. Matthew Broderick gives an absolutely stunningly charismatic performance as Ferris Bueller. He breaks the fourth wall to narrate his own life. He's popular and well known and has clearly had some wild adventures before. Hughes manages to really make us understand Bueller before we go on this day with him. Broderick is perfect. Alan Ruck is his perfect counterpart. Cameron is neurotic, scared, anxious and desperately needs Ferris' help to break free. They have good chemistry together and they are the perfect balance. Mia Sara is the lovely girlfriend to Ferris. Sara is mostly eye candy and she is beautiful but she doesn't really stand out amongst the cast. She has a purpose and she fulfilled it. Jennifer Grey is absolutely fantastic as Ferris' terminally angry sister trying to stop Ferris in his tracks. She is sort of the villain and yet you can't help but love to hate her. The supporting cast of the film are all very good too including Jeffrey Jones, Edie McClurg and Charlie Sheen in a legendary cameo role.What can I really say about John Hughes as a director that hasn't already been said. He just simply had this absolutely magical talent at telling stories that you felt like you were a part of. It doesn't matter how improbably you are right there with his characters and you never forget them. He is an amazing writer and he is absolutely the exception to the rule that writer's don't usually translate to directors very well because no one knows his vision like he does. He probably has more classics and memorable films to his credit than most other directors. Most of all John Hughes' films are just fun and Ferris Bueller's Day Off is just simple fun. Its not intense and it doesn't make you think really, its just fun and a wild time and the perfect definitive 80's film. Whether its the product placement or the characters or the clothing...its a must see from the 80's generation. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion John Hughes's best movie, great non-stop action, memorable scenes, well picked actors, good acting, this movie is definitely on of the best movies from the 80's. You can definitely see where John Hughes got the ideas for Home alone, since Ed Rooney got treated the way the thieves did in home alone. :D Ferris Bueller just could pull anything off, on the other hand his friend Cameron was scared to do anything. This is a great message, sometimes it is better to risk and try, not just sit around wasting your time and being bored. The things Ferris did were a little bit too hard to pull off in real life, but the point was, that with courage and confidence you can do so much and it is really one of the most important things in life.This movie, without a doubt, is a classic, definitely one of the greatest comedies ever. Remember, sometimes it is better to take a day off school and to something fun and memorable, but only sometimes ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedy movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Hughes was interviewed about the reason why he made movies in the first place and he said "To prove how stupid some teenagers can really be without even realizing it." For people who haven't watched his movies his reasoning may sound strange to them, but for some who have know for a fact that he puts his proof into comedy.In Ferris Bueller's Day Off he proves it with excellence. The movie stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller a senior in high-school who is determined to act sick so that he can ditch school for a ninth consecutive time so that he can some fun with his best friend Cameron (played by Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend Sloane (played by Mia Sara) for the whole day while his parents are away from home, while Ferris is on his so called sick day his school principal Ed Rooney (played by Jeffrey Jones) is determined to get him busted for ditching school. Writer-director John Hughes has written the perfect story for a well done teen comedy, and his direction and his cast try to prove that the stupid thing that teenagers do can be very laughable. the movie also includes a very good supporting cast which includes Jennifer Grey as his sister Jeanie who gets ticked off in the beginning of the movie when she knew all along that he was going to ditch school when her parents found his performance to be very convincing as well as the other 8 times that he ditched school to take a guess, and Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward as their parents Katie and Tom Bueller the parents as I mentioned earlier got fooled by his prank. The movie itself is a film that I consider to be a must see for all people who like movies that not only make fun of teenagers in a laughable way, and for people who like comedy movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferris (and Cameron's) Day Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this movie's plot, and looking beyond the surface of the story into John Hughes' direction of the cinematography and the actors' portrayals, one can see the motives behind this movie and why it is so important to today's culture and to the lives of people of all ages. Beginning with just the opening scenes, where Ferris is shown waking up and performing his way out of going to school, he already breaks the fourth wall by addressing the audience and looking straight into the camera as a sort of confession time for him to state his true motives and plans. The audience almost becomes his confidant in this way and the only person Ferris is ever truly honest with, seeing as he can easily lie to other characters such as his girlfriend and his parents. It is also important to note that Ferris is the only character to do this for the rest of the movie, and this is intentional to imply that Ferris is the narrator of the whole story. As the narrator, although the story is told from Ferris' perspective, now the focus is shifted away from making Ferris the protagonist and more towards highlighting the other people he talks about. Considering that outlook, it is easier to recognize Cameron as the main character, and how the story being told truly revolves around him while Ferris simply keeps the wheels turning. In his efforts to drive the plot of the story, Ferris whisks Cameron and Sloane out of their boring, everyday lives onto an adventure to visit major must-sees in Chicago. The movie features many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago, and as Hughes puts it, the film was his love letter to the city: "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could. Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit." Some argue that the places Ferris and his gang visit and the things they do are touristy and not a good representation of things a Chicago native would choose to do, however Hughes purposefully aimed to make the setting recognizable and well-known to emphasize how unbelievable Ferris' day truly was (Siegel). The film would not have captured the same feeling without the foul ball catch at the Cubs game, or Ferris' solo in the parade, or the crew's peaceful admiration of the artwork in the Chicago Art Institute.Further analyzing their Chicago Art Institute excursion, this scene stands out for its slower pace and more serious mood than the rest of the movie. This feeling is instilled by having only music playing the entirety of the scene without any spoken words, as well as the scene's positioning right after a humorous, slapstick scene of Rooney breaking in to Ferris' house and encountering his dog, and right before the upbeat spectacle of Ferris in the parade. In fact, the original layout of this scene was much different, but in response to critic's reactions, Hughes changed the background music and the placement of the scene to assure its impact (Watkins). This scene is crucial to the plot of the movie as well, as Cameron is found splitting off from his friends and standing transfixed before Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte for nearly a full minute, looking deep into the pointillism of a mother and her child, which come to symbolize his life, and how the closer he gets, the less sense it makes. And while Cameron ponders his existence in a teen-angst-y way, Sloane and Ferris enjoy in a moment alone drowned in blue light from Marc Chagall's America Windows, suggesting how Ferris embodies freedom and the notion of America being able to "save" people and offer them a better life. After all Ferris' goal is to "save," and although he appears to simply be wanting to save himself from a boring day at school, looking deeper could reveal that in reality Ferris is saving Cameron. Cameron finds his redemption in the end, as this crazy, whirlwind of a movie eventually builds up to the Ferrari scene, and the whole story comes together to reveal the purpose of all the madness. Cameron stops being the victim and ultimately proves to be the hero that the story revolves around. He states his authority and prepares to stand up to his dad saying, "I'm going to defend it. Right or wrong I'm going to defend it. ... When Morris comes home, he and I will just have a little chat" (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). By this point, the story has come full circle, and has amounted to a classic Hughes coming-of-age tale based around the vulnerability and truth behind being a teenager, as displayed by Cameron (Ebert). Although designed to trick audiences into assuming that this movie is all about Ferris (I mean just look at the title), in truth there's more to be taken away from the story than a laugh at Ferris' good luck. But don't get me wrong, this movie is exceptionally crafted and I would advise you to allow it to encourage you to take life a little less seriously. After all, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it" (Ferris Bueller's Day Off).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80s teen comedy at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around every once in a while, you could miss it." While not Hughes' best film, it stands up as a great teen comedy. Matthew Broderick gives an excellent performance as the likable and clever Ferris Bueller, who loves to live life instead of rigorously attending high school, but makes special precautions not to hurt the feelings of his loved ones; his parents, sister, best friend and girlfriend. His best friend is played by Alan Ruckman, who also gives a good performance as someone so wound up and cow-eyed by the strict authority of his father he struggles to have fun even with the help of Ferris. Mia Sara is good as his cheerleader girlfriend, the sultry Sloane Petersen, who is a good friend to both of them, sticking by Ferris and comforting Cameron. The dynamic between these three is what makes the film work, you really get the feeling Ferris is helping to bring Cameron out of himself. The comedic set pieces are brilliant, from Ferris' immaculately conceived contraptions fitted in his room to keep his parents in the dark, to Cameron's cold, clinical white "museum" of a house. Jeffrey Jones almost steals the show as Principal Ed Rooney, an obsessed man trying to ruin the fun, who keeps bungling his attempts to expose Ferris, losing a shoe and a getting kicked in the face by Ferris' sister in the process. Jennifer Grey is excellent as Ferris' bitchy, wound-up sister who learns to loosen up in the end after an encounter with a drugged up Charlie Sheen in a police station. All in all, it's an excellent film, bolstered by Hughes' stylish direction. The fourth wall breaking works for Ferris' showman-like character, and the writing balances the laugh-out-loud comedy with interesting character arcs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has attended high school in the last 30 years knows that this movie portrays exactly what it is like. Who doesn't know someone exactly like Ferris? Or Cameron? Or Sloan? Or Rooney? Or the dad? There are Ferrises, Camerons, Sloans, Rooneys, and dads in EVERY American high school. One of the funniest parts about this movie is that it IS so accurate. This movie is filled with jokes about our culture. I haven't met one person yet who has seen it and not liked it. Talk about a 1980s cult classic. The film uses witty humor and a bit of goofy humor. It's the PERFECT film for light comedy. If you're into those kind of films that make you think a lot, this one definitely isn't for you. On the other hand, if you laugh at things like lip synching to Wayne Newton, you'll love it. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" was one of the greatest comedies from the 80's. It still holds up great to this day. The comedy was great, I love all the characters and they are all relate-able (the guy who gets off scott free, the neurotic, the asshole teacher, etc.), and this is the third Matthew Broderick film that I enjoyed him in (The Lion King &amp; Bee Movie are the other two)! But I think the teachers were too mean spirited and there were some parts in the movie that could have been cut out. For what it is though, it was a great film. If you happen to find a copy of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," pick it up and give it a try.Also Ben Steins sandpaper emotions are funnier here than they were in Casper and Son of the Mask.</fullReview>

Ferris is one of those characters you just want to see win in the end.Alan Ruck was funny as Cameron Frye, the nervous, insecure, self-loathing, self-contradicting best friend of Ferris.Mia Sara was good as Slone Peterson, Ferris's girlfriend. But she didn't contribute all that much to the plot.Jeffrey Jones was hilarious as Ed Rooney, the obsessive, evil, witty, determined principle.There were many other great small performances, like Ben Stein "Bueller...Bueller...Bueller...Bueller...".Throw in a great music score, original jokes and lots of memorable lines and scenes, you have one of the funniest movies of the 80's.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest of the great triumvirate of Hughes' mid 80s high-school films. The Breakfast Club has a pre-Linklater intimacy and seriousness; Weird Science begat Buffy. But Ferris Bueller's Day Off is all things to all men - and women. Light, fast, immensely detailed and brilliantly acted the whole thing fizzes with the heady mix of pubescence and 80s aspiration.Returning to this film, what I love is that the only truly unsympathetic character is off-stage, that is to say Cameron's father. Everyone else is a good guy. Rooney, the high-school principal is a pantomime goon, a trope played outstandingly by Jeffrey Jones, but is no baddie. The valets, abducting the car because it's a wonderful motor, not through avarice, bring it back unscathed. Neuroses are the real, faceless enemy, easily dispatched in the climate of can-do and good humour. Marvellous.What I didn't remember is the carnival float sequence in the centre of Chicago. Despite the one fault of the movie - the bloody-minded interpolation of a recreation of Wacko's Thriller video - it stands as an exhilarating, signature sequence for the entire film. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only woman out there who thinks that Ferris is the hottest guy EVER? Well, maybe I'm a little biased because I grew up in the Chicago area where the movie was filmed. Most of the scenes in the movie were shot in Winnetka and Northbrook and as you can tell those towns are absolutely beautiful. I unfortunately grew up in a neighboring town called Evanston and often longed of going to the famous New Trier HS in Winnetka and living the life of Ferris' girl friend Sloan. You see my Ferris, we'll call him Mr. E to protect the innocent grew up in the area and went to New Trier. He was so cute and was totally like Ferris. I used to sit in class and write his name over and over in my notes, Emma + Erik, oops I let it slip. Oh well, I can't help it, he's just so dreamy!! As Cameron famously says after Ferris saves him from the pool "Ferris Bueller, you're my hero" Erik ....., is my hero. I often used to drive by his parents house and pretended that I was going to meet him for a date, then it was back to boring old Evanston. He talked to me once, and said "can I have some napkins" when he was ordering some food at this restaurant Buffalo Joe's in my town where I used to work. I touched his hand, it was the greatest day of my life. Unfortunately I'm a plump old housewife now living on the west coast, but at least I always have this movie to remind me of the good old days. Oh did I mention, Erik, I mean Ferris, is totally hot. So, like yeah see the movie. It is way rad!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a strange film. At the time of its release, everyone loved it and praised it for its slick and original style. Having a main character talk to the camera was a pretty fresh idea for mainstream movies. This doesn't mean it never happened before. This film has been influenced strangely enough, by Jean Luc Godard's "Breathless". Who would have thought that John Hughes even paid attention to the French New Wave? Maybe he didn't and it's all just purely coincidental. What else is bizarre about this film is its dated and exaggerated use of technology. Ferris Beuller uses his computer to hack into his high school transcript and alter his attendance record. And this was 1986..? Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a funny movie and it has a very sweet side to it but the upper class atmosphere of this movie is really annoying. Ferris and his friends take a day off from school to live the high life in the city of Chicago by going to expensive restaurants, going to a Cubs game, visiting a museum and as Ferris puts it" we saw priceless works of art!" and they also sit in a booth by the Chicago stock exchange. What were they doing there? Before going home, Ferris and his friends spend an hour at someone's swimming pool and jacuzzi. All of this just wouldn't be enough without Ferris friend's car, which happens to be a Ferrari. Now there's nothing wrong with being rich and granted, this is a comedy which is not supposed to be totally realistic. But the theme of the film seems to suggest that in order to really have fun, you need to have money and spend it. These kids just cannot see through the superficial and material world they live in. At one point Ferris's sister is heard complaining to herself about Ferris. "Maybe it's not so bad. After all, I got a car and he got a computer". Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a light comedy and if there's anything to learn from the story, its that its that getting a little support from your friends goes a long way. In some ways, "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" was the 80's version of Forrest Gump. They don't exactly have the same story but both films deal with how success can be earned even if you don't play by the rules. Forrest Gump had a learning disability but he became very successful. Ferris Beuller slacked off from school but everyone thought he was sick and was rooting for him. This theme has a strong resonance with today's standard of living. Look whose running the country! And isn't it ironic that "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" uses George H. W. Bush as a reference when the boring teacher played by the conservative, Ben Stein "something o-o economics. Voodoo economics." Well I guess you could say that John Hughes is a true visionary. Every plot and detail has a purpose. That I applaud him for. As for the spoiled kids, I could care less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Illogical But Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I never watched this in the theatre. I never watched it the first few thousand times it ran on television. Recently, it popped up on the USA Network and I just didn't bother to change the channel. Broderick does seem to have some sort of charming bad boy charisma that makes this movie interesting and a tad funny, but the movie's concept and plot are extremely out of left field. There is no way he could possibly be prepared for every contingency or get away with everything he does. Making his family as wealthy as they seem to be is an obvious plot point because Ferris has to be wealthy to explain his attitude and above canny luck. For me, seeing Mia Sara playing a typical teen after knowing her just for the Tom Cruise movie Legend is one of the few things that made this movie interesting; that and hoping Jeffrey Jones will get him. At least this film inspired the much more enjoyable Parker Lewis Can't Lose series which was so much more funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tale of a high school kid, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) skipping school and their adventures in Chicago.I was unimpressed when I saw this movie in 1986 and my feelings haven't changed. I do admit to laughing a few times and there were two hysterical performances by Jennifer Grey (as Ferris' sister) and Charlie Sheen (looking all hot and hunky in a cameo), but that's about it. The lack of a real story got annoying and the jokes are VERY scattershoot--they come out of nowhere and, more often than not, fall flat. For instance--the two songs during the parade sequence--it is colorful and energetic, but what the hell is it doing in this movie? That's just one example of many.Also, I hated Broderick as Ferris--he comes across as smug, obnoxious and boring. Sara is beautiful and charming but is given nothing to do. Ruck was just whiny. I also got sick of all the parents being portrayed as utter morons.I'm giving it a 6 for Grey, Sheen and some beautiful Chicago scenery. But, all in all, a disappointment. It makes the unsuccessful TV series look like "Hamlet".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is believed to be an iconic film by many. In this film Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick , is a high school student who has a knack for playing hooky. Knowing that this may be his last time he can skip school he develops an elaborate plan to pull it off. Ferris, along with his friend Cameron Frye, played by Alan Ruck, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, played by Mia Sara, head to Chicago for the day. As they ditch school they have to stay one step ahead of their principle Ed Rooney, played by Jeffrey Jones, and Ferris' sister Jeanie Bueller, played by Jennifer Grey.The theme from this film has to be to live life to the fullest and make the most of everyday. Ferris Bueller is a character who makes the best of everything and encourages his friends to do the same. If not for Ferris Bueller, Cameron may not have worked up the courage to confront his father about their relationship and Jeanie Bueller may not have found a new respect for Ferris and discover she needs to start focusing more on herself. In a way, this film reminds me of the film The Breakfast Club. Both films are about high school students dealing with a villainous principle who in the end, discover more about themselves than they ever knew before.Dialog and music are two important techniques used in this film. The music selected heightens the suspenseful moments well and aids the quick cutting speed found throughout the film. The dialog of the film is an under-appreciated aspect. Ferris' sharp and outlandish reasoning is something that can only be appreciated. There are many great techniques used throughout this film but the dialog and music proved to be key. Both of these techniques play into the theme of the film, which is live it up to the fullest. The music selected was always boisterous and lightened and the dialog throughout the film is constantly about loosening up and having fun. In all, this is a great film and one that can be viewed over and over again.</fullReview>

We also don't need to be told who stars in it, the director, producer etc. We know all that!I've noticed a lot of people have given this a poor rating. My rating is 10, maybe because I was in school when I first seen this movie and it made me envious? I don't know. Some people have said that Ferris is over the top, it's too unbelievable, would never happen etc. But isn't it something you would have dreamed doing when you were in school? That is the point, that is why it is over the top. It is what you could only have dreamed doing but would never have pulled off.I think I re-watch this movie at least once a year, probably my all time favourite, I don't want to see it is my favourite because so many other movies are too but it is well up there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're in the mood and can forgive its knowing style then it's great, silly fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller is a high school smart guy who is smart, capable but unwilling to spend the day in school when the weather is so perfect. Convincing his parents that he is too sick to go to school is only the first step of a cunning plan to get his friend Cameron to come over and help him break the beautiful Sloane out of classes. Mission accomplished, they head out to town but Principal Ed Rooney doesn't believe this 'illness' for a second and is determined to catch Bueller out this time.For 75 minutes this film is a slick, enjoyable, silly fantasy that is great fun as it exists in a completely different universe that we all wish we were in. Only in the final 10 minutes does John Hughes suddenly remember that, hey, he's John Hughes and launches into a message ending where endings are made, lessons learned and the 'kids are alright'. Ignoring the inevitable mush this is not a great film anyway ? it is silly, it is total fantasy and it has no logic to it whatsoever; but, damn it, it's a lot of fun! This is why it has stuck in so many people my age minds, because it is pure teenage escapism and, as such, it is silly and a lot of fun to watch. Matching the fun/silly tone of the material the film delivers everything with a knowing wink at the audience the whole way.In doing this it put a lot of weight on Broderick's and Ferris' shoulders. Ferris is not a perfect character but he is good enough to keep the audience with him ? even if now, as an adult, I'd sort of like to wipe that smug smile off his goddamn know-it-all face (sort of)! Anyway, Broderick carries the film's mood very well and he wins the audience with a charismatic 'to-camera' delivery that could easily have been embarrassingly awful. He seems to be having a lot of fun making the film and he manages to put that into his character and it helps the film a lot. A fresh-faced Ruck is also good and it isn't his fault that he is dumped with the hard work of delivering the films last minute lesson and losing the fun. Sara is also given some rubbish to do at the end but basically her role is one of looking pretty and being light on her feet (not like that!). Jones is good fun even if he delivers a fairly genre standard role (although it is an early entry as a fall guy). Small role for Swanson and Sheen make for curiosity value.Overall this is not a great film but it is good fun and works within its own fantasy world setting. The delivery of the stars (especially Broderick) really make sure the material works where it could have been a bit of an embarrassment. Only a typically John Hughes 'what have we learned today?' moment at the end kind of knocks the life out of that ? up till that point it's silly escapism that works if you watch it as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decades have gone by and new generations continue to relate to this comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."In only a span of six years, John Hughes managed to direct some of the best comedies from the 80's which surprisingly hold up very well to this day. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still regarded as a classic in the genre and despite being a simple mainstream movie, Matthew Broderick delivers such an iconic performance that many teens continue to fall in love with his character as the decades pass. The gags are handled with perfect comedic timing and the soundtrack has become such a recognizable tune in pop culture. I don't know exactly what it is that has made this such a beloved film amongst American teenagers, but it seems to transcend generations over time because of its accessibility. It's a light comedy about being young and mischievous that simply seems to delight and captivate audiences who are looking for some form of escape. It's rare for a film with a simple premise like this to continue captivating audiences over time and even those teens who watched it in the 80's and are now mature decide to go back and revisit it for nostalgic purposes or to introduce it to their now teenage sons. This is just further proof that no one had the comedic touch that Hughes had in the 80's with his teenage comedies. I still prefer Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as his go to movie, but Ferris Bueller was a delightful experience. I look forward to catching up with some more of his classic films. I remember having seen classic scenes of this movie, but this was my first time watching it from beginning to end and I was delighted and surprised because I didn't think I would ever like Broderick as much as I did here. This is by far his best performance.The film takes place in Chicago where we are introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a senior in High School who has decided to take the day off from school by fooling his parents into thinking he's sick. Ferris constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the audience letting them know what he's thinking. His plan is so well thought out that even his friends at school think he's developed a serious condition and are trying to raise money for his treatment. He's the sort of guy that everyone in school dreams of being and his life motto is simply to enjoy life to the fullest. He personifies the spirit of youth and that is what makes him such a likable guy despite acting irresponsable at times. The only people who don't believe him are his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who is angry everyone keeps on falling for his lame excuses, and the school principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) who is determined to discover his lie and make him lose the school year for it. Ferris has everything planned out very carefully and is convinced his plan will work. He calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who has also taken a sick leave, but in his case he's really feeling bad. Ferris convinces him to come pick him up and together they come up with a plan to help Ferris's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), get out of classes. In a hilarious scene the duo call Principal Rooney impersonating Sloane's father and asking him to give his daughter permission to leave the school because her grandmother has passed away. Ferris then convinces Cameron to take his father's Ferrari and the adventure begins for the three friends through the streets of Chicago. Hughes has always excelled as a screenwriter and he is responsible for some of the funniest comedies from the 80's and 90's. He didn't direct as many films, but he has been involved with many scripts. In Ferris Bueller he seems to have written a simple but perfectly executed script of a young teenager who is trying to live life to the fullest. He could've come out as cocky, but there is some heart to his character and it becomes incredibly hard not to root for him, especially when Hughes put so much emphasis during the opening scene portraying the dullness of High School life and then introducing Principal Rooney as such a douchebag. The scenes where he is desperately trying to uncover Ferris's plan are incredibly cartoonish and over the top, but it is funny nonetheless. There are also a few heart felt scenes between Ferris and Cameron which make his character even more likable despite his bad influence. Broderick delivers the performance of his career and there are very few actors who can break the fourth wall the way he did here without interrupting the flow of the story (the other who comes to mind is John Cusack). There is also a great scene in which Ferris covers one of The Beatle's song in a parade that simply adds to the already amazing soundtrack. Jones is hilarious as Rooney and it's not often that these over the top villains are portrayed well. He never comes off annoying, and that's something difficult to achieve. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a comedy that has transcended time and generations and it may come as a surprise to many considering it's such a light and simple premise, but Hughes manages to work his magic. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film to Watch on Your Day Off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986): Dir: John Hughes / Cast: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey: This is every student's fantasy. A day without parents, teachers and authority. Ferris Bueller fakes sickness in order to skip his ninth day of school. He convinces his best friend to join him because one wrong move deserves another. Then they proceed to break Bueller's girlfriend out of school by faking a family death. The principal isn't buying it and makes an attempt to bring Bueller to justice. Entertaining and often very funny teen comedy directed by John Hughes who previously brought us The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles. One problem the film has is its moral dilemma. It seems to view Bueller's antic as heroic as he invades a parade as well as convince his friend to allow them to venture out in a vehicle that was totally off limits. Matthew Broderick plays Ferris whose actions are free spirited and without consequence. He is joined by Alan Ruck as his nervous best friend who must take a stand against his dominating father. Mia Sara plays Bueller's anxious girlfriend full of life. Jeffrey Jones is hilarious as the principal whose day keeps getting worse. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's sister Jeanie who knows of her brother's schemes but cannot convict him. It seems to address freedom and adolescence and our everlasting war against public education. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I ADORE this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, in my opinion, is one of the funniest and greatest movies that I have ever watched in my entire lifetime. Granted, my "entire lifetime" hasn't been very looking in comparison to others, but so far this is possibly one of the greatest I've ever seen.Not only is Ferris a funny, lovable character that makes us laugh and smile and want to be him, but Cameron IS us, as people, the awkward ones who worry too much. Ferris makes us laugh, Cameron is relatable, and Sloane is the pretty comic relief, even more than Ferris at times, but in a different sort of way. All in all, this movie is absolutely hilarious, and I regret not watching it sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedy movie i have ever seen.Right from the start movie engages the audience and builds the character of Ferris Bueller played by Matthew Broderick,who is a fun loving,full of life and very clever fella liked by everyone. The movie also makes you realize how important it is that you enjoy life as it comes and conquer your fears. The acting by all the characters is excellent and dialogues are also good. at the end i would quote from the movie that " Life moves pretty fast,and if you don't stop and look around once in a while,you could miss it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe many perfect movies have ever been made but this is surely one. Bueller... has barely dated since it's release which, for a film about young people and city/suburban life, is an astonishing achievement. What it has in spades is sincerity and authenticity - qualities that set many of John Hughes' movies apart - combined with a ripping script. What I like most about this movie is that it is entirely devoid of sex and violence and can be enjoyed by "everyone in the family" (not that I don't enjoy sex and violence in movies but many of the best movies - Casino being a case in point - are not really suitable in the same way). I would honestly recommend this move to absolutely anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>he should have taken the movie off, instead of the day....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have seen many movies in my time. several with matthew broderick. However, this movie in no way stood ground to how people told me it was. the characters were terribly developed, it had a stupid 80's kid plot, and i did not enjoy it at all. if there was a score lower than a 1 in this rating system....it would get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was Too Fairy Tale And Unrealistic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was anyone's dream and no reality! (Spoilers ahead!) Ferris Bueller fakes being sick to get out of going to school. Why didn't his stupid parents know that he was sick. And why didn't the stupid principal catch him in the act? His friend was so stupid! How many people in real life would let their best friend borrow their father's car? Why didn't Ferris' father see him all of those times Ferris was near him instead of in school? In real life, his sister would have told on him instead of covered up for him at the end of the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I mean the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the baddest movies I have ever seen, although I like Matthew Broderick's acting talents. Why it is so bad: Ferris plays the real cool guy and ignores his best friends.Even after all, everybody likes him. Hrr, if our real world could be that funny. The worst acting role of Matthew Broderick!</fullReview>
