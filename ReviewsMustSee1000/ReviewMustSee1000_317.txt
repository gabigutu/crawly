		<shortDescription>Better now than when I was 11</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this movie from when I was a kid. I remembered it fondly, and always pictured Pacino giving the big "This whole courtroom's out of order!!" speech. I just rented it again after not seeing it for about twenty years, and WOW! There's a lot more to remember than that one speech. I absolutely loved this movie! I always like Pacino, but sometimes he just plays a similar character over and over. In this one, young Pacino got to play everything from scared to sad to funny to furious... and I thought he did great. I haven't felt for a character so much in quite a while.The relationship between Pacino and his "leading lady" was a good one, especially for the '70's. I thought those two characters were interesting together.The music sucked, but every movie soundtrack at that time sounded like a porno flick, didn't it?It's a story where one bad thing after another happens in a short period of time, in very unrealistic (we all hope!) fashion - but that's a whole movie genre in itself (although I don't know what you'd call it), to make us think of lots of different things and to push the main character over the edge. Without all the subplots, I don't think the ending would have made as much sense.I'd like a copy for my video library, and I don't say that often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Catch-22' inside a courtroom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked And Justice for All. I found it very entertaining and absorbing. In its satiric way, the movie is full of rich characters and plausible situations even if sometimes you can spot the cliché around the corner. Sometimes satire works as a magnifying glass to expose and better criticize something. And I believe that's what happens in this movie with all those bizarre scenes and deranged characters.Even though Jewison focuses problems such as corruption, criticizes the danger of powerful people in the wrong places and brings up moral dilemmas about the practice of law, I believe And Justice for All is more of a satire than a serious alert to a possible decadence of the judicial system. The odd elements in the plot are one too many to see the movie strictly from its dramatic point of view: a cross-dresser client, an evidence-eating defendant, a suicidal judge, a hysterical lawyer.In a certain way, the message of this movie reminded me the one of Mike Nichols anti-war comedy Catch-22: in order to cope with a crazy situation you have to become a little crazy. In a war scenario people fight for values like justice and order, but they also fight for power and interests; the same thing happens inside a courtroom. Some lawyers see Law as a business, some see it as a way to promote their personal careers and some see it as the opportunity given to those who have nothing else to lose.The performances are just great, specially the ones of Jack Warden and Jeffrey Tambor. Al Pacino unquestionably steals the movie with another over-the-top performance as the lawyer willing to risk everything and delivers another memorable speech during his `opening statement'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The young lawyer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur Kirkland is a young lawyer who realizes early on in his career that whatever he learned in school is different in real life. When we first meet Arthur he seems eager to help his clients. He soon realizes the legal system, as it's practiced in the court room, depends on who is judging the case, as there appears to be jaded judges who are blind to the justice he is seeking for his clients.This 1979, directed by Norman Jewison, and based on a screen play by Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtin, offers another look at the way our legal system works.The young Arthur clearly gets his fill of what is wrong with the system early on as he sees an innocent man go to jail for something he didn't do. That same man, plays a pivoting role in the story when he becomes so frustrated that he can't take it anymore. The same goes for the black cross dresser, who puts his trust in Arthur, only to feel betrayed when Arthur sends a colleague to defend him, but obviously, that lawyer couldn't care less what happens to the poor man.The film is engrossing because of the work of a young, and eager, Al Pacino, who as Arthur Kirkland, is basically, the whole movie. Mr. Pacino, under Mr. Jewison's guidance did a wonderful job in getting under Arthur Kirkland's skin. This was one of the best performances this talented actor gave early in his career.The rest of the cast shows some actors that went on to bigger and better things. Craig T. Nelson, Christine Lahti, Jeffrey Tambor, Domnenic Chianese,and Larry Briggman, made good contributions to the success of the film. Some veteran pros like Jack Warden, John Forsythe, Lee Strassberg, Sam Levene, are also showcased in the film."And Justice for All" is a satisfactory film worth a look because of Norman Jewison and Al Pacino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And Pacino proves my point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie Al Pacino once again proves my point that he (Al Pacino) is one of the greatest actors off all time. By 1979 he had already pretty much proven this but never the less this is one of his best films yet. Even without Al Pacino this movie would be great.(Not near as great but never the less)I mean it is also very well directed and the screen play alone is magnificently written. So if you are a Pacino fan, or even if your not a Pacino fan i am telling you, that to die without seeing this movie is a sin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C'mon, people. Are you really having trouble determining whether this is a comedy or not? From beginning to end, it's filled with hysterical and whimsical (if sometimes troubling) situations, wickedly funny bits of dialogue, and sight gags. There are way too many to mention here, but the highlights would include the trial of the foul-mouthed gentleman, the helicopter ride, the defendant eating the lottery tickets, Arthur and Gail's Chinese dinner, the ethics committee hearing, Carl and the prostitute and, of course, the "opening statement" in the courtroom. An important subplot runs through all this -- Arthur trying to hold his sanity and legal practice together, while sparking up his love live -- along with some of the tragedy he witnesses. He is, after all, a budget-priced criminal defense lawyer in a large Eastern city, so I wouldn't expect everything to be pretty and tidy, even in a comedy. Contrary to some of the comments below, this movie is highly pedigreed. Thought the script was weak? Barry Levinson co-wrote it. And what's all this bellyaching about the music? This movie was released during the disco craze and the score was performed by a jailhouse ensemble. What did you expect the music to sound like, Tangerine Dream? Porter Wagoner? Beethoven? It was written by Dave Grusin, who has been nominated for seven Oscars (he won in 1988 for "The Milagro Beanfield War") and also has collected seven Grammys over the years. Of course, it was directed by Norman Jewison, who has shown good, if occasional, aptitude for comedy ("The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming," "Moonstruck," "Other People's Money"). Also, if you look at Pacino's performance with a critical eye, you may decide it was one of the best of his career -- especially compared with some of the more contrived (if popular) portrayals subsequent to this movie ("Scarface," "Scent of a Woman"). Try to remember the context in which a movie was released while watching with that critical eye and it's generally apparent if it stands the test of time. I'd say this one does -- beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent legal drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb performances of all players without exception, but of course special mention has to go to Pacino who gives one of the best performances of his career. If you are interested in joining the legal profession (as I was), this is a must-see. Pacino is an over-worked, successful defence lawyer, juggling his heavy caseload. When a judge, whom he is publicly known to hate, is charged with Rape, Pacino is asked to defend him. Although this is the premise for the film, it is so beautifully entwined with many different, rich characters and a multitude of cases, it's almost unfair to even pinpoint the main thread. A perfect blend of tragedy, comedy and drama, I would rank this film in my all-time top 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie's Out Of Order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Look, I adore Jewison's Rollerball. I even like the original Thomas Crown Affair, this is his worst movie by a mile. We will get to the worst ending in the history of legal movies. Sometimes, like Flashdance, it helps just to let you read a summary of the narrative. How does this sound?: a transvestite that is mistreated in a series of coincidences that make Snowpiercer realistic? Of course, he ends up killing himself. An insane judge with a death wish who sits on the edge of ledges eating his lunch? Later, he takes Arthur for a ride on his helicopter that he only fills with barely enough; less and less each time? A lawyer friend of Arthur's who has a breakdown and starts throwing plates and glasses at people in the Courthouse? A woman beating judge who just happens to be Arthur's nemesis who wants Arthur, who hates his guts, to represent him with his career on the line? Suspension of disbelief does not cover this utter insanity. Hey, I was one of the few people that like Jewison's FIST, this is just an awful piece of utter crap. In philosophy we call this temporal compression, if these ridiculous events were spread out over vast periods of time maybe, just maybe, we could believe them. The last event, which is the core of the plot, Fleming choosing Arthur, his worst enemy to defend him is a piece of brainless absurdity. It is there for only one reason to set up the worst ending in any courtroom movie. Lawyers out there, what would the Bar have done to a man who turned on his client and made the prosecution's case for them? Now, you understand the suicidal judge Warden don't you? Guess who the judge turns out to be when Arthur blows a gasket, starts yelling and cursing in a courtroom, Hello?, then proceeds to jump to attacking Fleming instead of defending him. First, he would never have practiced law for the rest of his life, Fleming would have sued him for every penny he would ever earn; these things would have worried him after he got out of jail years later for all the contempt charges. See the painful plot contrivance? Out of all the judges, Arthur draws the suicidal judge who is his best friend and lets him go Postal without having him beaten to the ground like in reality. This is what makes this the steaming piece of poop it always has been. The transvestite's fate, the suicidal judge, the lawyer throwing plates, his worst enemy on earth selecting Pacino to represent him. The worst written movie you will ever watch. Pacino is just starting out here, and do not kid yourself, the man made some very terrible films: Revolution, Author, Author. This is at the top of the list. None of Jewison's library comes close to this on the stink level; it is the single worst courtroom movie ever made. Want to see a good one? Watch Anatomy Of A Murder or The Verdict. Disagree with me? Ask yourself, if my life hung in the balance would I select my worst freaking enemy to defend me? The whole script is so phony and manufactured; it has the verisimilitude of a Fred Flintstone episode. One Big Pile Of Poop</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stands out among the hundreds I've seen; It is exactly what it was initially marketed as; an inditement of the late 70's (and I suspect little has changed) legal system. This is accomplished magnificently.. Imagine an over-worked court appointed defender with a heart of gold.. in a corrupt web of compromise, and over-stressed beauro-crats. If you have ever enjoyed a court/lawyer movie give this one a chance!!! Look out for one of the funniest and yet reasonably plausible situations I've ever seen in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Object Is After All, Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I doubt you will ever see as thorough an indictment of the American legal system as you are brought in the film And Justice For All. Too often the object of that legal system has been terribly lost in the process.This film has become my favorite Al Pacino role. I don't think he was ever better on the screen as Arthur Kirkland, an attorney who cares maybe too much for his clients both for his career and his own mental health. During the course of And Justice For All, Pacino has two clients who for reasons I won't go into here, do not get their proper day in court and both stories end tragically. The clients are Robert Christian as the cross dressing Ralph Agee and Thomas G. Waites as Jeff McCullaugh and both players give stunning performances. The hardest audience heart out there will feel their pain.Their stories are mixed in with Pacino's running feud with a malevolent judge played by John Forsythe. John Forsythe in this film is not the John Forsythe of Dynasty or Bachelor Father or the disembodied employer of three shapely female private eyes. As it turns out this law and order judge thinks he's quite above the law. And he involves Pacino in his effort to prove his innocence after he's accused of rape.Life does have a funny way of imitating art and later on the New York State Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Sol Wachtler, was brought down in a similar scandal to what Forsythe is accused of here.Jack Warden is another judge operating out of that same Baltimore courthouse that Forsythe does. He's quite a whack job himself, sitting on a window ledge eating his lunch, wearing a concealed revolver under his judicial robes. It's a crime for the rest of us to do that, but he's another judge who feels himself above the law.Pacino has some very tender scenes with Lee Strassberg who plays his grandfather and Sam Levene who is Strassberg's friend at the nursing home they reside it. They're all such good players that you don't even think while you're watching them that this is a reunion of Michael Corleone and Hyman Roth. His scenes with them are his link to a world beyond his chosen profession.The tragedy of And Justice For All is not so much the personal tragedies of Christian and Waites, bad as they are. It is the arrogant abuse of the rules and procedures of our legal system by the very men who are a bound by it as Pacino is. Pacino finds himself so boxed in that the only way he can see justice done is blow up his own career in a now legendary courtroom climax scene.In the post Watergate Era, And Justice For All found its audience. And its message is still a timely one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A searing indictment of the legal profession!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And Justice for All is an expose of the corruption, politics, and general crookedness of the legal profession. We are introduced to this unsavory world in the form of Al Pacino's character, Arthur. The movie does a good job of portraying both the human and systemic flaws of the American legal system. While the film works well if it is viewed as a segment of episodes, it suffers if viewed as a whole. Taken together the episodes feel disjointed. Still, And Justice for All is a socially relevant film and the presence of Pacino adds to its appeal. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly conceived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino's comically baffled expression at the very last shot of this film says it all, really. But is he baffled by Jeffrey Tambor's silly toupee, or by the fact that he has no idea what kind of movie he was just in? Not to worry - he's not alone. Director Norman Jewison doesn't know either, and neither does the audience....And Justice For All, according to many reviews, is supposed to be some sort of Catch-22-ish satirical black comedy, but if so then it fails miserably, since it's never as funny or outrageous as that, and the scenes that force the film's messages - and those are excruciatingly obvious - are melodramatic and heavy-handed. The comedic scenes seem to be there more to relieve the tension cause by the more dramatic scenes, but instead they just confuse. Most of the time the message we get is that very simply, law doesn't work, and always with tragic results - innocent men rot away in prison, guilty powerful men go unpunished, and guilty evil men walk free and kill again.Pacino was famed for his subtle performances throughout the 70's - nobody else could have made the slick transition from naive idealism to calculated evil that he achieved in The Godfather, or in Dog Day Afternoon. But here no trace of subtlety can be found. And although the over-the-top performance fits right in at the final scene, and indeed makes for a very memorable and often quoted couple of minutes, it makes every other scene - especially the ones Pacino's character shares with his grandfather or his dull, unconvincing love interest - fall flat. Partially it's a good thing, because it paved the way for his performance in Scarface - which is one of the best, most glorious examples of complete, shameless overacting ever. But here it just doesn't work. It's not Pacino's fault, though, or Jewison's; It's just a poorly conceived story, and with something like that, all the talent in the world couldn't help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does "justice" really exist in the American judicial system?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is getting to be a bit long in the tooth nowadays, but unfortunately it still rings all too true in America today. Every day we see another example of the film's basic truth; if you have enough money or influence, you can do almost ANYTHING and walk away clean. Jewison's film is just one in a long line of protests against a system where justice is a two tiered affair; from Bob Dylan's THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL, through grousing newspaper editorials about corporate criminals walking away, through grumbling in the Vox Populi (and subsequent rioting) about the handling of the O. J. Simpson case, and the currently impending travesty that will probably allow those responsible for the Enron debacle to avoid responsibility for the lives they've destroyed.The ending of AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, although fictional, gives us all a bit of welcome relief from a sea of corruption that seems to be drowning us all... but is the film really an accurate reflection of what's going on in the legal system? I decided to find out.I have a friend who is an attorney who seldom watches movies of any sort; he doesn't even own a television set. He's never seen AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, so I sent him a cut rate DVD of it (which he played on his PC's DVD drive). I asked him for comments from the point of view of a real, working lawyer.He enjoyed the film, but I found his comments fascinating... from a technical standpoint, the film had a few flaws, but also had some rather neat plot twists that, for odd reasons, ring true.First off... I was very surprised to hear that Arthur Kirkland's opening statement to the jury would be VERY UNLIKELY to get him disbarred! In fact, given the circumstances, it was about the only course open to him, and if he HADN'T sunk Fleming, Kirkland COULD have been disbarred! Under the canons of legal ethics, once Kirkland knew FOR CERTAIN that Fleming was guilty of the accusations (and he knew that from Fleming's own admission of guilt), he had only two options. Failure to exercise one of both of them IS grounds for disbarment.1- He would have to go to the judge and request to be relieved as Fleming's defense attorney. If he were to defend Fleming, KNOWING that he's guilty, it would necessarily require him to LIE in open court, a clear violation of legal ethics. In real practice, a lawyer will often tell a prospective defendant FLAT OUT "If you're guilty, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT". Unfortunately for us all, Kirkland's probing for the truth (and Fleming's confession) are totally unrealistic. As we know from the film's plot, the option of walking away from the case was neatly cut off for him. Even if he had been able to exercise it, he was still on shaky ethical ground, and could possibly have been hauled before the Bar Association at a later date.2- Kirkland's other option in this situation involves his role as an Officer of the Court. Once he knew for certain that Fleming was guilty, he was OBLIGATED to report that fact to the court. If he had dropped the case and it could be proved later that he knew about Fleming's guilt but hadn't taken this whistle blowing action, he was disbarment bait. The failure to report Fleming's confession constitutes the deliberate withholding of evidence.In the end, Kirkland fulfilled this requirement with his outburst, thus covering his ass from an ethical standpoint. However, due to the unconventional way he did it, one of two things would probably happen in a real court.First, Judge Rayford would reprimand him in open court for his unseemly performance, and possibly find him in contempt.Second, even tho it was a VERY touchy situation, it's possible that the State Bar Association would probably also issue a reprimand, falling short of disbarment proceedings, again on the basis of unseemly conduct in court.My attorney friend was also critical of Kirkland's handling of the Jeff McCullough case. Repeatedly, Kirkland tells Jeff "I'll get you out".Lawyers may sometimes seem like all powerful miracle workers to the general public, but they're not. With his "I'll get you out" statements, KIRKLAND WAS MAKING A PROMISE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP, and thus was lying to Jeff. The proper statement would have been "I'll do everything that I can to get you out".Another criticism... when the charges were first filed against Fleming, he should have been suspended from the bench IMMEDIATELY until such time as the charges were disposed of. If found eventually guilty, EVERY case that Judge Fleming decided from the time of being charged had an almost automatic appeal loophole.These things seem like minor technicalities, just the nitpicking of a few words and concepts. That may be true, but the law itself IS nothing but a few words and concepts... words and concepts that we're supposed to be living by.One final thing the lawyer said, and this is, to me, the most ominous comment of all.He doesn't deal with Kirkland's sort of practice... in his own words, criminal law is far too sleazy for his tastes.The lies, back-room deals, corruption, and as he put it, "Playing Penalty Poker" with prosecutors are all too accurately portrayed in this film, and he wants no part of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review: 'And Justice for all' has been reviewed to death here below: as comedy; as a tour-de- force acting performance by Al Pacino; as an entertainment and as a musical showcase. I was hugely entertained by this movie but in a different way.This is a personal evaluation of a landmark movie directed by Norman Jewison and written by Barry Levinson &amp; Valarie Curtin. The film reflected the rage that many felt against the failed Criminal-Justice system of 25-yrs ago. Since then, Judges have been reigned in somewhat, and DNA technology has freed thousands, many even from death row. What still persists is law-enforcement's inability to admit a mistake. Officialdom will move heaven and earth to stand firm on any previous decision; as if to admit error would undermine the legal edifice and bring the law into disrespect. The opposite is true of course. The whole world knows that mistakes are made in adjudicating the relations between people and if law enforcement could admit this fact with grace, the whole legal system would run more smoothly, in fact an order of magnitude smoother and more efficiently. And thus the rage.I would like to start at the end. With titles running, Arthur Kirkland, Baltimore lawyer, is sitting, bewildered and despairing on the steps of the Baltimore Court House; he has just blown the career he loved. His rage at the phony and corrupt criminal-justice system has led him to betray the client he was sworn to defend and he will surely be disbarred. The trial he has been ejected from will certainly be declared a mistrial and a vicious criminal may go free. The affair he was having with Gail Packer, a thing of the past.The writers had no doubt about the story they were telling. It's a story about justice denied to all but those who can get the best legal representation and that means money. It is a story of a system where judges have become so arrogant and crazed by their own power of life or death that they have lost all contact with the world around them. Without a modicum of respect for the rights of those that come before them for justice, sometimes carelessly and sometimes with malice they meddle heedlessly in peoples lives causing havoc and dismay.The plea-bargaining system also comes in for its share of bashing. In the lobbies and antechambers of the CourtHouse we see lawyers and prosecutors haggling over the penalties to be meted out in exchange for a guilty plea. These are almost biblical scenes of temple desecration.Judge Henry T. Fleming played by John Forsyth is the metaphor for evil in this movie. His aloofness and arrogance and his repetition of the words 'I don't care' convey the awesomeness of his depravity. He really doesn't care about the people who come before him or their lawyers or the rest of the World for that matter. In this he is the distilled essence of evil. As the story evolves we realize that this man is more criminal than those who appear before him and all ironies are complete. In the penultimate scene, the 'You are out of order' scene; Judge Fleming, accused rapist, and Kirkland's client gazes sternly and coldly at Kirklands' helpless rage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My least faverout Pacino film. Boring, unbelivable, uninspired and generally turgid and forced feeling....The ending is stupid and overblown and worst of all - THE MUSIC! The music makes it feel like its trying to be a comedy and it may be this which makes me dislike this film so much. Along with Bobby Deerfield, Pacino's poorest ever film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HEAVY HANDED STINKER SHOOTS ITS OWN MESSAGE IN THE FOOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I like both actor Al Pacino and director Norman Jewison, but in AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, I like neither of them. They were assigned a stinker and they stink with it. The picture represents all the worst things in late 70s film, particularly lame, family aimed comedy or drama. This film tries to be satiric, but takes itself too seriously in the drama department and fails miserably when it tries to be funny. It feels too much and thinks too little.SPOILERS BELOWPacino plays "the best lawyer there is" and tries to defend all the innocent people in Baltimore. Now he must defend a judge he doesn't like from a rape charge he knows he's guilty of. Meanwhile all of his innocent clients (all of whom have weepy stories of poverty and hard luck) are getting screwed in his absence. One of them tells Pacino horror stories of prison, giving the worst delivery in the movie to the line "they RAPED me!" Too heighten the black comedy, our hero is close friends with a suicidal judge played by Jack Warden. The moral strain weighs on our hero and we get scenes of Pacino lightheartedly running with joggers to the worst music ever put in a film. The climax contains the famous "You're out of order!" speech, the crest of the actor's most over-the-top performance. Courtroom drama never looked worse.The satire of this film is weak and obvious, and it doesn't help that it's contained in a poorly acted, poorly directed movie. The score by David Grusin is torturous. If you want a good film that exposes the justice system, see THE TRIAL (1962) or BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (1962). If want a good Pacino movie, anything from SERPICO (1973) to SCARFACE (1983) should satisfy. If you want a good Jewison movie, see ROLLERBALL (1975) or FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1971). AND JUSTICE FOR ALL was a mistake. It's messages can be better served with anything from LE PROCES to NATURAL BORN KILLERS.Avoid this mess! See a real movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino's Performance Becomes Central To The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...And Justice for All" is an Oscar nominated court room drama that stars Al Pacino as charismatic and personable lawyer Arthur Kirkland,who has apparently gotten sick of the American judicial system.Joining him in are Jack Warden, John Forsythe, and Lee Strasberg. This film directed by Norman Jewison has earned a Oscar nominations for both Pacino and the screenplay written by Barry Levison and Valerie Curtin.Added to that,it also well-known for its final speech scene by Kirkland which has served as inspiration to many films after it was shown back in 1979.Arthur Kirkland is a lawyer who remains someone who is fighting for truth,justice and idealism which many lawyers tend to forget once they attain fame and fortune.This is presented in the story through many cases and problems that his clients face including defending a judge who is guilty and cannot refuse to become his client as he is threatened to get disbarred from his profession as a lawyer.It was obvious that Al Pacino's presence and great performance made this film a classic.He portrayed Kirkland extremely well that is definitely unforgettable.His final speech wherein the people in the court scream,"You are out of order" His presence and personality as the lawyer Arthur Kirkland,helps carry this drama-comedy through to an effective if melodramatic monologue at the end, functioning as the summation of a court case.Despite the many plots involved in it,the viewer won't get confused as Pacino's performance becomes central to the movie rather than the many events that are involved in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic piece of Pacinoism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a fantastic film which is frequently snubbed on movie polls but totally deserves a decent nod. It can at times seem like an episode of one of those police drama series so popular around the time it was made (Miami Vice springs to mind in some parts). However once you get past the 'period' nature of the film it takes on quite a different character. Pacino's lines have been parodied often in popular culture to the point where the film could easily be transformed into comedy, but this has not been the outcome simply because Pacino is so darn engaging and emotion that raw is hard to deny. If I told you to watch a film in which the hero is a moral lawyer you would probably think that his character sounds like Mr Boring; but Pacino is anything but. He really gives his character so much depth in every glance, movement, breathe.... He jumps out of the picture and grows with intensity as the film progresses to one of the best moments of film history; the infamous court room explosion ending. By this point you're so engaged that you are going through the emotions right along with him; cheering with the crowd, laughing at Pacino's refusal to exit the room quietly and finishing with the line 'you have just heard my opening statement'=classic :D The relationship between Pacino and his love interest at first seems just like a typical element to add to the film; ie, this is the 70s, our star needs a love interest etc. Yet their bedroom fights add tension to the mix and give what could have been a boring run of the mill romance a bit of unlikeliness. The supporting cast are by no means bad, but some lesser characters seem to not be able to completely deliver the emotion Pacino needs to bounce off in order to truly explore his own performance; basically Pacino is a god and sweeps the floor with the rest. This is actually not a good thing because it detracts from the overall film. However, this film is a great drama to loose yourself in for a while and despite the depressing subject matter of 'injustice' through most of the film; the ending does succeed in reversing allot of the frustration. In fact you do get a strong sense of the film's overall more relevant message; justice will be delivered if people use their discretion and don't simply follow bureaucratic procedures for the sake of doing so. Free from corruption and infused with moral integrity; one man can make a difference. This is one of my go to movies for procrastination and dish-washing distraction. It's entertaining even after the first watch and that's what makes it a classic piece of Pacino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final courtroom soliloquy by Pacino's character at the end of the movie says it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student in 1968 I worked in my father's law office when 20 years of age running errands and picking up clients and other attorneys at the airport. I once thought I wanted to become a lawyer like the old man. After that experience it never crossed my mind again. It was then I recognized that lawyers were merely another "mob" with public sanction. My father ultimately had to give it up because of all the disingenuous people he had to deal with in that arena. Justice is difficult to come by under the best of circumstances and courtrooms present an intellectual environment one notch above that of an alley.For me this movie should be required viewing by all prospective attorneys. Especially the criminal variety for eventually they shall be exposed to all that they have seen in this movie in one form or another and very likely much, much worse.Oh, and I liked the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least It Had Al Pacino and Baltimore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino is usually a bit over-the-top and usually interesting to watch. He certainly is both in this movie. The Baltimore setting is another plus.It's a movie that lurches from satire to straight comedy to drama and even tragedy--with a disco sound track no less. The sheer wealth of incident (so much happens in this movie!) is improbable. And of course the finale, with Pacino Telling It Like It Is, is pure Hollywood histrionics.But after all it is Pacino chewing the scenery, not some lesser actor. He makes you feel how much he cares about his clients, and he makes you share his rage over the legal system. You feel his frustration with his beloved but addled grandfather, who thinks his boy is still in school. His loyalty to the old man is touching.All in all, an entertaining movie about a serious subject, but not a movie to take too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino's Best Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of the great roles over Al Pacino's career, we automatically conjure up images of The Godfather I and II, Scent of A Woman, Carlito's Way and Serpico among many others. What gets little mention and is oft forgotten is Al Pacino's performance as Arthur Kirkland in "?And Justice for All." From days past and as I would watch Pacino classics, I always think back to 1979 and his portrayal of an ethical lawyer fighting for truth and justice in a not so ethical legal morass.Thanks to AMC for bringing this movie back for new generation of movie watchers and also for a reminder of how great an actor Al Pacino is. If you have not seen "?And Justice for All," you are in for a treat. Far and away this was Al Pacino's best film role and possibly one of the greatest film roles of all time.Too bad Hollywood was so engrossed in the morbidly depressing and cynical Kramer vs. Kramer in 1980. Head to head, Dustin Hoffman's role in Kramer vs. Kramer could not hold Al Pacino's water, but alas, the Hollywood types on most occasions vote with their backsides and not their heads.See this Movie!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American legal system is a joke. For the most part it favors the rich, tosses a bone to the poor, while everyone else gets lost in the cracks. And those cracks are everywhere.Al Pacino delivers a powerhouse performance in ...And Justice For All. The film has it's ups and downs, but Al's final scene is well worth the wait. Without giving away the ending, let me paraphrase something he tells the jury during his criminal trial's opening statement. "Winning is the only thing that matters. Both sides in a trial will do whatever's necessary to win. Winning is everything." How true it is. The guilty are set free on technical errors. The innocent are jailed on the words of convicted felons. Truth means nothing. Facts are routinely tossed out of court. Lawyers hate this movie because it shows how corrupt the legal system really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Al Pacino and own several of his films, but had never even heard of 'And Justice For All' till one day while at best buy I knocked down a DVD while digging in my purse to answer my phone. Reaching down to pick it up I saw Pacino's name but didn't recognize the title. I read the back and found it interesting partly b/c most of his roles around the 70s were mob related(not that I mind). When I saw the price was $6.99 I figured it didn't matter if it was great or okay b/c I'd have another Pacino film for my collection. I ended up watching it that night, twice b/c it gets better each time you watch it. Everything about this film is amazing from beginning to end, especially the well crafted writing and actors who perfectly mix the intense drama with the dark humor. If they gave Oscars for just the endings this film would get one hands down. If you are the type of person who notices the little things, pay attention to the musical score. This film made me realize the saying "keep it simple stupid" can apply to films soundtracks if done right. It doesn't matter if you like the box office hits or think Hollywood has only its self to blame for poor sales at the theater, you will love it. And to think if that guy hadn't dialed the wrong # causing me to answer my phone I would have never knocked this movie off the shelf, it's like one of those love stories straight out of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...and justice for all" is a remarkable film that shows the American legal system from the inside. The film clearly shows us that corruption is a common and everyday thing in order to settle and getting off the hook. The legal profession has always, and I might add, that it probably always will, face an amount of problems and prejudice when it comes to honesty and "fair play". In this movie the remarkable Al Pacino plays a lawyer who actually cares for his clients. To him it is not about the money, but it is all about to give each individual, poor or rich, homosexual or not, the best legal defense possible. Unfortunately lawyers like Al Pacino's character are a minority. Throughout the movie your hate against the accused judge is really growing, and the end of the film is the finest work I have ever seen on the screen! Al Pacino' opening procedure will always be remembered in the film history, especially among the movies in the history which deal with the legal system. The movie is splendid. Do me a favor and watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Complete Courtroom Drama I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is compelling. It is not just a supremely entertaining courtroom drama, but more so a brilliantly detailed character study. Al Pacino, predictably, is just class, and the other characters give him some very competent support. The interweaving of secondary cases with the main one is seamless, and keeps the pace moving at a pleasing level. The ending, which is so often talked about, is terrific, if a little sudden, and not totally satisfying. The script is faultless. My only criticism is that the disco soundtrack is incongruous with the serious issues at hand and at times pretty comical. But I guess the time period is perfectly evoked through it, not that the issues are exclusively relevant to the late 70s/early 80s though. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"...And Justice For All" is one of those well-intentioned movies that doesn't achieve the goal it was set out to accomplish. Having said this, the film was a superb example how there are some lawyers truly do care about their clients and not intent on making a lot of money.I now know why Al Pacino is considered one of the greatest film stars in Hollywood. With roles in "The Godfather," "Scent Of A Woman," "Heat," "Devil's Advocate" and "The Insider," Pacino has proven he is an actor with integrity and presence.The best thing about "...And Justice For All" was watching Pacino in action because this came out while he was at his peak; furthermore, the incredible part is that he is still at this level. Another aspect I enjoyed immensely was the true and genuine care that Pacino's character had for his clients. It was incredible that lawyer's are human like everyone else.The only thing I would change about this movie would be to narrow the storylines because it had a few too many to follow. With the number of subplots in this film, it was too difficult to pinpoint the main plot and enjoy the film outright.Overall, this movie was good and I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not one of Pacino's best movies (with a long list of hits though it is hard to beat) this is one of the classic 1970s lawyer pics. Pacino takes on the role of a good lawyer, both in morals and principles, who will put those same morals and principles to the test when he has to defend a corrupt and mean-spirited judge or else face serious reprimands from the bar. Unlike "The Paper Chase" light-hearted take on love and law school, "...And Justice for All" is a comedy about the follies of being a lawyer but, with a poignant twist on the morals that grip at the conscious of litigators who get to personal with their work. Pacino's role, as well as his oft quoted breakdown during his opening argument ("You're out of order!...") is a must-see in itself</fullReview>

Another excellent film depicting the legal system in a realistic fashion.This film is brilliant, because while it is a satire, it does not treat the audience as ignorant. Baltimore lawyer, (Pacino) must defend a judge (John Forsythe) in a horrific sexual assault case. Christine Lahti is believable as an ethics committee commando, at odds with Pacino.Jack Warden is at his best (You may also catch him in "The Verdict" with Paul Newman another great legal drama).This film does not sugar-coat reality,nor does it patronize the audience, and has some excellent performances. 10/10.</fullReview>

Satire is easy to screw up, and Jewison often perpetrates very heavy-handed, pedantic films with overstated messages. The two don't mix. Too many scenes and lines of dialogue were just too hackneyed to be believed. A couple of less simmering subplots and this could have been effective. Pacino is great to watch, but a bit more subtlety is really necessary to pull this stuff off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Pacino Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"And Justice For All" is both an entertaining and meaningful film. It shows us the errors in our system of jurisprudence that is the best we have yet is still flawed and many times unfair in its implementation. "And Justice For All" depicts these flaws through a satirical look at this system and its principal characters.When Judge Henry T. Fleming is accused of rape, he hires defense attorney Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) to represent him. Kirkland is a fiery, idealistic lawyer who cares for people- and who detests Fleming, a man with whom he's battled in the courtroom and regards as both uncaring and arrogant. Furthermore, Fleming is holding up the release of a Kirkland client falsely accused of murder. This is of no consequence to Fleming, who instead sees an opportunity to make his innocence more apparent by having an adversary defend him. Kirkland wants no part of this charade, until Fleming threatens to blackmail him with long buried information on a breach of attorney-client privilege. Reluctantly, Kirkland takes the case.Several events rattle Kirkland as he prepares his defense; a near-fatal helicopter ride with a presumably suicidal judge (Jack Warden) and the public nervous breakdown of his law partner (Jeffrey Tambor). Things turn tragic when two of Kirkland's clients die in separate incidents. A harmless, transgender man hangs himself when he is mistakenly sent back to jail in Kirkland's absence, and McCullough- the man Fleming prevented from being released- is shot in a hostage situation, as Kirkland attempts to diffuse it. Enraged and disillusioned at such an unthinkable turn of events, Kirkland sits on a bench outside the courtroom and ponders his role in a system he perceives as terribly indifferent and cruel.Shortly thereafter, Kirkland receives photos from another client that show Judge Fleming engaged in S&amp;M acts with a prostitute. When shown the pictures, Fleming smirks and admits his guilt in the rape for which he is accused. A disgusted Kirkland leaves the room as a haughty Fleming reminds him that "he'll see him in court". The trial begins, and after the prosecution's opening statement, it is Kirkland's turn. After what appears to be a legitimate attempt to discredit the prosecution for their "lack of a case", he stuns everyone by declaring Fleming's guilt and proclaims "he should go right to f*ckin' jail". As the judge objects and the crowd erupts into chaos amidst this blatant breach of etiquette, Kirkland is dragged from the courtroom. He screams at Fleming- who looks on with a mixture of both disbelief and disgust- for disgracing the law and the people he represents.Pacino is outstanding. His courtroom scene is one of those moments in film that is stamped indelibly on one's memory. He perfectly conveys the disenchantment of a man hopelessly swimming against the tide despite his best efforts. In the end he all but sacrifices a career to ensure that a thoroughly detestable man, a person who is "supposed to protect people" is ruined professionally. Fine character work is turned in by both John Forsythe as Fleming and Jack Warden as an eccentric judge who keeps a rifle in his chambers and eats his lunch on the ledge of a 4th floor balcony.A highly recommended movie and a must for Pacino fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...And Just This Movie for All Time!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can see on my rating, this is one of my all time favorite films of all time. Pacino was just excellent. But he had a almost dream team of a cast to back him up.Let's start with the late great Jack Warden as the loony/crazed eccentric Judge Francis Rayford. When he pulled the gun and shot it in the courtroom, man that one gets me every-time. he has a sort of a Death-Wish and Pacino's Arthur is in a way scared of him. It's very evident on the helicopter scene! Funny. He practically stole the movie along with Tambor and Forsythe.Next we had the late great John Forsythe as the evil and despicable Judge Henry T. Fleming. Man what a great job he did! I would have never imagine the "Charlie" of Charlie's Angels as a bad guy! He played him as a suave thinking he is the law incarnate and because of that he thinks he's untouchable, yet he is way worse than the criminals he puts away. What a great villain. He just oozed badness.Next we have the late great Lee Strasberg as Grandpa Sam. How well he played him. So sad were these scenes to me because I can relate big-time as I take care of my loved one who suffers from dementia and Alzheimers. It is very difficult to see your love one's mind and body deteriorate on a daily basis. But I decided to take the caregiver role nonetheless. Ans it has taking it's toll on me but I would not have any other way.Then we have the hilarious and funny Jeffrey Tambor as the insane Jay Porter. He practically stole the picture from Pacino. From the very 1st scene he had, he had me cracking up. That's how good he was in this. His "deteriorating' of a lawyer who cannot take it or hack it anymore is so believable. His scene with Pacino when he comes over late one night to tell him that a client Porter got off, knowing he was guilty, just killed a couple of kids is devastating. No wonder he went bonkers because he felt responsible. Great performance by this talented and great actor.The tall and beautiful Christine Lahti as the ethics committee member Gail Packer 'hunting' down corrupt lawyers was OK. This was Lahti's movie debut per say. (she had done a couple of TV movies before this one) It was funny to have her as Pacino's love interest because she towered over him big-time. She's 5'10", he's 5'7". They really didn't have chemistry per say, but she was OK.The late great Sam Levene played Arnie, Grandpa Sam's friend and fellow resident at the rest home. His few scenes were poignant and funny and sad. A great way for this actor to end his career. This was to be his final film.The late Robert Christian as the tragic and doomed transvestite Ralph Agee was well done by Christian. His very 1st scene was funny and very humiliating at the same time. I was very happy Pacino's Arthur decided to represent him and try to keep him/her out of jail. Christian expressed the fear of winding up in jail and it felt very real. Tragic ending though.Another tragic person was Jeff McCullaugh played by the great Thomas G. Waites. A innocent guy who is in jail and can't seem to get out! No matter what Pacino does. It has a lot to do with Forsthe's Fleming who is being a complete jerk and not even considering to review the case because he has issues with Pacino's Arthur.Larry Bryggman as Warren Fresnell, a fellow colleague of Tambor &amp; Pacino, did a good job. His one oversight caused a tragic mishap. Very intense scene with Pacino and it's the 1st time we see Pacino's Arthur just blow up and lose it.The great Craig T. Nelson as prosecuting attorney Frank Bowers, was a worthy and believable adversary for Pacino in the final court case concerning Fleming. He did a good job.The wonderful and funny Dominic Chianese as Carl Travers, a client of Arthur who just can't keep from getting into one mess after another. ( all concerning woman) was just hilarious. From the very 1st time we see him in, he was just on a roll. Kind of reminded me of Larry David of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Almost the same kinda of intensity and delivery of lines. His lending a "helping hand" to Arthur, helps Pacino come to a resolution and conclusion of what to do with Fleming.The great Joe Morton plays a Prison Doctor. But his scenes were short and he didn't really have much to do. In the Special Edition DVD of this film, they have a deleted scene which included more of Joe Morton's doctor calling in Pacino's Arthur and informing him that Waites Jeff McCullaugh was brutally beaten and raped and Pacino comes to the Prison hospital to see McCullaugh. But I can see why they deleted it, it just did not do much for the flow of the movie. it was better done without this deleted scene that when we see the McCullaugh character again, he has taken hostages and armed himself because he was brutally beaten and raped. Kind of makes more sense.Two character actors I recognized but they really had just bit cameo parts were Beverly Sanders(remember her from a memorable Sanford &amp; Son episode,Matchmaker(1974)as Nora Simpson) as Sherry, Arthur's secretary and John Aquino (of Diner fame, he was 'Tank') as a Deputy Sheriff.There was another deleted scene included on the Special Edition DVD that is worth mentioning called "Thanksgiving Basketball Game" In it we have Pacino, Tambor and Bryggman and the rest of the guests, going outside for a friendly game of ball.</fullReview>

But if he does not do it, the judge will have him disbarred.Roger Ebert says of this film that "it's not a statement, it's an anthology." And that is absolutely right. The plot above, and a similar plot on the back of the movie's case, only cover about one quarter of what goes on in this film. We have a crazy attorney, a prison riot, a suicidal judge (played expertly by Jack Warden)... the rape trial actually turns out to be such a small part.But that is a good thing, because we get to see Al Pacino being a little bit excited in a variety of different circumstances. And the tone is incredible -- some parts are deadly serious (rape, murder and suicide have to be to some degree) while much of the movie is a very, very dark comedy. And it is incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real old fashioned lawyer drama but with a human aspect in it. It's not all in the courtroom though, most is actually out of it. There are a number of stories running together but that's the life of a lawyer really all about. Al Pacino is his usual best again, the roll is really the type of character he excels in. Most other characters are fine too but it's all about Pacino of course. Very watchable movie, it continuously moves forward and changes. The actual main story is almost a side line in the story but it comes to a end with a big bang. Although the bang is big the outcome is a bit unexpected and in a way I think the movie is not completely finished. Watch it for sure though (and ignore the cheesy 70's music).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino puts justice on trial. Extremely entertaining !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"And Justice for All" is a critical look at "our wonderful judiciary system" and it delivers its message with a shameless lack of subtlety that I found very amusing. Pacino's over-the-top performance as attorney Arthur Kirkland is absolutely fantastic and no one else could have done it better. The movie is extremely entertaining and hilarious, except a few sentimental moments. Even those have their charm however, and Pacino is in a real tour-de-force here. There are many sub-plots and the tone is uneven, which makes it a strange movie from this point of view. This is the funniest and most entertaining performance by Al Pacino. The expression on Pacino's face in the last shot is priceless, and so is his legendary, passionate, court room speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the reasons Al Pacino was the most important actor of the 70s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We don't get many of these types of movies anymore. Studios worry about their commercial appeal (ie. appeal to teenagers on a date) and give us more gory thrillers or rom-coms instead, but back in the 70s the occasional satiric drama would sneak past the studio committee types and hit the box office like a blot of lightning. Part of the reason for this was the presence of successful writers of hard hitting social satire like Paddy Chayefsky among the front of rank of Hollywood scripters and another reason was powerhouse actors like Pacino. Like his earlier hit Dog Day Afternoon, here the camera stays on him like a spotlight as he fights a doomed fight with every breath in his body.This movie took on a serious subject: a Justice System so lost in its own bureaucracy and politics that it could no longer dispense the thing it was created for, ie. justice. Pacino ran with it in classic fashion, ranting, foaming at the mouth, practically rabid with indignation and frustration. It's a powerhouse performance, not subtle by any means, but affecting, maddening, galvanizing. By the time the movie's over, you want to make this guy governor of New York.The script by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson is the film's greatest strength. Years later I could still quote from it line for line. It is funny, clever and insane by turns with enough wildly believable ironies for ten courtroom dramas. Corrupt supposed officers of the court spout on about ethics yet are not above blackmail. The wealthy and connected enjoy privileges, while the bureaucracy grinds up the unsuspecting. Director Jewison gave everything a professional polish, but then wisely stayed out of the way of his star. This was Pacino's stage and he owned it.Be prepared to have your world rocked. There are few modern actors who would even attempt a role like this. They want the audience to like them. Pacino just wants to be heard. And he'll yell to make that happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie... What a performance!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have spent 2 weekends watching only Al Pacino movies... Carlito's way, The Devils Advocate, Scent of a woman and the last one today "And Justice for All"... And this guy "Al Pacino" amazes me, surprises me with his performance in every movie. What a brilliant performance in this movie. If you have to see this movie, just watch it for the performance that this guy delivers. The expressions, the dialog delivery, the change of emotions, the profound manner he ensures he delivery every single word and every single action is something you would get to relish during the entire course of this movie. Before i forget that I should be mentioning something about the movie as well and not only about Al Pacino who seem to have mesmerized me with his performance that I am not able to talk about anything else, the movie is a master piece in itself... Very good story line up, a big slap on the judicial system and the way it functions. Beautifully directed and with the kind of fine actors working in this movie, I am sure the director wouldn't have had much of a trouble getting such fine actors to act the way he wanted. See the brilliance of Al Pacino and every body else and I am sure you would be praising it all the way just like I am. Have fun watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A story about our wonderful judicial system"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Courtroom drama has enjoyed a level of prestige through almost every age of cinema, but this late 70s offering, ? And Justice for All, perverts the normal course of the subgenre in order to trash the very tenets and conventions of the American legal system.Soapbox pictures like this can often be a bit self-defeating, losing their audience amid the po-faced preaching. But ? And Justice for All takes a cunning approach. It keeps its (frankly depressing) subject matter afloat with a continual air of irreverence, vaguely surreal in the way it never quite borders on outright comedy. You're always left wondering whether you are really supposed to be finding it funny. It is really only a slight exaggeration of the absurdity of real life. But so as to keep the central plot line serious, a lot of this semi-humour comes from a small set of supporting players, in particular the brilliantly manic Jeffrey Tambor, and Jack Warden doing the seedy authority figure act that seemed to account for his entire 70s career. Their antics make Pacino's impassioned outbursts towards the end of the movie seem more believable by comparison. And when those moments come, Pacino is at his charismatic best, conveying gravitas even when he is a haggard and unshaven mess.Director Norman Jewison's style is at its most simple. Long takes, stark backgrounds and functional shot compositions are the order of the day here. The idea is that the images are that powerful, Jewison doesn't need any fancy tricks. But that doesn't mean there isn't thought in what he does with the camera. He often gives varied coverage of a scene, throwing in shots on the periphery of the action to show systems at work, such as a courtroom artist sketching a relaxed John Forsythe. He also keeps his distance quite a bit, putting the characters in long shot even during a dialogue scene. This gives us in the audience a feeling of being cut off from what is going on, unable to help, like the crowd kept back from a crime scene.The resulting picture is one of the most powerful and affecting of its kind. The point of stories like this is to leave the audience with a sense of injustice, a pro-active feeling that something must change. And on that account ? And Justice for All is nothing short of spectacular success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Supposedly this movie got panned. I have no idea why. I never get tired of watching it. "We want to win regardless of the truth, regardless of justice, regardless, of who's guilty or innocent. Winning is, everything." My other favorite part is when Pacino says "the prosecution is not going to get that man today, no, because I'm gonna get him." I've got most of the lines for both of those court scenes memorized. The one weak part of the plot was that Pacino actually had enough leverage to get Jeff McCulough released from prison and the case reopened as a non-negotiable pre-condition for taking Fleming's case. Only a minor problem.</fullReview>

The attempt at satire is derailed by the thematic inconsistency. The performances are all over the place too ... Christine Lahti is fresh, Jack Warden is having a great time, John Forsythe and Jeffrey Tambor contest to see who can chew on the scenery the hardest, Lee Strasberg is seemingly in another, more earnest movie, and Al Pacino is brilliantly watchable as always. The 70's disco-y score is the definition of inappropriate and annoying. But if you have nothing better to do, rent it and pick up some beer and chips ... you'll be entertained, although I suspect not in the manner intended by the Mr. Jewison, Mr. Levinson, and Ms. Curtin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike any other legal drama I have seen, this is more of a courthouse drama than a court room drama in that it follows Al Pacino (a lawyer) though several cases he has. In the movie Pacino juggles matters with various clients, a love affair with a board member, friendships and rivalries with other attorneys (one of which goes through a nervous breakdown), as well as very differing relationships with two judges - one who is suicidal and another who is his sworn enemy. Corruption and injustice pushes ethical Pacino to breaking point with an ending scene containing quite possibly the most enthralling acting I can remember. Every syllable Pacino utters is perfect! Really not to be missed if you are a fan of the genre at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norman Jewison directs American actor Al Pacino to show some home truths about American justice system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norman Jewison is a leading Canadian director who has made many socially relevant offbeat films which have left their mark on American cinema.It can be said that things did not work out well for him when he made "And Justice for All".In this film,he has tried to depict the corruption which has soiled the image as well as reputation of American criminal justice system.However,despite the presence of some leading names of Hollywood cinema including superstar Al Pacino,this film has failed to be a major achievement as somewhere in the middle of the film viewers feel abysmally lost.This might be due to the fact that audiences are made to believe that they are watching a drama film whereas in reality they are being forced to witness a comedy film.It is true that "And justice for all" is absolutely honest in its approach but due to its irrational assortment of various feather brained characters,viewers tend to dissociate themselves more and more with the overall development of film's honest plot and story line.In the past, somebody remarked that "And justice for all" had a strange kind of reactionary effect on American criminal justice system which was similar to "All the President's Men" directed by Alan.J.Pakula. However,after seeing both the films,one wonders how such a lopsided comparison was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to add my 'one thumb up one thumb down' to this film, but only because the portrayal of court room scenes, lawyers and prisons have come so far since this film. IN IT'S DAY it was most probably a daring attack on the judicial system, but even TV shows today are more daring - 'Law &amp; Order' and all of it's offshoots, 'The District'(ironically with Nelson who was in this film), not to mention 'OZ' on HBO. I agree, there were attempts at comic relief from Jeffrey Tambor, or at least I think they were, in spite of his mysterious breakdown. I am still not sure how 'funny' the suicidal judge was. But one glaring timewarp was the god-awful music. Whoever says that soundtracks are not all that important needs to see this film. One reviewer here said they thought they were watching a porno movie - and that's pretty funny - but the music here was along the lines of typical '70's cop shows. I wonder how much of the film could be salvaged if a new music track was scored for it.... In any event, it went as far as it could go FOR THE PERIOD and in spite of the tearful histrionics of Pacino (who I think is a fabulous actor) it was not horrible...just a time warp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy? Nope!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm sure the intent of the filmmakers was for this to be a comedy and it does generate some well-earned humor, the stakes involved embodied through two criminally (no pun intended) underrated supporting performances (by Robert Christian and Thomas G. Waites) are much too high for this film to be labeled a comedy, despite the filmmakers intentions. This is compelling drama presented in a matter-of-fact style that makes it all the more chilling. In fact, the film only goes wrong when it tries too hard for its comedic tone. I remember seeing this film as a kid late one night on cable. I came in on the scene where Ralph, the doomed transvestite, is forced to go to prison due to lack of proper paperwork and was shaken by the revelation in the next scene where Pacino revels that Ralph hanged himself. Watching this film as an adult, I thought I'd be desensitized to such material especially since I am a "Law &amp; Order" addict and all. However, that scene and this film scares me now more than ever because I understand just how very easy it is to get trapped in the maze of the criminal justice system. And since the Supreme Court just days ago ruled in favor of retroactive searches based on traffic warrants being admissible which makes anyone a target of unlawful search and seizures, this film is all the more prescient and horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Pacino blows the whistle on the corrupt justice system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Archangel Michael" on this site thinks "And Justice for All" (1979) is a lousy courtroom story and rates it 2/10. However, this movie is not a courtroom story or a crime story. It's the story of a man (Al Pacino) who throws away his lawyer career to become a whistleblower. It's the story of a man who decides that his life demands honesty. His grandfather (Lee Strasberg) has even told him earlier that without honesty, a life is worth nothing. And although Pacino has his difference with his girl friend (Christine Lahti) who is on a committee attempting to clean up the system of justice a bit, it is a difference of degree, not of kind. He wants a more thorough housecleaning that aims at the judges. They are elected, but does the public have a choice or are the choices heavily restricted by politics? This movie is a black comedy, which is a way of insinuating unpleasant realities by a degree of recognition of their absurdity. The movie is along the lines of "The Hospital" (1971).No opportunity is lost in this film to condemn the justice system and to show how poorly adapted it is to dispense justice. The bitter and sweet, the tragic and the comic are inextricably intertwined. John Forsythe is perfectly cast as the paragon of justice, looking eminently respectable with his silver hair and meticulous suits. We see him for what he is when the robes come off. Jack Warden is excellent as a suicidal judge. All the minor or lesser supporting parts are cast extremely well, allowing each actor to fashion a memorable role. This is due primarily to an excellent script and smooth editing that moves from vignette to vignette effortlessly.The movie has something to say and it says it in its own highly satirical, farcical and simultaneously serious way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one mostly like legal movies as they are mixed with drama, suspense and very tense scenes and most of the time the plots are revealing and with a twist. And this 1979 picture directed by TV man Norm Jewison has all of that with an all right title of "And Justice For All" it shows that the courts and legal system is a cat and mouse game with unfairness and plenty of corruption, and true the film is mixed with some funny moments and some outrageous characters to round the entertainment and overall quality of it.Al Pacino(one of the best around and one of his better roles which was Oscar nominated)is Arthur Kirkland a young criminal defense lawyer in Baltimore, who watches a system with criminals going free as it's the typical lawyers and judges are making deals like plea bargains and deals, yet all of a sudden the innocent are going unprotected. As after case after case Arthur is to repay a favor somewhat political it's like you scratch my back I scratch yours as Arthur is pressured into defending a high profile judge(played by John Forsythe) who's been accused of raping and beating a young girl. And you guessed it Arthur knows he's guilty and finally all of this comes to an explosive head! This film is simply about integrity and choosing between right and wrong it's a calling for morality and in the meantime it's a showcase and satire spin of the justice legal system which like anything else can be manipulated, really overall good underrated late 1970's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One reviewer here says, in effect, "This is a comedy!! People who say otherwise are fools!" Balderdash. It's half comedy, half tragedy. This difficult genre, this strange hybrid, reached maturity in the late 1960s and into the 1970s with films like Dog Day Afernoon, Nashville, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, this picture. So, half comedy, half pointed commentary on the corruption of America, with the latter half including a healthy dollop of tragedy.The film is good. The script is pretty solid - well researched, lively, elegantly stitching together a lot of disparate material. Some of the scenes drag on too long. The photography seems uninspired. The music is that awful oboe-heavy stuff that permeated a lot of movies of this era (see also "Tootsie" for example). The acting is fine. Jack Warden is hilarious. Christine Lahti is entirely convincing. John Forsythe is outstanding. Al Pacino is, as always, worth watching, although this is not one of my top five favorites of his performances. The sequences with the character named Jeff are worth the price of admission; I'm amazed that this actor (Thomas G. Waites) didn't become one of the top character actors of the 1980s and '90s. By the way, I think the connections are fairly obvious between Jack Nicholson's lunchroom scene in "Five Easy Pieces" and Jeff's big moment.</fullReview>

John Forsythe (Dynasty) plays a corrupt judge since we know him better as the lovable Blake Carrington on television. I enjoy watching Jeffrey Tambor and Larry Bryggman as fellow lawyers. Tambor had hair then and plays an unstable, conflicted lawyer. Bryggman is under-rated actor and better known as Dr. John Dixon or other film parts. Bryggman's character can match Pacino any day. I enjoyed Christine Lahti as the love interest although not necessary. The film has some sad troubling moments especially with two innocent men wronged by the justice system.

Al Pacino is solid, but his final scene is unnecessarily over-the-top. Many of the supporting performances are cringeworthy, though that might be the writer and director's faults. John Forsythe is quite unconvincing as Al Pacino's nemesis. Jeffrey Tambor is irritatingly over-the-top in his role. Craig T Nelson is ridiculous as the prosecutor.

		<shortDescription>Has become a classic of the impossibility to change justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has become a classic, meaning it is commonly quoted when you speak of the problem of justice in the USA, in this case Baltimore, Maryland. The title of the film is the end of the pledge of allegiance that is read at the beginning of the film by several children in some class. Every Ameican knows it and it is essential to keep it in mind here."I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."Apart from the sidetracking subplot of the grandfather of the main character, a lawyer, the rest has to do with nothing but justice and prison. Even the affair this main character has with the lawyer turned bureaucrat in the court administration or surveillance committee is part of the plot because she has a lot to say about a lot of things and about what he should do or should not do. Our main character, Arthur Kirkland, is seen taking care, a strange way of speaking, of two clients. One will commit suicide and the other will be shot by some sniper of the police when he steps out of line. The lawyer himself, Arthur, is liquidated and he has no other way than accepting this self-liquidation provided he can in doing so bring at least one rotten judge down. If you step off the line, either you become rotten all the way, hence the slave of the system, or you will be kicked out and you will starve. Liquidation by starvation.Justice is shown as malfunctioning from beginning to end, from left to right and back from right to left, up and down and the reverse, from front to back and vice versa. They do not have the slightest interest for the people they are supposed to try and send to prison, or eventually release, put on probation or parole. It is absolutely disheartening but there is nothing to do about it. So better accept it and make do with it, or at least make believe you believe in the fairness of that justice for all which is the miscarriage of justice for most.Enjoy the film. There is nothing else to say except the details of the arguments. You better watch them and discover them yourself, but be sure you have not eaten something too greasy if you do not want to be sick, I mean vomit in your lap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

He is called upon to defend a judge he despises(played by John Forsythe) who is accused of rape. The judge (named Fleming) wants Arthur to defend him, and threatens to have him disbarred if he doesn't, especially when Arthur learns the truth of the allegations. His friend Jay(played by Jeffrey Tambor) also an attorney has apparently lost his mind, and the judge trying the case(played by Jack Warden) has a death wish... Reasonably good film has superb performances and many pertinent things to say, with a memorable finale, but never catches fire like the similarly themed film "The Hospital".

Nelson, Jack Warden, and a host of others. this movie explores the criminal justice system,, and makes you wonder just how much this is based on reality,, a lot i'm sure. our lawyer hero tries to defend his clients the best he can,, some are guilty some are innocent,, you have to feel for his main client wrongly convicted and rotting in jail,, as far as the dirty judge goes, i'm glad the storyline had our hero not defending the scumbag judge,, the part of the movie that was intriguing to me was the woman hired to get dirt on the case and our hero,, he winds up sleeping with, I guess maybe he figured he would beat her to the punch so if she had information regarding the investigation he would be the first one to find out what was going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Injustice For Al ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I have the pleasure to watch "? And Justice for All", I try to understand why this movie isn't as discussed and revered as it should be. I guess the comedic aspect of the script ?rightfully Oscar nominated- might have disoriented those who expected a solid courtroom drama. Yet the laughs worked for me, and if I wouldn't dare to label this a comedy, I must say that laughs never worked as well as when you expected serious stuff, especially when the film is served by one hell of a spectacular performance from Al Pacino, earning him his fifth Oscar nomination of the 70's.The comedy works because it conveys the subtle notion that some things would be too tragic if they were not so absurd, and the absurdity denounced in the film relies on the pervert effect of bureaucracy on the American judicial system. Norman Jewison's film is an extremely well-written satire of the judicial system, offering many perspectives on the way, justice can be handled with many vivid examples on the most dysfunctional elements, at a point that you almost get the feeling of an episodic film that sometimes loses its track, but this is trivial when you consider the pedagogic value of "? And Justice For All".You have all the pros and cons of the Judicial system presented, beyond all the ideals and the noble words, there is a stinking atmosphere of corruption, if not in the procedures, in the human, which is saying a lot when the human factor is so preponderant. The hero of this tragicomedy is Arthur Kirkland while his colleagues reminded of a line from one of my Business School teachers, who told us that "you can be absolutely professional AND a complete bastard", you can be a bastard and respect the rules, and on a bigger scale, the Law. This idea is totally unacceptable on an ethical level for Kirkland, who tries not to be just a lawyer, but a man of principles and ideals, like those expressed by children's voices in the beginning of the film, concluding with "? And Justice For All" said in unison.Four simple words that summarize a noble ideal, and an ellipsis to sustain the idea that this is what it's all about at the end, this is the Alpha and the Omega. And Arthur Kirkland's struggle is to revive a certain noble idea of Justice. As the movie goes on, we learn about the many judicial oddities that cruelly underline the flaws of the system, one man arrested for a taillight and kept in jail because he was suspected for murder, the burden was refused because of a delay of three days in the procedures, another man sentenced to jail because his lawyer couldn't even check his file correctly, while another one, played by a scene-stealer Jeffrey Tambor, was so talented, he allowed the acquittal of a killer, based on a technicality, allowing two new murders to be committed, he did his job but at what price?Progressively, the humor fades out while the decisive aspect of the human factor, for worse, is proved. And we can only hope, that Arthur Kirkland would use his humanity for the best and not let himself corrupted by the bureaucratic system, and become a professional instead of an ethical lawyer. This is the inspirational core of the film: the moral conflict lying beneath the soul of Arthur Kirkland and incarnated by the case he must defend, his personal enemy, Judge Fleming, John Forsythe in a powerful and nuanced antagonistic role, is accused of rape. Fleming is the one who kept Arthur's client for jail because of the delay, Kirkland threw him a punch him in the face, getting directly to jail, and last but not least, Kirkland already betrayed another client who was really guilty. To avoid being disbarred, Arthur must defend his client, who reveals himself to be guilty.Arthur Kirkland is put in the wall besides his own moral conflict, and this is what the whole movie is about, making us root for a character who, in an existential impulse, must question the very meaning of his vocation. In a poignant discussion with his grandfather, portrayed by Lee Strasberg, (Michael Corleone's archenemy from "The Godfather Part II"), Arthur is reminded that honesty is the most important value. And this idea is proved as he realizes the emotional downfall of his colleague who let the killer getting free. What's the purpose of a system that doesn't guarantee justice for those who really need it, where justice depends on a talent more than an ethic? Is justice a system or an ideal? Is it reliable or ... totally out of order? Well, let's say that whatever slowness have bothered you in the beginning, the climax makes it all worth it. In the same vein of "The Verdict" or "Kramer vs. Kramer", "? And Justice For All" allows a reflexion on the practicality of Justice and the way it should make the lawyers feel invested by a noble mission.And apart from that, the movie strikes by the originality of its tone where we get to discover a lawyer in a jail, where a judge with suicidal impulses fires a gun to have silence, Jack Warden is absolutely priceless ? and where you'll have one of the most communicative laugh scenes ever, the movie is entertaining and enjoyable at many levels, and if I mentioned Lee Strasberg, it's also a pleasure to rediscover his Sicilian sidekick, Johnny Ola as his first client. And above all these elements, there's Al Pacino's intense performances made of laughs, shouts, cries, powerful silences, and desperate outbursts of anger. Al Pacino is the soul of the moral dilemma structuring the film, and having seen all the Oscar nominated performances from 1979, the fact that he didn't win an Oscar can be called "? Injustice For Al"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Justice for All: A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"And Justice for All" is an insightful and tragic film about a defence lawyer Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) who has his sanity tested by a justice system that is broken. I will not go into the details of the plot, except to raise two points. To begin with, the plot has some big, spectacular scenes for its actors (particularly in the end), but it also seems a bit predictable at times, like Kirkland's love affair and some of the tragedies endured in the prison system. Yet this shortcoming is more than compensated by the fact the characters seem like real human beings who are vibrant and alive , as opposed to actors who are just playing roles. As long as we can believe in the characters and feel what they feel, then the plot has a freshness and a vitality that it would otherwise have lacked. In emphasizing the role of character in making "And Justice for All" work as a film, I am referring even to the relatively small roles, such as Thomas Waites as Jeff McCullaugh, who is arrested on a false charge and slowly driven crazy while in prison. Robert Christian also delivers a superb and poignant performance as the trans-gender Ralph Agee. Lastly Jeffrey Tambor does a great job playing the defence lawyer Jay Porter who is overworked, stressed, and harbouring a troubled conscience.However, "And Justice for All" succeeds primarily because of Al Pacino's great work as a character actor. Al Pacino plays Arthur Kirkland as though he was that man. Instead of seeing Al Pacino, we see a defence lawyer who is overworked, impassioned, spontaneous, brilliant and eccentric. However, Al Pacino's achievement goes even beyond that, because what he is conveying through his performance is the psychology of Arthur Kirkland, a man slowly falling to pieces under the strain of tragedy, the incompetence of others and his huge workload. So the viewers are not only given an interesting character to watch, but they are also shown an interesting character that changes emotionally and psychologically over the course of this movie. And the experience is fascinating, wonderful and troubling all at the same time.8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and daring courtroom satire with a magnificent performance from Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino gives a typical powerful performance in this excellent courtroom drama which sees him called in to defend a judge he detests, who has been accused of raping a young woman. Pacino plays Arthur Kirkland, an angry, sharp-tongued young lawyer who hates Judge Fleming because he sent an innocent client of Kirkland's to prison because the evidence provided to prove the man's innocence arrived a few days late. When Kirkland hears that Fleming has been arrested on a rape charge, he couldn't be happier. But then when he is summoned before him and is told that Fleming wants him to defend him in court, Kirkland faces a moral and legal dilemma, especially when he becomes convinced of Fleming's innocence and uncovers a shocking conspiracy that plagues the justice system. But as he delves deeper into the case and all the mayhem that's going on behind the scenes, Kirkland realises that nothing is ever really as it seems, and that someone is manipulating him and using him as a pawn in something much more bigger than what is happening in the courtroom...Pacino is brilliant here at what he does best; running around the place screaming and shouting like a madman and sporting a tough personality that reminds people that he's a force to be reckoned with. With a performance like this here, it's no wonder De Palma had him play Tony Montana in "Scarface" a few years later. "...And Justice for All." is a political satire on the justice system in America, and it's quite dark in it's portrayal of a corrupt system as we have a well respected and fair judge (Played by Jack Warden) who is actually suicidal and spends his lunch break perched on the fourth floor balcony looking down on the street, and in one scene he is trying to shoot himself with a shotgun only to be disturbed at the last minute to be called back into court. Kirkland's friend and fellow lawyer has a nervous breakdown halfway through the film and shaves his head, while Kirkland begins a relationship with a woman he has nothing in common with and shares different political views with. Everything seems to be coming in around him, and this gives the film a claustrophobic feel as the suspense and drama is mounted up all for the climatic scene in the courtroom with the superb, unexpected twist. "...And Justice for All." is written very well and directed with great skill by Norman Jewison and the story blends the many subplots in together very well, assuring that the film never gets boring or relentless like many of these kind of films usually do. Dark, satiric and very entertaining and absorbing, this is a must-see film where Pacino gives one of his best, and possibly his most underrated performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extraordinary performance by the GREAT Al Pacino who once again demonstrates he's one of the best all time actors. This legal drama focuses on the decadent justice system in the USA, although it can be applied for every lawyer who has been in civil, and criminal tribunals.I'm a lawyer and I felt very identified with Arthurt's character. He has worked very hard in order to maintain a status as a honest lawyer but sometimes you can't just get things right when "powerful" interests play as the Puppet Master in justice. The movie deals with corruption, moral, legal aspects, and personal situations of the main character.It made me feel very emotional when Arthur's grandpa gets worse on his mental condition and can't even remember about Arthur being a lawyer. Grandpa paid Arthur's law school and took care of him. Showing Arthur with his Grandpa reminds us that even that the justice system is rotten, it doesn't mean that lawyers are also rotten inside. Touching and very realistic movie. An underrated gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norman Jewison's '...And Justice For All' is a film worth your time, thanks to it's interesting storyline and a winning performance by the legendary Al Pacino. This Courtroom Drama, offers a punch! Al Pacino stars as Arthur Kirkland, An ethical Baltimore defense lawyer who is disgusted with rampant legal corruption and is asked to defend a judge he despises in a rape trial. But if he doesn't do it, the judge will have him disbarred.Valerie Curtin &amp; Barry Levinson's Screenplay offers a punch. The film begins with a bang, and the protagonist gets defined wonderfully. Though the pace dips in the middle and tends to get a bit boring, it's climax comes out bombastic. "You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order! They're out of order!", these legendary lines, are amongst the powerful dialogue ever.Norman Jewison's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is fine. Performance-Wise: Obviously, Pacino steals the show with a winning performance. He leaves you spell-bound in the penultimate portions. John Forsythe is terrific, and causes hatred. Christine Lahti is natural to the core. Jeffrey Tambor &amp; Craig T. Nelson are passable. Others lend good support.On the whole, '...And Justice For All' is a convincing Courtroom Drama. Watch It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour of the mind of lawmakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And Justice for All is a rather psychological take on American or rather any country's judicial system; a cabaret with a variety of performances and fiascos to keep a stray bunch of audience entertained. So the courtroom is quipped with hooting, jeering and maudlin. AJFA is a sardonic depiction of courtroom proceedings where the principled, the just get ignored for profit, gossip and technicalities. It is quite a revelation for me right now, as I type the review as my words embolden my understanding towards the film. The act may not be perfect but it quite sublimely conveys its message.Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) is a vehemently righteous lawyer who flips off the depraved and satirical judicial system for making a mockery of justice and humanity. There is a wave of imbroglios throughout, with a client chewing lottery tickets, a judge wielding a gun to silence the situation, a suicidal magistrate who arbiters the system etc. Most of them detail the wonkiness that take for granted the victim's ordeal during the proceedings. Fed up to the teeth with unfairness, Arthur now has to face the test of morality and principles when he is authorized to defend Judge Fleming, a rule-abiding fellow who is in the former's bad books. There is also a love affair which does not get to intrusive. Thank God for that.AJFA is quite a nimble comedy, drama which may entertain a lazy day. It tries not to get too serious or refined, a boon and a bane for the film since it lacks the impact of some of its contemporaries. It falls in the category that best describes films of the eighties, scrupulous but not groundbreaking. It's like entering a pie contest, where a coop of smiling, simple yet impeccably dressed ladies present their pies to you, which you eat, praise and leave the scene. And that's the end of it. AJFA is one of the better pies.Al Pacino is a marvelous actor, and I say this because I can see that he knows where and how he should take his character. The role is balanced, with its share of intonations and restraint. In the initial scenes, I was disillusioned by the act but as the film progressed, he justified his initial approach in the film. Who would like to see him shouting all the time? Though I felt he could have added some more color to his role, in some sequences, knowing his status in film history. For example, in the lottery scene, when Al and some others prevent him from chewing any more tickets, Al could've looked at his colleague and cracked a smile at the ludicrousness of the situation, since the scene was meant to be humorous. But Pacino has tremendous control in the final few scenes e.g. the outburst at the court and at his friend and colleague.Al subtly takes most of the credit, even when other established actors take up quite some screen space. An unknown face, Ralph Christian steals the spotlight apart from Al, as the transgender accused of a petty crime. All he had to convey was fear of being embarrassed and horror of being sent to the callous prison, which he did efficiently. Scene 1humiliation was tragic and the effect of the successive encounters and ignominies was etched on his face. Another hapless convict unfairly incarcerated is portrayed delicately by Thomas G. Waites, who pines on Arthur till he reaches a breaking point, his pleas being disregarded by everyone else except the latter.John Forsythe's character has a supercilious, apathetic attitude towards subordinates and the accused and is a power-exploiting unscrupulous. Though he should be getting more screen time, he doesn't because, as I stated previously, the movie is not about the case but the psyche. Jack Warden is bumbling and lampooning, perhaps to depict the depreciation of the mind of a magistrate, who has to adhere to the sometimes anachronistic or pedantic laws. His helicopter scene borders on idiocy to an acidic extent; I momentarily felt I was watching Mr. Bean.The main complaint I have is that the film digresses so much; it never covers the rape victim's story and jumps straight to conclusions, in order to obviate any technicalities in the film. It's a Woody Allen approach, but I constantly wanted it to push a bit more. What is least appealing is the garish music that infuses incoherently dance tracks and trumpets in a film like this, a music best suited for Saturday Night Fever or a sports movie.AJFA may not have done complete justice to the movie, but it's a novel idea that tries to reach out to the people, even though it may have dreamt to be much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Skewers the "Justice" System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the movie is described as being about a defence attorney (Al Pacino) called upon to defend a judge (John Forsythe) with whom he's been in conflict against an accusation of rape, that really isn't the point of the movie, and I'm not even sure I'd call it the central story of the movie, although it is the storyline that leads to the eventual climax of the movie. This is really a movie blending together a variety of story lines all of which have a connecting point in Pacino's character of Arthur Kirkland, and basically the movie serves as an indictment of the lack of justice within the American "justice system."From beginning to end "justice" is portrayed as a series of deals being made with little regard for whether the accused are guilty or innocent; "justice" is portrayed as lawyers and judges who really don't give a damn about the people they see come before them; "justice" is portrayed as innocent people getting caught up in a nightmare of a legal system and being thrown into jail regardless of evidence exonerating them; "justice" is portrayed as the guilty being let off on technicalities to commit their crimes all over again; "justice" is portrayed as a disciplinary committee of lawyers who go after small fry lawyers for small time issues but who leave the big names and the judges alone. In other words, "justice" is not portrayed in a positive light.The movie is Pacino's, and his performance is excellent. He's the idealistic one - the one who sees the problems and wants something done about the problems but can't get the system to work as he believes it should. Forsythe was all right as Judge Fleming, and brought the proper bearing to the role and Jack Warden provided some effective comic relief (as well as being effective in dramatic scenes when called upon to do so) as the semi-suicidal Judge Rayford. In all honesty Christine Lahti seemed perhaps a bit out of her depth in this relatively early stage of her career as a member of the disciplinary committee who develops a relationship with Kirkland. Jeffrey Tambor was solid as he always is in these supporting roles as Kirkland's partner who goes off the deep end.I personally found that the ending weakened this movie a bit. The last scenes of the movie return to the rape accusation against Fleming as his trial opens before Judge Rayford, culminating in Kirkland's opening statement to the jury. I thought Pacino perhaps overplayed that scene a bit. I also wondered if the movie might have made an even greater impact if Kirkland's idealism had been shattered and he buckled to the system. Still, although it did perhaps weaken a bit at the end, it remained a very sobering view of the justice system.</fullReview>

Fleming is very good on his role) who is charged for the rape and beating of a young girl.Since Aurthur is threatened to lose his job and has no choice,takes on the judge's trial-who is hated by everyone in the court of the law yet feared.To sum up the movie is superb and is recommended to everyone.It has great direction,interpretations and tells a lot things about how disgustingly the system of "justice" is (not) working.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"And Justice For All" is a tonally inconsistent legal drama which is elevated tremendously by the presence of actor Al Pacino in the lead role. Everyman director Norman Jewison serves up that familiar tone of grit and angst that defined 70s Hollywood, and screenwriter Barry Levinson does pen an interesting tale about the hypocrisies and failings of the American Legal System, but flash forward 2 decades and it's Al Pacino's performance that really makes things watchable.Not only is Pacino a master of chewing scenery, but he has somehow managed to construct a filmography filled with both memorable monologues and ridiculously entertaining rants. "The Merchant of Venice", "Any Given Sunday", "The Devil's Advocate", "The Insider", "Donnie Brasco", "Two For The Money", "City Hall", "Heat", "Carlito's Way", "Scent of a Woman", "Glengary Glenn Ross", "Frankie and Johnny", "The Godfather Trilogy", "Sea of Love", "Scarface", "Serpico", "Dog Day Afternoon" etc etc?they all contain scenes in which Pacino simply cuts loose, delivering some immensely nutty speeches with divine levels of charisma. Of course people continually criticise Pacino for playing it big, for going over the top, but this is a guy who cut his teeth in theatre and still manages to find time in between movies to perform on the stage. He knows how to project himself, knows how to command a room, and so when he delivers his famous monologue at the end of "And Justice For All", it's hard not to smile at the dramaturgical fireworks. But beyond Pacino's madcap meltdown, "Justice" has very little of interest. Director Norman Jewison has little to say about either justice or legal circuits, and his film too awkwardly mixes satire, comedy and docudrama. The acclaimed Lee Strasberg co-stars.7.5/10 ? "And Justice For All" isn't as good as cinema's best courtroom dramas ("The Verdict", "12 Angry Men", "Paths of Glory", "Compulsion", "Death on the Staircase", "Anatomy of a Murder", "Capturing The Friedmans", "The Paper Chase", "Murder on a Sunday Morning" etc), but it's still a pretty good second tier legal flick. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... And Justice For All. is a very entertaining, well made courtroom drama. It is a story of a tormented lawyer who is asked to defend a judge that he despises against rape accusations. The lawyer, played by Al Pacino in another of his great performances in the '70s, finds himself in a moral dilemma that threatens his career. His instincts contradict with all the evidences on his hands that show the innocence of the accused judge, which lead to a memorable finale and the film's most famous and parodied scene.Jack Warden and Jeffrey Tambor give solid supporting performances here backed up by a solid script and competent direction from Norman Jewison, director of the multi Oscar winner In The Heat Of The Night. This is however Al Pacino movie from start to finish, in a performance that earned him a well deserved Oscar nomination, he steals every scene he is in, showcasing some of the talent that won him the legendary status he enjoys today.... And Justice For All. might not be the most sophisticated or original movie of the '70s but it is still essential viewing for any Pacino fan and any movie fan looking for an entertaining intelligent courtroom drama.</fullReview>

It' s maybe the first courtroom movie and its story remains to be beaten even after 20 years. The case of Al and his colleagues open a really good debate about consciousness and values. This touches me deeply because I am an ancient law student in Human rights and up to my last minute, I will repeat that I didn't choose this law only to get an education. Justice is a part of me. And it's a gift to get my favorite actor to illustrate this fight.Moreover, the movie balances between comedy and drama and gets great cast. A special mention to late Lee Strasberg, the mentor of Al, because when the two are together, you really see their mutual appreciation.In conclusion, you will be guilty to not run for this hidden gem !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand; Pacino knocks it out of the park.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A legal thriller that tackles a subject rarely seen in film and one that I loved seeing explored. This subject being the affect that a lawyer's clients have on their life. Throughout the film we see how several different clients take a huge toll on Arthur Kirkland's (Al Pacino) life and it's not like they appear for a minute, make an impact and then disappear. These people come back and forth into his life throughout the film and each time they appear the impact they have on Kirkland is more emotionally wrenching and painful to watch.The story centers around a Judge (John Forsythe) who is highly disliked by everyone in the business, especially Kirkland, that becomes accused of rape and actually hires Kirkland to become his lawyer. So the main plot goes through the struggle that Kirkland has emotionally with defending a man he hates who is accused of rape and it becomes more and more grueling as time goes on.One of the more interesting subplots is that of Arthur's best friend Jay (a young Jeffrey Tambor, for you Arrested Development fans) and the painful breakdown he has after learning that one of his former clients who he knew was guilty but still got off and back on the streets has committed murder again. In a film dominated by the impeccable brilliance of Al Pacino, Tambor still manages to shine. He also adds a lot of humor to the film, as does Jack Warden a more absurd Judge that is good friends with Kirkland. Throughout this entire great film is the genius of Al Pacino who delivers one of his greatest performances and certainly the best of 1979.</fullReview>

Some people may say they like this mixture but for me this movie was a serious topic (rape) so having these parts scattered made it a bit jumbled.That said, music was cheesy but funny, so that was good.

		<fullReview>The basic premise of this film is a sound one, albeit common. It is hard to resist Al Pacino's down to earth and well acted character portrayal. This is the first highlight of the film; first thing you notice. The second highlight would have to be the philosophical questions it poses regarding justice; however, it get's there, asks some good questions, and ultimately ends up being an episode of Perry Mason. A good episode.This film ends rather abruptly and what seems to be not well thought out. You may find poetry in it, I found it to be rather contentious. You decide.The character actors are good in spots, but 'over-act' through a great deal of it. Again, Perry Mason.However, for an early Pacino performance with guts, this works fine and isn't so bad, just not good.If it's on cable, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kitchen sink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10 and it seemed like the heighth of sophistication. An idealistic, principled lawyer sees the world falling apart around him and makes his stand. The world's a crummy place, he learns.Watching it again recently, a lot of things became clear. It's essentially a kitchen-sink potboiler melodrama with some black comedy in it, a puree of everything from Paddy Chayefsky to Frank Capra to Elia Kazan in which a little man rails against the system. The script is much more mediocre than you'd find in those guys' movies (Lumet is the most obvious touchstone here, and would've been the right person to direct), with lots of planted insights and twists that we've seen coming a mile away. It's faux moral in the manner of a 15-year-old who learns that not every defendant is innocent of a crime, and I think Levinson and Curtain really have no idea of what lawyers really do. Everything in the movie is an idealistic Showstopper about the system--no poring over the books or sweating out the details. There are a couple good scenes/characters I guess (Jeffrey Tambor is really entertaining), but the movie really makes little sense. Why the banally comic scene with the helicopter? Why the crummy lounge jazz score? Why does Pacino SUDDENLY YELL in the middle of every other sentence? I jest about Pacino though. He's great, totally alive, spry, and enervated--the last of his great run through the '70s, and in the service of a generic crap picture. Jewison's direction is pretty lousy, and it seems like the actors (many good actors, I might add) are essentially flying blind. Pacino makes it work for him, though, and if the movie has any weight at all, it's because he's so committed to it. He's still young enough to be completely charismatic (in the manner of "Dog Day Afternoon") yet old enough to carry some authority and wisdom. The movie doesn't really deserve him, but without him there'd be no movie at all, and I'm glad he stooped to be in this to do his thing at its most unfiltered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but charming legal drama with the a good performance by Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And Justice For All ...And Justice For All - 1979 Norman Jewison film shot on location in Baltimore,Maryland.This mix of courtroom drama and comedy is an odd time capsule- trying to imagine this Baltimore and the Baltimore from the HBO series the Wire-just makes my head explode- but I guess 26 years can make a world of difference- hell I was a Colts fan back then.Al Pacino is the star of vehicle as the idealistic Adam Kirkland.The real breakout performance is by Jeffrey Tambor as the barrister who really looses it when one of his former clients murders some children.The score can really be off-putting with the Dave Grusin light jazz making the movie feel like a canceled law show from the 70s at times.The movie is blessed with some memorable moments-including Al Pacino assaulting a Buick and a bald Jeffrey Tambor destroying a whole cart of dishes-the movie mixes drama and comedy pretty well- but I think it would be too slow for folks looking for the quick pace of a modern movie.The DVD has a sleep-inducing play by play commentary by the Director.

		<shortDescription>The Pieces are all there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie has been somewhat underrated by a large number of IMDb voters. It has many of the ingredients which make up an intriguing and entertaining film. These essential pieces include a talented lead performer, a fine supporting cast, a good script with some emotional subject matter, some humorous elements, a touch of romance and some excellent courtroom drama. These individual components, which include some of my own personal favorites, combine to produce some rewarding entertainment for film lovers.The film stars Al Pacino as a crusading defense attorney, who does his best to overcome an imperfect judicial system. Jack Warden provides uproarious support as a wise, but eccentric, judge who is involved in an abundance of the script's many humorous moments. John Forsythe portrays another judge, who provides absolutely no humor but is responsible for a large portion of the film's drama and suspense. Pacino fans will enjoy watching him try to outwit this morally corrupt and powerful member of the judiciary.I could envision an IMDb voter rating somewhere between 6 and 10, based on the voter's perspective. I personally put it in the upper portion of that range.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barry Levinson's early look at Baltimore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Barry Levinson turned to directing, he co-wrote Norman Jewison's "...And Justice for All", a comedy-drama that makes you feel like your head just exploded. Al Pacino plays Baltimore lawyer Arthur Kirkland, whose frustration with America's legal system - coupled with having to defend a judge whom he hates under threat of getting disbarred - leads him to do something that in reality probably no lawyer would ever do.Even if the movie has a rather unrealistic ending, you have to agree with what Arthur does. And one does get the feeling that America's legal system has been degenerating for years. Can we ever restore the ideals that the Founding Fathers envisioned?! Whether or not we can, I recommend "...AJFA". It's a hilarious indictment of the failed state of the criminal justice system in this country. You can pledge allegiance to it (figuratively speaking). Also starring Jack Warden, John Forsythe (happy birthday, John!), Lee Strasberg, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Lahti, Sam Levene (in his final role) and Craig T. Nelson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are simply not enough words to describe the passion, drama, and feeling, that is And Justice For All! This movie is a scathing indictment of the legal profession with elements of comedy, dramatic tension, and sadness, as we follow Arthur Kirkland, an overworked Baltimore attorney, with a unique rarity seen in law, a compassionate heart.There are elements of this movie that are hysterically funny, bitterly poignant, and emotionally heartbreaking. But you feel SOOOOOO drawn to the film because the acting is perfect. From the crazy judge with a death-wish (played to the hilt by the late great Jack Warden) to the arrogant and sinister judge Fleming whom Kirkland is blackmailed into defending played magnificently by John Forsythe, the film's emotional power is so gripping and captivating that it feels like you are watching a documentary! I consider the 8-minute final courtroom scene to be one of the greatest moments in movie history! Arthur Kirkland represents human dignity and compassion, speaking the truth in a system gone insane where the affluent can manipulate the system when guilty, while the poor and underprivileged who may be innocent, often take their place in overcrowded jails. This social and economic class distinction is a powerful undertone message in And Justice For All. This is a film that not only makes you think, it takes your breath away.One thing to add to the review: PLEASE ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITS UNCUT FORMAT! (Premium Cable, commercial video, or DVD.) The broadcast and standard cable editions of this movie edit out or dub all of the bad language. For this movie, without the bad language, it kills the whole effect and emotional power of the movie. (Especially in the climatic final courtroom scene.)</fullReview>

He is definitely one of the Best if not THE Best. He is right up there along with the contemporary Heavyweights like Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, and Robert De Niro.The movie too is an intelligent movie if not a very great one. This movie shows a Lawyer, an advocate in a very positive light and do not project them as the 'Sharks' among the Humans as they usually are.And this movie comes from a director who has gave us at least 2 memorable movies : 'The Hurricane'(1999) and 'The Fiddler on the Roof'(1971).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pacino is in excellent form as Arthur Kirkland, an idealistic and passionate defense lawyer. He is a rebel, and often clashes with his colleagues, judges, and even his girlfriend.For the most part, the supporting cast is delightful. Jack Warden is again a joy to watch as a crazy-like-a-fox judge. John Forsythe plays against type as a manipulative judge accused of raping and beating a young woman. Lee Strasberg is perfect as Grandpa Sam. Jeffrey Tambor steals the movie as Arthur's partner Jay. However, the normally likable Christine Lahti is out of place as Gail, the self-righteous and judgmental but requisite love interest for Pacino's character. The two have little chemistry-the romantic scenes are flat, and even when their characters argue, it seems forced.I saw this film many times as a child, and I loved it. I saw it again the other night, and it's just as great as I remembered. It was and always will remain one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The System is Broken! he cried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were quite a few of these types of films in the seventies - not really comedies or dramas per se, but a clever mixture of both, and part of the reason that the '70s are regarded by many as the richest era for films &amp; film-making. Another sample which comes to mind is "Mother, Jugs, and Speed" - not as good, but comparable. These films point to a darkly humorous take on our existence, usually taking place in modern, contemporary times, and in an urban setting. In this one, the legal - justice system is targeted; it's the system we supposedly depend on and which elevates our nation (the U.S.) above the rabble of the world. But the way it's examined here, the system doesn't really work. It's geared towards those with the power (read: money) and most of those incarcerated, it seems to say, are there by an awful whim of fate. Most lawyers (Pacino plays a particularly compassionate one) function merely to make the suffering of these innocents a bit less grueling, through kissing the butts of hard-line judges (Forsythe is a particularly mean one).It's a one-sided view, to be sure, that we have here: those who are truly guilty, such as child-killers, get released on technicalities and proceed to murder the next day, causing at least for one lawyer (Tambor) a spin down to a nervous breakdown. Do such things really happen in real life? Surely. But, here it's de rigueur, as if looking at the world through a funhouse mirror, a sly distortion. It's amusing to view this satire on our society's ills and we can laugh, with a bit of discomfort, at a picture of what passes for rule of law or justice. But it's probably more gratifying to see Pacino, Warden and the rest acting their best, mostly 'New York-style' (though this takes place in Baltimore). Pacino's character really shouldn't be a lawyer; he feels too much and is a genuine human being, where as everyone else is caught up in the abstracts of winning in the system. Even Pacino's new girlfriend (Lahti in her 1st movie role), tho appearing sympathetic to his dilemmas, is just another cog in the system. When he explains his biggest problem to her in the last act, instead of heartfelt advice, she gives him a list of options, as if she was his, well, lawyer.Pacino's all alone in this picture. All his peers have enclosed themselves in callous shells. His only outlet, a grandpa (acting teacher Strasberg) is moving steadily into senility. His stand-in father-judge (Warden) is literally giving in to the craziness. It all points to the thrilling finale of Pacino's opening statement during the climactic trial. Where in action pictures it usually points to a thrilling final battle, in this type of picture it's a thrilling monologue by the main actor. Pacino's all alone up there and his rendition is worth the price of admission by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has aged rather well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when it came out in 1979. I loved it back then. It had everything....drama, mystery, comedy, a love story....all elements that make a very memorable movie. Watching it again a few months ago, I have to say that it has aged fairly well. Although maybe the musical score could use some updating. Al Pacino is great as always. I've also always liked Christine Lahti, but Jeffrey Tambor steals the show here. Also, Jack Warden as a suicidal judge is hilarious. Lawyers beware, this film does not show the legal profession in a positive light. It's not kind to lawyers, nor is it kind to judges. Al Pacino's Arthur Kirkland spends his time swimming against the tide, trying to be a good lawyer yet having to make sense of all the chaos and madness around him. Meanwhile, he has to deal with his dad(his only family and the person who put him through law school) who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's,while also pursuing a relationship with lawyer Gail Packer(Lahti). A full plate to be sure, but watching Arthur navigate through this maze is fun, and well worth 2 hours of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing mix, but good despite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially it doesn't start out very well. You hear children saying the pledge of allegiance in comically childish voices while empty courtrooms and hallways dissolve by, and it seems good, but then the music starts. Either the director should have fired the score composer, or the director should have been fired for allowing that score. It was an intensely 80s (even though this was made in 1979) soft-jazz that, at first, made me worried that this movie would be an entirely lighter movie than it detailed on the back, and then later just didn't fit the movie at all. It was also bad music in the first place, which made it rather annoying.Furthermore, this was shot in that 70s/80s color that makes everything look soft, except the filmmakers were obviously trying for a hard, gritty look at times. I don't know much about what type of film-stock was available at the time, but considering I've seen quite a few movies from the time period that were capable of really taking over that soft, fuzzy look and either using it well or reversing it completely, it shows that maybe the cinematographer wasn't exactly at the top of his game at the time. That said, some rather great, albeit obvious, shots were used to pretty good effect from time to time. I think what gets me about this movie is that the usual bland imagery made the really good shots seem too blatantly symbolically obvious, almost like you wanted to say to the cinematographer, "Yeah yeah yeah, I see, bars fall across his face, and this movie is about Justice. Woo." I guess I don't really even need to say that this movie is about justice, considering that justice is in the title, everything the characters talk about is justice, it's set in the judicial system about a man named Arthur (Pacino) as a lawyer, yadayadayada. What's interesting about the writing, though, is that it does two major things: 1) It tries to paint a tragic, dark picture of the judicial system via a series of mistrials, corrupt officials, mistaken identities, and about every court-screw up you can possibly think of, and 2) It simultaneously tries to be a surreal dark-humor piece, something kind of Gilliam-esquire.Now considering the bad choice of music and the bad choice of cinematography, I wonder seriously if the direction really fit the writing. However, I can't really be sure, because the writing is so incredibly random. The crazy surreality thrown in amongst the gritty realism really confuses the viewer and makes the movie a bit unclear about what it was really trying to do.Now two explanations come to mind about this. The first is that the direction just simply didn't fit the writing and thus resulted in an odd combination conceits. The second is that the director saw the writing was really impenetrable in said way, and thus did his best to make it work. Two writers worked on the script. Maybe the second one was called in because the director wanted a different tone to the movie, or maybe the two writers just had such different outlooks on what they're doing, the director tried to include both. In one instance, the director is bad, in another, he's really commendable for at least making it work. I don't really know what to think about it.That said, it isn't like this movie is entirely bad. The acting is incredible. The story is very engaging at the least and really takes the time to knock the audience across the head a few times. Al Pacino was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and I don't know exactly what he lost it to, but if he had won it, it would have been well deserved.It is a good enough movie that I actually would have no qualms about including it in my DVD collection, and because of the sort of oddness of exposition, it's hard not to want to watch the movie again just to have some idea of what to expect.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good vehicle for Al Pacino.The last scene reminds me a bit about the role he played as the besieged bank robber that received the support of onlookers.Except that here Pacino plays the role of a lawyer who decides that honesty is more important than a career in a corrupt system.Wish it was more of a true story than an a Hollywood fiction.Supporting cast is also very good:the lawyer partner who acts outrageously after successfully defending a guilty man who then proceeds to go on a crime spree;the eccentric judge played by an excellent character actor whose antics are frightening and funny at the same time.This 1979 flick is somewhat outdated but powerful acting by Pacino makes it worth seeing again as I just did on the Canadian movie channel (no commercials during the film).Norman Jewison directs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pacino doesn't often play lawyers. Have you noticed that? I don't know if producers think he's too volatile for a courtroom or what, but he's usually a on the side of Order rather than Law.Now that's out of the way. What about the movie? Great! I had a tiny problem with a few scenes involving Pacino's grandfather, but I concede they're necessary to set up his love of the law and why he's a lawyer in the first place. Other than that, this is one of the great courtroom dramas. Great story and great dialogue. It teeters between real comedy and dark comedy for the entire movie, culminating in the famous scenery-chewing monologue from Pacino that features the immortal lines, "YOU'RE out of order! YOU'RE out of order!" Great stuff. (Don't forget the quirky performance by Jack Warden as the gun-toting judge with a death wish.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent, all-around. I think the critics underrated it, and Pacino should have won an Oscar for this role. I think he does a lot more acting in this movie than he did in the Godfather movies. In the Godfather I, II and III, he did more staring and thinking than acting (although the acting he did do in those movies was fantastic).I agree with some critics that some portions were a bit overly dramatic, and the cynicism and dark comedy were perhaps a bit overdone, but I think that adds (in a positive way) to the tone of the movie--the idea is to give you a feel for how overwhelming and chaotic and nonsensical the legal profession is! One professional review I read stated that the overkill I mentioned above distracted from the main storyline. I disagree. I think it supported the storyline completely. It provided a vivid illustration to back up what the storyline was trying to say.I say to those critics--"relax! It's fiction rather than a documentary, and dramas are supposed to be dramatic!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true, it's a bit cheesy, but we're used to cheesy films from America (at least it's not about some wimp hero like Ben Affleck or so saving us all from the really bad guys (if not..aliens!). Instead this lovable 70's movie (still like the cars and clothes) is a story with a heavy moral about the good conscience of people in judicial positions. I must say though, that this kind of a moral suits me much better than for instance the moral in 'Pearl Harbor', witch is a grotesque and pathetic movie about 'the will to be strong' or 'we will prevail'.. something abstract like that (revenge! revenge! kill the baddies, if our president (Roosefelt, who was bound to a wheelchair) has the will to stand up, we will be strong enough to fight back). There is of course a risk that people will grow a little cynical about justice in America after seeing this picture. I have to say that I already was before watching it. Among other reasons because of that treacherous plea-bargain stuff that has led criminals in the States to accuse innocent people of all kinds of s**t (not proven but hey!). I'm sorry if I sound a little fanatical about the political stuff and all, but I don't see why the moral of this movie is 'too heavy', 'patronizing', or 'cynical', when Hollywood still produces s**t in witch te Americans save the world again from the Martians or the terrorists. It's a kind of arty farty highbrow judgment. I like a self-critical point of view.So I liked the movie, it's just good cinema and the jokes were kind of okay, I don't mind. Nice to see that Al Pachino actually hasn't changed at all, over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Possible spoilers] Poor Al Pacino as a beleaguered defense lawyer just can't seem to win for losing. One of his clients is a transvestite who hangs himself in his cell after Pacino fails to make a court date that would save him from a jail term; another client who is innocent of all charges takes hostages and is shot by the police after Pacino fails to get him released. Because he could be disbarred as a result of a professional indiscretion in his past, he is blackmailed into defending a monstrously corrupt (and guilty) judge on a rape and assault charge. And to top it all off, he is sleeping with a woman from a government commission charged with investigating bad lawyers! He should be number 1 on its list. A more inept and ineffectual attorney has never been seen in the movies (with the possible exception of Paul Newman in `The Verdict'). Director Norman Jewison has billed this as a satire, but it plays more like some sort of angry, over-the-top tabloid melodrama that gets too carried away by its own zeal. There's probably a good movie to be made about the ethical dilemma faced by a defense attorney who gets a guilty defendant off on a technicality and then has to stand by helpless while he commits a new crime, but this one isn't it. Despite Pacino's likable bravura, you can't help thinking that this is one defense attorney who would have been far better off working for the prosecution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was intended as a satire. This must be understood first in order to truly appreciate it. A lot of people complain that it is totally unbelieveable that all that could happen in such a short time. The fact it, it was meant, through all those different situations, to show different things that are wrong with the judicial system. What holds the movie together is a very likable central character which we have in Arthur Kirkland as played by Al Pacino. It's a great performance and one of the few times that Pacino plays a regular, friendly guy. His reactions are those that we would have if we had the guts. There is nothing exceptional about him except his integrity and we all would like to be like him. The movie ranges from the hilarious (the helicopter ride) to the truly tragic (the scene after the drag queen kills him/herself). If nothing else, the movie is a typical man vs. society story where we all root for the guy with the strongest convictions. It's an enjoyable movie that moves very quickly. My only complaints would be the soundtrack (a victim of the times) and the abrupt ending (we don't find out what happens to Arthur).</fullReview>

I know it's heresy to say but entertainment gets dated. This one hasn't aged well. It's none too subtle. As one of the IMDb reviews I just read said, less would be more. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious in 1925. He ain't that funny today. This was a bravura performance back in '79. In fact, several of them were. The writing seemed crisp.

While, at the time of this review, both films had an identical 7.2 rating, I found '...And Justice for All' to be average. While most legal films focus on a single unusual or high stakes case, this film jumps around to several projects Arthur has going on through most of the film, only focusing on the 'main event' at the climax. This muddles the film and makes the running time feel long (for what is accomplished). Throw in an unlikely, underdeveloped love affair between Arthur and his professional rival (or over-seer) Gail, and you get a picture that feels very out of focus. The most distracting aspect of the film is its incongruent tone. There are two totally apposing tones in this film?an overbearing and depressing portrait of legal corruption and short comings versus a wacky and humorous portrait of the silly day to day life in the legal system (who knew it was so quirky and fun?). In the name of humor some outlandish and unrealistic things happen such as Arthur's friend Jay going insane (but only briefly taking a break from law). I don't know if the suicidal judge is supposed to be funny, but it is not funny or realistic. Other outlandish things happen in the name of drama. At one point a judge shoots a gun into the ceiling of a public court room to gain order. During the climax trial a hated judge (one of two the lawyers deal with in the film) is put on trial for rape. The other judge in the film (the suicidal one) oversees the trial even though they are colleagues that work together in the same courthouse. Such wildly unrealistic details really pulled me out of the drama of this movie. The comedy aspect fell flat in every way and felt totally out of place. The saving grace is that the film has a few decent dramatic scenes and Al Pacino does a good job with the main role. It is fun to see him subdued yet passionate in a role (he is usually either very showy or very cold in his roles). Five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally out there but Pacino does give a riveting opening statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Hill Street Blues a couple or three years later, ...And justice for all looks at the seedy underbelly of society. There may be a humanity to this society occupied by drag queens, nut cases and corruption but rest assured the good guys are few and far between.This is the basic premise of this drama co-written by Barry Levinson and also set in has native Baltimore like many of his directorial efforts. Al Pacino's character, here named Kirkland (Pacino looks as much as a guy named Kirkland as John Forsythe, Pacino's co-star would look like a guy named DeNunzio). Anyway, it seems that Kirkland is cursed with caring too much about his clients. He has two sort of innocent clients, one who is already in jail and one who is facing it. Kirkland is also dating a woman, played by the lovely Christine Lahti, who investigates crooked or incompetent members of the legal profession. A sort of Internal Affairs for jurists. And we could go on from here describing the plot and it would fill about ten pages.The trouble about this movie is that it's too busy. The focus had to be more about the more interesting plot about the judge accused of rape. Instead we are hit over the head with the tired underdog plot about one good man against a cruel world.That is not to say that this isn't worth seeing. There are some wickedly funny spots, especially involving the relationship between Kirkland and his legal partner, played by Jeff Tambor who more or less expanded this character into his Judge Alan Wachtel for Hill Street Blues. The most hilarious of these moments comes at the very end of the film.Altogether, not bad but for all persons involved not the best they have ever done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wished "...And Justice for All" was a great movie about one lawyer's conflicts within a broken justice system. I wonder if the movie might have been better if Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky collaborated on this uneven darkly comical project instead of director Norman Jewison and screenwriters Barry Levinson and Valerie Curtain.What ruined it for me were the various subplots and supporting characters which got in the way of the main plot in which an attorney (Al Pacino) finds that was hired to defend a corrupt judge (John Forsyth) he does not respect.Even though the final scenes were outrageously over-the-top, the final 20 minutes were the best scenes in the movie. Pacino loud, bombastic appearance fit perfectly and I only wished that the ending was as good as the rest of the movie. I think "...And Justice for All" was unable to do what "Network" did three years earlier due to some ill-advised creative choices that made the film more silly than biting.I will always remember the ending. The rest of the movie is a bit of a blur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge Al Pacino fan, i rented this movie from Blockbusters and was really looking forward to watching it. when i finally did get around to it, i was highly disappointed. i was expecting a tense courtroom drama, in the vein of films like A Few Good Men. Instead what i got was an film messy in it's tone, flirting between high drama and silly comedy. One of the main problems was the film had too much going on. There were too many sub-plots floating around, some of which deal with interesting issues such as how defending guilty clients can affect your mental stability, but frustratingly these plot strands are never really tied up, but rather just left to billow in the wind.Needless to say, Pacino is excellent, portraying the full range of emotions admirably, in the process earning himself another academy award nomination. In fact the acting throughout the entire film is fault-less. The main problem is the films inability to categorise itself into a genre. For example, a scene where Pacino's law partner finds out a man he defended and found innocent had just murdered two children. This scene is then followed by a scene where Pacino goes helicopter flying with an eccentric judge! Its worth sticking with the film though, if just for the final 20-30 minutes, to see Pacino let loose. Overall, an invigorating end but as a whole, a disappointing film that had the potential for so much more. and the music is perhaps the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. completely out of tone with the film. belongs more in a soft-core porn flick</fullReview>

Have you ever watched a good film (good script, good acting, interesting story) but had it ruined by some funky, disco jive music that is inappropriate and ruins the entire film? It is so annoying! I wish they'd just rerelease this film with no music. It would be an improvement over the groovy trumpet solos during an emotionally somber scene. Dave, Dave, Dave, what happened? For a talented musician, how could you massacre this film with that awful music that most assuredly was dated and pukey even when this film was new?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** At the start of the movie "And Justice for All" you can't tell the difference between defense lawyer Arthur Kirkland, Al Pacino, from the persons that he defends in the courtroom. We first see Arthur Spending the night in "the can" for contempt of court for taking a swing at Judge Flemings, John Forsythe, who was presiding on a case that he had before his bench. Having to face a review board to see if he's fit to be a lawyer and facing possible disbarment Arthur starts to wonder if all the work that he put into going through law school and in passing the Maryland State Bar to become a member of the law profession was really worth it? By the time the film ends Arthur knew that it was. In one of the most explosive courtroom scenes even filmed in a movie that would show everyone there, including Arthur, how corrupt "the System" had become with innocent as well as people who should be shown some mercy by the court, mercy tempered with justice, are thrown to the wolves and in many cases left to die by their own hand or drive the police to do it. Authur also showed how the justice system is manipulated by those who were sworn to uphold it for their own personal greed and power but his brave action may have well cost him his right to practice law. With his career on the line Arthur is suddenly given the job to defend the very Judge who would want nothing better then to have him disbarred Judge Henry T. Fleming. Accused of assault battery and rape of a local call girl Leah Shepard, Terri Wooten, it turns out that Arthur is the best person to defend the judge since it would prove that even he, who hates Flaming with a vengeance, has to defend his client to the best of his ability. Later it turns out that the Honorable judge Fleming did in fact beat and rape Leah and he even tells Arthur that fact bragging that when he's acquitted he'll pay Leah another visit. It's obvious that Flaming is a power crazed psychotic who want's to get back at Arthur by having him get him off knowing that he'll rape again and have it on his conscience, which of course Fleming doesn't have. Beside Al Pacino there are a number of cutting performances in the movie by Jack Warden, Judge Francis Rayford, a man of the court who's a bit off-the-wall steaming from him landing on his head after a skydiving incident during the Korean War. Robert Christian and Thomas Waltes as Arthur's doomed clients Ralph Agee and Jeff McCullaugh were both touching as well as tragic as two victims of a court system gone berserk."And Justice for All" was considered to be a bit over-the-top back in 1979 when it was released but now after some 25 years it's one of those few movies that were truly ahead of their time by showing how even the incorruptible United States Justice System can be corrupted if put into the right, or shall we say wrong, hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of my favorite Pacino films of all times. While it is an excellent film I did notice one flaw and I thought I'd mention it in the "goofs" section. Since I cannot find the specific link for that addition, I'm entering it here. When The judge played by Jack Warden crashes his helicopter after returning from his suicidal "half way point" ride with Arthur the rotor blades are obviously stopped. Anyone who knows better would realize that helicopters have an "auto rotation safety feature" that would allow the blades to keep spinning even while falling with no power!.

		<fullReview>May contain a few spoilers but its a must see. Now I know opinions vary about this movie being Pacino's best flick, but it outshines the rest next to "Heat". Yeah that along with "Godfather" and dont forget "Serpico".Well... wait a minute, I forgot the scent woman movie. But enough of that. I name this movie as the best court room drama and Pacino flick because he showed his true talent as an actor. This is one of my top twenty favorite movies. The script was tight, dialogue real, and pacing perfect. I never got bored. Aside from these reasons, I find the acting to be immaculate. Aspiring actors can learn from a genius who often forgot his lines. He wasnt even first chosen for "Godfather". This movie was made around the time I was still a tot but as I got older I've witnessed the difference between movies made back then to the movies made today. The content and the style in which this movie was done is made to be imitated not duplicated. Look at "A Few Good Men" and other court-side dramas. Where you think they got it from ? And how many attorney's would love to say "The Honorable Judge Fleming should go right to f*cking jail." Hell, I know I would. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disco Justice?and perhaps one of the finest last 10 minutes of a film ever preserved on celluloid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two guys who like to take cinematic chances, Norman Jewison and Al Pacino, came together to make a very engaging film, "And Justice for All". Jewison has been responsible for cinematic garbage (anyone remember Rollerball?) and complete masterworks (Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck, Agnes of God), but one thing is distinct about his film-making. Jewison seems to find scripts that aptly match the actors he casts and tries to get all he can out of them, even if the script is horribly flawed. And believe me; he has had some flawed scripts (does anyone remember F.I.S.T?) This movie that pits an average but hardworking defense attorney, Arthur Kirkland, played by Pacino, and the entire justice bureaucracy run by power-centered judges like Henry T. Fleming, played by John Forsythe. We get to see judicial largess and judicial activism work against innocent defendants (even though the circumstances upon which one of Kirkland's defendants is booked is not totally believable) and how Kirkland works around the system to find ways to free his clients, though his efforts are often futile.The script is barely more than a made-for-TV effort, and the music sounds like rejected background tunes for "Charlie's Angels", but there are memorable acting performances in this film. I was surprised at how well John Forsythe played a thoroughly egocentric and conniving judge; Jack Warden as a suicidal adrenaline junkie cum judge creates one of his better characterization efforts on film.The Piece De Resistance of this 119 minute gem is Kirkland's opening statement during Judge Fleming's rape trial. This might be the only truly well-written dialog in the film, and there is only one guy capable of delivering it in the most engaging and passionate means possible. That person is Al Pacino. Though Pacino has been known to do some pretty quirky and sometimes cartoonish character roles, those very quirky emotive properties make the last 10 minutes of this film one of the best scenes ever captured in American film. If there were an acting school out there that wanted to see a bit of method acting that challenges the best of what masters like Brando could do, that school should buy the rights to the last 10 minutes of "And Justice for All", burn it to a CD, and make it required study.If they could just find a way to erase the disco music in this film, it would be even better, but that being said, I still think this film is worth a look. I would give it a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 (it's probably 5.5, but I round down).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bigger waste of time than teaching advanced physics to cats.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of movies that have aged gracefully and are still wholly relevant, such as The GodFather. However, this is not one of them. Unfortunately, it doesn't even fall in the "it's so bad, it's good" category either.Please note that this review contains multiple spoilers.For instance, as a 1979 picture, studios wanted to be on the cutting edge of what was considered cool at the time and thus, instead of a dramatic symphonic soundtrack, we are greeted right from the get-go with disco grooves. Since this felt so out of place, it would have made sense to see John Travolta in a cameo as the introductory credits rolled by. Keep in mind this is a drama about a case where a woman is severely beaten and raped, so prompting the audience to snap its fingers and gyrate its hips to appease the brutality of the crime was a decision that the kindred spirit of Jeffrey Dahmer presiding over Columbia Pictures at the time reasonably took.There are countless moments of total absence of logic that should baffle the mind of anybody with an IQ of 60 or higher.For one, Pacino's character, "Arthur," is in jail overnight for trying to punch a judge in the face. There is no way that he would still be practicing law afterwards. However, due to the infinitely spotless track record of 24h jail timeouts, it makes sense to assume that Arthur has learned his lesson. Next, a woman on a committee that antagonizes Arthur falls for the lamest sober pickup attempt in film history, in spite of the fact that she's a foot taller and out of his league. I've witnessed fewer leaps of faith in Rambo. Then, they proceed to have yelling matches sporadically throughout the movie but are magically able to separate their professional and personal lives. I have witnessed better chemistry between a Nazi officer and a concentration camp prisoner.Arthur's best friend is Jay who spends 2 scenes laughing exaggeratingly loud and long at an ironic element in the story. It had more weight and appeared more natural when Dr Evil did the same in Austin Powers. It is known later that a killer he freed on a technicality killed 2 children which upset him so that he took refuge at the end of a long hall with an endless stack of plates which he frisbeed at people who would approach him. This posed such a threat that 2 police officers unholstered their guns ready to shoot him. Later, he shaves his head (eat your heart out, Brittany Spears).Arthur is blackmailed into to defending the judge he despises in spite of the fact that he's guilty because he could otherwise be disbarred on a technicality. Trying to hit a judge is bad but apparently not as bad as calling the cops because he thought a crazy client of his might kill people, which is a conflict of interest. Makes sense.There is another judge in the story who is purely suicidal. He spend his lunches on the ledge of the 4th-floor, pilots helicopters with limited fuel supplies, and attempt to shoot his head off with a long rifle in his bathroom before court starts. Next to him, the Joker is the picture child for mental stability.The climax of the movie is the courtroom scene where Arthur is making his opening statement. He stops midway and announces that he can't continue because his client's guilty. The presiding judge tells him he's out of order to which Arthur yells back "No, YOU'RE out of order!" indicating to everybody that his comebacks have the wit of a 6-year old. Incredibly, the courtroom audience erupts in applause, give him a standing ovation, and the accused judge is seen with his head in his hands, all telling us, that the defendant will finally pay for his crimes. Unbelievable. I have seen more tactical argumentation from Creationists.Arthur is then seen sitting on the steps of the courthouse where Jay, who is clearly wearing a wig, is ready to come in. Jay salutes Arthur by lifting his wig off like you would a hat as a gesture of politeness. This surreal scene tops anything in the movie. Even in his drunken foolishness, the director must have thought the same, which is why the credits started rolling right after... complete with bland disco beats! I would rather pour a generous coating of sweet honey over my naked genitals and offer them buffet-style to a hungry tribe of fire ants than ever watch this movie again. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...And Justice for All (1978)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I can't appeal it. He's dead!"This is the story of an attorney who's life falls apart around him. The movie has average directing, a confused and confusing script, but good acting.Director Norman Jewison has a difficult way of telling the story. The camera is neither too close, neither too far, finding itself somewhere in the middle. A sort of awkward no man's land. A place where it neither supports, nor breaks the actor's performance. It's just... there. There are moments when the camera manages to break out of this purgatory and go for an extreme close-up: the director's signature.The script is confused and confusing. To make the drama of the main character compelling, the writers had to go to extreme lengths. There are countless bits and pieces that attempt to form a complete picture, but have little to do with the story. As a result, the main premise is out of focus, and the presentation shifts a lot.Any less detail, and the main character's reactions would have been unbelievable. Any more, and the movie would have been impossible to watch. In theory. In practice, the movie was so emotionally charged midway through, that I just couldn't bare it anymore. Or care less. It was so overwhelming, that my emotional defenses raised the bridge and declared emergency. After all, there is a limit to how much a viewer can take, and certain points should be more subtle.But despite all the attention, in the end, the script still doesn't answer the most important question: who is the main character? Is he a hero? An anti-hero? Or a wimp?The acting is good. Al Pacino delivers a powerful performance, even if over the top and disjointed here and there. Jack Warden is hilarious, John Forsythe is good, Jeffrey Tambor is excellent. Christine Lahti is the... aaa... let's say love interest....And Justice for All. Long and disjointed story, that in the end, is not very interesting. 5/10.</fullReview>

And then there is the wonderful Al Pacino, at his best, a superb performance beaten at the Oscar's race by the obvious De Niro for "The Deer Hunter". I guess that makes 1979 a vintage year...

		<fullReview>A fairly worthy effort, "And Justice for All" is more or less a standout role for Al Pacino. His Arthur is an interesting character and fun to watch. With all the corruption and break-downs around him, he bends but doesn't break. The judicial system seems terribly chaotic. By the end he seems to have learned a thing or two, but not without costs - perhaps most of all his sanity. I thoroughly enjoyed the focus on the Pacino character. He carries the movie mightily. The supporting cast blend together nicely as well especially notable being Jack Warden, John Forsythe, and Christine Lahti. The story seems sort of sketched together but works pretty well especially when getting to the main drive of it. The ending seems a little weak as it doesn't quite set a resolution but it keeps to the general tone. All and all a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Up To Par With Other 1970s Classics, But It Holds Its Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?And Justice For All tells the now tired story of a defense lawyer who finds himself blackmailed into defending a corrupt judge against a rape charge, even though the two men personally hate each other. Al Pacino carries the film with his performance as the mild lawyer. As for the rest of the film, I at first was skeptical of its melodramatic stance against the American judicial system. I was not able to buy into its scathing indictment of it because, despite the countless cases of racial profiling, sexual discrimination, remaining but obsolete and archaic city and state laws, not to mention the Bush administration's recent exploits regarding detainees and their removal of Habeas Corpus, the movie does not seem to touch on such legal issues. However, when someone of my generation sees this 1979 movie, they need to take into account its timeliness pertaining to its era. However, what remains topical even today is its cynical reflection of people in power.The film echoed the anger and contempt that American society had against the disastrously flawed justice system of its time. Over time, there have come new judges, new lawyers, a degree of progression of civil liberties and technological advances in forensics that have freed thousands, a miracle for so many on death row. What in spite of so much development continues in the same way it did in this film's era is law enforcement's lack of ability to own up to an error. Bureaucracies and administrative systems will eat their own parents to remain fixed on any earlier assessment, as if coming clean would weaken the law's structure and cause it contempt. The contrary is right obviously. Most people, most certainly the ones who have been victims of this cowardly inefficiency like many characters in this film, recognize that inaccuracies and missteps happen as a natural course in passing judgment on the interactions among people and if law enforcement and the legal system, and likewise politicians and government, would acknowledge this objective reality with the decency it is their job to uphold, the entire system of law would function more efficiently, indeed a great deal more efficiently. And since they never have, the criminal justice system of this film's era had developed an indifference to the truth, and in fact would rather protect its own than, say, an unsuspecting average joe.While the writers were not quite decisive on the pitch of their story, they had no uncertainty regarding what the story was about: Impartiality deprived of everyone other than those who know how to acquire the top legal protection, which is to say the moneyed ones. It is an overtly self-righteous but definitely passionate depiction of a system where its highest echelons have grown to be so self-important and indulgent in their own authority and privilege that they have put behind them all acquaintance with life outside their status. Lacking a scrap of empathy, understanding or real familiarity with the circumstances or liberties of those that pass through their courtrooms with varying fathoms of desperation, at times recklessly and now and again with spite they interfere obliviously in peoples' lives setting off devastation and alarm, the very things it is their jobs to eradicate.John Forsythe's character of the judge in question is the allegory for immorality in this film. His searingly portrayed unfriendliness, for one thing, condescension, another, and his admissions to his chronic lack of sympathy or empathy suggest his remarkable corruption. He actually does not care about the people who stand below him in his courtroom or their lawyers or anyone else. Herein, he is the extracted fundamental nature of the social evils in the realm of legal and government power. Even before the story languishes in the day-to-day cynical nightmare of Pacino's lawyer, we understand that Forsythe is more outrageous than any of the criminals he represents before him and all mocking quirks of fate are absolute.However one obtrusive deterrence is the synthesizer-ruled elevator music that sounds more like something heard in a 1970s porn film or a 1970s action-adventure TV show. The moviegoer says that music in a movie is unimportant should try to imagine this film's underscoring if it were given the same treatment as many of the great films of that decade.</fullReview>

Also the music used in the film made the think I was watching a porno. I understand it was the late 70's but even for that time, the music choice was terrible. Picking cheesy 70's instrumentals for a film that I think was supposed to be taken seriously as an attack on our justice system is a poor, poor choice. This is Pacino in a lull in his career. Several scenes in this film made me go, "I've never seen Pacino look so bad." Its somebody's fault, but I blame the incompetent director. Seeing what he did with this film makes he blame him entirely. This was probably an amazing script for Pacino to do it... the director likely just loused it up.And yes, there is no justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good message, decent yet uneven film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting to laugh at this film but there are some parts that are just plain hilarious. The plot goes all over the place which is a shame because if this film was made in a more solid fashion and took itself more seriously, maybe it could have been one of the greats. All the important elements are there- good acting, characters, humor, drama, etc... but the plotline doesn't gel like it should. There are too many ideas, or sub-plots if you will, thrown into the film. It seems almost as if the ideas in this movie could be split up and transformed into a few different law movies. Surprisingly, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire 120 minutes of the film; yet an uneven blend of comedy, cruelty, and drama makes it somewhat difficult to swallow. If the film's commentary on the injustices of the U.S. legal system are made evident to you, then you're set because this is definitely a "message movie". It's always good to see Al Pacino playing an honest, down-to-earth character. Be sure to mute your volume during the opening and closing credits unless you enjoy terribly cheesy disco soundtracks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-man show for Al Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, you have to like courtroom dramas, if this is a movie for you, although it's not the classic version of a courtroom film. It features the basic elements: a humane lawyer with many personal problems believing in justice but not in jurisdiction; a defendant whose guilt is controversial; and a bombastic final statement. All right, I like courtroom dramas, but I also like variety and that's what this movie presents. Bizarre characters, all together getting mad because of their jobs, give the movie a humorous, satirical touch. It's a satire on ... on everything. I have to admit, I don't see the meaning of each of the numerous subplots and minor characters for the director or for the writers. If the story was based on a true case, it would be different. Then I would say, they stick to the facts. But as it is made up, I suppose, the movie was only thought as a one-man show for Al Pacino in order to give him a chance to show his talent.However, this is not a masterpiece but a creative and funny but also a little disturbing court film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great performance stuck in a subpar movie that plays like a daytime drama with awful music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Al Pacino fan. I bought "And Justice for All" because of the fact that it starred Pacino, and I was excited because I had heard he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Now, after seeing the film, I can see why--his performance is great. Unfortunately, it's a great performance stuck in a lousy movie - "And Justice for All" is incompetently directed and, worst of all, the musical score really, really dates the film and almost makes it hard to watch at times.The subplots - like Pacino taking a ride on the judge's helicopter and having it crash - are so '70s-ish that I felt as if I were watching an episode of "Starsky and Hutch" or something. Honestly, this movie plays like a cheesy '70s daytime drama with better actors.Underneath the mess it has a good message about the legal profession. Pacino fans should see it because his performance is one of his best. However I find it hard to warm up to any movie that presents its courtroom scenes with a disco track playing in the background. If someone were to re-edit this film and insert more dramatic music (like a John Williams score or something), it might actually be watchable.I've never seen music literally ruin a film before, as I have with "And Justice for All." As you watch it (if you should choose to), you might recognize the score - it's the same song you heard in the last elevator you rode in. Yeah, it's that bad. The composer should be shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Pacino gives one of the most over the top godawful performances ever in this totally unbelievable courtroom drama that has not one scintilla of reality.The direction and script hammers home something until the audience is driven to drink. How Pacino could get involved in this mess is something to think about. Could it be that he has no sense of class, style, or acting ability? He has done some really good things, particular in his earlier career, but this overwrought performance started a down hill slide for the Pac Man that seemingly hasn't yet subsided. Maybe Pacino only has one kind of character in his arsenal, but one that should not have been released to scrutiny here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an Opportunity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see so many actors chewing the scenery to bits, you would figure there would be a nutritional label on the outside of the rental box. Sheesh, this is a crummy mess of a movie! Not only is the thing hopelessly overwrought and overacted, it can't even make up its mind if it wants to be a comedy or a drama or a dramady or, oh, Hell, why does it matter? Al Pacino's slobbering, self-righteous, criminal attorney (with layers of cuteness for the idiots in the audience who came to see Al Pacino be warm and fuzzy and emote like a dwarf on his third quad-shot Americano) shows why he should stick with playing Mafia Dons and blinded Vietnam vets. Thirty years on you get to see all sorts of famous people who have gone on to their rewards or recovered their self-respect enough to appear in other projects.Whether the slickery of Norman Jewison's direction or the nauseating disco score by Dave Grusin gets you to do one of those mini-barfs in the back of your throat first, it doesn't matter. Your popcorn is coming up.Slick, pre-packaged, 70s righteousness (see Brubaker to make the upchucking complete) is such a sickening embarrassment, you may consider buying a copy to show to the teenagers (beware, this cutesy-poo is R-rated poo at that) when they're home from school with the tummy flu and they can't throw up.I'm feeling a little off myself, after that gawdawful end title song!Urp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacino chews it up and spits it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Al Pacino, Jack Warden, John Forsythe, Lee Strasberg, Craig T. Nelson, and Christina Lahti, along with actors that would soon become known. This is the sort of role that Pacino chewed up and spit out. He's an idealistic young defense lawyer who slams up against the legal and ethical realities of systems run by flawed, petty, inhumane humans. This is a good, tense story with a few surprises and more than a few dark views on the world of Law. It reminds me of "Network", "M*A*S*H", and other 70's-80's films full of hopeless bureaucracy and corruption. My only complaint is about the scoring ? not so much that it sounds dated (which it does) but how inappropriate "The Odd Couple"/television theme-songy it sounds, and the shallow, almost random way it is layered over images. Poorly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL (Norman Jewison, 1979) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I have never bothered seeking out this film before even though it did occasionally play on TV over the years. While the impeccable talent involved would lead us to believe that we'd be in for heavy courtroom drama, surprisingly enough the film tries to be a sort of M*A*S*H* for the judicial system but here the humor comes off as forced most of the time.The film is developed in too episodic a fashion, some of which please and some of which are irrelevant (as much as it was nice to see Lee Strasberg and Sam Levene in their scenes together, there roles serve no real purpose) and the many cases lawyer Pacino is seen dealing with only manage to render the film longer. Christine Lahti is good in her role but her obligatory relationship with Pacino seems tacked on.The assortment of weird characters (both among the convicts and the court officials) are too outrageous to be believable, if occasionally hilarious as in the case of Jack Warden who seems to be more appropriate as part of the crazy aristocratic family seen in THE RULING CLASS (1971)! Most importantly, however, Pacino is in great form and the climactic trial sequence (also involving John Forsythe and Craig T. Nelson) is reasonably effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;*chomp!*&gt; &lt;*chomp!*&gt; That's the sound of Al Pacino chewing the scenery.Let me elucidate a bit. There are bad ham actors (Rod Steiger and late period Donald Pleasance come to mind) and ham actors that are so terrible that they achieve a kind of brilliance (like William Shatner). Then there are those rare ham actors that are actually pretty good. One name that occurs to me in this regard is Kenneth Branagh. Another is the Original 1970's Operatic Method Man, Al Pacino.In the wake of his breakout roles in "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part 2" (couldn't they have thought of a more creative title for that one?), Al Pacino embarked on a series of histrionic, mega-intense Method Acting roles in great movies like "Serpico" and "Dog Day Afternoon." In 1979, he appeared in what seems to me to the apotheosis of the Era of the Method, "...And Justice for All." Here he plays Arthur Kirkland, an idealistic lawyer (!) who becomes Disillusioned with the System; he wants to see justice done, but all he sees around him is injustice, bestowed on the needy and innocent by the System. (I could follow an earlier reviewer's lead and mention that a lot of this injustice comes from his own incompetence and carelessness as an attorney, but I'm not enough of a legal expert to make such a call).Roped into defending a thoroughly unlikeable judge (John Forsythe, in a kind of proto-Blake Carrington role) from a rape charge, Kirkland soon becomes convinced of his client's guilt. What should he do? Defend him anyway (that's his job, after all), or walk away? Meanwhile he has to deal with his aging grandfather (Method Mentor Lee Strasberg), his law partner (Jeffrey "Hey Now" Tambor), who's increasingly eccentric behavior is starting to worry his friends and colleagues, an amiable but crack-brained judge (Jack Warden), an overly smug prosecutor (Craig T. Nelson, the King of Authoritarian Smug) and the obligatory 1970's love interest (Christine Lahti).I can never watch this movie without noticing that Al Pacino is Acting!, a sure sign that he is over-Acting! Nevertheless, I find this movie truly entertaining. It's kind of like watching Iron Chef. You might not want to eat the food, but it's fun to watch them cook.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film is a Comedy NOT a Drama - Don't Waste Your Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And Justice for All ? Comment This is one of the most irritating films I have ever seen. It purports to be of the Crime/Drama/Thriller, in fact there's hardly a serious moment in the film! It is a comedy that is about as subtle as a sledgehammer and aimed at the sort of audience who find children's comedies funny. I watch 25 minutes of it before I became so disgusted that I turned it off as there was only one serious moment in the twenty-five minutes that I saw. As a lawyer and I can tell you that any lawyer who behaved like the lawyer in this film would be struck off! My chief complaint is that this film was incorrectly classified ? it should have been classified as a comedy. If I wanted to watch a comedy I would have selected a comedy, not something that purported to be a drama! The classification of this film as a drama is utterly mendacious! Whoever classified this film is wasting people's time!</fullReview>
